          Title: The BATSE-Swift luminosity and redshift distributions of
          short-duration GRBs
          Authors: Dafne Guetta, Tsvi Piran
          We  compare  the luminosity function and rate inferred from the
          BATSE  short hard bursts (SHBs) peak flux distribution with the
          redshift  and  luminosity  distributions  of  SHBs  observed by
          Swift/HETE   II.   While   the  Swift/HETE  II  SHB  sample  is
          incompatible   with   SHB  population  that  follows  the  star
          formation rate, it is compatible with a SHB rate that reflect a
          distribution  of  delay  times after the SFR. This would be the
          case  if  SHBs are associated with binary neutron star mergers.
          The  available data allows, however, different interpretations.
          For  example,  a  population  whose  rate is independent of the
          redshift fits the data very well. The implied SHB rates that we
          find range from $\sim 8$ to $\sim
          30h_{70}^3$Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. This is a much higher rate than
          what  was previously estimated. A detailed (2 dimensional) look
          at the best fit models shows, however, some discrepancy between
          the four Swift/HETE II SHBs and the models based on BATSE SHBs.
          This  could  be  a  statistical fluke. It could also arise from
          wrong  estimates  of  the triggering criteria or from selection
          effects.  If  real  it  may  indicate  the existence of two SHB
          populations  with  different  luminosity functions and redshift
          distributions.

          Title:  Low Frequency Radio Observations of Galaxy Clusters Can
          Reveal Global Signatures in the Cosmological 21-cm Background
          Authors: Asantha Cooray
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          While  the  low  frequency spectrum of the radio sky is rich in
          features  associated  with  the  cosmic  21-cm  background from
          neutral  Hydrogen,  a  direct  measurement  of  this  frequency
          spectrum  is  challenging. We propose a technique to indirectly
          establish global signatures in the cosmic 21-cm radiation based
          on  differential  observations  towards  and away from a galaxy
          cluster  such  that  modifications  imposed  by inverse-Compton
          scattering  via  electrons  in galaxy clusters can be detected.
          While  the unscattered spectrum has features with amplitudes up
          to  40  mK in the brightness temperature relative to the cosmic
          microwave background, after scattering, the observable spectrum
          contains  decrements  and increments with amplitudes around 0.2
          to  1  mK  in addition to a uniform few mK decrement associated
          with  the  black-body  CMB. Low frequency radio interferometers
          that  are  now planned for 21-cm anisotropy measurements can be
          easily  utilized  for  the proposed measurement. The signatures
          towards clusters will also confirm the 21-cm signal is produced
          at a redshift higher than the cluster, in addition to providing
          an   easy,   and   a   necessary,  cross-check  on  fluctuation
          measurements.

          Title: Halo Spacetime
          Authors: Mark D. Roberts
          Comments: 8 pages
          Subject to the four assupmtions:
          1)a  galactic  halo  can  be  modeled  by  a static spherically
          symmetric spacetime,
          2)in  the  limit  of  no  rotation  halo spacetime is Minkowski
          spacetime  and  that  the  speed  of  rotation is a permissible
          parameter   to   expand  in,  3)the  constraint  on  the  first
          derivatives  of  the metric needed in order to produce constant
          rotation  curves  can  be applied, 4)the perfect fluid Einstein
          equations;    it    is    shown    that    the    density    is
          $\rho=-2v^2/r^2+O(v^4)$,  where  $v=v_c/c$  is  the velocity of
          rotation  of  the  galaxy.  The  negative  density  is taken to
          indicate  that  one of the above four assumptions is wrong, the
          last  is  the most likely, implying that there is no such thing
          as dark matter.

          Title:  Three-Body  Kick  to  a Bright Quasar out of Its Galaxy
          During a Merger
          Authors: Loren Hoffman, Abraham Loeb (Harvard U.)
          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Nature
          The  quasar HE0450-2958 was recently discovered to reside ~7kpc
          away  from  a  galaxy  that  was  likely  disturbed by a recent
          merger.  The  lack  of  a  massive spheroid of stars around the
          quasar  raised  the unlikely suggestion that it may have formed
          in  a  dark galaxy. Here we explain this discovery as a natural
          consequence  of  a  dynamical kick imparted to the quasar as it
          interacted  with  a  binary  black  hole system during a galaxy
          merger  event.  The  typical stalling radius (~1pc) for a ~10^9
          solar  mass binary provides a kick of order the escape velocity
          of  the stellar spheroid, bringing the quasar out to around the
          observed radius before it turns around. This is consistent with
          the  observed  low relative velocity between the quasar and the
          merger-remnant  galaxy.  The  gas  carried  with the black hole
          throughout  the three-body interaction fuels the quasar for the
          duration of its journey, ~2x10^7 years. Gravitational radiation
          recoil could not have produced the required kick.

          Workshop
          In  order  to  study  the  possibility of acoustic detection of
          ultra-high  energy neutrinos in water, our group is planning to
          deploy  and  operate  an  array  of  acoustic sensors using the
          ANTARES Neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore,
          acoustic  sensor  hardware  has  to  be developed which is both
          capable  of  operation under the hostile conditions of the deep
          sea  and  at  the  same  time  provides  the  high  sensitivity
          necessary  to  detect  the weak pressure signals resulting from
          the  neutrino's  interaction  in  water.  In  this  paper,  two
          different  approaches  to  building  such  sensors,  as well as
          performance   studies  in  the  laboratory  and  in  situ,  are
          presented.

          Title:  First  optical images of circumstellar dust surrounding
          the debris disk candidate HD 32297
          Authors: P. Kalas
          Comments: 5 pages; Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters
          Near-infrared  imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope recently
          revealed  a circumstellar dust disk around the A star HD 32297.
          Dust  scattered  light  is detected as far as 400 AU radius and
          the  linear  morphology  is  consistent with a disk ~10 degrees
          away  from  an  edge-on  orientation. Here we present the first
          optical  images  that  show the dust scattered light morphology
          from  560 to 1680 AU radius. The position angle of the putative
          disk  midplane  diverges  by  31  degrees and the color of dust
          scattering  is  most  likely blue. We associate HD 32297 with a
          wall  of interstellar gas and the enigmatic region south of the
          Taurus molecular cloud. We propose that the extreme asymmetries
          and  blue disk color originate from a collision with a clump of
          interstellar  material as HD 32297 moves southward, and discuss
          evidence consistent with an age of 30 Myr or younger.

          Title:  Possible  evidence  for  the ejection of a supermassive
          black hole from an ongoing merger of galaxies
          Authors:  Martin  G.  Haehnelt  (IoA), Melvyn B. Davies (Lund),
          Martin J. Rees (IoA)
          Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX, no figures; MNRAS in press
          Attempts  of  Magain  et al (2005) to detect the host galaxy of
          the  bright  QSO  HE0450--2958  have  not  been  successful. We
          suggest  that  the supermassive black hole powering the QSO was
          ejected from the observed ULIRG at the same redshift and at 1.5
          arcsec distance. Ejection could have either be caused by recoil
          due  to gravitational wave emission from a coalescing binary of
          supermassive  black  holes  or  the  gravitational slingshot of
          three or more supermassive black holes in the ongoing merger of
          galaxies  which  triggered the starburst activity in the ULIRG.
          We  discuss implications for the possible hierarchical build-up
          of  supermassive  black  holes from intermediate and/or stellar
          mass   black   holes,  and  for  the  detection  of  coalescing
          supermassive binary black holes by LISA.

          Title:  Rotational  Broadening of Atomic Spectral Features from
          Neutron Stars
          Authors: P. Chang, S. Morsink, L. Bildsten, I. Wasserman
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, to appear in ApJ Letters
          The  discovery of the first gravitationally redshifted spectral
          line from a neutron star (NS) by Cottam, Paerels and Mendez has
          triggered  theoretical  studies  of  the physics of atomic line
          formation  in  NS  atmospheres.  Chang,  Bildsten and Wasserman
          showed  that  the hydrogenic Fe H$\alpha$ line formed above the
          photosphere  of  a  bursting  NS is intrinsically broad. We now
          include  rotational  broadening  within  general relativity and
          compare  the  resulting  profile to that observed during Type I
          bursts  from  EXO  0748-676.  We  show  that the fine structure
          splitting  of the line precludes a meaningful constraint on the
          radius.  Our  fitting of the data show that the line forming Fe
          column    is    ${\rm    log}_{10}    (N_{\rm   Fe,   n=2}/{\rm
          cm^{-2}})=17.9_{-0.42}^{+0.27}$ and gravitational redshift $1+z
          =1.345_{-0.008}^{+0.005}$ with 95% confidence. We calculate the
          detectability  of  this  spectral  feature for a large range of
          spins  and  inclinations  assuming that the emission comes from
          the  entire  surface.  We find that at 300 (600) Hz only 10-20%
          (5-10%)  of  NSs  would  have spectral features as deep as that
          seen in EXO 0748-676.

          Title:  Exposing  the Nuclear Burning Ashes of Radius Expansion
          Type I X-ray Bursts
          Authors:  Nevin  N.  Weinberg  (Caltech,  KITP),  Lars Bildsten
          (KITP, UCSB), Hendrik Schatz (MSU, JINA)
          Comments: 15 pages, 15 figures (emulateapj), accepted to ApJ
          We  solve  for  the  evolution  of  the  vertical extent of the
          convective  region of a neutron star atmosphere during a Type I
          X-ray  burst. The convective region is well-mixed with ashes of
          nuclear  burning and its extent determines the rise time of the
          burst  light  curve.  Using a full nuclear reaction network, we
          show  that the maximum vertical extent of the convective region
          during   photospheric  radius  expansion  (RE)  bursts  can  be
          sufficiently  great that: (1) some ashes of burning are ejected
          by  the radiation driven wind during the RE phase and, (2) some
          ashes  of  burning  are  exposed  at  the  neutron star surface
          following the RE phase. We find that ashes with mass number A ~
          30  -  60  are mixed in with the ejected material. We calculate
          the  expected  column  density  of ejected and surface ashes in
          hydrogen-like states and determine the equivalent widths of the
          resulting  photoionization edges from both the wind and neutron
          star  surface.  We  find  that  these can exceed 100 eV and are
          potentially  detectable.  A  detection  would probe the nuclear
          burning processes and might enable a measurement of the neutron
          star  gravitational  redshift.  In  addition,  we  find that in
          bursts with pure helium burning layers, protons from (alpha, p)
          reactions  cause  a  rapid onset of the 12C(p, gamma)13N(alpha,
          p)16O  reaction  sequence. The sequence bypasses the relatively
          slow  12C(alpha, gamma)16O reaction and leads to a sudden surge
          in  energy production that is directly observable as a rapid (~
          ms) increase in flux during burst rise.

          Title:  Fluctuations  along Velocity Coordinate: Statistics and
          Effects of Absorption
          Authors: A. Lazarian, D. Pogosyan
          Comments: 31 page, 1 figure
          We  discuss  statistics of Doppler-broadened spectral lines, in
          particular,     the     statistics     of    fluctuations    in
          Position-Position-Velocity data cub along the velocity axis. We
          show  that absorption substantially changes the long wavelength
          statistics of fluctuations compared to the optically thin case.
          At  the  same time, short-wavelength asymptotic is not affected
          by  absorption and remains power-law. We consider both the case
          of  high  spatial  resolution  and  the  case  of  poor spatial
          resolution  and  discuss  the retrieval of power-law indexes of
          velocity and density spectra. This provides a new technique for
          studies of turbulence from observations. A big advantage of the
          technique  is  that studies of turbulence can accomplished even
          when spatial resolution of the turbulent volume is poor.

          Using   the   Florida   Multi-object   Imaging   Near-IR  grism
          Observational  Spectrometer  (FLAMINGOS), we have conducted the
          FLAMINGOS  Extragalactic Survey (FLAMEX), a deep imaging survey
          covering  7.1  square degrees within the 18.6 sq. deg NOAO Deep
          Wide-Field  Survey  (NDWFS)  regions. FLAMEX is the first deep,
          wide-area  near-infrared  survey  to image in both the J and Ks
          filters,  and  is  larger  than  any  previous  NIR  surveys of
          comparable  depth.  The  intent  of FLAMEX is to facilitate the
          study  of  galaxy  and  galaxy  cluster  evolution  at 1<z<2 by
          providing  rest-frame optical photometry for the massive galaxy
          population  at  this  epoch. This effort is designed to yield a
          public  data  set  that  complements  and augments the suite of

          FLAMEX  and  initial  results  based  upon ~150,000 Ks-selected
          sources  in  the Bootes field. We describe the observations and

          number   counts  are  consistent  with  results  from  previous
          surveys.  Finally,  we  comment upon the utility of this sample
          for  detailed  study  of the ERO population, and present one of
          the  first  spectroscopically  confirmed  z>1  galaxy  clusters

          We  present data obtained with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC)
          aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer) for a sample of 74
          young  (t  <  30 Myr old) Sun-like (0.7 < M(star)/M(Sun) < 1.5)
          stars.  These  are  a sub-set of the observations that comprise
          the  Spitzer  Legacy science program entitled the Formation and
          Evolution  of Planetary Systems (FEPS). Using IRAC we study the
          fraction  of  young  stars that exhibit 3.6-8.0 micron infrared
          emission   in   excess   of  that  expected  from  the  stellar
          photosphere,  as  a  function  of  age  from 3-30 Myr. The most
          straightforward  interpretation  of such excess emission is the
          presence  of hot (300-1000K) dust in the inner regions (< 3 AU)
          of  a circumstellar disk. Five out of the 74 young stars show a
          strong  infrared  excess,  four of which have estimated ages of
          3-10  Myr.  While  we  detect  excesses  from 5 optically thick
          disks,  and  photospheric  emission  from  the remainder of our
          sample,  we  do  not  detect any excess emission from optically
          thin  disks  at  these wavelengths. We compare our results with
          accretion  disk fractions detected in previous studies, and use
          the  ensemble  results  to  place additional constraints on the
          dissipation timescales for optically-thick, primordial disks.

          of diffuse star cluster systems are red, 1.1 < g-z < 1.6, which
          is  redder  than  metal-rich GCs and often as red as the galaxy
          itself.  Most  DSC systems thus have mean ages older than 5 Gyr
          or  else  have  super-solar  metallicities.  We  find  that  12
          galaxies  in our sample contain a significant excess of diffuse
          star cluster candidates -- nine are lenticulars (S0s), and five
          visibly  contain dust. We also find a substantial population of
          DSCs  in  the halo of the giant elliptical M49, associated with
          the  companion  galaxy  VCC 1199. Most DSC systems appear to be
          both aligned with the galaxy light and associated with galactic
          disks,  but  at  the  same  time  many  lenticulars do not host
          substantial  DSC  populations.  Diffuse  star  clusters  in our
          sample  share  similar  characteristics  to those identified in
          other  nearby  lenticular,  spiral,  and dwarf galaxies, and we
          suggest  that  DSCs  preferentially form, survive, and coevolve
          with  galactic  disks.  Their properties are broadly consistent
          with  those  of merged star cluster complexes, and we note that
          despite   being   3   -   5   magnitudes  brighter  than  DSCs,
          ultra-compact  dwarfs  have  similar  surface brightnesses. The
          closest Galactic analogs to the DSCs are the old open clusters.
          We  suggest that if a diffuse star cluster population did exist
          in  the  disk  of  the Milky Way, it would be very difficult to
          find. (Abridged)

          Title:   The   baseline   intracluster   entropy  profile  from
          gravitational structure formation
          Authors: G. Mark Voit, Scott T. Kay, Greg L. Bryan
          Comments: Accepted to MNRAS, 8 pages, 9 figures
          The  radial  entropy  profile  of  the  hot  gas in clusters of
          galaxies  tends  to follow a power law in radius outside of the
          cluster  core. Here we present a simple formula giving both the
          normalization  and  slope for the power-law entropy profiles of
          clusters   that   form  in  the  absence  of  non-gravitational
          processes such as radiative cooling and subsequent feedback. It
          is  based  on  seventy-one  clusters  drawn  from four separate
          cosmological    simulations,    two   using   smoothed-particle
          hydrodynamics  (SPH)  and  two  using  adaptive-mesh refinement
          (AMR),  and  can be used as a baseline for assessing the impact
          of  non-gravitational  processes  on  the  intracluster  medium
          outside  of cluster cores. All the simulations produce clusters
          with  self-similar  structure in which the normalization of the
          entropy  profile  scales linearly with cluster temperature, and
          these profiles are in excellent agreement outside of 0.2 r_200.
          Because  the observed entropy profiles of clusters do not scale
          linearly    with   temperature,   our   models   confirm   that
          non-gravitational   processes   are   necessary  to  break  the
          self-similarity  seen  in  the  simulations.  However, the core
          entropy  levels  found by the two codes used here significantly
          differ,  with  the  AMR  code  producing  nearly  twice as much
          entropy at the centre of a cluster.

          Title: Gas distribution, kinematics and star formation in faint

          Comments:   15  pages,  6  tables,  13  figures.  Accepted  for
          publication in MNRAS
          We  compare  the  gas  distribution, kinematics and the current
          star  formation  in  a  sample of 10 very faint (-13.37 < M_B <
          -9.55)  dwarf  galaxies.  For  5  of  these galaxies we present
          fresh, high sensitivity, GMRT HI 21cm observations. For all our
          galaxies  we  construct  maps  of  the  HI  column density at a
          constant  linear resolution of ~300 pc; this forms an excellent
          data  set  to  check  for  the  presence  of a threshold column
          density  for  star  formation.  We find that while current star
          formation (as traced by Halpha emission) is confined to regions
          with  relatively  large  (N_HI  >  (0.4  -1.7)  X 10^{21} atoms
          cm^{-2})  HI  column  density,  the  morphology  of  the Halpha
          emission  is in general not correlated with that of the high HI
          column  density gas. Thus, while high column density gas may be
          necessary  for  star  formation, in this sample at least, it is
          not  sufficient  to  ensure  that  star  formation does in fact
          occur.  We examine the line profiles of the HI emission, but do
          not  find  a  simple relation between regions with complex line
          profiles  and  those  with on-going star formation. Finally, we
          examine the very fine scale (~20-100 pc) distribution of the HI
          gas,  and  find  that  at  these scales the emission exhibits a
          variety  of  shell  like,  clumpy and filamentary features. The
          Halpha  emission  is  sometimes associated with high density HI
          clumps,  sometimes  the  Halpha  emission  lies  inside  a high
          density shell, and sometimes there is no correspondence between
          the  Halpha  emission  and  the  HI  clumps.  In  summary,  the
          interplay  between  star  formation  and  gas  density in these
          galaxy  does  not  seem to show the simple large scale patterns
          observed in brighter galaxies (abridged).

          Title: The Local Rate and the Progenitor Lifetime of Short-Hard
          Gamma-Ray Bursts: Synthesis and Predictions for LIGO
          Authors: Ehud Nakar, Avishay Gal-Yam, Derek B. Fox
          The  properties  of the short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) with
          known  host-galaxies  suggest  that  these events result from a
          long-lived progenitor system. The most popular progenitor model
          of  SHBs invokes the merger of either double neutron star (DNS)
          binaries  or  neutron  star-black  hole  (NS-BH)  systems. Such
          events  produce  strong  gravitational waves (GWs) at frequency
          range   that  is  accessible  to  current  and  next-generation
          ground-based  GW  observatories.  In  this  work we combine the
          census of SHB observations with refined theoretical analysis to
          critically  evaluate  the  compact  binary progenitor model. We
          then explore the implications for GW detection of these events.
          Beginning  from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic
          time,  we  consider  what  intrinsic  luminosity  and  lifetime
          distributions  can  reproduce  both the known SHB redshifts and
          luminosities, and the peak flux distribution of the large BATSE
          SHB  sample.  We  find  that (1) Short progenitor lifetimes, <3
          Gyr,  are ruled out, and lifetimes of about 6 Gyr favored. This
          result  is  difficult to reconcile with the observed properties
          of  the  DNS  population  in  our  galaxy. We show that for DNS
          systems to remain viable SHB progenitors, a large population of
          old  undetectable  NS  binaries must be postulated. (2) We find
          that  the  local  rate  of SHBs is at least 10 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 and
          likely as high as 10^5 Gpc^-3 yr-1, significantly above earlier
          estimates.  (3)  We find that assuming that SHBs do result from
          compact   binaries,  either  through  the  old  DNS  population
          mentioned   above   or   from   NS-BH  mergers,  our  resulting
          predictions  for the LIGO event rate are extremely encouraging:
          several   detections   per  year  may  be  expected  at  design
          sensitivity,   and   the   first   coincident   observation  of
          electromagnetic  and  gravitational  radiation  from an SHB may
          well be made with current facilities.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          The  1<z<2 redshift window hosts the peak of the star formation
          and metal production rates. Studies of the metal content of the
          star  forming  galaxies  at these epochs are however sparse. We
          report  VLT-ISAAC  near-infrared  spectroscopy  for a sample of
          five  [OII]-selected, M_B,AB<-21.5, z~1.4 galaxies, by which we
          measured  Hbeta and [OIII]5007 emission line fluxes from J-band
          spectra, and Halpha line fluxes plus upper limits for [NII]6584
          fluxes   from   H-band   spectra.   The   z~1.4   galaxies  are
          characterized   by  the  high  [OIII]/[OII]  line  ratios,  low
          extinction  and  low  metallicity  that  are  typical  of lower
          luminosity  CADIS  galaxies  at 0.4<z<0.7, and of more luminous
          Lyman  Break  Galaxies at z~3, but not seen in CFRS galaxies at
          0.4<z<0.9.  This  type of spectrum (e.g., high [OIII]/[OII]) is
          seen  in  progressively  more luminous galaxies as the redshift
          increases.  These  spectra  are caused by a combination of high
          ionisation  parameter  q  and  lower  [O/H].  Pegase2  chemical
          evolution  models are used to relate the observed metallicities
          and  luminosities  of z~1.4 galaxies to galaxy samples at lower
          and  higher redshift. Not surpringsingly, we see a relationship
          between redshift and inferred chemical age. We suppose that the
          metal-enriched  reservoirs  of  star  forming  gas  that we are
          probing  at intermediate redshifts are being mostly consumed to
          build  up  both  the  disk  and  the bulge components of spiral
          galaxies.  Finally,  our analysis of the metallicity-luminosity
          relation  at 0<z<1.5 suggests that the period of rapid chemical
          evolution may take place progressively in lower mass systems as
          the   universe  ages.  These  results  are  consistent  with  a
          ``downsizing''  type  picture  in  the  sense  that  particular
          signatures  (e.g.,  high [OIII]/[OII] or low [O/H]) are seen in
          progressively   more   luminous  (massive)  systems  at  higher
          redshifts.

          Title: The Initial Mass Function as given by the fragmentation

          Journal-ref: Astronomische Nachrichten (2005), 326,754
          The  dichotomy  between  a  universal mass function (IMF) and a
          variable   IMF  which  depends  on  local  physical  parameters
          characterises  observational and theoretical stellar astronomy.
          In this contribution the available distributions of probability
          are briefly reviewed. The physical nature of two of them, gamma
          variate  and lognormal, is then explained once the framework of
          the  fragmentation  is introduced. Interpolating techniques are
          then  applied  to the sample of the first 10 pc and to the open
          cluster  NGC6649: in both cases lognormal distribution produces
          the  best  fit.  The  three  power  law  function has also been
          investigated   and   visual  comparison  with  an  artificially
          generated  sample  of 100000 stars suggests that the variations
          in  the  spectral  index  are simply due to the small number of
          stars available in the observational sample. In order to derive
          the  sample  of masses, a new formula that allows us to express
          the  mass as a function of the absolute magnitude and (B-V) for
          MAIN V, GIANTS III and SUPERGIANTS I is derived.

          clouds

          Observations", Leuven, Belgium, September 12-16, 2005
          The  most  geoeffective  solar  drivers are magnetic clouds - a
          subclass of coronal mass ejections (CME's) distinguished by the
          smooth rotation of the magnetic field inside the structure. The
          portion of CME's that are magnetic clouds is maximum at sunspot
          minimum  and  mimimum  at  sunspot  maximum.  This  portion  is
          determined  by  the  amount  of  helicity carried away by CME's
          which  in  turn  depends  on the amount of helicity transferred
          from  the  solar  interior  to  the surface, and on the surface
          differential  rotation.  The  latter can increase or reduce, or
          even  reverse  the  twist of emerging magnetic flux tubes, thus
          increasing  or  reducing the helicity in the corona, or leading
          to   the   violation   of   the   hemispheric   helicity  rule,
          respectively.  We  investigate  the  CME's  associated with the
          major  geomagnetic  storms  in the last solar cycle whose solar
          sources  have  been  identified,  and find that in 10 out of 12
          cases  of  violation  of  the  hemispheric  helicity rule or of
          highly geoeffective CME's with no magnetic field rotation, they
          originate  from  regions  with  "anti-solar"  type  of  surface
          differential rotation.

          We review the main properties, demographics and applications of
          binary  and  millisecond  radio pulsars. Our knowledge of these
          exciting  objects has greatly increased in recent years, mainly
          due  to  successful surveys which have brought the known pulsar
          population   to   over  1700.  There  are  now  80  binary  and
          millisecond pulsars associated with the disk of our Galaxy, and
          a  further 103 pulsars in 24 of the Galactic globular clusters.
          Recent  highlights  have  been  the discovery of the first ever
          double  pulsar  system  and  a  recent flurry of discoveries in
          globular clusters, in particular Terzan 5.

          Title: Can brane dark energy model be probed observationally by
          distant supernovae?
          Authors: Marek Szydlowski, Wlodzimierz Godlowski
          Comments: 14 pages 7 figures
          The  recent  astronomical measurements of distant supernovae as
          well  as  other  observations  indicate  that  our  universe is
          presently  accelerating.  There are different proposals for the
          explanation  of  this  acceleration.  Most  of  these proposals
          require  the  existence of exotic matter with negative pressure
          violating the strong energy condition. On the other hand, there
          have  appeared  many  models which offer dramatically different
          mechanism  for  the  current acceleration, in which dark energy
          emerges  from  the  gravity  sector rather than from the matter
          sector.  In this paper, we compare the concordance $\Lambda$CDM
          model with the braneworld models of dark energy by using Akaike
          and  Bayesian  informative critera. We show that, although this
          model  has  extra  parameters (the fundamental constants of the
          bulk  space)  resulting  in  an  improved fit to the SNIa data,
          these new parameters are actually not important for description
          of   present  acceleration  epoch.  With  the  example  of  the
          Sahni--Shtanov    braneworld    model    \cite{Shtanov03},   we
          demonstrate  that,  although  this  model has better fit to the
          SNIa data than $\Lambda$CDM model, the information criterion of
          model selection prefers the $\Lambda$CDM model. This is because
          the informative criteria of model selection compensate for this
          advantage  by penalizing models having more free parameters. We
          conclude  that  only new future observational data are powerful
          enough  to  give  advantage to dark-energy models of braneworld
          origin, i.e., a very high-significance detection is required to
          justify the presence of new parameters.

          We  discuss  the  distribution of radial velocities of galaxies
          belonging  to  the  Local  Group.  Two  independent  samples of
          galaxies  as  well  as  several  methods  of reduction from the
          heliocentric   to  the  galactocentric  radial  velocities  are
          explored. We applied the power spectrum analysis using the Hann
          function  as  a  weighting  method, together with the jackknife
          error  estimation.  We  performed  a  detailed analysis of this
          approach.  The  distribution  of  galaxy  redshifts seems to be
          non-random.  An  excess  of  galaxies with radial velocities of
          $\sim 24 {km} \cdot {s}^{-1}$ and $\sim 36 {km} \cdot {s}^{-1}$
          is  detected,  but  the  effect is statistically weak. Only one
          peak  for  radial  velocities  of $\sim 24 {km} \cdot {s}^{-1}$
          seems to be confirmed at the confidence level of 95%.

          We  present  7  mm and 3.5 cm wavelength continuum observations
          toward  the  Herbig  AeBe star HD169142 performed with the Very
          Large  Array  (VLA)  with an angular resolution of ~1". We find
          that this object exhibits strong (~4.4 mJy), unresolved (~1") 7
          mm  continuum  emission,  being  one  of the brightest isolated
          Herbig   AeBe   stars  ever  detected  with  the  VLA  at  this
          wavelength. No emission is detected at 3.5 cm continuum, with a
          3  sigma upper limit of ~0.08 mJy. From these values, we obtain
          a  spectral  index  of  ~2.5  in  the 3.5 cm to 7 mm wavelength
          range, indicating that the observed flux density at 7mm is most
          likely  dominated  by  thermal  dust  emission  coming  from  a
          circumstellar  disc. We use available photometric data from the
          literature  to  model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
          this  object  from  radio  to near-ultraviolet frequencies. The
          observed  SED  can  be  understood  in  terms  of an irradiated
          accretion  disc  with  low  mass  accretion rate, 10^{-8} solar
          masses  per year, surrounding a star with an age of ~10 Myr. We
          infer  that  the mass of the disc is ~0.04 solar masses, and is
          populated by dust grains that have grown to a maximum size of 1
          mm everywhere, consistent with the lack of silicate emission at
          10  microns. These features, as well as indications of settling
          in the wall at the dust destruction radius, led us to speculate
          the disc of HD169142 is in an advanced stage of dust evolution,
          particularly in its inner regions.

          In this paper another class of Dark Matter candidate particles:
          the  pseudoscalar  and  scalar  light  bosonic  candidates,  is
          discussed.  Particular  care  is  devoted  to  the study of the
          processes  for  their  detection (which only involves electrons
          and  photons/X-rays)  in  a  suitable  underground experimental
          set-up.  For this purpose the needed calculations are developed
          and  various related aspects and phenomenologies are discussed.
          In particular, it is shown that - in addition to the WIMP cases
          already  discussed  elsewhere - there is also possibility for a
          bosonic  candidate  to  account  for  the  6.3 sigma C.L. model
          independent   evidence  for  the  presence  of  a  particle  DM
          component  in  the  galactic halo observed by DAMA/NaI. Allowed
          regions in these scenarios are presented also paying particular
          care on the cosmological interest of the bosonic candidate.

          Title:  Central  energy  equipartition  in multi-mass models of
          globular clusters
          Authors: P. Miocchi (Universita' di Roma "La Sapienza", Dip. di
          Fisica, Rome, Italy)
          Comments:  LaTeX  2e,  9  pages  with  7  figures. Accepted for
          publication in MNRAS
          In   the  construction  of  multi-mass  King-Michie  models  of
          globular clusters, an approximated central energy equipartition
          between stars of different masses is usually imposed by scaling
          the  velocity  parameter  of each mass class inversely with the
          stellar  mass, as if the distribution function were isothermal.
          In  this  paper,  this 'isothermal approximation' (IA) has been
          checked and its consequences on the model parameters studied by
          a comparison with models including central energy equipartition
          correctly.  It  is found that, under the IA, the 'temperatures'
          of  a  pair of components can differ to a non-negligible amount
          for  low concentration distributions. It is also found that, in
          general,  this  approximation  leads to a significantly reduced
          mass  segregation in comparison with that given under the exact
          energy   equipartition  at  the  centre.  As  a  representative
          example,   an  isotropic  3-component  model  fitting  a  given
          projected   surface   brightness   and  line-of-sight  velocity
          dispersion profiles is discussed. In this example, the IA gives
          a    cluster   envelope   much   more   concentrated   (central
          dimensionless    potential   W=3.3)   than   under   the   true
          equipartition  (W=0.059),  as well as a higher logarithmic mass
          function  slope. As a consequence, the inferred total mass (and
          then the global mass-to-light ratio) results a factor 1.4 times
          lower  than  the  correct value and the amount of mass in heavy
          dark remnants is 3.3 times smaller. Under energy equipartition,
          the  fate  of  stars  having a mass below a certain limit is to
          escape  from the system. This limit is derived as a function of
          the mass and W of the giants and turn-off stars component.

          Title:  Astrometric  Light-Travel  Time signature of sources in
          nonlinear motion
          Authors: Guillem Anglada, Jordi Torra
          Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures
          Context:Very  precise  planned  space  astrometric missions and
          recent  improvements on imaging capabilities require a detailed
          review of the assumptions of classical astrometric modeling.
          Aims:We  show that Light-Travel Time must be taken into account
          to  model  the  kinematics of astronomical objects in nonlinear
          motion, even at stellar distances.
          Methods:A closed expression to include Light-Travel Time in the
          actual  astrometric  models  with nonlinear motion is provided.
          Using   a   perturbative   approach   the   expression  of  the
          Light-Travel  Time signature is derived. We propose a practical
          form  of the astrometric modelling to be applied in astrometric
          data reduction of sources at stellar distances($d>1 pc$).
          Results  :We  show  that  the  Light-Travel  Time  signature is
          relevant  at  $\muas$  accuracy (or even at $mas$) depending on
          the  time  span of the astrometric measurements. We explain how
          information  about  the  radial  motion  of  a  source  can  be
          obtained. Some estimative numbers are provided for known nearby
          binary systems
          Conclusions  :In the light of the obtained results, it is clear
          that  this  effect  must be taken into account to interpret any
          kind   of  precise  astrometric  measurements.  The  effect  is
          particularly  interesting  in  measurements  performed  by  the
          planned   astrometric   space  missions  (GAIA,  SIM,  JASMINE,
          TPF/DARWIN).  Finally  an  objective  criterion  is provided to
          quickly  evaluate  whether  the  Light-Travel  Time modeling is
          required for a given source or system.

          Title:  Influence of gravity waves on the internal rotation and
          Li abundance of solar-type stars
          Authors: Corinne Charbonnel, Suzanne Talon
          Comments:  Published  in Science, Vol.309, p.2189, 30 September
          2005. pdf only
          The  Sun's  rotation  profile  and  lithium  content  have been
          difficult  to  understand in the context of conventional models
          of  stellar  evolution. Classical hydrodynamical models predict
          that  the  solar interior must rotate highly differentially, in
          disagreement with observations. It has recently been shown that
          internal  waves  produced  by  convection  in  solar-type stars
          produce  an  asymmetric,  shear  layer  oscillation, similar to
          Earth's  quasi-biennial  oscillation,  that  leads to efficient
          angular  momentum redistribution from the core to the envelope.
          We  presents  results  of  a model that successfully reproduces
          both  the rotation profile and the surface abundance of lithium
          in solar-type stars of various ages.

          The   low   background,   good  spatial  resolution  and  great
          sensitivity  of  the  EPIC-pn  camera on XMM-Newton give useful
          limits  for  the  detection of extended sources even during the
          short  exposures  made during slewing maneouvers. In this paper
          we  attempt  to illustrate the potential of the XMM-Newton slew
          survey as a tool for analysing flux-limited samples of clusters
          of  galaxies  and  other  sources  of  spatially extended X-ray
          emission.

          The  Global  mm-VLBI  Array  is at present the most sensitive 3
          mm-VLBI   interferometer  and  provides  images  of  up  to  40
          micro-arcsecond resolution. Using this array, we have monitored
          the rotation of the innermost jet in the quasar NRAO 150, which
          shows an angular speed of ~ 7 deg./yr. Future 3 mm arrays could
          include  additional  stations  like ALMA, GBT, LMT, CARMA, SRT,
          Yebes,  Nobeyama  and  Noto,  which would allow to push VLBI at
          this   wavelength  to  sensitivity  and  image  quality  levels
          comparable  to those of present VLBI at centimeter wavelengths.
          This  would  improve our knowledge of the accretion systems and
          the  magneto-hydrodynamics  of  the  innermost  jets in AGN and
          microquasars.

          Title:   Single   massive  stars  at  the  critical  rotational
          velocity: possible links with Be and B[e] stars
          Authors: Georges Meynet, Andre Maeder
          Comments: 11 pages, 13 figures, Stars with the B[e] phenomenon,
          M. Kraus and A. Miroshnichenko, ASP Conference Series, in press
          Using  single  star  models  including the effects of shellular
          rotation with and without magnetic fields, we show that massive
          stars at solar metallicity with initial masses lower than about
          20-25  M$_\odot$  and with an initial rotation above $\sim 350$
          km  s$^{-1}$  likely  reach  the critical velocity during their
          Main-Sequence  phase.  This results from the efficient outwards
          transport  of  angular  momentum by the meridional circulation.
          This could be a scenario for explaining the Be stars. After the
          Main-Sequence  phase,  single star in this mass range can again
          reach  the  critical limit when they are on a blue loop after a
          red supergiant phase \citep{HL98}. This might be a scenario for
          the  formation  of B[e] stars, however as discussed by Langer &
          Heger  (1998),  this  scenario would predict a short B[e] phase
          (only  some 10$^4$ years) with correspondingly small amounts of
          mass lost.

          We  present the spectral and temporal analysis of the 2004/2005
          outburst  of  the  transient  X-ray pulsar V0332+53 as observed
          with  Integral. After the discovery of the third cyclotron line
          in  phase averaged spectra (Kreykenbohm et al 2005, Pottschmidt
          et   al  2005),  detailed  pulse  phase  spectroscopy  revealed
          remarkably  little  variability  of the cyclotron lines through
          the  4.4s  X-ray  pulse  (Pottschmidt  et  al 2005). During the
          decline  of  the  outburst,  the  flux  was  observed  to decay
          exponentially  until  2005  Feb 10 and linearly thereafter. The
          spectrum  was  found  to  become  harder  with  time, while the
          folding energy remained constant. The energy of the fundamental
          cyclotron  line  increased  with  time from 26.5kev in the RXTE
          observation  up  to 29.5kev in the last Integral one indicating
          that the emission region is moving closer to the surface of the
          neutron  star.  For  a  detailed  analysis,  see  Mowlavi et al

          Comments:  16  pages, 6 color figures, 4 b/w figures, submitted
          to Astronomy and Astrophysics
          (ABBREVIATED)  We study the spectrum of the prompt emission and
          the  X-ray  and  optical  afterglow  fluxes of XRRs and XRFs. A
          comparison  is  then performed with GRBs. We derive a sample of
          54 events XRRs/XRFs observed by BeppoSAX and HETE-2. We analyze
          the  distribution  of  the  spectral  parameters  of  the  Band
          function finding that the spectral indexes are similar to those
          of classical GRBs, whereas the peak energy is lower by a factor
          of  4  for  the  XRRs/XRFs.  We  study  the  optical  and X-Ray
          afterglow  properties  of  the  XRRs/XRFs;  in  particular  XRR
          011030. We find that the X-ray and optical flux distribution of
          the  XRRs/XRFs  sample,  observed 40 ks from burst trigger, are
          consistent  with those of classical GRBs. We find also that the
          XRRs/XRFs  lightcurves  seems to be similar to the GRB ones. In
          addition,  they  never  show  a  rising slope at early time. We
          compare  this  result  with  the  afterglow  predictions of two
          models : the high redshift scenario, and the off-axis scenario.
          In  this last framework, we consider jets with a homogeneous, a
          -2   power-law   shaped   and  a  Gaussian  luminosity  angular
          distribution.  We  find  that  the  high  redshift scenario can
          explain  some events but not the total sample of XRRs/XRFs. The
          off-axis model may be consistent with our foundings only when a
          power-law   shaped   jet  is  considered.  However,  given  the
          uncertainties  on  the  selection  effects  in  our sample, the
          Gaussian  jet  viewed  at  small  angles from the Gaussian core
          cannot  be  ruled  out.  On the contrary, our analysis strongly
          disfavored a homogeneous jet seen off-axis.

          15-19, 2005
          Today's  sensistive, high resolution Chandra X-ray observations
          allow  the  study  of  many  populations  of X-ray sources. The
          traditional  astronomical  tools  of  photometric  diagrams and
          luminosity  functions are now applied to these populations, and
          provide the means for classifying the X-ray sources and probing
          their  evolution.  While overall stellar mass drives the amount
          of  X-ray  binaries  in  old  stellar population, the amount of
          sources  in  star-forming  galaxies  is  related  to  the  star
          formation  rate.  Shart-lived,  luminous,  high  mass  binaries
          (HNXBs) dominate these young populations.

          Authors:   Huaiyu   Duan   (UCSD),  George  M.  Fuller  (UCSD),
          Yong-Zhong Qian (UMN)
          Comments: 16 pages, 9 figures
          We   examine   the  coherent  active-active  channel  nonlinear
          neutrino  flavor  evolution  in  the post-core-bounce supernova
          environment. We improve on the previous spin precession analogy
          to  neutrino  oscillation,  and propose the concept of neutrino
          flavor isospin, which treats neutrinos and anti-neutrinos on an
          equal  footing.  We  point  out  a  key conserved quantity, the
          "total  effective energy". This conservation condition suggests
          a  simple explanation for previous numerical results. We employ
          a  co-rotating  frame  in  the  spin precession picture to gain
          physical  insights into the collective behaviors of this system
          when  neutrino-neutrino  forward  scattering dominates the weak
          potentials which govern flavor conversion. We also use the spin
          precession analogy to analyze previously-derived limits for the
          behavior  of supernova neutrinos, e.g., the Background Dominant
          Solution, and we speculate on how such solutions could arise in

          Title: Investigating Galaxy Evolution with Chandra
          Authors: G. Fabbiano
          Comments:  To  be  included  in  the  proceedings of the 'X-ray
          universe  2005  meeting'  held  in  San  Lorenzo de El Escorial
          (Spain), 26-30 Sep 2005
          Chandra  observations show the importance of the X-ray band for
          studying the evolution of galaxies. Binary X-ray sources are an
          easily  detectable  tracer  of  the stellar population. Chandra
          studies  of  these  populations are giving us insights into the
          nature  and  formation of these binaries, and provide the basis
          for   diagnostics   of   galaxy  evolution.  With  Chandra  and
          XMM-Newton  we  can  explore relatively poorly known aspects of
          the black hole population of the universe: ultra-luminous X-ray
          sources,  that may be connected with the 'missing' intermediate
          mass  black  holes  predicted  by hierarchical galaxy and black
          hole  formation  scenarios;  and quiescent supermassive nuclear
          black  holes and their surroundings, as a way to understand the
          full  range  of  the  AGN  phenomenon.  Finally, the X-ray band
          provides  the  only  way  to  explore  hot plasmas in galaxies;
          recent  observations  are  revealing  the  importance  of these
          plasmas as vehicles of both chemical enrichment and energy.

          Title: Gamma Ray Astronomy with Magnetized Zevatrons

          Nearby  sources  of cosmic rays up to a ZeV(=10^21 eV) could be
          observed  with  a  multi-messenger approach including secondary
          gamma-rays  and  neutrinos.  If cosmic rays above ~10^18 eV are
          produced  in  magnetized  environments such as galaxy clusters,
          the  flux  of secondary gamma-rays below ~1 TeV can be enhanced
          up  to  several  orders  of magnitudes compared to unmagnetized
          sources. A particular source of enhancement are synchrotron and
          cascade  photons  from  e^+e^-  pairs  produced by protons from
          sources with relatively steep injection spectra proportional to
          E^-2.6.  Such  sources  should  be  visible at the same time in
          ultra-high   energy   cosmic   ray  experiments  and  gamma-ray
          telescopes.

          publication in Astron. Nachrichten
          We  present  results  of  an optical and near-infrared (IR) 1.8
          deg^2  survey  in  the  Pleiades  open  cluster  to  search for
          substellar  objects.  From  optical I-band images from the CFHT
          and J-band images from the 3.5 m CAHA Telescope, we identify 18
          faint  and  very red L brown dwarf candidates, with I> 20.9 and
          I-J>  3.2. The follow-up observations of nine objects in the H-
          and  Ks-bands  confirm  that eight belong to the IR sequence of
          the  cluster  and  the  proper  motion  measurements  of  seven
          candidates   confirm   that   they   are  Pleiades  members.  A
          preliminary estimation of the substellar mass spectrum dN/dM in
          the  form of a power law M^-alpha provides alpha=0.57+-0.14. We
          extrapolate  this  function  to  estimate  the  number  of very
          low-mass  brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects that could be
          present  in  the  cluster  down  to 1 M_Jup. Sensitive searches
          combining  far  red  and  near infrared observations may unveal
          these objects in a near future.

          Title:  Size  and Properties of the NLR in the Seyfert-2 Galaxy
          NGC 1386

          Komossa  (MPE Garching), Martin Haas (Univ. Bochum), Rolf Chini
          (Univ. Bochum)
          Comments: 14 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          We  study  the narrow-line region (NLR) of the Seyfert-2 galaxy
          NGC 1386 by means of long-slit spectroscopy obtained with FORS1
          at  the  VLT.  We  use  the  galaxy  itself for subtracting the
          stellar  template,  applying  reddening  corrections to fit the
          stellar  template to the spectra of the NLR. The continuum gets
          steadily  redder  towards the nucleus. The spatial distribution
          of the reddening derived from the Balmer decrement differs from
          the  continuum reddening, indicating dust within the NLR with a
          varying column density along the line of sight. Using spatially
          resolved  spectral  diagnostics,  we  find a transition between
          central  line ratios falling into the AGN regime and outer ones
          in  the  HII-region  regime,  occuring at a radius of ~6 arcsec
          (310  pc)  in  all  three  diagnostic diagrams. Applying CLOUDY
          photoionisation  models,  we show that the observed distinction
          between  HII-like  and AGN-like ratios in NGC 1386 represents a
          true difference in ionisation source and cannot be explained by
          variations of physical parameters such as ionisation parameter,
          electron  density  or  metallicity.  We  interpret it as a real
          border  between  the  NLR,  i.e.  the  central AGN-photoionised
          region   and   surrounding   HII  regions.  We  derive  surface
          brightness,  electron  density,  and  ionisation parameter as a
          function  of  distance  from  the  nucleus.  Both  the electron
          density  and  the ionisation parameter decrease with radius. We
          discuss   the   consequences  of  these  observations  for  the
          interpretation  of  the empirical NLR size-luminosity relation.
          In  the  outer  part  of  the NLR, we find evidence for shocks,
          resulting  in  a  secondary  peak  of  the electron-density and
          ionisation-parameter  distribution  north  of  the  nucleus. We
          compare the NLR velocity curve with the stellar one and discuss
          the differences.

          Title: [OIII] profile substructure in radio-quiet quasars
          Authors:  Christian  Leipski  (Univ.  Bochum),  Nicola  Bennert
          (Univ. Bochum)
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Interactions  between the radio jet and the optical emission of
          the  narrow-line  region  (NLR)  are a well known phenomenon in
          Seyfert  galaxies.  Here,  we  present  the  study  of possible
          jet-NLR interactions in five radio-quiet PG quasars with double
          or triple radio structure. High spatial and spectral resolution
          observations   were   carried   out   in  the  Hbeta-[OIII]5007
          wavelength  range.  In  all cases, there is evidence for [OIII]
          profile    substructure   (shoulders,   subpeaks,   blueshifted
          ''broad''  components)  with  different clarity. To measure the
          velocity,  line  width, intensity, and location of these [OIII]
          components,   several   Gaussians   were   fitted.  Often,  the
          substructures  are  more  pronounced  close to the radio lobes,
          suggestive  of  jet-NLR  interactions. Our observations support
          the unification scheme in which radio-quiet quasars are assumed
          to be the luminous cousins of Seyfert galaxies.

          Authors:  D.  Paulson,  J.  Allred,  R. Anderson, S. Hawley, W.
          Cochran, S. Yelda
          Comments: Accepted for publication in PASP
          We  present  optical  spectra  of  a  flare  on Barnard's star.
          Several  photospheric  as  well  as  chromospheric species were
          enhanced  by the flare heating. An analysis of the Balmer lines
          shows  that their shapes are best explained by Stark broadening
          rather   than  chromospheric  mass  motions.  We  estimate  the
          temperature of the flaring region in the lower atmosphere to be
          >8000  K and the electron density to be ~10^14 cm^{-3}, similar
          to  values  observed in other dM flares. Because Barnard's star
          is  considered  to  be  one of our oldest neighbors, a flare of
          this magnitude is probably quite rare.

          publication in AJ
          In  order  to  examine  the  relative  importance  of  powerful
          starbursts and Compton-thick AGNs in NGC 6240, we have obtained
          mid-infrared  images  and  low-resolution spectra of the galaxy
          with   sub-arcsecond   spatial   resolution   using   the  Keck
          Telescopes.  Despite  the  high spatial resolution (~200 pc) of
          our  data, no signature of the hidden AGNs has been detected in
          the  mid-infrared. The southern nucleus, which we show provides
          80-90%  of  the  total  8-25 um luminosity of the system, has a
          mid-infrared  spectrum  and a mid-/far-infrared spectral energy
          distribution  consistent  with  starbursts.  At  the same time,
          however,  it  is  also  possible  to attribute up to 60% of the
          bolometric   luminosity   to  an  AGN,  consistent  with  X-ray
          observations,  if  the AGN is heavily obscured and emits mostly
          in   the   far-infrared.  This  ambiguity  arises  because  the
          intrinsic   variation   of  properties  among  a  given  galaxy
          population (e.g., starbursts) introduces at least a factor of a
          few   uncertainty  even  into  the  most  robust  AGN-starburst
          diagnostics.  We  conclude that with present observations it is
          not possible to determine the dominant power source in galaxies
          when  AGN  and  starburst luminosities are within a factor of a
          few of each other.

          article  with  uncompressed figures may be downloaded from this

          The  spectral energy distribution of the dark cloud LDN1622, as
          measured  by  Finkbeiner using WMAP data, drops above 30GHz and
          is   suggestive   of  a  Boltzmann  cutoff  in  grain  rotation
          frequencies, characteristic of spinning dust emission.
          LDN1622 is conspicuous in the 31 GHz image we obtained with the
          Cosmic  Background  Imager, which is the first cm-wave resolved
          image  of a dark cloud. The 31GHz emission follows the emission
          traced by the four IRAS bands. The normalised cross-correlation
          of  the 31 GHz image with the IRAS images is higher by 6.6sigma
          for  the 12um and 25um bands than for the 60um and 100um bands:
          C(12+25) = 0.76+/-0.02 and C(60+100) = 0.64+/-0.01.
          The  mid-IR  -- cm-wave correlation in LDN 1622 is evidence for
          very small grain (VSG) or continuum emission at 26-36GHz from a
          hot  molecular phase. In dark clouds and their photon-dominated
          regions  (PDRs)  the  12um  and  25um emission is attributed to
          stochastic  heating  of  the  VSGs. The mid-IR and cm-wave dust
          emissions  arise in a limb-brightened shell coincident with the
          PDR  of  LDN1622,  where the incident UV radiation from the Ori
          OB1b  association heats and charges the grains, as required for
          spinning dust.

          Title: Scalar-Tensor Gravitation and Cosmic Acceleration
          Authors: Sanil Unnikrishnan, T.R.Seshadri
          Comments: 9 pages, 2 figures, Submitted to Physics Letters B
          In  this  paper  we consider a model in which the gravitational
          ``constant''  $G$  is  determined by a tachyon-like field whose
          Lagrangian is of the form $\mathcal{L}_{\phi} = -V(\phi)\sqrt{1
          -  \partial_{\mu}\phi\partial^{\mu}\phi}$  and the potential is
          of  the  form  $  V(\phi)  =  \lambda \phi ^{-4}$. We study the
          cosmological consequence of this theory in the matter dominated
          era  and  show  that this leads to a transition from an initial
          decelerated  expansion to an accelerated expansion phase at the
          present epoch.

          Title:  An  Alternative Interpretation for the Moduli Fields of
          the Cosmology Associated to Type IIB Supergravity with Fluxes
          Authors:    Tonatiuh    Matos,    Jose-Ruben    Luevano,   Hugo
          Garcia-Compean
          Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure
          We start with a particular cosmological model derived from type
          IIB  supergravity theory with fluxes, where usually the dilaton
          is  interpreted  as  a  Quintessence field. Instead of that, in
          this  letter we interpret the dilaton as the dark matter of the
          universe.  With this alternative interpretation we find that in
          this  supergravity  model  the  dilaton  dominates the universe
          before  recombination.  We  also  show  that  the model gives a
          similar  evolution  and  structure  formation  of  the universe
          compared  with  the  $\Lambda$CDM model in the linear regime of
          fluctuations  of  the structure formation. Some free parameters
          of   the  theory  are  fixed  using  the  present  cosmological
          observations.   In   the  non-linear  regimen  there  are  some
          differences  between  the type IIB supergravity theory with the
          traditional  CDM paradigm. The supergravity theory predicts the
          formation  of  galaxies  earlier  than  the CDM and there is no
          density  cusp  in the center of galaxies. These differences can
          distinguish  both  models and can give a distinctive feature to
          the  phenomenology  of  the  cosmology  coming from superstring
          theory with fluxes.

          Title: The BATSE-Swift luminosity and redshift distributions of
          short-duration GRBs
          Authors: Dafne Guetta, Tsvi Piran
          We  compare  the luminosity function and rate inferred from the
          BATSE  short hard bursts (SHBs) peak flux distribution with the
          redshift  and  luminosity  distributions  of  SHBs  observed by
          Swift/HETE   II.   While   the  Swift/HETE  II  SHB  sample  is
          incompatible   with   SHB  population  that  follows  the  star
          formation rate, it is compatible with a SHB rate that reflect a
          distribution  of  delay  times after the SFR. This would be the
          case  if  SHBs are associated with binary neutron star mergers.
          The  available data allows, however, different interpretations.
          For  example,  a  population  whose  rate is independent of the
          redshift fits the data very well. The implied SHB rates that we
          find range from $\sim 8$ to $\sim
          30h_{70}^3$Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. This is a much higher rate than
          what  was previously estimated. A detailed (2 dimensional) look
          at the best fit models shows, however, some discrepancy between
          the four Swift/HETE II SHBs and the models based on BATSE SHBs.
          This  could  be  a  statistical fluke. It could also arise from
          wrong  estimates  of  the triggering criteria or from selection
          effects.  If  real  it  may  indicate  the existence of two SHB
          populations  with  different  luminosity functions and redshift
          distributions.

          Title:  Low Frequency Radio Observations of Galaxy Clusters Can
          Reveal Global Signatures in the Cosmological 21-cm Background
          Authors: Asantha Cooray
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          While  the  low  frequency spectrum of the radio sky is rich in
          features  associated  with  the  cosmic  21-cm  background from
          neutral  Hydrogen,  a  direct  measurement  of  this  frequency
          spectrum  is  challenging. We propose a technique to indirectly
          establish global signatures in the cosmic 21-cm radiation based
          on  differential  observations  towards  and away from a galaxy
          cluster  such  that  modifications  imposed  by inverse-Compton
          scattering  via  electrons  in galaxy clusters can be detected.
          While  the unscattered spectrum has features with amplitudes up
          to  40  mK in the brightness temperature relative to the cosmic
          microwave background, after scattering, the observable spectrum
          contains  decrements  and increments with amplitudes around 0.2
          to  1  mK  in addition to a uniform few mK decrement associated
          with  the  black-body  CMB. Low frequency radio interferometers
          that  are  now planned for 21-cm anisotropy measurements can be
          easily  utilized  for  the proposed measurement. The signatures
          towards clusters will also confirm the 21-cm signal is produced
          at a redshift higher than the cluster, in addition to providing
          an   easy,   and   a   necessary,  cross-check  on  fluctuation
          measurements.

          Title: Halo Spacetime
          Authors: Mark D. Roberts
          Comments: 8 pages
          Subject to the four assupmtions:
          1)a  galactic  halo  can  be  modeled  by  a static spherically
          symmetric spacetime,
          2)in  the  limit  of  no  rotation  halo spacetime is Minkowski
          spacetime  and  that  the  speed  of  rotation is a permissible
          parameter   to   expand  in,  3)the  constraint  on  the  first
          derivatives  of  the metric needed in order to produce constant
          rotation  curves  can  be applied, 4)the perfect fluid Einstein
          equations;    it    is    shown    that    the    density    is
          $\rho=-2v^2/r^2+O(v^4)$,  where  $v=v_c/c$  is  the velocity of
          rotation  of  the  galaxy.  The  negative  density  is taken to
          indicate  that  one of the above four assumptions is wrong, the
          last  is  the most likely, implying that there is no such thing
          as dark matter.

          Title:  Three-Body  Kick  to  a Bright Quasar out of Its Galaxy
          During a Merger
          Authors: Loren Hoffman, Abraham Loeb (Harvard U.)
          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Nature
          The  quasar HE0450-2958 was recently discovered to reside ~7kpc
          away  from  a  galaxy  that  was  likely  disturbed by a recent
          merger.  The  lack  of  a  massive spheroid of stars around the
          quasar  raised  the unlikely suggestion that it may have formed
          in  a  dark galaxy. Here we explain this discovery as a natural
          consequence  of  a  dynamical kick imparted to the quasar as it
          interacted  with  a  binary  black  hole system during a galaxy
          merger  event.  The  typical stalling radius (~1pc) for a ~10^9
          solar  mass binary provides a kick of order the escape velocity
          of  the stellar spheroid, bringing the quasar out to around the
          observed radius before it turns around. This is consistent with
          the  observed  low relative velocity between the quasar and the
          merger-remnant  galaxy.  The  gas  carried  with the black hole
          throughout  the three-body interaction fuels the quasar for the
          duration of its journey, ~2x10^7 years. Gravitational radiation
          recoil could not have produced the required kick.

          Workshop
          In  order  to  study  the  possibility of acoustic detection of
          ultra-high  energy neutrinos in water, our group is planning to
          deploy  and  operate  an  array  of  acoustic sensors using the
          ANTARES Neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore,
          acoustic  sensor  hardware  has  to  be developed which is both
          capable  of  operation under the hostile conditions of the deep
          sea  and  at  the  same  time  provides  the  high  sensitivity
          necessary  to  detect  the weak pressure signals resulting from
          the  neutrino's  interaction  in  water.  In  this  paper,  two
          different  approaches  to  building  such  sensors,  as well as
          performance   studies  in  the  laboratory  and  in  situ,  are
          presented.

          Title:  First  optical images of circumstellar dust surrounding
          the debris disk candidate HD 32297
          Authors: P. Kalas
          Comments: 5 pages; Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters
          Near-infrared  imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope recently
          revealed  a circumstellar dust disk around the A star HD 32297.
          Dust  scattered  light  is detected as far as 400 AU radius and
          the  linear  morphology  is  consistent with a disk ~10 degrees
          away  from  an  edge-on  orientation. Here we present the first
          optical  images  that  show the dust scattered light morphology
          from  560 to 1680 AU radius. The position angle of the putative
          disk  midplane  diverges  by  31  degrees and the color of dust
          scattering  is  most  likely blue. We associate HD 32297 with a
          wall  of interstellar gas and the enigmatic region south of the
          Taurus molecular cloud. We propose that the extreme asymmetries
          and  blue disk color originate from a collision with a clump of
          interstellar  material as HD 32297 moves southward, and discuss
          evidence consistent with an age of 30 Myr or younger.

          Title:  Possible  evidence  for  the ejection of a supermassive
          black hole from an ongoing merger of galaxies
          Authors:  Martin  G.  Haehnelt  (IoA), Melvyn B. Davies (Lund),
          Martin J. Rees (IoA)
          Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX, no figures; MNRAS in press
          Attempts  of  Magain  et al (2005) to detect the host galaxy of
          the  bright  QSO  HE0450--2958  have  not  been  successful. We
          suggest  that  the supermassive black hole powering the QSO was
          ejected from the observed ULIRG at the same redshift and at 1.5
          arcsec distance. Ejection could have either be caused by recoil
          due  to gravitational wave emission from a coalescing binary of
          supermassive  black  holes  or  the  gravitational slingshot of
          three or more supermassive black holes in the ongoing merger of
          galaxies  which  triggered the starburst activity in the ULIRG.
          We  discuss implications for the possible hierarchical build-up
          of  supermassive  black  holes from intermediate and/or stellar
          mass   black   holes,  and  for  the  detection  of  coalescing
          supermassive binary black holes by LISA.

          Title:  Rotational  Broadening of Atomic Spectral Features from
          Neutron Stars
          Authors: P. Chang, S. Morsink, L. Bildsten, I. Wasserman
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, to appear in ApJ Letters
          The  discovery of the first gravitationally redshifted spectral
          line from a neutron star (NS) by Cottam, Paerels and Mendez has
          triggered  theoretical  studies  of  the physics of atomic line
          formation  in  NS  atmospheres.  Chang,  Bildsten and Wasserman
          showed  that  the hydrogenic Fe H$\alpha$ line formed above the
          photosphere  of  a  bursting  NS is intrinsically broad. We now
          include  rotational  broadening  within  general relativity and
          compare  the  resulting  profile to that observed during Type I
          bursts  from  EXO  0748-676.  We  show  that the fine structure
          splitting  of the line precludes a meaningful constraint on the
          radius.  Our  fitting of the data show that the line forming Fe
          column    is    ${\rm    log}_{10}    (N_{\rm   Fe,   n=2}/{\rm
          cm^{-2}})=17.9_{-0.42}^{+0.27}$ and gravitational redshift $1+z
          =1.345_{-0.008}^{+0.005}$ with 95% confidence. We calculate the
          detectability  of  this  spectral  feature for a large range of
          spins  and  inclinations  assuming that the emission comes from
          the  entire  surface.  We find that at 300 (600) Hz only 10-20%
          (5-10%)  of  NSs  would  have spectral features as deep as that
          seen in EXO 0748-676.

          Title:  Exposing  the Nuclear Burning Ashes of Radius Expansion
          Type I X-ray Bursts
          Authors:  Nevin  N.  Weinberg  (Caltech,  KITP),  Lars Bildsten
          (KITP, UCSB), Hendrik Schatz (MSU, JINA)
          Comments: 15 pages, 15 figures (emulateapj), accepted to ApJ
          We  solve  for  the  evolution  of  the  vertical extent of the
          convective  region of a neutron star atmosphere during a Type I
          X-ray  burst. The convective region is well-mixed with ashes of
          nuclear  burning and its extent determines the rise time of the
          burst  light  curve.  Using a full nuclear reaction network, we
          show  that the maximum vertical extent of the convective region
          during   photospheric  radius  expansion  (RE)  bursts  can  be
          sufficiently  great that: (1) some ashes of burning are ejected
          by  the radiation driven wind during the RE phase and, (2) some
          ashes  of  burning  are  exposed  at  the  neutron star surface
          following the RE phase. We find that ashes with mass number A ~
          30  -  60  are mixed in with the ejected material. We calculate
          the  expected  column  density  of ejected and surface ashes in
          hydrogen-like states and determine the equivalent widths of the
          resulting  photoionization edges from both the wind and neutron
          star  surface.  We  find  that  these can exceed 100 eV and are
          potentially  detectable.  A  detection  would probe the nuclear
          burning processes and might enable a measurement of the neutron
          star  gravitational  redshift.  In  addition,  we  find that in
          bursts with pure helium burning layers, protons from (alpha, p)
          reactions  cause  a  rapid onset of the 12C(p, gamma)13N(alpha,
          p)16O  reaction  sequence. The sequence bypasses the relatively
          slow  12C(alpha, gamma)16O reaction and leads to a sudden surge
          in  energy production that is directly observable as a rapid (~
          ms) increase in flux during burst rise.

          Title:  Fluctuations  along Velocity Coordinate: Statistics and
          Effects of Absorption
          Authors: A. Lazarian, D. Pogosyan
          Comments: 31 page, 1 figure
          We  discuss  statistics of Doppler-broadened spectral lines, in
          particular,     the     statistics     of    fluctuations    in
          Position-Position-Velocity data cub along the velocity axis. We
          show  that absorption substantially changes the long wavelength
          statistics of fluctuations compared to the optically thin case.
          At  the  same time, short-wavelength asymptotic is not affected
          by  absorption and remains power-law. We consider both the case
          of  high  spatial  resolution  and  the  case  of  poor spatial
          resolution  and  discuss  the retrieval of power-law indexes of
          velocity and density spectra. This provides a new technique for
          studies of turbulence from observations. A big advantage of the
          technique  is  that studies of turbulence can accomplished even
          when spatial resolution of the turbulent volume is poor.

          Using   the   Florida   Multi-object   Imaging   Near-IR  grism
          Observational  Spectrometer  (FLAMINGOS), we have conducted the
          FLAMINGOS  Extragalactic Survey (FLAMEX), a deep imaging survey
          covering  7.1  square degrees within the 18.6 sq. deg NOAO Deep
          Wide-Field  Survey  (NDWFS)  regions. FLAMEX is the first deep,
          wide-area  near-infrared  survey  to image in both the J and Ks
          filters,  and  is  larger  than  any  previous  NIR  surveys of
          comparable  depth.  The  intent  of FLAMEX is to facilitate the
          study  of  galaxy  and  galaxy  cluster  evolution  at 1<z<2 by
          providing  rest-frame optical photometry for the massive galaxy
          population  at  this  epoch. This effort is designed to yield a
          public  data  set  that  complements  and augments the suite of
          existing surveys in the NDWFS fields. We present an overview of
          FLAMEX  and  initial  results  based  upon ~150,000 Ks-selected

          We  present data obtained with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC)
          aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer) for a sample of 74
          young  (t  <  30 Myr old) Sun-like (0.7 < M(star)/M(Sun) < 1.5)
          stars.  These  are  a sub-set of the observations that comprise
          the  Spitzer  Legacy science program entitled the Formation and
          Evolution  of Planetary Systems (FEPS). Using IRAC we study the
          fraction  of  young  stars that exhibit 3.6-8.0 micron infrared
          emission   in   excess   of  that  expected  from  the  stellar
          photosphere,  as  a  function  of  age  from 3-30 Myr. The most
          straightforward  interpretation  of such excess emission is the
          presence  of hot (300-1000K) dust in the inner regions (< 3 AU)
          of  a circumstellar disk. Five out of the 74 young stars show a
          strong  infrared  excess,  four of which have estimated ages of
          3-10  Myr.  While  we  detect  excesses  from 5 optically thick
          disks,  and  photospheric  emission  from  the remainder of our
          sample,  we  do  not  detect any excess emission from optically
          thin  disks  at  these wavelengths. We compare our results with
          accretion  disk fractions detected in previous studies, and use
          the  ensemble  results  to  place additional constraints on the
          dissipation timescales for optically-thick, primordial disks.

          We  use  HST/ACS  imaging of 100 early-type galaxies in the ACS
          Virgo  Cluster Survey to investigate the nature of diffuse star
          clusters  (DSCs).  Compared  to  globular clusters (GCs), these
          star clusters have moderately low luminosities (M_V > -8) and a
          broad  distribution  of  sizes  (3 < r_h < 30 pc), but they are
          principally   characterized   by   their   low   mean   surface
          brightnesses  which  can  be more than three magnitudes fainter
          than  a typical GC (mu_g > 20 mag arcsec^-2). The median colors
          of diffuse star cluster systems are red, 1.1 < g-z < 1.6, which
          is  redder  than  metal-rich GCs and often as red as the galaxy
          itself.  Most  DSC systems thus have mean ages older than 5 Gyr
          or  else  have  super-solar  metallicities.  We  find  that  12
          galaxies  in our sample contain a significant excess of diffuse
          star cluster candidates -- nine are lenticulars (S0s), and five
          visibly  contain dust. We also find a substantial population of
          DSCs  in  the halo of the giant elliptical M49, associated with
          the  companion  galaxy  VCC 1199. Most DSC systems appear to be
          both aligned with the galaxy light and associated with galactic
          disks,  but  at  the  same  time  many  lenticulars do not host
          substantial  DSC  populations.  Diffuse  star  clusters  in our
          sample  share  similar  characteristics  to those identified in
          other  nearby  lenticular,  spiral,  and dwarf galaxies, and we
          suggest  that  DSCs  preferentially form, survive, and coevolve
          with  galactic  disks.  Their properties are broadly consistent
          with  those  of merged star cluster complexes, and we note that
          despite   being   3   -   5   magnitudes  brighter  than  DSCs,
          ultra-compact  dwarfs  have  similar  surface brightnesses. The
          closest Galactic analogs to the DSCs are the old open clusters.
          We  suggest that if a diffuse star cluster population did exist
          in  the  disk  of  the Milky Way, it would be very difficult to
          find. (Abridged)

          Title:   The   baseline   intracluster   entropy  profile  from
          gravitational structure formation
          Authors: G. Mark Voit, Scott T. Kay, Greg L. Bryan
          Comments: Accepted to MNRAS, 8 pages, 9 figures
          The  radial  entropy  profile  of  the  hot  gas in clusters of
          galaxies  tends  to follow a power law in radius outside of the
          cluster  core. Here we present a simple formula giving both the
          normalization  and  slope for the power-law entropy profiles of
          clusters   that   form  in  the  absence  of  non-gravitational
          processes such as radiative cooling and subsequent feedback. It
          is  based  on  seventy-one  clusters  drawn  from four separate
          cosmological    simulations,    two   using   smoothed-particle
          hydrodynamics  (SPH)  and  two  using  adaptive-mesh refinement
          (AMR),  and  can be used as a baseline for assessing the impact
          of  non-gravitational  processes  on  the  intracluster  medium
          outside  of cluster cores. All the simulations produce clusters
          with  self-similar  structure in which the normalization of the
          entropy  profile  scales linearly with cluster temperature, and
          these profiles are in excellent agreement outside of 0.2 r_200.
          Because  the observed entropy profiles of clusters do not scale
          linearly    with   temperature,   our   models   confirm   that
          non-gravitational   processes   are   necessary  to  break  the
          self-similarity  seen  in  the  simulations.  However, the core
          entropy  levels  found by the two codes used here significantly
          differ,  with  the  AMR  code  producing  nearly  twice as much
          entropy at the centre of a cluster.

          publication in MNRAS
          We  compare  the  gas  distribution, kinematics and the current
          star  formation  in  a  sample of 10 very faint (-13.37 < M_B <
          -9.55)  dwarf  galaxies.  For  5  of  these galaxies we present
          fresh, high sensitivity, GMRT HI 21cm observations. For all our
          galaxies  we  construct  maps  of  the  HI  column density at a
          constant  linear resolution of ~300 pc; this forms an excellent
          data  set  to  check  for  the  presence  of a threshold column
          density  for  star  formation.  We find that while current star
          formation (as traced by Halpha emission) is confined to regions
          with  relatively  large  (N_HI  >  (0.4  -1.7)  X 10^{21} atoms
          cm^{-2})  HI  column  density,  the  morphology  of  the Halpha
          emission  is in general not correlated with that of the high HI
          column  density gas. Thus, while high column density gas may be
          necessary  for  star  formation, in this sample at least, it is
          not  sufficient  to  ensure  that  star  formation does in fact
          occur.  We examine the line profiles of the HI emission, but do
          not  find  a  simple relation between regions with complex line
          profiles  and  those  with on-going star formation. Finally, we
          examine the very fine scale (~20-100 pc) distribution of the HI
          gas,  and  find  that  at  these scales the emission exhibits a
          variety  of  shell  like,  clumpy and filamentary features. The
          Halpha  emission  is  sometimes associated with high density HI
          clumps,  sometimes  the  Halpha  emission  lies  inside  a high
          density shell, and sometimes there is no correspondence between
          the  Halpha  emission  and  the  HI  clumps.  In  summary,  the
          interplay  between  star  formation  and  gas  density in these
          galaxy  does  not  seem to show the simple large scale patterns
          observed in brighter galaxies (abridged).

          Title: The Local Rate and the Progenitor Lifetime of Short-Hard
          Gamma-Ray Bursts: Synthesis and Predictions for LIGO
          Authors: Ehud Nakar, Avishay Gal-Yam, Derek B. Fox
          The  properties  of the short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) with
          known  host-galaxies  suggest  that  these events result from a
          long-lived progenitor system. The most popular progenitor model
          of  SHBs invokes the merger of either double neutron star (DNS)
          binaries  or  neutron  star-black  hole  (NS-BH)  systems. Such
          events  produce  strong  gravitational waves (GWs) at frequency
          range   that  is  accessible  to  current  and  next-generation
          ground-based  GW  observatories.  In  this  work we combine the
          census of SHB observations with refined theoretical analysis to
          critically  evaluate  the  compact  binary progenitor model. We
          then explore the implications for GW detection of these events.
          Beginning  from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic
          time,  we  consider  what  intrinsic  luminosity  and  lifetime
          distributions  can  reproduce  both the known SHB redshifts and
          luminosities, and the peak flux distribution of the large BATSE
          SHB  sample.  We  find  that (1) Short progenitor lifetimes, <3
          Gyr,  are ruled out, and lifetimes of about 6 Gyr favored. This
          result  is  difficult to reconcile with the observed properties
          of  the  DNS  population  in  our  galaxy. We show that for DNS
          systems to remain viable SHB progenitors, a large population of
          old  undetectable  NS  binaries must be postulated. (2) We find
          that  the  local  rate  of SHBs is at least 10 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 and
          likely as high as 10^5 Gpc^-3 yr-1, significantly above earlier
          estimates.  (3)  We find that assuming that SHBs do result from
          compact   binaries,  either  through  the  old  DNS  population
          mentioned   above   or   from   NS-BH  mergers,  our  resulting
          predictions  for the LIGO event rate are extremely encouraging:
          several   detections   per  year  may  be  expected  at  design
          sensitivity,   and   the   first   coincident   observation  of
          electromagnetic  and  gravitational  radiation  from an SHB may
          well be made with current facilities.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          The  1<z<2 redshift window hosts the peak of the star formation
          and metal production rates. Studies of the metal content of the
          star  forming  galaxies  at these epochs are however sparse. We
          report  VLT-ISAAC  near-infrared  spectroscopy  for a sample of
          five  [OII]-selected, M_B,AB<-21.5, z~1.4 galaxies, by which we
          measured  Hbeta and [OIII]5007 emission line fluxes from J-band
          spectra, and Halpha line fluxes plus upper limits for [NII]6584
          fluxes   from   H-band   spectra.   The   z~1.4   galaxies  are
          characterized   by  the  high  [OIII]/[OII]  line  ratios,  low
          extinction  and  low  metallicity  that  are  typical  of lower
          luminosity  CADIS  galaxies  at 0.4<z<0.7, and of more luminous
          Lyman  Break  Galaxies at z~3, but not seen in CFRS galaxies at
          0.4<z<0.9.  This  type of spectrum (e.g., high [OIII]/[OII]) is
          seen  in  progressively  more luminous galaxies as the redshift
          increases.  These  spectra  are caused by a combination of high
          ionisation  parameter  q  and  lower  [O/H].  Pegase2  chemical
          evolution  models are used to relate the observed metallicities
          and  luminosities  of z~1.4 galaxies to galaxy samples at lower
          and  higher redshift. Not surpringsingly, we see a relationship
          between redshift and inferred chemical age. We suppose that the
          metal-enriched  reservoirs  of  star  forming  gas  that we are
          probing  at intermediate redshifts are being mostly consumed to
          build  up  both  the  disk  and  the bulge components of spiral
          galaxies.  Finally,  our analysis of the metallicity-luminosity
          relation  at 0<z<1.5 suggests that the period of rapid chemical
          evolution may take place progressively in lower mass systems as
          the   universe  ages.  These  results  are  consistent  with  a
          ``downsizing''  type  picture  in  the  sense  that  particular
          signatures  (e.g.,  high [OIII]/[OII] or low [O/H]) are seen in
          progressively   more   luminous  (massive)  systems  at  higher
          redshifts.

          Title: The Initial Mass Function as given by the fragmentation

          Journal-ref: Astronomische Nachrichten (2005), 326,754
          The  dichotomy  between  a  universal mass function (IMF) and a
          variable   IMF  which  depends  on  local  physical  parameters
          characterises  observational and theoretical stellar astronomy.
          In this contribution the available distributions of probability
          are briefly reviewed. The physical nature of two of them, gamma
          variate  and lognormal, is then explained once the framework of
          the  fragmentation  is introduced. Interpolating techniques are
          then  applied  to the sample of the first 10 pc and to the open
          cluster  NGC6649: in both cases lognormal distribution produces
          the  best  fit.  The  three  power  law  function has also been
          investigated   and   visual  comparison  with  an  artificially
          generated  sample  of 100000 stars suggests that the variations
          in  the  spectral  index  are simply due to the small number of
          stars available in the observational sample. In order to derive
          the  sample  of masses, a new formula that allows us to express
          the  mass as a function of the absolute magnitude and (B-V) for
          MAIN V, GIANTS III and SUPERGIANTS I is derived.

          clouds

          Observations", Leuven, Belgium, September 12-16, 2005
          The  most  geoeffective  solar  drivers are magnetic clouds - a
          subclass of coronal mass ejections (CME's) distinguished by the
          smooth rotation of the magnetic field inside the structure. The
          portion of CME's that are magnetic clouds is maximum at sunspot
          minimum  and  mimimum  at  sunspot  maximum.  This  portion  is
          determined  by  the  amount  of  helicity carried away by CME's
          which  in  turn  depends  on the amount of helicity transferred
          from  the  solar  interior  to  the surface, and on the surface
          differential  rotation.  The  latter can increase or reduce, or
          even  reverse  the  twist of emerging magnetic flux tubes, thus
          increasing  or  reducing the helicity in the corona, or leading
          to   the   violation   of   the   hemispheric   helicity  rule,
          respectively.  We  investigate  the  CME's  associated with the
          major  geomagnetic  storms  in the last solar cycle whose solar
          sources  have  been  identified,  and find that in 10 out of 12
          cases  of  violation  of  the  hemispheric  helicity rule or of
          highly geoeffective CME's with no magnetic field rotation, they
          originate  from  regions  with  "anti-solar"  type  of  surface
          differential rotation.

          We review the main properties, demographics and applications of
          binary  and  millisecond  radio pulsars. Our knowledge of these
          exciting  objects has greatly increased in recent years, mainly
          due  to  successful surveys which have brought the known pulsar
          population   to   over  1700.  There  are  now  80  binary  and
          millisecond pulsars associated with the disk of our Galaxy, and
          a  further 103 pulsars in 24 of the Galactic globular clusters.
          Recent  highlights  have  been  the discovery of the first ever
          double  pulsar  system  and  a  recent flurry of discoveries in
          globular clusters, in particular Terzan 5.

          Title: Can brane dark energy model be probed observationally by
          distant supernovae?
          Authors: Marek Szydlowski, Wlodzimierz Godlowski
          Comments: 14 pages 7 figures
          The  recent  astronomical measurements of distant supernovae as
          well  as  other  observations  indicate  that  our  universe is
          presently  accelerating.  There are different proposals for the
          explanation  of  this  acceleration.  Most  of  these proposals
          require  the  existence of exotic matter with negative pressure
          violating the strong energy condition. On the other hand, there
          have  appeared  many  models which offer dramatically different
          mechanism  for  the  current acceleration, in which dark energy
          emerges  from  the  gravity  sector rather than from the matter
          sector.  In this paper, we compare the concordance $\Lambda$CDM
          model with the braneworld models of dark energy by using Akaike
          and  Bayesian  informative critera. We show that, although this
          model  has  extra  parameters (the fundamental constants of the
          bulk  space)  resulting  in  an  improved fit to the SNIa data,
          these new parameters are actually not important for description
          of   present  acceleration  epoch.  With  the  example  of  the
          Sahni--Shtanov    braneworld    model    \cite{Shtanov03},   we
          demonstrate  that,  although  this  model has better fit to the
          SNIa data than $\Lambda$CDM model, the information criterion of
          model selection prefers the $\Lambda$CDM model. This is because
          the informative criteria of model selection compensate for this
          advantage  by penalizing models having more free parameters. We
          conclude  that  only new future observational data are powerful
          enough  to  give  advantage to dark-energy models of braneworld
          origin, i.e., a very high-significance detection is required to
          justify the presence of new parameters.

          Title:  Weak  redshift  discretisation  in  the  Local Group of

          We  discuss  the  distribution of radial velocities of galaxies
          belonging  to  the  Local  Group.  Two  independent  samples of
          galaxies  as  well  as  several  methods  of reduction from the
          heliocentric   to  the  galactocentric  radial  velocities  are
          explored. We applied the power spectrum analysis using the Hann
          function  as  a  weighting  method, together with the jackknife
          error  estimation.  We  performed  a  detailed analysis of this
          approach.  The  distribution  of  galaxy  redshifts seems to be
          non-random.  An  excess  of  galaxies with radial velocities of
          $\sim 24 {km} \cdot {s}^{-1}$ and $\sim 36 {km} \cdot {s}^{-1}$
          is  detected,  but  the  effect is statistically weak. Only one
          peak  for  radial  velocities  of $\sim 24 {km} \cdot {s}^{-1}$
          seems to be confirmed at the confidence level of 95%.

          We  present  7  mm and 3.5 cm wavelength continuum observations
          toward  the  Herbig  AeBe star HD169142 performed with the Very
          Large  Array  (VLA)  with an angular resolution of ~1". We find
          that this object exhibits strong (~4.4 mJy), unresolved (~1") 7
          mm  continuum  emission,  being  one  of the brightest isolated
          Herbig   AeBe   stars  ever  detected  with  the  VLA  at  this
          wavelength. No emission is detected at 3.5 cm continuum, with a
          3  sigma upper limit of ~0.08 mJy. From these values, we obtain
          a  spectral  index  of  ~2.5  in  the 3.5 cm to 7 mm wavelength
          range, indicating that the observed flux density at 7mm is most
          likely  dominated  by  thermal  dust  emission  coming  from  a
          circumstellar  disc. We use available photometric data from the
          literature  to  model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
          this  object  from  radio  to near-ultraviolet frequencies. The
          observed  SED  can  be  understood  in  terms  of an irradiated
          accretion  disc  with  low  mass  accretion rate, 10^{-8} solar
          masses  per year, surrounding a star with an age of ~10 Myr. We
          infer  that  the mass of the disc is ~0.04 solar masses, and is
          populated by dust grains that have grown to a maximum size of 1
          mm everywhere, consistent with the lack of silicate emission at
          10  microns. These features, as well as indications of settling
          in the wall at the dust destruction radius, led us to speculate
          the disc of HD169142 is in an advanced stage of dust evolution,
          particularly in its inner regions.

          In this paper another class of Dark Matter candidate particles:
          the  pseudoscalar  and  scalar  light  bosonic  candidates,  is
          discussed.  Particular  care  is  devoted  to  the study of the
          processes  for  their  detection (which only involves electrons
          and  photons/X-rays)  in  a  suitable  underground experimental
          set-up.  For this purpose the needed calculations are developed
          and  various related aspects and phenomenologies are discussed.
          In particular, it is shown that - in addition to the WIMP cases
          already  discussed  elsewhere - there is also possibility for a
          bosonic  candidate  to  account  for  the  6.3 sigma C.L. model
          independent   evidence  for  the  presence  of  a  particle  DM
          component  in  the  galactic halo observed by DAMA/NaI. Allowed
          regions in these scenarios are presented also paying particular
          care on the cosmological interest of the bosonic candidate.

          Title:  Central  energy  equipartition  in multi-mass models of
          globular clusters
          Authors: P. Miocchi (Universita' di Roma "La Sapienza", Dip. di
          Fisica, Rome, Italy)
          Comments:  LaTeX  2e,  9  pages  with  7  figures. Accepted for
          publication in MNRAS
          In   the  construction  of  multi-mass  King-Michie  models  of
          globular clusters, an approximated central energy equipartition
          between stars of different masses is usually imposed by scaling
          the  velocity  parameter  of each mass class inversely with the
          stellar  mass, as if the distribution function were isothermal.
          In  this  paper,  this 'isothermal approximation' (IA) has been
          checked and its consequences on the model parameters studied by
          a comparison with models including central energy equipartition
          correctly.  It  is found that, under the IA, the 'temperatures'
          of  a  pair of components can differ to a non-negligible amount
          for  low concentration distributions. It is also found that, in
          general,  this  approximation  leads to a significantly reduced
          mass  segregation in comparison with that given under the exact
          energy   equipartition  at  the  centre.  As  a  representative
          example,   an  isotropic  3-component  model  fitting  a  given
          projected   surface   brightness   and  line-of-sight  velocity
          dispersion profiles is discussed. In this example, the IA gives
          a    cluster   envelope   much   more   concentrated   (central
          dimensionless    potential   W=3.3)   than   under   the   true
          equipartition  (W=0.059),  as well as a higher logarithmic mass
          function  slope. As a consequence, the inferred total mass (and
          then the global mass-to-light ratio) results a factor 1.4 times
          lower  than  the  correct value and the amount of mass in heavy
          dark remnants is 3.3 times smaller. Under energy equipartition,
          the  fate  of  stars  having a mass below a certain limit is to
          escape  from the system. This limit is derived as a function of
          the mass and W of the giants and turn-off stars component.

          Title:  Astrometric  Light-Travel  Time signature of sources in
          nonlinear motion
          Authors: Guillem Anglada, Jordi Torra
          Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures
          Context:Very  precise  planned  space  astrometric missions and
          recent  improvements on imaging capabilities require a detailed
          review of the assumptions of classical astrometric modeling.
          Aims:We  show that Light-Travel Time must be taken into account
          to  model  the  kinematics of astronomical objects in nonlinear
          motion, even at stellar distances.
          Methods:A closed expression to include Light-Travel Time in the
          actual  astrometric  models  with nonlinear motion is provided.
          Using   a   perturbative   approach   the   expression  of  the
          Light-Travel  Time signature is derived. We propose a practical
          form  of the astrometric modelling to be applied in astrometric
          data reduction of sources at stellar distances($d>1 pc$).
          Results  :We  show  that  the  Light-Travel  Time  signature is
          relevant  at  $\muas$  accuracy (or even at $mas$) depending on
          the  time  span of the astrometric measurements. We explain how
          information  about  the  radial  motion  of  a  source  can  be
          obtained. Some estimative numbers are provided for known nearby
          binary systems
          Conclusions  :In the light of the obtained results, it is clear
          that  this  effect  must be taken into account to interpret any
          kind   of  precise  astrometric  measurements.  The  effect  is
          particularly  interesting  in  measurements  performed  by  the
          planned   astrometric   space  missions  (GAIA,  SIM,  JASMINE,
          TPF/DARWIN).  Finally  an  objective  criterion  is provided to
          quickly  evaluate  whether  the  Light-Travel  Time modeling is
          required for a given source or system.

          Title:  Influence of gravity waves on the internal rotation and
          Li abundance of solar-type stars
          Authors: Corinne Charbonnel, Suzanne Talon
          Comments:  Published  in Science, Vol.309, p.2189, 30 September
          2005. pdf only
          The  Sun's  rotation  profile  and  lithium  content  have been
          difficult  to  understand in the context of conventional models
          of  stellar  evolution. Classical hydrodynamical models predict
          that  the  solar interior must rotate highly differentially, in
          disagreement with observations. It has recently been shown that
          internal  waves  produced  by  convection  in  solar-type stars
          produce  an  asymmetric,  shear  layer  oscillation, similar to
          Earth's  quasi-biennial  oscillation,  that  leads to efficient
          angular  momentum redistribution from the core to the envelope.
          We  presents  results  of  a model that successfully reproduces
          both  the rotation profile and the surface abundance of lithium
          in solar-type stars of various ages.

          The   low   background,   good  spatial  resolution  and  great
          sensitivity  of  the  EPIC-pn  camera on XMM-Newton give useful
          limits  for  the  detection of extended sources even during the

          we  attempt  to illustrate the potential of the XMM-Newton slew
          survey as a tool for analysing flux-limited samples of clusters
          of  galaxies  and  other  sources  of  spatially extended X-ray
          emission.

          The  Global  mm-VLBI  Array  is at present the most sensitive 3
          mm-VLBI   interferometer  and  provides  images  of  up  to  40
          micro-arcsecond resolution. Using this array, we have monitored
          the rotation of the innermost jet in the quasar NRAO 150, which
          shows an angular speed of ~ 7 deg./yr. Future 3 mm arrays could
          include  additional  stations  like ALMA, GBT, LMT, CARMA, SRT,
          Yebes,  Nobeyama  and  Noto,  which would allow to push VLBI at
          this   wavelength  to  sensitivity  and  image  quality  levels
          comparable  to those of present VLBI at centimeter wavelengths.
          This  would  improve our knowledge of the accretion systems and
          the  magneto-hydrodynamics  of  the  innermost  jets in AGN and
          microquasars.

          velocity: possible links with Be and B[e] stars

          Comments: 11 pages, 13 figures, Stars with the B[e] phenomenon,
          M. Kraus and A. Miroshnichenko, ASP Conference Series, in press
          Using  single  star  models  including the effects of shellular
          rotation with and without magnetic fields, we show that massive
          stars at solar metallicity with initial masses lower than about
          20-25  M$_\odot$  and with an initial rotation above $\sim 350$
          km  s$^{-1}$  likely  reach  the critical velocity during their
          Main-Sequence  phase.  This results from the efficient outwards
          transport  of  angular  momentum by the meridional circulation.
          This could be a scenario for explaining the Be stars. After the
          Main-Sequence  phase,  single star in this mass range can again
          reach  the  critical limit when they are on a blue loop after a
          red supergiant phase \citep{HL98}. This might be a scenario for
          the  formation  of B[e] stars, however as discussed by Langer &
          Heger  (1998),  this  scenario would predict a short B[e] phase
          (only  some 10$^4$ years) with correspondingly small amounts of
          mass lost.

          We  present the spectral and temporal analysis of the 2004/2005
          outburst  of  the  transient  X-ray pulsar V0332+53 as observed
          with  Integral. After the discovery of the third cyclotron line
          in  phase averaged spectra (Kreykenbohm et al 2005, Pottschmidt
          et   al  2005),  detailed  pulse  phase  spectroscopy  revealed
          remarkably  little  variability  of the cyclotron lines through
          the  4.4s  X-ray  pulse  (Pottschmidt  et  al 2005). During the
          decline  of  the  outburst,  the  flux  was  observed  to decay
          exponentially  until  2005  Feb 10 and linearly thereafter. The
          spectrum  was  found  to  become  harder  with  time, while the
          folding energy remained constant. The energy of the fundamental
          cyclotron  line  increased  with  time from 26.5kev in the RXTE
          observation  up  to 29.5kev in the last Integral one indicating
          that the emission region is moving closer to the surface of the
          neutron  star.  For  a  detailed  analysis,  see  Mowlavi et al

          of classical GRBs, whereas the peak energy is lower by a factor
          of  4  for  the  XRRs/XRFs.  We  study  the  optical  and X-Ray
          afterglow  properties  of  the  XRRs/XRFs;  in  particular  XRR
          011030. We find that the X-ray and optical flux distribution of
          the  XRRs/XRFs  sample,  observed 40 ks from burst trigger, are
          consistent  with those of classical GRBs. We find also that the
          XRRs/XRFs  lightcurves  seems to be similar to the GRB ones. In
          addition,  they  never  show  a  rising slope at early time. We
          compare  this  result  with  the  afterglow  predictions of two
          models : the high redshift scenario, and the off-axis scenario.
          In  this last framework, we consider jets with a homogeneous, a
          -2   power-law   shaped   and  a  Gaussian  luminosity  angular
          distribution.  We  find  that  the  high  redshift scenario can
          explain  some events but not the total sample of XRRs/XRFs. The
          off-axis model may be consistent with our foundings only when a
          power-law   shaped   jet  is  considered.  However,  given  the
          uncertainties  on  the  selection  effects  in  our sample, the
          Gaussian  jet  viewed  at  small  angles from the Gaussian core
          cannot  be  ruled  out.  On the contrary, our analysis strongly
          disfavored a homogeneous jet seen off-axis.

          Title: X-ray populations in galaxies
          Authors: G. Fabbiano
          Comments:  This  is  a  review  talk,to  be  published  in  the
          proceedings  of  the  IAU  Symposium  230,  Populations of high
          energy  sources  in  galaxies, held in Dublin (Ireland), August
          15-19, 2005
          Today's  sensistive, high resolution Chandra X-ray observations
          allow  the  study  of  many  populations  of X-ray sources. The
          traditional  astronomical  tools  of  photometric  diagrams and
          luminosity  functions are now applied to these populations, and
          provide the means for classifying the X-ray sources and probing
          their  evolution.  While overall stellar mass drives the amount
          of  X-ray  binaries  in  old  stellar population, the amount of
          sources  in  star-forming  galaxies  is  related  to  the  star
          formation  rate.  Shart-lived,  luminous,  high  mass  binaries
          (HNXBs) dominate these young populations.

          Title: Collective Neutrino Flavor Transformation In Supernovae
          Authors:   Huaiyu   Duan   (UCSD),  George  M.  Fuller  (UCSD),
          Yong-Zhong Qian (UMN)
          Comments: 16 pages, 9 figures
          We   examine   the  coherent  active-active  channel  nonlinear
          neutrino  flavor  evolution  in  the post-core-bounce supernova
          environment. We improve on the previous spin precession analogy
          to  neutrino  oscillation,  and propose the concept of neutrino
          flavor isospin, which treats neutrinos and anti-neutrinos on an
          equal  footing.  We  point  out  a  key conserved quantity, the
          "total  effective energy". This conservation condition suggests
          a  simple explanation for previous numerical results. We employ
          a  co-rotating  frame  in  the  spin precession picture to gain
          physical  insights into the collective behaviors of this system
          when  neutrino-neutrino  forward  scattering dominates the weak
          potentials which govern flavor conversion. We also use the spin
          precession analogy to analyze previously-derived limits for the
          behavior  of supernova neutrinos, e.g., the Background Dominant
          Solution, and we speculate on how such solutions could arise in
          realistic supernova environments.

          Title: Investigating Galaxy Evolution with Chandra
          Authors: G. Fabbiano
          Comments:  To  be  included  in  the  proceedings of the 'X-ray
          universe  2005  meeting'  held  in  San  Lorenzo de El Escorial
          (Spain), 26-30 Sep 2005
          Chandra  observations show the importance of the X-ray band for
          studying the evolution of galaxies. Binary X-ray sources are an
          easily  detectable  tracer  of  the stellar population. Chandra
          studies  of  these  populations are giving us insights into the
          nature  and  formation of these binaries, and provide the basis
          for   diagnostics   of   galaxy  evolution.  With  Chandra  and
          XMM-Newton  we  can  explore relatively poorly known aspects of
          the black hole population of the universe: ultra-luminous X-ray
          sources,  that may be connected with the 'missing' intermediate
          mass  black  holes  predicted  by hierarchical galaxy and black
          hole  formation  scenarios;  and quiescent supermassive nuclear
          black  holes and their surroundings, as a way to understand the
          full  range  of  the  AGN  phenomenon.  Finally, the X-ray band
          provides  the  only  way  to  explore  hot plasmas in galaxies;
          recent  observations  are  revealing  the  importance  of these
          plasmas as vehicles of both chemical enrichment and energy.

          Comments: 4 pages, 3 ps figures
          Nearby  sources  of cosmic rays up to a ZeV(=10^21 eV) could be
          observed  with  a  multi-messenger approach including secondary
          gamma-rays  and  neutrinos.  If cosmic rays above ~10^18 eV are
          produced  in  magnetized  environments such as galaxy clusters,
          the  flux  of secondary gamma-rays below ~1 TeV can be enhanced
          up  to  several  orders  of magnitudes compared to unmagnetized
          sources. A particular source of enhancement are synchrotron and
          cascade  photons  from  e^+e^-  pairs  produced by protons from
          sources with relatively steep injection spectra proportional to
          E^-2.6.  Such  sources  should  be  visible at the same time in
          ultra-high   energy   cosmic   ray  experiments  and  gamma-ray
          telescopes.

          Comments:  2  pages,  2  figures,  ULMSF Workshop, accepted for
          publication in Astron. Nachrichten
          We  present  results  of  an optical and near-infrared (IR) 1.8
          deg^2  survey  in  the  Pleiades  open  cluster  to  search for
          substellar  objects.  From  optical I-band images from the CFHT
          and J-band images from the 3.5 m CAHA Telescope, we identify 18
          faint  and  very red L brown dwarf candidates, with I> 20.9 and
          I-J>  3.2. The follow-up observations of nine objects in the H-
          and  Ks-bands  confirm  that eight belong to the IR sequence of
          the  cluster  and  the  proper  motion  measurements  of  seven
          candidates   confirm   that   they   are  Pleiades  members.  A
          preliminary estimation of the substellar mass spectrum dN/dM in
          the  form of a power law M^-alpha provides alpha=0.57+-0.14. We
          extrapolate  this  function  to  estimate  the  number  of very
          low-mass  brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects that could be
          present  in  the  cluster  down  to 1 M_Jup. Sensitive searches
          combining  far  red  and  near infrared observations may unveal
          these objects in a near future.

          Title:  Size  and Properties of the NLR in the Seyfert-2 Galaxy

          Komossa  (MPE Garching), Martin Haas (Univ. Bochum), Rolf Chini
          (Univ. Bochum)
          Comments: 14 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          We  study  the narrow-line region (NLR) of the Seyfert-2 galaxy
          NGC 1386 by means of long-slit spectroscopy obtained with FORS1
          at  the  VLT.  We  use  the  galaxy  itself for subtracting the
          stellar  template,  applying  reddening  corrections to fit the
          stellar  template to the spectra of the NLR. The continuum gets
          steadily  redder  towards the nucleus. The spatial distribution
          of the reddening derived from the Balmer decrement differs from
          the  continuum reddening, indicating dust within the NLR with a
          varying column density along the line of sight. Using spatially
          resolved  spectral  diagnostics,  we  find a transition between
          central  line ratios falling into the AGN regime and outer ones
          in  the  HII-region  regime,  occuring at a radius of ~6 arcsec
          (310  pc)  in  all  three  diagnostic diagrams. Applying CLOUDY
          photoionisation  models,  we show that the observed distinction
          between  HII-like  and AGN-like ratios in NGC 1386 represents a
          true difference in ionisation source and cannot be explained by
          variations of physical parameters such as ionisation parameter,
          electron  density  or  metallicity.  We  interpret it as a real
          border  between  the  NLR,  i.e.  the  central AGN-photoionised
          region   and   surrounding   HII  regions.  We  derive  surface
          brightness,  electron  density,  and  ionisation parameter as a
          function  of  distance  from  the  nucleus.  Both  the electron
          density  and  the ionisation parameter decrease with radius. We
          discuss   the   consequences  of  these  observations  for  the
          interpretation  of  the empirical NLR size-luminosity relation.
          In  the  outer  part  of  the NLR, we find evidence for shocks,
          resulting  in  a  secondary  peak  of  the electron-density and
          ionisation-parameter  distribution  north  of  the  nucleus. We
          compare the NLR velocity curve with the stellar one and discuss
          the differences.

          Title: [OIII] profile substructure in radio-quiet quasars
          Authors:  Christian  Leipski  (Univ.  Bochum),  Nicola  Bennert
          (Univ. Bochum)
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Interactions  between the radio jet and the optical emission of
          the  narrow-line  region  (NLR)  are a well known phenomenon in
          Seyfert  galaxies.  Here,  we  present  the  study  of possible
          jet-NLR interactions in five radio-quiet PG quasars with double
          or triple radio structure. High spatial and spectral resolution
          observations   were   carried   out   in  the  Hbeta-[OIII]5007
          wavelength  range.  In  all cases, there is evidence for [OIII]
          profile    substructure   (shoulders,   subpeaks,   blueshifted
          ''broad''  components)  with  different clarity. To measure the
          velocity,  line  width, intensity, and location of these [OIII]
          components,   several   Gaussians   were   fitted.  Often,  the
          substructures  are  more  pronounced  close to the radio lobes,
          suggestive  of  jet-NLR  interactions. Our observations support
          the unification scheme in which radio-quiet quasars are assumed
          to be the luminous cousins of Seyfert galaxies.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in PASP
          We  present  optical  spectra  of  a  flare  on Barnard's star.
          Several  photospheric  as  well  as  chromospheric species were
          enhanced  by the flare heating. An analysis of the Balmer lines
          shows  that their shapes are best explained by Stark broadening
          rather   than  chromospheric  mass  motions.  We  estimate  the
          temperature of the flaring region in the lower atmosphere to be
          >8000  K and the electron density to be ~10^14 cm^{-3}, similar
          to  values  observed in other dM flares. Because Barnard's star
          is  considered  to  be  one of our oldest neighbors, a flare of
          this magnitude is probably quite rare.

          Comments:   27   pages,  7  figures,  2  tables;  Accepted  for
          publication in AJ
          In  order  to  examine  the  relative  importance  of  powerful
          starbursts and Compton-thick AGNs in NGC 6240, we have obtained
          mid-infrared  images  and  low-resolution spectra of the galaxy
          with   sub-arcsecond   spatial   resolution   using   the  Keck
          Telescopes.  Despite  the  high spatial resolution (~200 pc) of
          our  data, no signature of the hidden AGNs has been detected in
          the  mid-infrared. The southern nucleus, which we show provides
          80-90%  of  the  total  8-25 um luminosity of the system, has a
          mid-infrared  spectrum  and a mid-/far-infrared spectral energy
          distribution  consistent  with  starbursts.  At  the same time,
          however,  it  is  also  possible  to attribute up to 60% of the
          bolometric   luminosity   to  an  AGN,  consistent  with  X-ray
          observations,  if  the AGN is heavily obscured and emits mostly
          in   the   far-infrared.  This  ambiguity  arises  because  the
          intrinsic   variation   of  properties  among  a  given  galaxy
          population (e.g., starbursts) introduces at least a factor of a
          few   uncertainty  even  into  the  most  robust  AGN-starburst
          diagnostics.  We  conclude that with present observations it is
          not possible to determine the dominant power source in galaxies
          when  AGN  and  starburst luminosities are within a factor of a
          few of each other.

          http URL
          The  spectral energy distribution of the dark cloud LDN1622, as
          measured  by  Finkbeiner using WMAP data, drops above 30GHz and
          is   suggestive   of  a  Boltzmann  cutoff  in  grain  rotation
          frequencies, characteristic of spinning dust emission.
          LDN1622 is conspicuous in the 31 GHz image we obtained with the
          Cosmic  Background  Imager, which is the first cm-wave resolved
          image  of a dark cloud. The 31GHz emission follows the emission
          traced by the four IRAS bands. The normalised cross-correlation
          of  the 31 GHz image with the IRAS images is higher by 6.6sigma
          for  the 12um and 25um bands than for the 60um and 100um bands:
          C(12+25) = 0.76+/-0.02 and C(60+100) = 0.64+/-0.01.
          The  mid-IR  -- cm-wave correlation in LDN 1622 is evidence for
          very small grain (VSG) or continuum emission at 26-36GHz from a
          hot  molecular phase. In dark clouds and their photon-dominated
          regions  (PDRs)  the  12um  and  25um emission is attributed to
          stochastic  heating  of  the  VSGs. The mid-IR and cm-wave dust
          emissions  arise in a limb-brightened shell coincident with the
          PDR  of  LDN1622,  where the incident UV radiation from the Ori
          OB1b  association heats and charges the grains, as required for
          spinning dust.

          Title: Scalar-Tensor Gravitation and Cosmic Acceleration
          Authors: Sanil Unnikrishnan, T.R.Seshadri
          Comments: 9 pages, 2 figures, Submitted to Physics Letters B
          In  this  paper  we consider a model in which the gravitational
          ``constant''  $G$  is  determined by a tachyon-like field whose
          Lagrangian is of the form $\mathcal{L}_{\phi} = -V(\phi)\sqrt{1
          -  \partial_{\mu}\phi\partial^{\mu}\phi}$  and the potential is
          of  the  form  $  V(\phi)  =  \lambda \phi ^{-4}$. We study the
          cosmological consequence of this theory in the matter dominated
          era  and  show  that this leads to a transition from an initial
          decelerated  expansion to an accelerated expansion phase at the
          present epoch.

          is  interpreted  as  a  Quintessence field. Instead of that, in
          this  letter we interpret the dilaton as the dark matter of the
          universe.  With this alternative interpretation we find that in
          this  supergravity  model  the  dilaton  dominates the universe
          before  recombination.  We  also  show  that  the model gives a
          similar  evolution  and  structure  formation  of  the universe
          compared  with  the  $\Lambda$CDM model in the linear regime of
          fluctuations  of  the structure formation. Some free parameters
          of   the  theory  are  fixed  using  the  present  cosmological
          observations.   In   the  non-linear  regimen  there  are  some
          differences  between  the type IIB supergravity theory with the
          traditional  CDM paradigm. The supergravity theory predicts the
          formation  of  galaxies  earlier  than  the CDM and there is no
          density  cusp  in the center of galaxies. These differences can
          distinguish  both  models and can give a distinctive feature to
          the  phenomenology  of  the  cosmology  coming from superstring
          theory with fluxes.

          Title:  Three-Body  Kick  to  a Bright Quasar out of Its Galaxy
          During a Merger
          Authors: Loren Hoffman, Abraham Loeb (Harvard U.)
          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Nature
          The  quasar HE0450-2958 was recently discovered to reside ~7kpc
          away  from  a  galaxy  that  was  likely  disturbed by a recent
          merger.  The  lack  of  a  massive spheroid of stars around the
          quasar  raised  the unlikely suggestion that it may have formed
          in  a  dark galaxy. Here we explain this discovery as a natural
          consequence  of  a  dynamical kick imparted to the quasar as it
          interacted  with  a  binary  black  hole system during a galaxy
          merger  event.  The  typical stalling radius (~1pc) for a ~10^9
          solar  mass binary provides a kick of order the escape velocity
          of  the stellar spheroid, bringing the quasar out to around the
          observed radius before it turns around. This is consistent with
          the  observed  low relative velocity between the quasar and the
          merger-remnant  galaxy.  The  gas  carried  with the black hole
          throughout  the three-body interaction fuels the quasar for the
          duration of its journey, ~2x10^7 years. Gravitational radiation
          recoil could not have produced the required kick.

          Title:  Possible  evidence  for  the ejection of a supermassive
          black hole from an ongoing merger of galaxies
          Authors:  Martin  G.  Haehnelt  (IoA), Melvyn B. Davies (Lund),
          Martin J. Rees (IoA)
          Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX, no figures; MNRAS in press
          Attempts  of  Magain  et al (2005) to detect the host galaxy of
          the  bright  QSO  HE0450--2958  have  not  been  successful. We
          suggest  that  the supermassive black hole powering the QSO was
          ejected from the observed ULIRG at the same redshift and at 1.5
          arcsec distance. Ejection could have either be caused by recoil
          due  to gravitational wave emission from a coalescing binary of
          supermassive  black  holes  or  the  gravitational slingshot of
          three or more supermassive black holes in the ongoing merger of
          galaxies  which  triggered the starburst activity in the ULIRG.
          We  discuss implications for the possible hierarchical build-up
          of  supermassive  black  holes from intermediate and/or stellar
          mass   black   holes,  and  for  the  detection  of  coalescing
          supermassive binary black holes by LISA.

          Title: Investigating Galaxy Evolution with Chandra
          Authors: G. Fabbiano
          Comments:  To  be  included  in  the  proceedings of the 'X-ray
          universe  2005  meeting'  held  in  San  Lorenzo de El Escorial
          (Spain), 26-30 Sep 2005
          Chandra  observations show the importance of the X-ray band for
          studying the evolution of galaxies. Binary X-ray sources are an
          easily  detectable  tracer  of  the stellar population. Chandra
          studies  of  these  populations are giving us insights into the
          nature  and  formation of these binaries, and provide the basis
          for   diagnostics   of   galaxy  evolution.  With  Chandra  and
          XMM-Newton  we  can  explore relatively poorly known aspects of
          the black hole population of the universe: ultra-luminous X-ray
          sources,  that may be connected with the 'missing' intermediate
          mass  black  holes  predicted  by hierarchical galaxy and black
          hole  formation  scenarios;  and quiescent supermassive nuclear
          black  holes and their surroundings, as a way to understand the
          full  range  of  the  AGN  phenomenon.  Finally, the X-ray band
          provides  the  only  way  to  explore  hot plasmas in galaxies;
          recent  observations  are  revealing  the  importance  of these
          plasmas as vehicles of both chemical enrichment and energy.

          mm-VLBI   interferometer  and  provides  images  of  up  to  40
          micro-arcsecond resolution. Using this array, we have monitored
          the rotation of the innermost jet in the quasar NRAO 150, which
          shows an angular speed of ~ 7 deg./yr. Future 3 mm arrays could
          include  additional  stations  like ALMA, GBT, LMT, CARMA, SRT,
          Yebes,  Nobeyama  and  Noto,  which would allow to push VLBI at
          this   wavelength  to  sensitivity  and  image  quality  levels
          comparable  to those of present VLBI at centimeter wavelengths.
          This  would  improve our knowledge of the accretion systems and
          the  magneto-hydrodynamics  of  the  innermost  jets in AGN and
          microquasars.

          Title: [OIII] profile substructure in radio-quiet quasars
          Authors:  Christian  Leipski  (Univ.  Bochum),  Nicola  Bennert
          (Univ. Bochum)
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Interactions  between the radio jet and the optical emission of
          the  narrow-line  region  (NLR)  are a well known phenomenon in
          Seyfert  galaxies.  Here,  we  present  the  study  of possible
          jet-NLR interactions in five radio-quiet PG quasars with double
          or triple radio structure. High spatial and spectral resolution
          observations   were   carried   out   in  the  Hbeta-[OIII]5007
          wavelength  range.  In  all cases, there is evidence for [OIII]
          profile    substructure   (shoulders,   subpeaks,   blueshifted
          ''broad''  components)  with  different clarity. To measure the
          velocity,  line  width, intensity, and location of these [OIII]
          components,   several   Gaussians   were   fitted.  Often,  the
          substructures  are  more  pronounced  close to the radio lobes,
          suggestive  of  jet-NLR  interactions. Our observations support
          the unification scheme in which radio-quiet quasars are assumed
          to be the luminous cousins of Seyfert galaxies.

          Title: Cosmic infrared background and early stellar populations
          Authors: A. Kashlinsky
          Comments:  Invited  review  to  appear in proceedings of Irvine
          workshop  "First  light  and reionization", eds. E. Barton & A.
          Cooray. New Astronomy Reviews, in press
          Cosmic  infrared  background  (CIB)  contains information about
          galaxy luminosities over the entire history of the Universe and
          can be a powerful diagnostic of the early populations otherwise
          inaccessible  to  telescopic studies. Its measurements are very
          difficult  because  of the strong IR foregrounds from the Solar
          system   and   the  Galaxy.  Nevertheless,  substantial  recent
          progress  in measuring the CIB and its structure has been made.
          The  measurements  now  allow to set significant constraints on
          early  galaxy  evolution  and, perhaps, even detect the elusive
          Population  III  era.  We discuss briefly the theory behind the
          CIB,  review  the  latest  measurements  of  the  CIB  and  its
          structure,  and discuss their implications for detecting and/or
          constraining the first stars and their epochs.

          Magain  et al. (2005) argued that the host galaxy of the quasar
          in HE0450-2958 is substantially under-luminous given the likely
          mass  of  its nuclear black hole. Using kinematical information
          from  the  spectra  of  the quasar and the companion galaxy, an
          ultra-luminous infrared galaxy, we test the hypothesis that the
          black  hole  powering the quasar was ejected from the companion
          galaxy  during a merger. We find that the ejection model can be
          securely  ruled out, since the kick velocity required to remove
          the  black hole from the galaxy is greater than about 500 km/s,
          inconsistent  with  the presence of narrow emission line gas at
          the  same redshift as the quasar nucleus. We also show that the
          quasar  in  HE0450-2958  has  the spectral characteristics of a
          narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy and calculate a mass for its black
          hole  that  is  roughly  an  order  of  magnitude  smaller than
          estimated by Magain et al. The predicted luminosity of the host
          galaxy  is  then  consistent  with the upper limits inferred by
          those authors.

          Title:  High-resolution  Millimeter  Imaging  of  Submillimeter
          Galaxies

          We present sub-arcsecond resolution IRAM PdBI interferometry of
          eight  submillimeter galaxies at redshifts from 2 to 3.4, where
          we  detect  continuum at 1mm and/or CO lines at 3 and 1 mm. The
          CO   3-2/4-3   line   profiles  in  five  of  the  sources  are
          double-peaked,  indicative of orbital motion either in a single
          rotating  disk  or  of a merger of two galaxies. The millimeter
          line  and  continuum emission is compact; we marginally resolve
          the  sources  or  obtain  tight upper limits to their intrinsic
          sizes  in all cases. The median FWHM diameter for these sources
          and   the  previously  resolved  sources,  SMMJ023952-0136  and
          SMMJ140104+0252  is  less  than  or  equal to 0.5" (4 kpc). The
          compactness  of  the  sources does not support a scenario where
          the far-IR/submm emission comes from a cold, very extended dust
          distribution.   These   measurements   clearly  show  that  the
          submillimeter  galaxies we have observed resemble scaled-up and
          more  gas  rich  versions of the local Universe, ultra-luminous
          galaxy   (ULIRG)   population.   Their  central  densities  and
          potential  well  depths are much greater than in other redshift
          2-3 galaxy samples studied so far. They are comparable to those
          of  elliptical  galaxies  or massive bulges. The SMG properties
          fulfill  the criteria of 'maximal' starbursts, in which most of
          the available initial gas reservoir of 10^10-10^11 solar masses
          is converted to stars on a few dynamical timescales.

          Title: The broken hierarchy of galaxy formation

          Comments: 10 pages, 6 colour figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of
          the  stellar  mass  of  bright  galaxies was already in place at
          $z>1$.  This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation
          because   massive  halos  are  assembled  late  in  hierarchical
          cosmologies  such  as  cold dark matter (CDM). In this paper, we
          discuss  a  new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model
          in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed
          to  quench  cooling  flows  in  massive  halos.  This  mechanism
          naturally  creates  a  break  in  the  local  galaxy  luminosity
          function  at  bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within
          the  Millennium  N-body  simulation;  the  accurate  dark matter
          merger  trees  and  large  number  of realizations of the galaxy
          formation process that the simulation provides results in highly
          accurate  statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical
          parameters  in the model by reference to the properties of local
          galaxies,  we  use it to investigate the evolution of the K-band
          luminosity  and galaxy stellar mass functions. We also calculate
          the  volume averaged star formation rate density of the Universe
          as  a  function  of  redshift  and  the  way  in  which  this is
          apportioned  amongst  galaxies  of  different  mass.  The  model
          robustly  predicts  a substantial population of massive galaxies
          out  to  redshift  $z\sim  5$  and a star formation rate density
          which  rises  with increasing redshift in objects of all masses.
          Although  observational data on these properties have been cited
          as  evidence for ``anti-hierarchical'' galaxy formation, we find
          that  when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally
          hierachical  CDM  model  provides  a  very  good  match to these
          observations.

          Title:  A  method  to  search  for topological signatures in the
          angular distribution of cosmic objects
          Authors: Armando Bernui, Thyrso Villela
          Comments: 11 pages, 18 figures. To appear in A&A
          We   present   a   method  to  search  for  large  angular-scale
          correlations,  termed  topological  signatures,  in  the angular
          distribution  of  cosmic  objects,  which  does  not  depend  on
          cosmological  models  or  parameters  and  is  based only on the
          angular  coordinates  of the objects. In order to explore Cosmic
          Microwave  Background  temperature fluctuations data, we applied
          this  method  to  simulated  distributions  of  objects  in thin
          spherical  shells  located in three different multiply-connected
          Euclidean 3-spaces ($T^3$, $T_{\pi}$, and $G_6$), and found that
          the  topological  signatures  due  to  these  topologies  can be
          revealed  even  if  their  intensities are small. We show how to
          detect such signatures for the cases of full-sky and partial-sky
          distributions  of  objects.  This  method can also be applied to
          other  ensembles of cosmic objects, like galaxies or quasars, in
          order  to  reveal  possible  angular-scale correlations in their
          distributions.

          The  finding  of  an  unexpectedly  large source of energy from
          repulsive  interactions  between  neutrons  in  the 2,850 known
          nuclides  has  challenged  the  assumption that H-fusion is the
          main  source  of  energy  that  powers the Sun and other stars.
          Neutron  repulsion  in compact objects produced by the collapse
          of  stars  and  collisions  between  galaxies  may  power  more
          energetic  cosmological  events (quasars, gamma ray bursts, and
          active  galactic  centers)  that  had  been attributed to black
          holes   before   neutron   repulsion   was   recognized.  On  a
          cosmological  scale,  nuclear  matter  cycles  between  fusion,
          gravitational  collapse,  and  dissociation  (including neutron
          emission)  rather  than  evolve in one direction by fusion. The
          similarity  Bohr  noted between atomic and planetary structures
          may extend to a similarity nuclear and stellar structures.

          Title:    Models    of   Ultraluminous   X-Ray   Sources   with
          Intermediate-Mass Black Holes
          Authors:  N.  Madhusudhan, S. Justham, L. Nelson, B. Paxton, E.

          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We   have  computed  models  for  ultraluminous  X-ray  sources
          ("ULXs")  consisting  of  a black-hole accretor of intermediate
          mass  ("IMBH"; e.g., ~1000 Msun) and a captured donor star. For
          each of four different sets of initial donor masses and orbital
          separations, we computed 30,000 binary evolution models using a
          full  Henyey  stellar  evolution code. To our knowledge this is
          the  first  time that a population of X-ray binaries this large
          has been carried out with other than approximation methods, and
          it  serves  to  demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to
          large-scale  population  studies  of mass-transfer binaries. In
          the  present  study,  we find that in order to have a plausible
          efficiency  for  producing active ULX systems with IMBHs having
          luminosities   >   10^{40}   ergs/sec,   there  are  two  basic
          requirements  for  the capture of companion/donor stars. First,
          the  donor stars should be massive, i.e., > 8 Msun. Second, the
          initial  orbital  separations, after circularization, should be
          close,  i.e., < 6-30 times the radius of the donor star when on
          the  main  sequence. Even under these optimistic conditions, we
          show  that  the  production  rate  of IMBH-ULX systems may fall
          short of the observed values by factors of 10-100.

          Title:  Do  Low  Levels  of  Metallicity  Influence Cooling and
          Collapse of Ionized Gas in Small Protogalactic Halos?

          Potsdam, (2) American Museum of Natural History, New York)
          Comments: 19 pages, 5 figures, AASTex. Submitted to ApJ
          We study the influence of low levels of metal enrichment on the
          cooling  and  collapse  of  ionized  gas in small protogalactic
          halos  using three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics
          simulations.  Our  initial  conditions  represent protogalaxies
          forming  within a fossil HII region -- a previously ionized HII
          region  which has not yet had time to cool and recombine. Prior
          to cosmological reionization, such regions should be relatively
          common,   since  the  characteristic  lifetime  of  the  likely
          ionizing  sources are significantly shorter than a Hubble time.
          We  show  that  in  these regions, H_2 is the dominant and most
          effective coolant, and that it is the amount of H_2 formed that
          controls  whether  or  not the gas can collapse and form stars.
          For metallicities Z <= 10^{-3} Z_sun, metal line cooling alters
          the  density  and temperature evolution of the gas by less than
          1% compared to the metal-free case at densities below 1 cm^{-3}
          and temperatures above 2000 K. However, at higher densities and
          lower   temperatures   metal  line  cooling  does  become  more
          important,  and  may affect the ability of the gas to fragment.
          Finally, we find that an external ultraviolet background delays
          or suppresses the cooling and collapse of the gas regardless of
          whether or not it is metal-enriched.

          Nucleosynthetic   signatures   in   common   between   the  gas
          responsible  for  the  high  redshift  Lyman alpha forest and a
          subsample  of  extremely  metal  poor stars are found. A simple
          mass loss model of chemical evolution with physically motivated
          parameters  provides  a  consistent picture in which the gas is
          identified  with that lost by supernova-driven winds during the
          first  generation  of  star  formation.  Substantial  mass loss
          occurs  which  can  account for a diffuse IGM with up to 80% of
          the  total  baryon  content  and  a  peak  [C-O/H] abundance of
          \~-2.9.  This  mass  loss  component  differs from one produced
          later during galaxy formation and evolution that contributes to
          a  circum-galactic  medium  (CGM). The CGM was shown earlier to
          have a mass of ~10% of all baryons and peak [Fe/H]~-1.

          We  present  deep  (70-80  ks)  Chandra  and multicolor HST ACS
          images  of two jets hosted by the powerful quasars 1136-135 and
          1150+497,  together  with  new  radio observations. The sources
          have  an  FRII  morphology  and were selected from our previous
          X-ray  and  optical  jet survey for detailed follow up aimed at
          obtaining   better   constraints  on  the  jet  multiwavelength
          morphology  and  X-ray and optical spectra of individual knots,
          and  to  test emission models deriving physical parameters more
          accurately.  All  the  X-ray  and optical knots detected in our
          previous short exposures are confirmed, together with a few new
          faint  features. The overlayed maps and the emissivity profiles
          along the jet show good correspondence between emission regions
          at  the  various  wavelengths;  a  few show offsets between the
          knots  peaks  of <1". In 1150+497 the X-ray, optical, and radio
          profiles  decrease  in similar ways with distance from the core
          up  to  ~7", after which the radio emission increases more than
          the  X-ray  one.  No  X-ray spectral variations are observed in
          1150+497.  In  1136-135  an  interesting  behavior is observed,
          whereby,  downstream  of the most prominent knot at ~ 6.5" from
          the  core,  the  X-ray  emission fades while the radio emission
          brightens.  The  X-ray  spectrum  also  varies,  with the X-ray
          photon  index  flattening  from ~2 in the inner part to ~1.7 to
          the end of the jet. We intepret the jet behavior in 1136-135 in
          a  scenario  where  the  relativistic  flow  suffers systematic

          2005
          We  report  the first significant detection of an X-ray cluster
          associated  with  a  powerful (L(bol) ~1e47 erg/sec) radio-loud
          quasar  at  high  redshift  (z=1.06). Diffuse X-ray emission is
          detected  out  to ~120 kpc from the CSS quasar 3C 186. A strong
          Fe-line  emission  at  the  z(rest)=1.06  confirms  its thermal
          nature.   We   find   that  the  CSS  radio  source  is  highly
          overpressured  with  respect  to  the thermal cluster medium by
          ~2-3  orders  of  magnitude. This provides direct observational
          evidence  that  the  radio  source is not thermally confined as
          posited   in  the  ``frustrated''  scenario  for  CSS  sources.
          Instead, the radio source may be young and at an early stage of
          its  evolution. This source provides the first detection of the
          AGN  in  outburst  in  the  center  of  a cooling flow cluster.
          Powerful  radio  sources  are  thought  to  be triggered by the
          cooling   flows.   The   evidence  for  the  AGN  activity  and
          intermittent  outbursts  comes from the X-ray morphology of low
          redshift  clusters, which usually do not harbour quasars. 3C186
          is a young active radio source which can supply the energy into
          the  cluster  and  potentially  prevent its cooling. We discuss
          energetics  related  to  the  quasar  activity  and the cluster
          cooling  flow, and possible feedback between the evolving radio
          source and the cluster.

          We  discuss  observational  properties  of strong emission-line
          galaxies  at  low redshift found by our deep imaging survey for
          high-redshift  Ly  alpha  emitters. In our surveys, we used the
          narrowband  filter,  NB816  (lambda_center=8150A  with  FWHM  =
          120A), and the intermediate-band filter, IA827 (lambda_center =
          8270A with FWHM = 340A). In this survey, 62 NB816-excess (> 0.9
          mag)  and 21 IA827-excess (> 0.8 mag) objects were found. Among
          them,  we  found  20  NB816-excess  and 4 IA827-excess Ly alpha
          emitter   candidates.   Therefore,   it   turns   out  that  42
          NB816-excess   and   17   IA827-excess   objects   are   strong
          emission-line objects at lower redshift. Since 4 objects in the
          two  low-z samples are common, the total number of strong low-z
          emitters is 55. Applying our photometric redshift technique, we
          identify 7 H alpha emitters at z~0.24, 20 H beta-[OIII] ones at
          z~0.65,  and  11  [OII]  ones  at  z~1.19.  However,  we cannot
          determine  reliable  photometric  redshifts of the remaining 17
          emitters.  The  distributions  of  their  rest frame equivalent
          widths  are  consistently  understood  with  recent  studies of
          galaxy evolution from z~1 to z~0.

          Title: X-ray source populations in galaxies
          Authors: G. Fabbiano
          Comments: 40 pages. This is a review submitted to Annual Review
          of  Astronomy  &  Astrophysics Comments are welcome and will be
          considered in a revised version
          Today's sensitive, high-resolution X-ray observations allow the
          study  of populations of X-ray sources, in the luminosity range
          of  Galactic  X-ray  binaries,  in galaxies as distant as 20-30
          Mpc. The traditional astronomical tools of photometric diagrams
          and  luminosity functions are now applied to these populations,
          providing  a  direct  probe  of the evolved binary component of
          different   stellar   populations.   The  study  of  the  X-ray
          populations of E and S0 galaxies has revamped the debate on the
          formation  and evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and
          on  the  role  of  globular  clusters in these processes. While
          overall stellar mass drives the amount of X-ray binaries in old
          stellar  populations,  the  amount  of  sources in star forming
          galaxies  is  related  to the star formation rate. Short-lived,
          luminous,  high-mass  binaries  (HMXBs)  dominate  these  young
          populations. The most luminous sources in these systems are the
          debated  ULXs,  which  have been suggested to be ~100-1000 Msol
          black  holes,  but  could  alternatively  include  a  number of
          binaries  with stellar mass black holes. Very soft sources have
          also  been  discovered  in  many  galaxies  and their nature is
          currently  being  debated.  Observations of the deep X-ray sky,
          and  comparison  with  deep  optical surveys, are providing the
          first evidence of the X-ray evolution of galaxies.

          Title: The maximum contribution to reionization from metal-free
          stars
          Authors:   Jose   M.   Rozas,   Jordi   Miralda-Escude,  Eduard
          Salvador-Sole
          Comments: 34 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  estimate  the maximum contribution to reionization from the
          first generation of massive stars, with zero metallicity, under
          the  assumption that one of these stars forms with a fixed mass
          in  every  collapsed  halo  in  which metal-free gas is able to
          cool.  We  assume  that  any  halo  that  has already had stars
          previously  formed  in  one of their halo progenitors will form
          only  stars  with  metals,  which are assigned an emissivity of
          ionizing  radiation  equal  to  that determined at z=4 from the
          measured  intensity  of the ionizing background. We examine the
          impact  of molecular hydrogen photodissociation (which tends to
          reduce  cooling when a photodissociating background is produced
          by  the  first  stars)  and X-Ray photoheating (which heats the
          atomic  medium,  raising  the  entropy  of  the  gas  before it
          collapses  into  halos). We find that in the CDM$\Lambda$ model
          supported   by  present  observations,  and  even  assuming  no
          negative  feedbacks  for  the  formation of metal-free stars, a
          reionized  mass  fraction  of 50% is not reached until redshift
          $z\sim  12$.  The  combination of ordinary metal-enriched stars
          and  early  metal-free  stars  can yield a CMB optical depth to
          electron  scattering  of  at  most  0.13.  The  contribution of
          metal-free  stars to the present Cosmic Infrarred Background is
          negligibly small.

          We  determined  oxygen  and iron abundances of the interstellar
          medium   (ISM)   using  K-shell  (O)  and  L-shell  (Fe)  X-ray
          photo-ionization  edges  towards  Ultra  luminous X-ray sources
          (ULXs).  We  determine  the  hydrogen  column  densities  (n_H)
          towards  the  ULXs  from  XMM-Newton archival spectra of 14 ULX
          sources.  We  compare our X-ray values with those obtained from
          radio HI observations for 8 of the sources. The X-ray model n_H
          values  are  in good agreement with the HI n_H values, implying
          that  the  hydrogen  absorption towards the ULX is not local to
          the  source,  with  the exception of M81 X-1. Oxygen abundances
          and iron abundances are roughly solar for the host galaxies.

          Comments: 17 pages, 4 figures; ApJ, in press
          We  report  identification of the radio loud narrow-line quasar
          SDSS  J172206.03+565451.6  which  we  found  in the course of a
          search for radio loud narrow-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
          SDSSJ172206.03+565451.6  is  only  the ~4th securely identified
          radio loud narrow-line quasar and the second-most radio loudest
          with a radio index R_1.4 ~ 100-700. Its black hole mass, M_BH =
          (2-3)  10^7 M_sun, is unusually small given its radio loudness,
          and   the   combination   of   mass   and   radio   index  puts
          SDSSJ172206.03+565451.6  in  a  scarcely  populated  region  of
          M_BH-R   diagrams.   SDSSJ172206.03+565451.6   is  a  classical
          Narrow-Line  Seyfert1-type  object with FWHM_Hbeta = 1490 km/s,
          an  intensity  ratio  of  [OIII]/Hbeta  = 0.7 and FeII emission
          complexes  with  FeII4570/Hbeta = 0.7. The ionization parameter
          of  its  narrow-line  region,  estimated  from  the  line ratio
          [OII]/[OIII],  is  similar  to  Seyferts  and its high ratio of
          [NeV]/[NeIII]  indicates  a strong EUV to soft-X-ray excess. We
          advertise  the combined usage of [OII]/[OIII] and [NeV]/[NeIII]
          diagrams  as  a  useful  diagnostic tool to estimate ionization
          parameters  and to constrain the EUV continuum shape relatively
          independent from other parameters.

          Comments: 43 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  investigate  the  nature  of a sample of 92 Spitzer/MIPS 24
          micron  selected  galaxies  in the CDFS, showing power law-like
          emission  in the Spitzer/IRAC 3.6-8 micron bands. The main goal
          is  to  determine  whether  the galaxies not detected in X-rays
          (47%  of the sample) are part of the hypothetical population of
          obscured  AGN  not  detected  even  in  deep X-ray surveys. The
          majority  of  the  IR power-law galaxies are ULIRGs at z>1, and
          those  with  LIRG-like  IR luminosities are usually detected in
          X-rays.  The optical to IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
          of  the  X-ray  detected  galaxies  are  almost equally divided
          between  a  BLAGN  SED  class (similar to an optically selected
          QSO)  and  a  NLAGN  SED  (similar to the BLAGN SED but with an
          obscured  UV/optical  continuum).  A  small  fraction  of  SEDs
          resemble  warm ULIRG galaxies (e.g., Mrk231). Most galaxies not
          detected  in  X-rays have SEDs in the NLAGN+ULIRG class as they
          tend  to  be  optically  fainter,  and  possibly more obscured.
          Moreover,  the  IR  power-law  galaxies have SEDs significantly
          different from those of high-z (z_sp>1) IR (24 micron) selected
          and  optically  bright  (VVDS  I_AB<=24)  star-forming galaxies
          whose  SEDs  show  a very prominent stellar bump at 1.6 micron.
          The  galaxies  detected  in  X-rays  have  2-8  keV  rest-frame
          luminosities  typical  of  AGN.  The  galaxies  not detected in
          X-rays  have  global  X-ray  to mid-IR SED properties that make
          them  good  candidates to contain IR bright X-ray absorbed AGN.
          If  all  these  sources  are  actually  obscured  AGN, we would
          observe  a  ratio  of obscured to unobscured 24 micron detected
          AGN  of  2:1,  whereas  models  predict  a  ratio of up to 3:1.
          Additional  studies using Spitzer to detect X-ray-quiet AGN are
          likely to find more such obscured sources.

          Title:  Testing  the beamed inverse-Compton model for jet X-ray
          emission: velocity structure and deceleration?
          Authors: M. J. Hardcastle
          Comments:  10 pages, 3 figures. Submitted to MNRAS 2005 Sep 01:
          version   posted   includes  response  to  referee's  comments:
          comments welcome
          By  considering  a  small  sample  of core-dominated radio-loud
          quasars  with X-ray jets, I show, as has been argued previously
          by  others, that the observations require bulk jet deceleration
          if  all  of  the  X-ray  emission  is to be explained using the
          widely  adopted  beamed  inverse-Compton  model, and argue that
          jets   even  in  these  powerful  objects  must  have  velocity
          structure   in   order  to  reconcile  their  radio  and  X-ray
          properties.  I  then  argue  that  the  deceleration  model has
          several  serious  weaknesses,  and  discuss  the  viability  of
          alternative  models  for  the decline in X-ray/radio ratio as a
          function  of position. Although inverse-Compton scattering from
          the  jets  is  a  required process and must come to dominate at
          high  redshifts,  adopting  an  alternative model for the X-ray
          emission  of  some  nearby,  well-studied  objects  can greatly
          alleviate  some of the problems posed by these observations for
          the beamed inverse-Compton model.

          Title: Extended X-Ray Emission from QSOs
          Authors:  Alan  Stockton (1), Hai Fu (1), J. Patrick Henry (1),
          Gabriela Canalizo (2) ((1) IfA Hawaii, (2) Univ. of California,
          Riverside)
          Comments: Accepted by ApJ. 9 pages including 5 figures
          We  report  Chandra  ACIS  observations of the fields of 4 QSOs
          showing  strong  extended optical emission-line regions. Two of
          these show no evidence for significant extended X-ray emission.
          The  remaining two fields, those of 3C 249.1 and 4C 37.43, show
          discrete (but resolved) X-ray sources at distances ranging from
          ~10 to ~40 kpc from the nucleus. In addition, 4C 37.43 also may
          show  a  region  of diffuse X-ray emission extending out to ~65
          kpc  and  centered  on  the  QSO.  It  has  been suggested that
          extended  emission-line  regions such as these may originate in
          the  cooling  of  a  hot  intragroup medium. We do not detect a
          general  extended  medium  in  any of our fields, and the upper
          limits  we  can place on its presence indicate cooling times of
          at  least a few 10^9 years. The discrete X-ray emission sources
          we detect cannot be explained as the X-ray jets frequently seen
          associated  with  radio-loud  quasars,  nor  can they be due to
          electron  scattering  of  nuclear  emission. The most plausible
          explanation  is  that  they  result from high-speed shocks from
          galactic  superwinds  resulting  either from a starburst in the
          QSO  host  galaxy  or  from  the  activation of the QSO itself.
          Evidence  from  densities  and velocities found from studies of
          the  extended  optical  emission around QSOs also supports this
          interpretation.

          Title:   The   Physical   Properties   and   Detectability   of
          Reionization-Epoch Galaxies
          Authors:   Romeel   Davé,   Kristian   Finlator,   Benjamin  D.
          Oppenheimer (Arizona)
          Comments: 20 pages, submitted to MNRAS
          We  present  predictions  drawn  from cosmological hydrodynamic
          simulations  for  the  physical,  photometric and emission line
          properties  of  galaxies  present  during  the latter stages of
          reionization   from  z=9-6.  We  find  significant  numbers  of
          galaxies that have stellar masses exceeding 10^8 Mo during this
          epoch,  with  metallicities  exceeding one-thirtieth solar. Far
          from  primeval "first-star" objects,these objects are likely to
          have reionized their infall regions prior to z=9, are dominated
          by  atomic  rather than molecular cooling, and are not expected
          to  be  forming Population III stars. Galaxies exhibit a slowly
          evolving comoving autocorrelation length from z=9-6, continuing
          a  trend  seen at lower redshifts in which the rapidly dropping
          bias  counteracts  the  rapidly  increasing  matter clustering.
          These   sources   can  be  marginally  detected  using  current
          instruments, but modest increases in sensitivity or survey area
          would  yield  significantly  increased  samples.  We compare to
          current  observations  of  the  z~6  rest-UV  and Ly-alpha line
          luminosity  functions, and find good agreement. We also compare
          with  the  z~7  object  observed by Egami et al., and find that
          such  systems  are ubiquitous in our simulations. The intrinsic
          Ly-alpha luminosity function evolves slowly from z=9-6, meaning
          that  it  should  also be possible to detect these objects with
          upcoming narrow band surveys such as DAzLE. We make predictions
          for  near-IR  surveys  with  JWST,  and  show that while a high
          density  of  sources  will be found, Population III objects may
          remain elusive. We present and compare simulations with several
          recipes  for  superwind feedback, and show that while our broad
          conclusions  are  insensitive  to this choice, a feedback model
          based  on  momentum-driven winds is favored in comparisons with
          available data. (abridged)

          Title: X-ray reflections on AGN
          Authors: A.C. Fabian (Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge, UK)
          Comments:  5  pages,  9  figures, to appear in Proc. "The X-ray
          Universe  2005",  San  Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain, September
          2005
          X-ray  reflection  generates much of the spectral complexity in
          the X-ray spectra of AGN. It is argued that strong relativistic
          blurring of the reflection spectrum should commonly be expected
          from  objects  accreting  at  a  high  Eddington rate. The good
          agreement  found  between  the  local  density in massive black
          holes  and  the energy density in quasar and AGN light requires
          that   the  accretion  which  built  massive  black  holes  was
          radiatively  efficient, involving thin discs extending within 6
          gravitational  radii.  The  soft excess found in the spectra of
          many  AGN  can  be  explained  by  X-ray  reflection  when such
          blurring  is  included  in  the  spectral analysis. Some of the
          continuum   variability   and   in   particular   the  puzzling
          variability  of  the  broad  iron  line can be explained by the
          strong  light bending expected in the region immediately around
          a  black  hole. Progress in understanding this behaviour in the
          brightest  sources can be made now with long observations using
          instruments on XMM-Newton and Suzaku. Future missions like Xeus
          and  Con-X, with large collecting areas, are required to expand
          the  range  of  accessible  objects  and  to make reverberation
          studies possible.

          Title:   An   Optical   Study   of   Stellar  and  Interstellar
          Environments of Seven Luminous and Ultraluminous X-Ray Sources
          Authors:  Caitlin  J.  Ramsey,  Rosa  M.  Williams,  Robert  A.
          Gruendl, C.-H. Rosie Chen, You-Hua Chu, Q. Daniel Wang
          Comments: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal
          We  have  studied  the stellar and interstellar environments of
          two luminous X-ray sources and five ultraluminous X-ray sources
          (ULXs)  in  order  to  gain insight into their nature. Archival
          Hubble Space Telescope images were used to identify the optical
          counterparts  of  the  ULXs  Ho IX X-1 and NGC 1313 X-2, and to
          make  photometric measurements of the local stellar populations
          of  these  and  the  luminous  source  IC  10  X-1. We obtained
          high-dispersion   spectroscopic  observations  of  the  nebulae
          around  these  seven  sources  to  search for He II lambda-4686
          emission  and  to estimate the expansion velocities and kinetic
          energies  of  these  nebulae.  Our  observations did not detect
          nebular  He  II emission from any source, with the exception of
          LMC X-1; this is either because we missed the He III regions or
          because  the  nebulae  are too diffuse to produce He II surface
          brightnesses  that  lie  within our detection limit. We compare
          the  observed  ionization  and  kinematics  of  the supershells
          around  the  ULXs  Ho  IX  X-1 and NGC 1313 X-2 with the energy
          feedback  expected  from  the  underlying stellar population to
          assess  whether  additional  energy contributions from the ULXs
          are  needed.  In  both cases, we find insufficient UV fluxes or
          mechanical  energies  from  the  stellar population; thus these
          ULXs  may  be  partially  responsible  for  the  ionization and
          energetics  of  their supershells. All seven sources we studied
          are  in young stellar environments and six of them have optical
          counterparts  with  masses  >~7  M_sun; thus, these sources are
          most likely high-mass X-ray binaries.

          workshop  "QSO Host Galaxies: Evolution and Environment" (Univ.
          Leiden, Aug. 22-26, 2005)
          We present results from an archival study of 70 medium-redshift
          QSOs  observed  with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on board
          the  Hubble Space Telescope. The QSOs have magnitudes M_V < -23
          (total nuclear plus host light) and redshifts 0.06 < z < 0.46.
          A  close  relationship between QSO host and nucleus is found by
          examining  multiple  parameters at once. A principal components
          analysis  shows  that 3 nuclear and host properties are related
          in a kind of fundamental plane: nuclear luminosity and the size
          and  effective  surface  magnitude  of the bulge. Using optical
          nuclear  luminosity,  this  relationship  explains 95.9% of the
          variance  in the overall sample, while 94.9% of the variance is
          accounted for if we use x-ray nuclear luminosity.
          The  form  of  this QSO fundamental plane shows similarities to
          the  well-studied fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies, and
          we  examine  the  possible relationship between them as well as
          the  difficulties involved in establishing this connection. The
          key  to  the relationship might lie in the fueling mechanism of
          the central black hole.

          Title:    Lensing    Reconstruction   using   redshifted   21cm
          Fluctuations
          Authors: Oliver Zahn, Matias Zaldarriaga
          Comments: 13 pages, 9 Figures
          We  investigate the potential of second generation measurements
          of  redshifted  21  cm radiation from the epoch of reionization
          (EOR)  to reconstruct the matter density fluctuations along the
          line  of  sight.  To  do so we generalize the quadratic methods
          developed  for  the  Cosmic  Microwave Background (CMB) to 21cm
          fluctuations. The three dimensional signal can be analyzed into
          a  finite number of line of sight Fourier modes that contribute
          to    the    lensing   reconstruction.   In   comparison   with
          reconstruction   using   the  CMB,  21cm  fluctuations  have  a
          disadvantage   of   relative   featurelessness,  which  can  be
          compensated   for   by   the   fact  that  there  are  multiple
          uncorrelated  backgrounds.  The  multiple  redshift information
          allows  to  reconstruct  relatively small scales even if one is
          limited  by  angular  resolution.  We  estimate  that  a square
          kilometer  of collecting area is needed with a maximal baseline
          of 3 km to achieve lensing reconstruction noise levels an order
          of  magnitude  below  CMB  quadratic  estimator  constraints at
          $l=1000$,  and constraints on the convergence out to a tenth of
          a  degree ($L\simeq 2000$) within a season of observations on a
          single  field.  Statistical  power  spectrum detections will be
          possible  to  sub-arcminute  scales,  even with the limited sky
          coverage  that  currently  proposed  experiments will have. One
          should   be  able  place  strong  constraints  on  cosmological
          parameters  using  this  method. Higher ambitions in the future
          would  bring larger collecting areas or longer observing times.
          This  way  one  could  image  arcminute  scales  of the lensing
          potential and probe individual clusters. We briefly address the
          effect  that  foregrounds  might have on lensing reconstruction
          with   21cm   fluctuations,  which  can  be  implemented  in  a
          straightforward manner within our formalism.

          Title:  Ultraluminous  X-ray  Sources  Powered  by  Radiatively
          Efficient  Two-Phased  Super-Eddington  Accretion  onto Stellar
          Mass Black holes
          Authors: Aristotle Socrates, Shane W. Davis
          Comments: 11 pages
          The  radiation  spectra  of many of the brightest ultraluminous
          X-ray  sources  (ULXs)  are  dominated  by  a  hard  power  law
          component,  likely powered by a hot, optically thin corona that
          Comptonizes  soft  seed  photons emitted from a cool, optically
          thick  black  hole  accretion  disk. Before its dissipation and
          subsequent conversion into coronal photon power, the randomized
          gravitational  binding  energy  responsible  for  powering  ULX
          phenomena  must separate from the mass of its origin by a means
          other  than,  and  quicker  than,  electron scattering-mediated
          radiative  diffusion. Therefore, the release of accretion power
          in  ULXs is not necessarily subject to Eddington-limited photon
          trapping,  as long as it occurs in a corona. Motivated by these
          basic  considerations,  we  present  a model of ULXs powered by
          geometrically  thin accretion onto stellar mass black holes. We
          argue that the radiative efficiency of the flow remains high if
          the  corona is magnetized or optically thin and the majority of
          the  accretion  power  escapes  in the form of radiation rather
          than  an  outflow. Within the context of the current black hole
          X-ray  binary  paradigm,  our  ULX  model  may  be viewed as an
          extension  of the very high state observed in Galactic sources.

          Title:  Spitzer  Observations  of Red Galaxies: Implication for
          High-Redshift Star Formation
          Authors:  Casey  Papovich  (1),  for the GOODS, MIPS GTO teams,
          ((1) Steward Observatory)
          Comments:  To  appear  in the proceedings of UC Irvine May 2005
          workshop  on  "First Light & Reionization", eds. E. Barton & A.
          Cooray, New Astronomy Reviews. 10 pages, 5 figures
          My colleagues and I identified distant red galaxies (DRGs) with
          J-K>2.3  mag  in  the  GOODS-S  field. These galaxies reside at
          z~1-3.5, (<z>=2.2) and based on their ACS (0.4-1 micron), ISAAC
          (1-2.2   micron),   and  IRAC  (3-8  micron)  photometry,  they
          typically  have  inferred  stellar masses > 10^11 solar masses.
          Interestingly,  more  than  50% of these objects have 24 micron
          flux  densities  >50  micro-Jy.  Attributing the IR emission to
          star-formation  implies  SFRs  of  \~100-1000  solar masses per
          year.  As  a  result, galaxies with stellar masses >10^11 solar
          masses  have  specific  SFRs  equal  to or exceeding the global
          value  at  z~1.5-3.  In  contrast,  galaxies  with >10^11 solar
          masses  z~0.3-0.75  have  specific  SFRs  less  than the global
          average,  and  more  than an order of magnitude lower than that
          for  massive  DRGs at z~1.5-3. Thus, the bulk of star formation
          in  massive  galaxies  is  largely  complete  by z~1.5. The red
          colors  and  large  inferred stellar masses in the DRGs suggest
          that  much  of the star formation in these galaxies occurred at
          redshifts  z>5-6.  Using  model  star-formation  histories that
          match   the  DRG  colors  and  stellar  masses  at  z~2-3,  and
          measurements of the UV luminosity density at z>5-6, we consider
          what  constraints exist on the stellar initial mass function in
          the progenitors of the massive DRGs at z~2-3.

          Title:  Constraining  global  properties  of  the  Draco  dwarf
          spheroidal galaxy
          Authors: Sergey Mashchenko, Alison Sills, H. M. P. Couchman
          Comments: 18 pages, 14 figures; accepted by ApJ
          By  fitting a flexible stellar anisotropy model to the observed
          surface   brightness   and  line-of-sight  velocity  dispersion
          profiles  of  Draco  we  derive  a  sequence  of cosmologically
          plausible  two-component  (stars + dark matter) models for this
          galaxy.  The  models  are  consistent  with  all  the available
          observations  and  can have either cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White or
          flat-cored  dark matter density profiles. The dark matter halos
          either  formed relatively recently (at z~2...7) and are massive
          (up  to  ~5x10^9  M_Sun),  or  formed  before  the  end  of the
          reionization  of  the  universe (z~7...11) and are less massive
          (down to ~7x10^7 M_Sun). Our results thus support either of the
          two  popular  solutions  of the "missing satellites" problem of
          Lambda  cold dark matter cosmology - that dwarf spheroidals are
          either  very massive, or very old. We carry out high-resolution
          simulations  of  the tidal evolution of our two-component Draco
          models  in  the  potential of the Milky Way. The results of our
          simulations  suggest  that  the  observable properties of Draco
          have  not been appreciably affected by the Galactic tides after
          10  Gyr of evolution. We rule out Draco being a "tidal dwarf" -
          a  tidally  disrupted  dwarf galaxy. Almost radial Draco orbits
          (with  the  pericentric distance <15 kpc) are also ruled out by
          our  analysis.  The  case of a harmonic dark matter core can be
          consistent  with observations only for a very limited choice of
          Draco  orbits  (with  the  apocentric-to-pericentric  distances
          ratio of <2.5).

          Title:  Semi-empirical  analysis  of  Sloan  Digital Sky Survey
          galaxies: II. The bimodality of the galaxy population revisited
          Authors:   Abilio   Mateus,   Laerte  Sodre  Jr.,  Roberto  Cid
          Fernandes, Grazyna Stasinska, William Schoenell, Jean M. Gomes
          Comments: 16 pages, 19 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  revisit  the  bimodal distribution of the galaxy population
          commonly  seen  in  the  local  Universe.  Here  we address the
          bimodality  observed  in galaxy properties in terms of spectral
          synthesis  products,  such  as  mean  stellar  ages and stellar
          masses, derived from the application of this powerful method to
          a  volume-limited sample of about 50 thousand luminous galaxies
          from  the  SDSS  Data  Release  2.  In  addition,  galaxies are
          classified according to their emission line properties in three
          distinct  spectral  classes:  star-forming galaxies, with young
          stellar populations; passive galaxies, dominated by old stellar
          populations;  and, hosts of active nuclei, which comprise a mix
          of young and old stellar populations. We show that the extremes
          of the distribution of some galaxy properties are associated to
          star-forming  galaxies  at  one  side,  and passive galaxies at
          another.  We  found that the mean light-weighted stellar age of
          galaxies  is  the  direct responsible to the bimodality seen in
          the galaxy population, and that stellar mass is a coadjuvant in
          the sense that only less massive galaxies are currently forming
          stars.  Our  results  also  give  support to the existence of a
          `downsizing'  in  galaxy formation, where massive galaxies seen
          nowadays have stellar populations formed at early times.

          Comments:  14  pages,  6  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We present an extensive X-ray spectral analysis of the cores of
          19  FRII  sources  in  the  redshift range 0.5<z<1.0 which were
          selected  to  be  matched  in isotropic radio power. The sample
          consists  of  10  radio  galaxies and 9 quasars. We compare our
          results  with  the  expectations  from a unification model that
          ascribes  the  difference between these two types of sources to
          the  viewing  angle  to  the  line  of  sight,  beaming and the
          presence  of a dust and gas torus. We find that the spectrum of
          all the quasars can be fitted with a single power law, and that
          the  spectral  index flattens with decreasing angle to the line
          of  sight.  We  interpret  this  as  the effect of increasingly
          dominant  inverse  Compton X-ray emission, beamed such that the
          jet  emission outshines other core components. For up to 70 per
          cent  of  the  radio  galaxies  we detect intrinsic absorption;
          their  core  spectra  are  best fitted with an unabsorbed steep
          power  law  of  average  spectral  index  $\Gamma=2.1$  and  an
          absorbed  power  law  of  spectral  index  Gamma=1.6,  which is
          flatter  than that observed for radio-quiet quasars. We further
          conclude  that  the  presence  of  a  jet  affects the spectral
          properties  of  absorbed  nuclear  emission  in  AGN.  In radio
          galaxies,   any   steep-spectrum  component  of  nuclear  X-ray
          emission,  similar to that seen in radio-quiet quasars, must be
          masked by a jet or by jet-related emission.

          Title:  Simulations  of  thermally  broadened HI Lya absorption
          arising in the warm-hot intergalactic medium
          Authors: P. Richter, T. Fang, G.L. Bryan
          Comments: 11 pages, 8 figures; submitted to A&A
          Recent  far-ultraviolet  (FUV)  absorption line measurements of
          low-redshift  quasars have unveiled a population of intervening
          broad HI Lya absorbers (BLAs) with large Doppler parameters (b>
          40  km/s).  If  the  large width of these lines is dominated by
          thermal  line broadening, the BLAs may trace highly-ionized gas
          in  the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in the temperature
          range  T ~ 10^5-10^6 K, a gas phase that is expected to contain
          a  large fraction of the baryons at low redshift. In this paper
          we   use   a  hydrodynamical  simulation  to  study  frequency,
          distribution,  physical  conditions,  and baryon content of the
          BLAs  at  z=0. From our simulated spectra we derive a number of
          BLAs  per  unit  redshift  of (dN/dz)_BLA ~ 38 for HI absorbers
          with   log   (N(cm^-2)/b(km/s))>10.7,   b>40   km/s,   and  log
          N(HII)<20.5.   The   baryon   content   of   these  systems  is
          Omega_b(BLA)=0.0121/h_65,  which  represents ~25 percent of the
          total baryon budget in our simulation. Our results thus support
          the  idea that BLAs represent a significant baryon reservoir at
          low    redshift.    BLAs   predominantly   trace   shock-heated
          collisionally  ionized  WHIM gas at temperatures log T~4.4-6.2.
          About 27 percent of the BLAs in our simulation originate in the
          photoionized Lya forest (log T<4.3) and their large line widths
          are  determined  by  non-thermal  broadening  effects  such  as
          unresolved  velocity  structure and macroscopic turbulence. Our
          simulation  implies  that  for a large-enough sample of BLAs in
          FUV spectra it is possible to obtain a reasonable approximation
          of the baryon content of these systems solely from the measured
          HI column densities and b values.

          Title: Galactic Corona or Local Group Intergalactic Medium?
          Authors:  Rik  J.  Williams  (Ohio  State),  Smita Mathur (Ohio
          State), Fabrizio Nicastro (CfA)
          Comments:  6  pages, 6 figures, to appear in the proceedings of

          September 2005
          Cosmological  hydrodynamic  simulations  predict  that  the low
          redshift universe comprises a web of warm-hot intergalactic gas
          and  galaxies,  with groups of galaxies and clusters forming at
          dense  knots  in  these  filaments.  Our  own  Galaxy  being no
          exception  is  also  expected  to be surrounded by the warm-hot
          intergalactic medium, filling the Local Group. Some theoretical
          models  also  predict  the  existence of a hot Galactic corona.
          With  X-ray  and  FUV observations of extragalactic sources, we
          can  probe  the warm-hot gas through absorption lines of highly
          ionized  elements.  Indeed,  Chandra, XMM and FUSE observations
          have  detected z=0 absorption lines toward many sightlines. The
          debate  that  has  emerged  is over the interpretation of these
          observations:  are  the z=0 absorption systems from the halo of
          our  Galaxy  or from the extended Local Group environment? This
          has important implications for our understanding of the mass of
          the  Local  Group, the physical conditions in the intergalactic
          medium,  the  structure  of  the Galaxy and galaxy formation in
          general.  We  will present the current status of the debate and
          discuss  our  ongoing  observing program aimed at understanding
          the  z=0  absorption  systems,  with  an  emphasis  on the high
          quality Chandra spectra of the Mrk 421 and Mrk 279 sightlines.

          Title: The effect of minihaloes on cosmic reionization

          UCSB),  F. Stoehr (IAP), A. Ferrara (SISSA), I.T. Iliev (CITA),

          Comments:  9  pages,  2  figures,  accepted for pubblication in
          MNRAS
          One  of  the most debated issues in the theoretical modeling of
          cosmic    reionization    is    the    impact   of   small-mass
          gravitationally-bound   structures.  We  carry  out  the  first
          numerical   investigation   of   the   role   of  such  sterile
          `minihaloes', which serve as self-shielding screens of ionizing
          photons.  Minihaloes  are  too small to be properly resolved in
          current  large-scale  cosmological  simulations,  and  thus  we
          estimate  their effects using a sub-grid model, considering two
          cases  that  bracket their effect within this framework. In the
          `extreme  suppression'  case in which minihalo formation ceases
          once  a  region  is  partially  ionized, their effect on cosmic
          reionization is modest, reducing the volume-averaged ionization
          fraction  by  an  overall factor of less than 15%. In the other
          extreme,  in which minihalo formation is never suppressed, they
          delay  complete  reionization  as  much  as Delta z~2, in rough
          agreement  with  the  results  from  a previous semi-analytical
          study  by  the  authors.  Thus, depending on the details of the
          minihalo   formation  process,  their  effect  on  the  overall
          progress  of reionization can range from modest to significant,
          but  the  minihalo photon consumption is by itself insufficient
          to force an extended reionization epoch.

          Title: Large-Scale Simulations of Reionization
          Authors:  Katharina  Kohler,  Nickolay  Y.  Gnedin, Andrew J.S.
          Hamilton
          Comments: 25 pages
          We  use  cosmological  simulations  to  explore the large-scale
          effects  of  reionization. Since reionization is a process that
          involves  a  large dynamic range - from galaxies to rare bright
          quasars  -  we need to be able to cover a significant volume of
          the  universe  in  our  simulation without losing hte important
          small  scale  effects  from  galaxies.  Here  we  have taken an
          approach  that  uses  clumping factors derived from small scale
          simulations  to  approximate  the  radiative  transfer  on  the
          sub-cell   scales.   Using  this  technique,  we  can  cover  a
          simulation  size  up  to $1280 h^{-1} Mpc$ with $10 h^{-1} Mpc$
          cells. This allows us to construct synthetic spectra of quasars
          similar  to  observed  spectra of SDSS quasars at high reshifts
          and  compare  them to the observational data. These spectra can
          then  be  analyzed  for  HII  region sizes, the presence of the
          Gunn-Peterson trough and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest.

          Spectra  will  be  made  available in the online version of the

          We  present  a near-infrared quasar composite spectrum spanning
          the  wavelength  range  0.58  -  3.5  um. The spectrum has been
          constructed  from  observations  of  27 quasars obtained at the
          NASA  IRTF  telescope and satisfying the criteria Ks < 14.5 and
          Mi  <  -23;  the  redshift  range  is  0.118  <  z < 0.418. The
          signal-to-noise  is moderate, reaching a maximum of 150 between
          1.6  and  1.9 um. While a power-law fit to the continuum of the
          composite  spectrum  requires  two  breaks,  a single power-law
          slope  of  alpha=-0.92  plus  a  1260  K  blackbody provides an
          excellent  description  of the spectrum from H-alpha to 3.5 um,
          strongly  suggesting  the presence of significant quantities of
          hot  dust  in  this  blue-selected  quasar  sample.  We measure
          intensities  and  line  widths  for ten lines, finding that the
          Paschen  line  ratios rule out Case B recombination. We compute
          K-corrections  for  the J, H, K, and Spitzer 3.6 um bands which
          will be useful in analyzing observations of quasars up to z=10.

          Active  galaxies  are the most powerful engines in the Universe
          for  converting  gravitational energy into radiation, and their
          study  at  all  epochs  of  evolution  is  therefore important.
          Powerful  radio-loud  quasars and radio galaxies have the added
          advantage  that, since their radio jets need X-ray-emitting gas
          as  a  medium in which to propagate, the sources can be used as
          cosmological  probes  to  trace significant atmospheres at high
          redshift. The radio emission can be used as a measure of source
          orientation,  and sensitive X-ray measurements, especially when
          used  in combination with multi-wavelength data, can be used to
          derive  important results on the physical structures on a range
          of  sizes from the cores to the large-scale components. In this
          paper  we  present  new  results  on  a  significant  sample of
          powerful  radio galaxies and quasars at z > 0.5, drawn from the
          3CRR  catalogue  and  selected to sample a full range of source
          orientation.  Using  high-quality  observations from XMM-Newton
          and  Chandra,  we  discuss  the  X-ray properties of the cores,
          jets,  lobes and cluster gas, and, through the incorporation of
          multi-wavelength data, draw conclusions about the nature of the
          emission from the different components.

          Title: The missing metals problem: II. How many metals are in z

          Authors:  N.  Bouche (1), M. D. Lehnert (1), C. Peroux (2) ((1)

          Letters
          In   the   context  of  the  ``missing  metals  problem'',  the
          contributions  of  the  UV-selected  z=2.2  ``BX'' galaxies and
          z=2.5  ``distant  red galaxies'' (DRGs) have not been discussed
          previously.  Here  we  show that: (i) DRGs only make a marginal
          contribution  to  the  metal  budget  (~  5%); (ii) BX galaxies
          contribute  as  much  as 18% to the metal budget; and (iii) the
          K-bright subsample ($K<20$) of the BX sample (likely equivalent
          to the `BzK' selected samples) contributes roughly half of this
          18%,  owing  both  to  their  larger  stellar masses and higher
          metallicities,  implying that the rare K-bright galaxies at z>2
          are  a  major  source of metals in the budget. We showed in the
          first  paper of this series that submm galaxies (SMGs) brighter
          than  3 mJy contribute ~5% (<9% as an upper limit) to the metal
          budget.  Adding  the  contribution  of SMGs and damped Ly-alpha
          absorbers, to the contribution of UV selected galaxies, implies
          that  at  least  30%  of  the  metals  (in  galaxies) have been
          accounted  for  at z=2. The cosmic metal density thus accounted
          for  is  ~  1.3\times 10^6 \rhosun. This is a lower limit given
          that  galaxies  on the faint-end of the luminosity function are
          not  included.  An  estimate  of  the distribution of metals in
          local  galaxies as a function luminosity suggests that galaxies
          with  luminosity  less than L^{\star}$ contribute about half of
          the  total  mass  of metals. If the metals in galaxies at z ~ 2
          are  similarly  distributed  then  faint  galaxies alone cannot
          solve the ``missing metals problem''. Galaxy populations at z ~
          2 only account for about 50% of the total metals predicted.

          Letters
          In   the   context  of  the  ``missing  metals  problem'',  the
          contributions  of  the  UV-selected  z=2.2  ``BX'' galaxies and
          z=2.5  ``distant  red galaxies'' (DRGs) have not been discussed
          previously.  Here  we  show that: (i) DRGs only make a marginal
          contribution  to  the  metal  budget  (~  5%); (ii) BX galaxies
          contribute  as  much  as 18% to the metal budget; and (iii) the
          K-bright subsample ($K<20$) of the BX sample (likely equivalent
          to the `BzK' selected samples) contributes roughly half of this
          18%,  owing  both  to  their  larger  stellar masses and higher
          metallicities,  implying that the rare K-bright galaxies at z>2
          are  a  major  source of metals in the budget. We showed in the
          first  paper of this series that submm galaxies (SMGs) brighter
          than  3 mJy contribute ~5% (<9% as an upper limit) to the metal
          budget.  Adding  the  contribution  of SMGs and damped Ly-alpha
          absorbers, to the contribution of UV selected galaxies, implies
          that  at  least  30%  of  the  metals  (in  galaxies) have been
          accounted  for  at z=2. The cosmic metal density thus accounted
          for  is  ~  1.3\times 10^6 \rhosun. This is a lower limit given
          that  galaxies  on the faint-end of the luminosity function are
          not  included.  An  estimate  of  the distribution of metals in
          local  galaxies as a function luminosity suggests that galaxies
          with  luminosity  less than L^{\star}$ contribute about half of
          the  total  mass  of metals. If the metals in galaxies at z ~ 2
          are  similarly  distributed  then  faint  galaxies alone cannot
          solve the ``missing metals problem''. Galaxy populations at z ~
          2 only account for about 50% of the total metals predicted.

          A  five  square arcminute region around the luminous radio-loud
          quasar  SDSS  J0836+0054  (z=5.8)  hosts a wealth of associated
          galaxies,  characterized  by  very red (1.3 < i_775 - z_{850} <
          2.0)  color.  The  surface density of these z~5.8 candidates is
          approximately  six  times  higher than the number expected from
          deep   ACS   fields.   This   is  one  of  the  highest  galaxy
          overdensities at high redshifts, which may develop into a group
          or cluster. We also find evidence for a substructure associated
          with  one  of  the  candidates. It has two very faint companion
          objects  within  two arcseconds, which are likely to merge. The
          finding  supports  the  results  of  a  recent  simulation that
          luminous  quasars  at  high redshifts lie on the most prominent
          dark-matter  filaments  and  are  surrounded  by  many  fainter
          galaxies. The quasar activity from these regions may signal the
          buildup of a massive system.

          Title: Tidal Capture of Stars by Intermediate-Mass Black Holes
          Authors: H. Baumgardt, C. Hopman, S. Portegies Zwart, J. Makino
          Comments: 13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Recent  X-ray  observations and theoretical modelling have made
          it  plausible  that  some ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX) are
          powered   by  intermediate-mass  black  holes  (IMBHs).  N-body
          simulations  have  also  shown that runaway merging of stars in
          dense  star  clusters  is  a  way to form IMBHs. In the present
          paper  we  have  performed N-body simulations of young clusters
          such  as  MGG-11  of  M82  in  which IMBHs form through runaway
          merging.  We  took  into account the effect of tidal heating of
          stars  by the IMBH to study the tidal capture and disruption of
          stars  by  IMBHs.  Our  results show that the IMBHs have a high
          chance  of  capturing  stars through tidal heating within a few
          core  relaxation times and we find that 1/3 of all runs contain
          a ULX within the age limits of MGG-11, a result consistent with
          the  fact  that  a  ULX  is  found  in this galaxy. Our results
          strengthen   the   case   for   some   ULX   being  powered  by
          intermediate-mass black holes.

          Title: The halo-model description of marked statistics
          Authors: Ravi K. Sheth
          Comments: 12 pages, 8 figures, MNRAS, in press
          Marked   statistics   allow   sensitive  tests  of  how  galaxy
          properties  correlate  with  environment,  as  well  as  of how
          correlations   between   galaxy   properties  are  affected  by
          environment. A halo-model description of marked correlations is
          developed,  which incorporates the effects which arise from the
          facts  that typical galaxy marks (e.g., luminosity, color, star
          formation  rate, stellar mass) depend on the mass of the parent
          halo,  and  that  massive  haloes  extend  to  larger radii and
          populate   denser  regions.  Comparison  with  measured  marked
          statistics  in semi-analytic galaxy formation models shows good
          agreement  on  scales  smaller than a Megaparsec, and excellent
          agreement  on  larger  scales. The halo-model description shows
          clearly  that the behaviour of some low-order marked statistics
          on  these scales encodes information about the mean galaxy mark
          as   a   function   of   halo   mass,  but  is  insensitive  to
          mark-gradients  within  haloes.  Higher-order statistics encode
          information  about  higher order moments of the distribution of
          marks  within haloes. This information is obtained without ever
          having   to   identify   haloes   or  clusters  in  the  galaxy
          distribution.   On   scales  smaller  than  a  Megaparsec,  the
          halo-model  calculation  shows  that  marked  statistics  allow
          sensitive  tests  of  whether or not central galaxies in haloes
          are  a  special  population.  A prescription for including more
          general  mark-gradients  in  the halo-model description is also
          provided.   The   formalism   developed  here  is  particularly
          well-suited   to   interpretation   of   marked  statistics  in
          astrophysical  datasets,  because  it  is  phrased  in the same
          language  that  is  currently  used  to interpret more standard
          measures of galaxy clustering.

          Title: Marked correlations in galaxy formation models
          Authors: Ravi K. Sheth, Andrew J. Connolly, Ramin Skibba
          Comments: 13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS in July 2005
          The  two-point  correlation  function  has  been  the  standard
          statistic  for  quantifying  how  galaxies  are  clustered. The
          statistic  uses  the  positions  of  galaxies,  but  not  their
          properties.  Clustering as a function of galaxy property, be it
          type,  luminosity, color, etc., is usually studied by analysing
          a  subset  of  the  full population, the galaxies in the subset
          chosen  because  they  have  a  similar range of properties. We
          explore  an  alternative  technique---marked  correlations---in
          which  one  weights  galaxies  by  some property or `mark' when
          measuring   clustering   statistics.  Marked  correlations  are
          particularly  well-suited  to quantifying how the properties of
          galaxies   correlate   with   their   environment.   Therefore,
          measurements  of  marked  statistics,  with luminosity, stellar
          mass,  color,  star-formation  rate,  etc.  as the mark, permit
          sensitive   tests   of   galaxy   formation   models.  We  make
          measurements  of such marked statistics in semi-analytic galaxy
          formation   models   to   illustrate   their   utility.   These
          measurements  show that close pairs of galaxies are expected to
          be red, to have larger stellar masses, and to have smaller star
          formation  rates.  We  also  show  that  the  simplest unbiased
          estimator of the particular marked statistic we use extensively
          is very simple to measure---it does not require construction of
          a  random  catalog---and  provide  an estimate of its variance.
          Large  wide-field  surveys  of  the sky are revolutionizing our
          view of galaxies and how they evolve. Our results indicate that
          application  of  marked  statistics  to  this  high quantity of
          high-quality  data  will  provide a wealth of information about
          galaxy formation.

          Title:   Statistics   of  Pressure  Fluctuations  in  Decaying,

          Dynamics
          We   present   results   from   a  systematic  direct-numerical
          simulation  study  of  pressure  fluctuations  in  an unforced,
          incompressible,  homogeneous,  and isotropic, three-dimensional
          turbulent  fluid.  At  cascade  completion,  isosurfaces of low
          pressure  are  found  to  be  organised  as  slender filaments,
          whereas  the  predominant  isostructures  appear sheet-like. We
          exhibit  several  new  results,  including plots of probability
          distributions   of   the   spatial   pressure-difference,   the
          pressure-gradient    norm,   and   the   eigenvalues   of   the
          pressure-hessian tensor. Plots of the temporal evolution of the
          mean  pressure-gradient  norm,  and the mean eigenvalues of the
          pressure-hessian   tensor  are  also  exhibited.  We  find  the
          statistically  preferred  orientations between the eigenvectors
          of  the  pressure-hessian  tensor,  the  pressure-gradient, the
          eigenvectors  of the strain-rate tensor, the vorticity, and the
          velocity.  Statistical  properties of the non-local part of the
          pressure-hessian tensor are also exhibited, for the first time.
          We  present  numerical  tests  (in  the  viscous  case) of some
          conjectures  of  Ohkitani [Phys. Fluids A {\bf 5}, 2570 (1993)]
          and  Ohkitani  and  Kishiba  [Phys. Fluids {\bf 7}, 411 (1995)]
          concerning  the  pressure-hessian  and the strain-rate tensors,
          for   the  unforced,  incompressible,  three-dimensional  Euler
          equations.

          Title: The halo-model description of marked statistics
          Authors: Ravi K. Sheth
          Comments: 12 pages, 8 figures, MNRAS, in press
          Marked   statistics   allow   sensitive  tests  of  how  galaxy
          properties  correlate  with  environment,  as  well  as  of how
          correlations   between   galaxy   properties  are  affected  by
          environment. A halo-model description of marked correlations is
          developed,  which incorporates the effects which arise from the
          facts  that typical galaxy marks (e.g., luminosity, color, star
          formation  rate, stellar mass) depend on the mass of the parent
          halo,  and  that  massive  haloes  extend  to  larger radii and
          populate   denser  regions.  Comparison  with  measured  marked
          statistics  in semi-analytic galaxy formation models shows good
          agreement  on  scales  smaller than a Megaparsec, and excellent
          agreement  on  larger  scales. The halo-model description shows
          clearly  that the behaviour of some low-order marked statistics
          on  these scales encodes information about the mean galaxy mark
          as   a   function   of   halo   mass,  but  is  insensitive  to
          mark-gradients  within  haloes.  Higher-order statistics encode
          information  about  higher order moments of the distribution of
          marks  within haloes. This information is obtained without ever
          having   to   identify   haloes   or  clusters  in  the  galaxy
          distribution.   On   scales  smaller  than  a  Megaparsec,  the
          halo-model  calculation  shows  that  marked  statistics  allow
          sensitive  tests  of  whether or not central galaxies in haloes
          are  a  special  population.  A prescription for including more
          general  mark-gradients  in  the halo-model description is also
          provided.   The   formalism   developed  here  is  particularly
          well-suited   to   interpretation   of   marked  statistics  in
          astrophysical  datasets,  because  it  is  phrased  in the same
          language  that  is  currently  used  to interpret more standard
          measures of galaxy clustering.

          Title: Marked correlations in galaxy formation models
          Authors: Ravi K. Sheth, Andrew J. Connolly, Ramin Skibba
          Comments: 13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS in July 2005
          The  two-point  correlation  function  has  been  the  standard
          statistic  for  quantifying  how  galaxies  are  clustered. The
          statistic  uses  the  positions  of  galaxies,  but  not  their
          properties.  Clustering as a function of galaxy property, be it
          type,  luminosity, color, etc., is usually studied by analysing
          a  subset  of  the  full population, the galaxies in the subset
          chosen  because  they  have  a  similar range of properties. We
          explore  an  alternative  technique---marked  correlations---in
          which  one  weights  galaxies  by  some property or `mark' when
          measuring   clustering   statistics.  Marked  correlations  are
          particularly  well-suited  to quantifying how the properties of
          galaxies   correlate   with   their   environment.   Therefore,
          measurements  of  marked  statistics,  with luminosity, stellar
          mass,  color,  star-formation  rate,  etc.  as the mark, permit
          sensitive   tests   of   galaxy   formation   models.  We  make
          measurements  of such marked statistics in semi-analytic galaxy
          formation   models   to   illustrate   their   utility.   These
          measurements  show that close pairs of galaxies are expected to
          be red, to have larger stellar masses, and to have smaller star
          formation  rates.  We  also  show  that  the  simplest unbiased
          estimator of the particular marked statistic we use extensively
          is very simple to measure---it does not require construction of
          a  random  catalog---and  provide  an estimate of its variance.
          Large  wide-field  surveys  of  the sky are revolutionizing our
          view of galaxies and how they evolve. Our results indicate that
          application  of  marked  statistics  to  this  high quantity of
          high-quality  data  will  provide a wealth of information about
          galaxy formation.

          We   present   results   from   a  systematic  direct-numerical
          simulation  study  of  pressure  fluctuations  in  an unforced,
          incompressible,  homogeneous,  and isotropic, three-dimensional
          turbulent  fluid.  At  cascade  completion,  isosurfaces of low
          pressure  are  found  to  be  organised  as  slender filaments,
          whereas  the  predominant  isostructures  appear sheet-like. We
          exhibit  several  new  results,  including plots of probability
          distributions   of   the   spatial   pressure-difference,   the
          pressure-gradient    norm,   and   the   eigenvalues   of   the
          pressure-hessian tensor. Plots of the temporal evolution of the
          mean  pressure-gradient  norm,  and the mean eigenvalues of the
          pressure-hessian   tensor  are  also  exhibited.  We  find  the
          statistically  preferred  orientations between the eigenvectors
          of  the  pressure-hessian  tensor,  the  pressure-gradient, the
          eigenvectors  of the strain-rate tensor, the vorticity, and the
          velocity.  Statistical  properties of the non-local part of the
          pressure-hessian tensor are also exhibited, for the first time.
          We  present  numerical  tests  (in  the  viscous  case) of some

          A  five  square arcminute region around the luminous radio-loud
          quasar  SDSS  J0836+0054  (z=5.8)  hosts a wealth of associated
          galaxies,  characterized  by  very red (1.3 < i_775 - z_{850} <
          2.0)  color.  The  surface density of these z~5.8 candidates is
          approximately  six  times  higher than the number expected from
          deep   ACS   fields.   This   is  one  of  the  highest  galaxy
          overdensities at high redshifts, which may develop into a group
          or cluster. We also find evidence for a substructure associated
          with  one  of  the  candidates. It has two very faint companion
          objects  within  two arcseconds, which are likely to merge. The
          finding  supports  the  results  of  a  recent  simulation that
          luminous  quasars  at  high redshifts lie on the most prominent
          dark-matter  filaments  and  are  surrounded  by  many  fainter
          galaxies. The quasar activity from these regions may signal the
          buildup of a massive system.

          Title: Tidal Capture of Stars by Intermediate-Mass Black Holes
          Authors: H. Baumgardt, C. Hopman, S. Portegies Zwart, J. Makino
          Comments: 13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Recent  X-ray  observations and theoretical modelling have made
          it  plausible  that  some ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX) are
          powered   by  intermediate-mass  black  holes  (IMBHs).  N-body
          simulations  have  also  shown that runaway merging of stars in
          dense  star  clusters  is  a  way to form IMBHs. In the present
          paper  we  have  performed N-body simulations of young clusters
          such  as  MGG-11  of  M82  in  which IMBHs form through runaway
          merging.  We  took  into account the effect of tidal heating of
          stars  by the IMBH to study the tidal capture and disruption of
          stars  by  IMBHs.  Our  results show that the IMBHs have a high
          chance  of  capturing  stars through tidal heating within a few
          core  relaxation times and we find that 1/3 of all runs contain
          a ULX within the age limits of MGG-11, a result consistent with
          the  fact  that  a  ULX  is  found  in this galaxy. Our results
          strengthen   the   case   for   some   ULX   being  powered  by
          intermediate-mass black holes.

          Title: The halo-model description of marked statistics
          Authors: Ravi K. Sheth
          Comments: 12 pages, 8 figures, MNRAS, in press
          Marked   statistics   allow   sensitive  tests  of  how  galaxy
          properties  correlate  with  environment,  as  well  as  of how
          correlations   between   galaxy   properties  are  affected  by
          environment. A halo-model description of marked correlations is
          developed,  which incorporates the effects which arise from the
          facts  that typical galaxy marks (e.g., luminosity, color, star
          formation  rate, stellar mass) depend on the mass of the parent
          halo,  and  that  massive  haloes  extend  to  larger radii and
          populate   denser  regions.  Comparison  with  measured  marked
          statistics  in semi-analytic galaxy formation models shows good
          agreement  on  scales  smaller than a Megaparsec, and excellent
          agreement  on  larger  scales. The halo-model description shows
          clearly  that the behaviour of some low-order marked statistics
          on  these scales encodes information about the mean galaxy mark
          as   a   function   of   halo   mass,  but  is  insensitive  to
          mark-gradients  within  haloes.  Higher-order statistics encode
          information  about  higher order moments of the distribution of
          marks  within haloes. This information is obtained without ever
          having   to   identify   haloes   or  clusters  in  the  galaxy
          distribution.   On   scales  smaller  than  a  Megaparsec,  the
          halo-model  calculation  shows  that  marked  statistics  allow
          sensitive  tests  of  whether or not central galaxies in haloes
          are  a  special  population.  A prescription for including more
          general  mark-gradients  in  the halo-model description is also

          Title:   Selecting  damped  Lyman-alpha  systems  through  CaII
          absorption. I: Dust depletions and reddening at z~1
          Authors:  Vivienne Wild (1,2), Paul Hewett (2), Max Pettini (2)
          ((1) MPA Garching, (2) IoA Cambridge)
          Comments: 22 pages, 16 figures, accepted MNRAS
          We use the average E(B-V) and ZnII column densities of a sample
          of  z~1 CaII (3935, 3970) absorption line systems selected from
          the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS  DR4)  to  show that on
          average,  with conservative assumptions regarding metallicities
          and  dust-to-gas  ratios,  they  contain  column  densities  of
          neutral  hydrogen  greater  than  the  damped Lyman-alpha (DLA)
          limit.  We  propose  that  selection  by  CaII absorption is an
          effective  way  of identifying high column densities of neutral
          hydrogen,  and  thus  large  samples  of DLAs at z<1.3 from the
          SDSS.  The  number  density  of  strong  CaII  absorbers  (with
          rest-frame  equivalent  width W_3935>0.5AA), is ~20-30% that of
          DLAs,  after  correcting for the significant bias against their
          detection due to obscuration of the background quasars by dust.
          On  average  these  absorbers  have E(B-V)>0.1mag; the dustiest
          absorbers  show depletions of refractory elements at a level of
          the  largest depletions seen in DLAs. For the first time we can
          measure  the  dust-to-metals  ratio  in  a sample of absorption
          selected  galaxies,  and  find  values close to, or even larger
          than,  those  observed locally. All of these properties suggest
          that  a  substantial  fraction  of  the CaII absorbers are more
          chemically evolved than typical DLAs. From consideration of the
          E(B-V)  distribution in our sample, and assuming CaII absorbers
          represent  a subset of DLAs, we calculate that dust obscuration
          causes  an  underestimation in the number density of DLAs by at
          least  8-12%  at these redshifts. Finally, the removal of Broad
          Absorption  Line  (BAL)  quasars  from  the  SDSS quasar sample
          increases  the  sensitivity  of  the  detection of reddening by
          intervening   absorbers.  To  this  end,  we  describe  a  new,
          automated,   principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  method  for
          identifying BAL quasars. [abridged]

          Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their afterglows have been proposed
          as  an  excellent  probe  to study the evolution of cosmic star
          formation,  the  reionization  of the intergalactic medium, and
          the  metal enrichment history of the universe, since the prompt
          gamma-ray   emission  of  GRBs  should  be  detectable  out  to
          distances  z>10.  Hitherto, the highest measured redshift for a
          GRB has been z=4.50. Here we report the optical spectrum of the
          afterglow  of GRB 050904 obtained 3.4 days after the burst. The
          spectrum  shows a clear continuum at the long wavelength end of
          the  spectrum  with  a  sharp cutoff at around 9000 A due to Ly
          alpha  absorption  at  a  redshift  of 6.3 with a damping wing.
          Little  flux  is  present  in  the waveband shortward of the Ly
          alpha  break. A system of absorption lines of heavy elements at
          redshift  z=6.295  +-  0.002  were  also  detected,  yielding a
          precise  measurement  of  the  largest known redshift of a GRB.
          Analysis  of  the  Si  II  fine structure lines suggest a dense
          metal-enriched environment around the GRB progenitor, providing
          unique  information  on  the  properties of the gas in a galaxy
          when the universe was younger than one billion years.

          Title:  Probing for evolutionary links between local ULIRGs and
          QSOs from NIR spectroscopy
          Authors:  K. M. Dasyra, L. J. Tacconi, R. I. Davies, R. Genzel,
          D. Lutz, T. Naab, D. B. Sanders, S. Veilleux, A. J. Baker
          Comments:  To  appear  in the "QSO Host Galaxies: Evolution and
          Environment"  conference  proceedings;  meeting held in Leiden,
          August 2005
          We  present a study of the dynamical evolution of Ultraluminous
          Infrared   Galaxies  (ULIRGs),  merging  galaxies  of  infrared
          luminosity  >10^12 L_sun. During our Very Large Telescope large
          program,  we have obtained ISAAC near-infrared, high-resolution
          spectra  of  54  ULIRGs (at several merger phases) and 12 local
          Palomar-Green  QSOs  to investigate whether ULIRGs go through a
          QSO  phase  during  their  evolution. One possible evolutionary
          scenario  is  that  after  nuclear  coalescence, the black hole
          radiates  close  to  Eddington to produce QSO luminosities. The
          mean  stellar  velocity  dispersion  that  we  measure from our
          spectra  is  similar (~160 km/s) for 30 post-coalescence ULIRGs
          and  7 IR-bright QSOs. The black holes in both populations have
          masses  of  order 10^7-10^8 M_sun (calculated from the relation
          to  the  host  dispersion) and accrete at rates >0.5 Eddington.
          Placing  ULIRGs  and IR-bright QSOs on the fundamental plane of
          early-type  galaxies  shows  that they are located on a similar
          region  (that  of  moderate-mass  ellipticals),  in contrast to
          giant  ellipticals  and radio-loud QSOs. While this preliminary
          comparison  of  the  ULIRG  and QSO host kinematical properties
          indicates  that  (some) ULIRGs may undergo a QSO phase in their
          evolutionary  history  before  they settle down as ellipticals,
          further  data  on non-IR excess QSOs are necessary to test this
          scenario.

          Title:  GMRT  observations  of  the  field  of  INTEGRAL  X-ray
          sources- II (newly discovered hard X-ray sources)
          Authors:  M. Pandey, A. P. Rao, R. Manchanda, P. Durouchoux, C.

          Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures. Accepted A&A
          We  have  conducted  low-frequency  radio observations with the
          Giant  Metrewave  Radio  Telescope  (GMRT) of 40 new hard X-ray
          sources  discovered  by the INTEGRAL satellite. This survey was
          conducted  in  order,  to  study  radio  emissions  from  these
          sources,  to  provide  precise  position  and  to  identify new
          microquasar  candidates.  From our observations we find that 24
          of  the X-ray sources have radio candidates within the INTEGRAL
          error  circle.  Based  on the radio morphology, variability and
          information available from different wavelengths, we categorize
          them as seventeen Galactic sources (4 unresolved, 7 extended, 6
          extended  sources  in  diffuse  region) and seven extragalactic
          sources  (2  unresolved,  5  extended).  Detailed  account  for
          seventeen  of  these  sources  was  presented in earlier paper.
          Based  on the radio data for the remaining sources at 0.61 GHz,
          and the available information from NVSS, DSS, 2MASS and NED, we
          have  identified possible radio counterparts for the hard X-ray
          sources.  The  three unresolved sources, viz IGR J17303$-$0601,
          IGR  J17464$-$3213,  and  IGR  J18406$-$0539  are  discussed in
          detail.  These  sources  have been identified as X-ray binaries
          with  compact  central  engine and variable in X-ray and in the
          radio,   and   are  most  likely  microquasar  candidates.  The
          remaining  fourteen  sources have extended radio morphology and
          are either diffuse Galactic regions or extragalactic in origin.

          Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures
          We  present the first detailed low frequency radio measurements
          of the galactic microquasar GRS1915+105 with GMRT. Simultaneous
          observations were carried out at 610 and 244 MHz. Our data does
          not  show any signature of spectral turn over even at low radio
          frequency  of 244 MHz. We propose that while the radio emission
          at high radio frequencies could predominantly come from compact
          jets,  the  emission at lower frequency originates in the lobes
          at the end of the jet which acts like a reservoir of low energy
          electrons.

          Title:  The  Effect  of  Gravitational  Recoil  on  Black Holes
          Forming in a Hierarchical Universe
          Authors: N. I. Libeskind, S. Cole, C. S. Frenk, J. C. Helly
          Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures, Submitted to MNRAS
          Galactic  bulges are known to harbour central black holes whose
          mass  is  tightly correlated with the stellar mass and velocity
          dispersion of the bulge. In a hierarchical universe, mergers of
          subgalactic units are accompanied by the amalgamation of bulges
          and  the  likely  coalescence of galactocentric black holes. In
          these  mergers,  the  beaming of gravitational radiation during
          the  plunge  phase  of  the  black  hole collision can impart a
          linear   momentum  kick  or  ``gravitational  recoil''  to  the
          remnant. If large enough, this kick will eject the remnant from
          the  galaxy  and  populate  intergalactic  space with wandering
          black  holes.  Using a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation,
          we  investigate  the  effect  of  black  hole  ejections on the
          scatter  in  the relation between black hole and bulge mass. We
          find  that  although  not  the  dominant source of the measured
          scatter,  they  do  make  a significant contribution and may be
          used  to set a constraint, v_kick<500 km/s, on the typical kick
          velocity,   in   agreement   with  values  found  from  general
          relativistic  calculations.  Even  for  the  more  modest  kick
          velocities  implied  by  these  calculations,  we  find  that a
          substantial  number of central black holes are ejected from the
          progenitors   of   present  day  galaxies,  giving  rise  to  a
          population of wandering intrahalo and intergalactic black holes
          whose  distribution  we  investigate  in high-resolution N-body
          simulations  of Milk-Way mass halos. We find that intergalactic
          black holes make up only ~2-3% of the total galactic black hole
          mass  but,  within a halo, wandering black holes can contribute
          up  to  about  half  of  the total black hole mass orbiting the
          central   galaxy.   Intrahalo   black  holes  offer  a  natural
          explanation  for  the compact X-ray sources often seen near the
          centres of galaxies and for the hyperluminous non-central X-ray
          source in M82.

          We  present  the  discovery of seven quasars at z>5.7, selected
          from  ~2000  deg^2  of  multicolor  imaging  data  of the Sloan
          Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS).  The new quasars have redshifts z
          from  5.79  to  6.13.  Five  are selected as part of a complete
          flux-limited sample in the SDSS Northern Galactic Cap; two have
          larger  photometric  errors  and  are  not part of the complete
          sample.  One  of  the  new  quasars,  SDSS J1335+3533 (z=5.93),
          exhibits no emission lines; the 3-sigma limit on the rest-frame
          equivalent  width of Ly alpha+NV line is 5 A. It is the highest
          redshift  lineless  quasar  known, and could be a gravitational
          lensed galaxy, a BL Lac object or a new type of quasar. Two new
          z>6  quasars,  SDSS  1250+3130  (z=6.13)  and  SDSS  J1137+3549
          (z=6.01),  show deep Gunn-Peterson absorption gaps in Ly alpha.
          These  gaps  are narrower the complete Gunn-Peterson absorption
          troughs  observed  among  quasars  at  z>6.2  and  do  not have
          complete Ly beta absorption.

          Comments: AJ, submitted, 56 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables
          We  study  the  evolution of the ionization state of the IGM at
          the  end of the reionization epoch using spectra of a sample of
          nineteen  quasars  at 5.74<z<6.42 discovered in the SDSS. Three
          methods  are used to trace IGM properties: (a) the evolution of
          the  Gunn-Peterson  optical  depth  in  the  Ly alpha,beta, and
          gamma;  (b)  the  distribution of dark absorption gaps, and (c)
          the  size  of  HII  regions  around  quasars.  We find that the
          evolution  of  the  IGM accelerated at z>5.7: the optical depth
          evolution  changes  from  tau ~ (1+z)^{4.3} to (1+z)^{>11}, and
          the average length of dark gaps with tau>3.5 increases from <10
          to  >80  comoving  Mpc.  The dispersion of IGM properties along
          different  lines  of  sight  also  increases  rapidly, implying
          fluctuations  by  a  factor  of >4 in the UV background at z>6,
          when  the  mean  free  path  of UV photons is comparable to the
          correlation  length  of  galaxies. The mean length of dark gaps
          shows the most dramatic increase at z~6, as well as the largest
          varianace.  We  suggest using dark gap statistics as a powerful
          probe  of  the  ionization  state  of  the  IGM  at  yet higher
          redshift.  The  sizes  of  HII  regions around quasars decrease
          rapidly  towards  higher  redshift, indicating that the neutral
          fraction of the IGM has increased by a factor of ~14 from z=5.7
          to  6.4.  The  mass-averaged  neutral fraction is 1-4% at z~6.2
          based  on  the  GP  optical  depth  and  HII  region sizes. The
          observations suggest that z~6 is the the end of the overlapping
          stage  of reionization, and are inconsistent with a neutral IGM
          at  z~6,  as  indicated by the finite length of dark absorption
          gaps.

          Journal-ref: ChJAA, Vol. 5(2005), Suppl., 269-272
          We  report  the  GMRT  observations of V4641 Sgr during the May
          2002  outburst at radio frequencies of 610 and 244 MHz. This is
          the  lowest  frequency  radio  detection  of  this  source. The
          present   low   frequency  radio  observations  clearly  showed
          spectral evolution from the optically thick to thin state. This
          behavior is broadly consistent with the expanding bubble model.
          However,  the  flux densities observed at lower frequencies are
          much  higher  than  predicted by this model. In the conical jet
          model, this discrepancy could be reconciled.

          We  have  carried  out  a high angular resolution near-infrared
          imaging  study  of  the  fields  of  6  quasars  with  7 strong
          absorption line systems at z < 0.5, using the Hokupa'a adaptive
          optics  system  and  the  QUIRC  near-infrared  camera  on  the
          Gemini-North  telescope.  These  absorption  systems  include 4
          classical  damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs), 2 sub-DLAs, and
          one  Lyman-limit  system.  Images  were obtained in the H or K'
          filters  with FWHM between 0.2"-0.5" with the goal of detecting
          the  absorbing  galaxies  and  identifying  their morphologies.
          Features  are  seen at projected separations of 0.5"-16.0" from
          the quasars and all of the fields show features at less than 2"
          separation.  We  find  candidate  absorbers in all of the seven
          systems.  With the assumption that some of these are associated
          with the absorbers, the absorbers are low luminosity < 0.1 L*_H
          or L*_K; we do not find any large bright candidate absorbers in
          any  of  our fields. Some fields show compact features that are
          too faint for quantitative morphology, but could arise in dwarf
          galaxies.

          Comments: accepted for publication in A&A
          We  present  UVES  observations  of  the log N(HI)= 21.7 damped
          Lyman-alpha   system   at  z=2.03954  towards  the  quasar  PKS
          0458-020.  HI Lyman-alpha emission is detected in the center of
          the  damped  Lyman-alpha  absorption  trough. Metallicities are
          derived  for MgII, SiII, PII, CrII, MnII, FeII and ZnII and are
          found   to   be   -1.21\pm0.12,   -1.28\pm0.20,   -1.54\pm0.11,
          -1.66\pm0.10,    -2.05\pm0.11,    -1.87\pm0.11,   -1.22\pm0.10,
          respectively,  relative  to  solar.  The  depletion  factor  is
          therefore  of  the  order  of  [Zn/Fe]=0.65.  We  observe metal
          absorption  lines to be blueshifted compared to the Lyman-alpha
          emission  up  to  a  maximum  of  100  and 200 km/s for low and
          high-ionization  species  respectively. This can be interpreted
          either  as  the consequence of rotation in a large (~7kpc) disk
          or  as  the imprint of a galactic wind. The star formation rate
          (SFR)   derived   from  the  Lyman-alpha  emission,  1.6  solar
          masses/yr,  is  compared  with that estimated from the observed
          CII* absorption. No molecular hydrogen is detected in our data,
          yielding  a  molecular fraction f<-6.52. This absence of H2 can
          be explained as the consequence of a high ambient UV flux which
          is  one  order  of magnitude larger than the radiation field in
          the  ISM  of our Galaxy and originates in the observed emitting
          region.

          Title:   Constraining   the   reionization   history  with  QSO
          absorption spectra
          Authors:   S.   Gallerani,   T.   Roy   Choudhury,  A.  Ferrara
          (SISSA/ISAS)
          Comments: 24 pages, 22 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  use  a  semi-analytical  approach  to  simulate  absorption
          spectra  of QSOs at high redshifts with the aim of constraining
          the  cosmic  reionization  history.  We consider two physically
          motivated  and  detailed  reionization  histories: (i) an Early
          Reionization  Model  (ERM) in which the intergalactic medium is
          reionized  by  PopIII  stars  at $z\approx 14$, and (ii) a more
          standard  Late  Reionization  Model (LRM) in which overlapping,
          induced  by  QSOs  and normal galaxies, occurs at $z\approx 6$.
          From the analysis of current Ly$\alpha$ forest data at $z < 6$,
          we  conclude  that  it  is  impossible  to  disentangle the two
          scenarios,  which  fit  equally well the observed Gunn-Peterson
          optical  depth, flux probability distribution function and dark
          gap  width  distribution.  At $z>6$, however, clear differences
          start  to  emerge which are best quantified by the dark gap and
          peak  width  distributions.  We find that 35 (zero) per cent of
          the  lines  of sight within $5.7< z <6.3$ show dark gaps widths
          $>50$  Angstrom in the rest frame of the QSO if reionization is
          not (is) complete at $z \gtrsim 6$. Similarly, the ERM predicts
          peaks of width $\sim 1$ Angstrom in 40 per cent of the lines of
          sight  in  the redshift range $6.0-6.6$; in the same range, LRM
          predicts  no  peaks  of width $>0.8$ Angstrom. We conclude that
          the  dark gap and peak width statistics represent superb probes

          The  gamma-ray burst (GRB) 050904 at z = 6.3 provides the first
          opportunity  of  probing the intergalactic medium (IGM) by GRBs
          at  the  epoch  of the reionization. Here we present a spectral
          modeling  analysis  of  the optical afterglow spectrum taken by
          the  Subaru  Telescope,  aiming  to  constrain the reionization
          history. The spectrum shows a clear damping wing at wavelengths
          redward  of  the  Lyman  break,  and  the wing shape can be fit
          either by a damped Ly alpha system with a column density of log
          N_HI  ~  21.6  at  a  redshift  close  to  the  detected  metal
          absorption  lines (z_{metal} = 6.295), or by almost neutral IGM
          extending to a slightly higher redshift of z_{IGM,u} ~ 6.36. In
          the latter case, the difference from z_{metal} may be explained
          by  acceleration of metal absorbing shells by the activities of
          the GRB or its progenitor. However, we exclude this possibility
          by  using  the  light  transmission  feature around the Ly beta
          resonance,  leading to a firm upper limit of z_{IGM,u} < 6.314.
          We  then  show  an  evidence  that  the IGM was largely ionized
          already  at  z=6.3,  with the best-fit neutral fraction of IGM,
          x_HI  =  0.00  +-  0.17, and an upper limit of x_HI < 0.60 (95%
          C.L.).  This is the first quantitative upper limit on x_HI at z
          > 6. Various systematic uncertainties are examined, but none of
          them  appears  large  enough  to change this conclusion. To get
          further  information  on  the  reionization, it is important to
          increase  the  sample  size of z >6 GRBs, to find GRBs with low
          column  densities  (log N_HI <~ 20) within their host galaxies,
          and for statistical studies of Ly alpha line emission from host
          galaxies.

          Title:  Gamma  Rays  from  Compton  Scattering  in  the Jets of
          Microquasars: Application to LS 5039
          Authors:  Charles D. Dermer (1), Markus Boettcher (2) ((1) NRL,
          (2) Ohio U.)
          Comments: 33 pages, 11 figures, submitted to ApJ
          Recent  HESS  observations  show that microquasars in high-mass
          systems are sources of VHE gamma-rays. A leptonic jet model for
          microquasar  gamma-ray emission is developed. Using the head-on
          approximation  for  the  Compton  cross section and taking into
          account  angular  effects  from  the  star's orbital motion, we
          derive expressions to calculate the spectrum of gamma rays when
          nonthermal jet electrons Compton-scatter photons of the stellar
          radiation  field.  Calculations  are  presented  for  power-law
          distributions  of  nonthermal  electrons that are assumed to be
          isotropically  distributed  in  the  comoving  jet  frame,  and
          applied  to  $\gamma$-ray  observations of LS 5039. We conclude
          that (1) the TeV emission measured with HESS cannot result only
          from  Compton-scattered  stellar radiation (CSSR), but could be
          synchrotron  self-Compton  (SSC)  emission  or a combination of
          CSSR and SSC; (2) fitting both the HESS data and the EGRET data
          associated  with  LS  5039  requires a very improbable leptonic
          model  with  a  very  hard electron spectrum. Because the gamma
          rays  would  be variable in a leptonic jet model, the data sets
          are  unlikely to be representative of a simultaneously measured
          gamma-ray  spectrum.  We  therefore  attribute EGRET gamma rays
          primarily  to  CSSR  emission,  and  HESS  gamma  rays  to  SSC
          emission.  Detection of periodic modulation of the TeV emission
          from  LS  5039  would  favor  a  leptonic SSC or cascade hadron
          origin  of  the  emission  in the inner jet, whereas stochastic
          variability alone would support a more extended leptonic model.
          The puzzle of the EGRET gamma rays from LS 5039 will be quickly
          solved with GLAST. (Abridged)

          Title:   Two-dimensional   radiation-hydrodynamic   model   for
          limit-cycle oscillations of luminous accretion disks
          Authors: K. Ohsuga
          Comments:  6  pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          (ApJ 01 April 2006, v640, 2 issue)
          We  investigate  the time evolution of luminous accretion disks
          around    black    holes,    conducting   the   two-dimensional
          radiation-hydrodynamic   simulations.   We   adopt   the  alpha
          prescription  for the viscosity. The radial-azimuthal component
          of  viscous  stress tensor is assumed to be proportional to the
          total  pressure  in  the  optically thick region, while the gas
          pressure in the optically thin regime. The viscosity parameter,
          alpha, is taken to be 0.1. We find the limit-cycle variation in
          luminosity  between  high  and low states. When we set the mass
          input  rate from the outer disk boundary to be 100 L_E/c^2, the
          luminosity suddenly rises from 0.3L_E to 2L_E, where L_E is the
          Eddington  luminosity. It decays after retaining high value for
          about  40  s.  Our  numerical results can explain the variation
          amplitude  and  duration of the recurrent outbursts observed in
          microquasar,  GRS  1915+105. We show that the multi-dimensional
          effects play an important role in the high-luminosity state. In
          this  state,  the  outflow  is  driven  by the strong radiation
          force,  and some part of radiation energy dissipated inside the
          disk  is swallowed by the black hole due to the photon-trapping
          effects.  This  trapped  luminosity  is  comparable to the disk
          luminosity.  We  also calculate two more cases: one with a much
          larger   accretion   rate  than  the  critical  value  for  the
          instability  and the other with the viscous stress tensor being
          proportional  to  the gas pressure only even when the radiation
          pressure   is   dominant.   We  find  no  quasi-periodic  light
          variations  in  these cases. This confirms that the limit-cycle
          behavior  found  in  the  simulations  is  caused  by  the disk
          instability.

          We present the first large-scale radiative transfer simulations
          of  cosmic  reionization,  in  a  simulation  volume  of (100/h
          Mpc)^3,  while  at  the  same time capturing the dwarf galaxies
          which  are  primarily  responsible for reionization. We achieve
          this   by   combining   the   results   from  extremely  large,
          cosmological, N-body simulations with a new, fast and efficient
          code   for   3D  radiative  transfer,  C^2-Ray.  The  resulting
          electron-scattering optical depth is in good agreement with the
          first-year  WMAP  polarization  data. We show that reionization
          clearly   proceeded   in   an   inside-out  fashion,  with  the
          high-density  regions  being  ionized earlier, on average, than
          the  voids.  Ionization  histories  of  smaller-size  (5  to 10
          comoving  Mpc) subregions exibit a large scatter about the mean
          and  do  not describe the global reionization history well. The
          minimum  reliable  volume size for such predictions is ~30 Mpc.
          We  derive  the power-spectra of the neutral, ionized and total
          gas  density  fields and show that there is a significant boost
          of the density fluctuations in both the neutral and the ionized
          components  relative  to  the  total  at  arcminute  and larger
          scales.  We  find  two  populations of HII regions according to
          their  size,  numerous,  mid-sized (~10 Mpc) regions and a few,
          rare,  very  large  regions  tens of Mpc in size. We derive the
          statistical  distributions  of the ionized fraction and ionized
          gas  density at various scales and for the first time show that
          both distributions are clearly non-Gaussian. (abridged)

          ((1)  SAp  CEA/Saclay,  France; (2) LAOG, Grenoble, France; (3)

          Comments:  12  pages, 6 figures (3 colour figures), accepted by
          A&A (in press)
          We   present   mid-infrared   (2-12   micron)  spectra  of  the
          microquasar SS 433 obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory
          (spectroscopic  mode of ISOPHOT and ISOCAM). We compare them to
          the  spectra  of four Wolf-Rayet stars: WR78, WR134, WR136, and
          WR147  in  the same wavelength range. The mid-infrared spectrum
          of  SS  433  mainly shows HI and HeI emission lines and is very
          similar  to  the  spectrum of WR147, a WN8(h)+B0.5V binary. The
          2-12  micron  continuum  emission  of  SS  433  corresponds  to
          optically   thin   and   partially  optically  thick  free-free
          emission,  from  which  we  calculate a mass loss rate of 2-3 x
          10^{-4} Msun/yr if the wind is homogeneous and a third of these
          values  if  it  is  clumped.  This  is consistent with a strong
          stellar  wind from a WN star. However, following recent studies
          concluding  that  the  mass  donor  star  of  SS  433  is not a
          Wolf-Rayet  star,  we  propose  that this strong wind out flows
          from  a geometrically thick envelope of material that surrounds
          the  compact  object  like  a stellar atmosphere, imitating the
          Wolf-Rayet phenomenon. This wind could also wrap the mass donor
          star,  and  at larger distances (~ 40 AU), it might form a dust
          envelope from which the thermal emission, detected with ISOPHOT
          at  25  micron  and  60 micron, would originate. This wind also
          probably  feeds  the  material  that  is ejected in the orbital
          plane  of  the  binary  system  and  that  forms the equatorial
          outflow detected in radio at distances > 100 AU.

          Title:  The Impact of Galaxy Formation on the Sunyaev-Zeldovich
          Effect of Galaxy Clusters
          Authors: Daisuke Nagai (U.Chicago, KICP)
          Comments: submitted to ApJ, 12 pages, 7 figures
          We  study the effects of radiative cooling and galaxy formation
          on  the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observable-mass relations using
          high-resolution  cosmological  simulations  performed  with the
          shock-capturing     eulerian     adaptive    mesh    refinement
          N-body+gasdynamics  ART  code.  To  assess the impact of galaxy
          formation,  we compare two sets of simulations performed in the
          adiabatic   regime  and  with  radiative  cooling  and  several
          physical  processes  critical  to  various  aspects  of  galaxy
          formation:   star   formation,  metal  enrichment  and  stellar
          feedback. We show that the SZ signal integrated to sufficiently
          large  fraction  of the cluster volume correlates strongly with
          the  enclosed  cluster  mass,  regardless of the details of the
          cluster  physics  or  dynamical state of the cluster. The slope
          and  redshift  evolution  of the SZ flux-mass relation are also
          insensitive to the details of the cluster gas physics, and they
          are  well  characterized  by  the  simple  self-similar cluster
          model.  While  the  tightness, slope and redshift evolution are
          relatively   unaffected,   the  radiative  cooling  and  galaxy
          formation  significantly  modify  the  normalization  of the SZ
          scaling relations. The effect is due to the decrease in the hot
          gas  fraction,  which is offset slightly by the increase in the
          gas   temperature.  The  baryon  dissipation  also  causes  the
          increase   in   the   total   cluster  mass  and  modifies  the
          normalization  by  a  few  percent.  Finally,  we show that the
          simulations  that include gas cooling and star formation are in
          good  agreement with the recent observational results on the SZ
          scaling   relations,  highlighting  the  importance  of  galaxy
          formation in theoretical modelling of clusters.

          We  present  low-resolution  (64 < R < 124) mid-infrared (8--38
          micron) Spitzer/IRS spectra of two z~1.3 ultraluminous infrared
          galaxies  (LFIR~10^13)  discovered  in a Spitzer/MIPS survey of
          the  Bootes  field  of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey (NDWFS).
          MIPS  J142824.0+352619  is  a  bright  160 micron source with a
          large  infrared-to-optical  flux  density  ratio and a possible
          lensing  amplification  of  <~10.  The 6.2, 7.7, 11.3, and 12.8
          micron  PAH  emission  bands  in  its  IRS  spectrum indicate a
          redshift of z~1.3. The large equivalent width of the 6.2 micron
          PAH  feature  indicates  that  at least 50% of the mid-infrared
          energy  is  generated in a starburst, an interpretation that is
          supported by a large [NeII]/[NeIII] ratio and a low upper limit
          on  the  X-ray  luminosity.  SST 24J142827.19+354127.71 has the
          brightest 24 micron flux (10.55 mJy) among optically faint (R >
          20)  galaxies  in  the  NDWFS.  Its mid-infrared spectrum lacks
          emission features, but the broad 9.7 micron silicate absorption
          band  places  this  source  at  z~1.3. Given this redshift, SST
          24J142827.19+354127.71  has  among  the  largest  rest-frame  5
          micron  luminosities  known. The similarity of its SED to those
          of  known  AGN-dominated  ULIRGs  and  its  lack  of either PAH
          features  or  large  amounts  of  cool  dust  indicate that the
          powerful  mid-infrared  emission  is  dominated  by  an  active
          nucleus  rather  than  a  starburst. Our results illustrate the
          power  of  the  IRS  in  identifying  massive  galaxies  in the
          ``redshift  desert''  and  in  discerning  their power sources.
          Because  they are bright, MIPS J142824.0+352619 (pending future
          observations  to  constrain  its lensing amplification) and SST
          24J142827.19+354127.71  are  useful  z>1  templates  of  a high
          luminosity starburst and AGN, respectively.

          Title:  Weak Gravitational Lensing of High-Redshift 21 cm Power
          Spectra
          Authors: Kaisey S. Mandel, Matias Zaldarriaga (Harvard)
          Comments: 18 pages, 10 figures; submitting to ApJ
          We  describe  the  effects  of  weak  gravitational  lensing by
          cosmological  large  scale structure on the diffuse emission of
          21 centimeter radiation from neutral hydrogen at high redshifts
          during  the  era of reionization. The ability to observe radial
          information  through  the frequency, and thus three-dimensional
          regions  of  the  background  radiation at different redshifts,
          suggests  that  21  cm studies may provide a useful context for
          studying  weak  lensing  effects. We focus on the gravitational
          lensing  effects  on  both  the  angular  power spectra and the
          intrinsic,  three-dimensional  power  spectra. We present a new
          approach  for  calculating  the weak lensing signature based on
          integrating differential Fourier-space shells of the deflection
          field  and  approximating the magnification matrix. This method
          is  applied  to  reionization models of the 21 cm spectra up to
          small  angular  scales  over a range in redshift. The effect on
          the  angular  power spectrum is typically < 1% on small angular
          scales,  and  very small on scales corresponding to the feature
          imprinted  by  reionization  bubbles,  due  to  the  near-scale
          invariance of the angular power spectrum of the 21 cm signal on
          these  scales.  We describe the expected effect of weak lensing
          on three-dimensional 21 cm power spectra, and show that lensing
          creates   aspherical   perturbations  to  the  intrinsic  power
          spectrum which depend on the polar angle of the wavevector. The
          effect  on  the  3D  power  spectrum  is < 1% on scales k < 0.1
          h/Mpc,  but  can  be  >  1% for highly inclined modes for k > 1
          h/Mpc.  The  angular  variation  of the lensing effect on these
          scales  is well described by a quartic polynomial in the cosine
          of  the polar angle. The detection of the gravitational lensing
          effects  on  21  cm  power spectra will require very sensitive,
          high  resolution  observations  by  future  low-frequency radio
          arrays.

          Title:  The  Transparency  of  the Universe Limited by Ly-alpha
          Clouds
          Authors: Rudolph E. Schild, Marius Dekker
          Comments: 8-Page article submitted to Astronomical Jounal
          The  brightnesses  of  supernovae  are  commonly  understood to
          indicate  that  cosmological  expansion  is accelerating due to
          dark energy. However the entire discussion presumes a perfectly
          transparent universe because no effects of reddening associated
          with  the  interstellar  extinction  law are seen. We note that
          with  two  kinds  of  dark  matter  (baryonic and non-baryonic)
          strongly  dominating  the  known  mass  of  the universe, it is
          seriously premature to assume that these dark matter components
          have   not   reduced  the  transmission  of  the  universe  for
          cosmological sources.
          We show that the long-known $Lyman-\alpha$ clouds, if nucleated
          by the population of baryonic dark matter primordial planetoids
          indicated by quasar microlensing, would act as spherical lenses
          and  achromatically  fade  cosmologically  distant  sources. We
          attempt to estimate the amount of this cosmological fading, but
          ultimately the calculation is limited by lack of a satisfactory
          model for the tenuous outer parts of a primordial planetoid. We
          also  consider  the  effects of such cosmological fading on the
          light of quasars.

          Title: The Nature of Weak MgII Absorbing Structures
          Authors:  Nikola Milutinovic, Jane R. Rigby, Joseph R. Masiero,
          Ryan S. Lynch, Chris Palma, Jane C. Charlton
          Comments: 25 pages, 19 figures, 4 tables
          Journal-ref: ApJ, April 10 2006, v641
          We  consider  geometries  and possible physical models for weak
          low ionization absorbers based on the relative incidence of low
          and  high ionization absorption systems. We found a total of 16
          metal-line  systems, with low and/or high ionization absorption
          detected  in  our  survey  of  weak  low  ionization absorption
          systems  from  the  archive  of  HST/STIS  data.  The  weak low
          ionization   absorbers   trace   an   abundant   population  of
          metal-enriched regions (close to solar metallicity). Generally,
          models  show  that  these systems have a ~10pc region of higher
          density gas and a ~1kpc region of lower density phase of higher
          ionization  absorption.  We compare absorption systems detected
          in  low  and/or  high ionization gas and find the following: 1)
          All  but 1 of the 10 weak low ionization systems have a related
          high  ionization  phase. In 3 cases the high ionization gas has
          only  a  single  component,  kinematically  centered on the low
          ionization  absorption,  and  in  the  other  6 cases there are
          additional  high  ionization components offset in velocity. The
          system,  toward  quasar  3C  273, do not have a high ionization
          cloud;  2) There are just 6 systems with only a high ionization
          phase  as  compared  to  the  9  systems with both low and high
          ionization  phases;  3)  The high ionization absorption in weak
          low ionization systems is, on average, stronger than in systems
          with   only   high  ionization  absorption;  4)  The  kinematic
          structure of the high ionization in weak low ionization systems
          is  similar  to  that  in high ionization only systems. We find
          that  filamentary  and sheetlike geometries are favored, due to
          the  relatively small observed cross-section of high ionization
          only systems. Although low ionization absorbers are not closely
          associated   with   luminous  galaxies,  they  arise  in  their
          immediate environments within the cosmic web.

          We  report  the  discoveries  of two, two-image gravitationally
          lensed quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: SDSS
          J0806+2006  at  z_s=1.540 and SDSS J1353+1138 at z_s=1.629 with
          image    separations   of   1.40"   and   1.41"   respectively.
          Spectroscopic   and   optical/near-infrared  imaging  follow-up
          observations   show  that  the  quasar  images  have  identical
          redshifts  and possess extended objects between the images that
          are  likely  to  be lens galaxies at z_l~0.6 in SDSS J0806+2006
          and  z_l~0.3  in  SDSS J1353+1138. The field of SDSS J0806+2006
          contains several nearby galaxies that may significantly perturb
          the system, and SDSS J1353+1138 has an extra component near its
          Einstein  ring  that is probably a foreground star. Simple mass
          models   with   reasonable   parameters  reproduce  the  quasar
          positions and fluxes of both systems.

          Title:  Constraints on Fundamental Cosmological Parameters with
          Upcoming Epoch of Reionization Observations
          Authors:  Judd  D.  Bowman,  Miguel  F.  Morales, Jacqueline N.
          Hewitt
          Comments: 7 pages, including 3 figures. Submitted to ApJ
          The  first generation of epoch of reionization experiments have
          the  potential  to  characterize  the  processes and history of
          reionization  for  redshifts  6<z<12  by  observing  the  power
          spectrum  of  the  redshifted  21  cm  radiation.  These  power
          spectrum observations could also contribute to our knowledge of
          the  underlying cosmology, particularly at redshifts before the
          effects  of  reionization  strongly  dominate  the cosmic radio
          background.   In   this   paper  we  explore  the  cosmological
          constraints  of  21  cm  power  spectrum  observations with the
          Mileura  Widefield Array (MWA) and its potential successor, the
          MWA5000,  assuming  a flat LCDM cosmology and that reionization
          occurs  below  a redshift of z=8. In addition to a standard set
          of  cosmological parameters, we include two nuisance parameters
          related  to  the  systematics  and  foregrounds  faced by radio
          observations.  While  the MWA observations cannot constrain the
          underlying cosmology, MWA5000 could provide useful constraints,
          in  particular on the slope of the inflationary power spectrum,
          n_s, and the running of the spectral index, alpha_s.

          Title:  Cosmological Parameter Estimation Using 21 cm Radiation
          from the Epoch of Reionization
          Authors: Matthew McQuinn, Oliver Zahn, Matias Zaldarriaga, Lars
          Hernquist, Steven R. Furlanetto
          Comments: 18 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ
          A  number  of radio interferometers are currently being planned
          or constructed to observe 21 cm emission from reionization. Not
          only  will  such  measurements  provide  a detailed view of the
          Epoch  of  Reionization,  but,  since  the  21 cm emission also
          traces  the distribution of matter in the Universe, this signal
          can be used to constrain cosmological parameters at redshifts 6
          ~<  z  ~<  20.  The  sensitivity  of  an  interferometer to the
          cosmological  information  in  the  signal  may  depend  on how
          precisely  the  angular  dependence  of  the  21  cm  3-D power
          spectrum  can  be  measured.  Here, we quantify all the effects
          that  break  the  spherical  symmetry  of  the  3-D 21 cm power
          spectrum  and produce physically motivated predictions for this
          power  spectrum,  utilizing an analytic model for reionization.
          We find that upcoming observatories will be sensitive to the 21
          cm  signal  over  a  wide range of scales, from larger than 100
          comoving  Mpc  to  as  small  as 1 comoving Mpc. We discuss how
          cosmological  parameters  can  be  measured,  and show that the
          first  generation  of  21  cm  observations  should  moderately
          improve  existing  constraints  on  cosmological parameters for
          certain   low-redshift   reionization  scenarios.  A  two  year
          observation  with  the second generation interferometer MWA5000
          in  combination  with  the  CMB  telescope  Planck  can improve
          constraints  on  Omega_w  (to  +- 0.019, a 30% improvement over
          Planck  alone),  Omega_m  h^2 (+- 0.0011, 50%), Omega_b h^2 (+-
          0.00013,  30%), Omega_nu (+-0.003, 300%), n_s (+- 0.0034, 30%),
          and  alpha_s  (+- 0.004, 100%). Larger interferometers, such as
          SKA,  have  the potential to do even better. If the Universe is
          substantially  ionized  by  z  ~  12  or  if  spin  temperature
          fluctuations  are  important, we show that it will be difficult
          to  place  competitive  constraints  on cosmological parameters
          with the 21 cm signal.

          Authors: A.V. Glushkov
          Comments: 34 pages, 18 figures
          The  three-dimensional  space distribution of 48921 quasars and
          16113  Seyfert  galaxies with redshifts z <= 6 is investigated.
          The global anisotropy caused by the shift of the observer place
          by  \simeq  50  Mpc  from  a center of their symmetry (supposed
          center  of  the  Metagalaxy)  to  the  side  of the vector with
          equatorial  coordinates  \alpha  \simeq  13  degrees and \delta
          \simeq  70  degrees  has  been  found in the placement of these
          objects.  In  the opposite direction there exists the extensive
          region  where  the  progressive  decrease  of redshifts up to a
          minimum  (near  \alpha  \simeq  193  degrees, \delta \simeq -70
          degrees)  is observed. The influence of gravitational potential
          and  possible  rotation  of the Metagalaxy on the anisotropy of
          redshifts of the cosmological objects has been considered.

          Comments: 52 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We examine the variability of the high-ionizaton C IV line in a
          sample  of 105 quasars observed at multiple epochs by the Sloan
          Digital  Sky  Survey.  We find a strong correlation between the
          change  in the C IV line flux and the change in the line width,
          but  no  correlations between the change in flux and changes in
          line center and skewness. The relation between line flux change
          and  line  width  change  is consistent with a model in which a
          broad  line  base  varies  with greater amplitude than the line
          core.  The objects studied here are more luminous and at higher
          redshift  than  those normally studied for variability, ranging
          in  redshift from 1.65 to 4.00 and in absolute r-band magnitude
          from  roughly  -24  to  -28. Using moment analysis line-fitting
          techniques,   we  measure  line  fluxes,  centers,  widths  and
          skewnesses for the C IV line at two epochs for each object. The
          well-known  Baldwin  Effect  is  seen for these objects, with a
          slope  beta  = -0.22. The sample has a median intrinsic Baldwin
          Effect  slope  of  beta  =  -0.85;  the  C  IV  lines  in these
          high-luminosity   quasars  appear  to  be  less  responsive  to
          continuum  variations  than  those  in  lower  luminosity  AGN.
          Additionally,  we  find no evidence for variability of the well
          known   blueshift  of  the  C  IV  line  with  respect  to  the
          low-ionization   Mg  II  line  in  the  highest  flux  objects,
          indicating  that this blueshift might be useful as a measure of
          orientation.

          Title: Simulating Wide-Field Quasar Surveys from the Optical to
          Near-Infrared
          Authors:   Natasha   Maddox,   Paul  C.  Hewett  (Institute  of
          Astronomy, Cambridge)
          Comments: 18 pages, 16 figures, accepted MNRAS
          A  number  of deep, wide-field, near-infrared surveys employing
          new  infrared  cameras  on  4m-class  telescopes  are  about to
          commence.  These  surveys  have  the potential to determine the
          fraction of luminous dust-obscured quasars that may have eluded
          surveys   undertaken   at  optical  wavelengths.  In  order  to
          understand  the  new  observations  it  is  essential  to  make
          accurate  predictions  of surface densities and number-redshift
          relations  for unobscured quasars in the near-infrared based on
          information  from  surveys at shorter wavelengths. The accuracy
          of  the  predictions  depends  critically  on  a  number of key
          components.  The  commonly used single power-law representation
          for   quasar   SEDs  is  inadequate  and  the  use  of  an  SED
          incorporating the upturn in continuum flux at lambda~12000 A is
          essential. The presence of quasar host galaxies is particularly
          important  over the restframe wavelength interval 8000 < lambda
          <  16000  A  and  we  provide an empirical determination of the
          magnitude  distribution  of  host galaxies using a low redshift
          sample  of  quasars from the SDSS DR3 quasar catalogue. A range
          of  models  for  the  dependence  of  host galaxy luminosity on
          quasar  luminosity is investigated, along with the implications
          for  the  near-infrared  surveys.  Even adopting a conservative
          model  for  the  behaviour of host galaxy luminosity the number
          counts  for  shallow surveys in the K-band increase by a factor
          of two. The degree of morphological selection applied to define
          candidate quasar samples in the near-infrared is found to be an
          important  factor  in  determining  the  fraction of the quasar
          population included in such samples.

          We report on ESO--VLT adaptive optics imaging of one radio-loud
          quasar  at  z  $\sim$  3. In spite of the large distance of the
          object   we   are  able  to  detect  its  surrounding  extended
          nebulosity  the  properties  of  which  are  consistent with an
          underlying  massive  galaxy  of M$_K$ $\sim$ --27 and effective
          radius  R$_e$  =  7 kpc. As far as we know this is the clearest
          detection  of  a  radio  loud quasar host at high redshift. The
          host  luminosity  is  indicative  of  the  existence of massive
          spheroids  even at this early cosmic epoch. The host luminosity
          is  about  1 magnitude fainter than the expected value based on
          the  average  trend  of  the  host  galaxies  of  RLQ  at lower
          redshift.  The  result,  which  however  is  based  on a single
          object, suggests that at z $\sim$ 3 there is a deviation from a
          luminosity--redshift   dependence  regulated  only  by  passive
          evolution.

          (abridged)  We  have  investigated  136  Chandra  extragalactic
          sources  without  broad  optical  emission  lines, including 93
          galaxies  with  narrow  emission  lines (NELG) and 43 with only
          absorption  lines  (ALG).  Based  on  fx/fo, Lx, X-ray spectral
          hardness   and  optical  emission  line  diagnostics,  we  have
          conservatively classified 36 normal galaxies (20 spirals and 16
          ellipticals) and 71 AGNs. We found no statistically significant
          evolution  in  Lx/LB, within the limited z range. We have built
          log(N)-log(S),  after  correcting  for  completeness based on a
          series  of  simulations.  The best-fit slope is -1.5 for both S
          and  B energy bands, which is considerably steeper than that of
          the  AGN-dominated  cosmic  background  sources,  but  slightly
          flatter  than the previous estimate, indicating normal galaxies
          will not exceed the AGN population until fx ~ 2 x 10-18 erg s-1
          cm-2 (a factor of ~5 lower than the previous estimate). A group
          of  NELGs  appear  to  be  heavily  obscured in X-rays, i.e., a
          typical  type 2 AGN. After correcting for intrinsic absorption,
          their  X-ray  luminosities  could be Lx > 10^44 erg s-1, making
          them  type  2 quasar candidates. While most X-ray luminous ALGs
          (XBONG  -  X-ray bright, optically normal galaxy candidates) do
          not  appear  to be significantly absorbed, we found two heavily
          obscured  objects,  which could be as luminous as an unobscured
          broad-line  quasar.  Among  43  ALGs,  we  found two E+A galaxy
          candidates  with  strong  Balmer absorption lines, but no [OII]
          line.  The  X-ray  spectra of both galaxies are soft and one of
          them  has  a  nearby  close  companion  galaxy,  supporting the
          merger/interaction  scenario  rather  than  the dusty starburst
          hypothesis.

          We  present  a  high-resolution,  high  signal-to-noise optical
          spectrum of the afterglow of GRB 051111 obtained with the HIRES
          spectrograph  on  the  Keck  I  10-m  telescope.  The  spectrum
          exhibits  three redshifted absorption systems with the highest,
          at  z=1.54948,  arising  in  the  GRB  host  galaxy.  While the
          Ly-alpha feature is outside the range of our spectrum, the high
          column  density of weakly-depleted Zn suggests that the host is
          a  damped  Lyman-alpha system with N(HI)>10^21(Z/Z_sun)^-1. The
          bulk  of  the gas (>80%) is confined to a narrow velocity range
          of  |v|<30  km/s exhibiting strong dust depletion of refractory
          elements such as Fe and Cr. The depletion pattern is similar to
          that  observed  in  warm  disk clouds of the Milky Way. We also
          detect  absorption  from all ground-level fine-structure states
          of  FeII, the first such example in a QSO-DLA or GRB-absorption
          spectrum,  which  indicate  conditions that are consistent with
          the  "warm  disk" depletion pattern. The absorption profiles of
          FeII  and  MgII  extend  over  several  hundred  km/s,  with  a
          depletion pattern that more closely resembles that of QSO-DLAs,
          suggesting that the sight line to GRB 051111 probes the halo of
          the  host  galaxy in addition to the dense disk. Thus, detailed
          diagnostics  of  the  interstellar  medium of GRB host galaxies
          continue  to  provide  insight into regions which are generally
          missed in quasar surveys.

          The XBootes Survey is a 5-ks Chandra survey of the Bootes Field
          of  the  NOAO  Deep  Wide-Field  Survey (NDWFS). This survey is
          unique in that it is the largest (9.3 deg^2), contiguous region
          imaged  in  X-ray  with  complementary deep optical and near-IR
          observations.  We present a catalog of the optical counterparts
          to  the  3,213  X-ray  point  sources  detected  in the XBootes
          survey. Using a Bayesian identification scheme, we successfully
          identified  optical  counterparts  for  98%  of the X-ray point
          sources. The optical colors suggest that the optically detected
          galaxies  are  a combination of z<1 massive early-type galaxies
          and  bluer  star-forming galaxies whose optical AGN emission is
          faint  or  obscured,  whereas  the  majority  of  the optically
          detected point sources are likely quasars over a large redshift
          range.  Our  large  area,  X-ray  bright, optically deep survey
          enables  us  to select a large sub-sample of sources (773) with
          high  X-ray  to optical flux ratios (f_x/f_o>10). These objects
          are  likely  high  redshift  and/or  dust  obscured  AGN. These
          sources  have  generally harder X-ray spectra than sources with
          0.1<f_x/f_o<10.  Of  the  73  X-ray  sources  with  no  optical
          counterpart  in the NDWFS catalog, 47 are truly optically blank
          down to R~25.5 (the average 50% completeness limit of the NDWFS
          R-band  catalogs).  These  sources  are  also likely to be high
          redshift and/or dust obscured AGN.

          We present VLT/ISAAC near-infrared imaging of the host galaxies
          of  15  low  luminosity  quasars  at  1  <  z  <  2.  This work
          complements  our studies to trace the cosmological evolution of
          the  host  galaxies  of high luminosity quasars. The radio-loud
          (RLQ)  and  radio-quiet (RQQ) quasars have similar distribution
          of  redshift  and  luminosity,  and  together  the high and low
          luminosity quasars cover a large range of the quasar luminosity
          function.  Both  RLQ  and  RQQ  hosts resemble massive inactive
          ellipticals  undergoing  passive  evolution. However, RLQ hosts
          are  systematically more luminous than RQQ hosts, as also found
          for  the  high  luminosity  quasars. The difference in the host
          luminosity remains the same from z = 2 to z = 0. For the entire
          set  of  quasars, we find a correlation between the nuclear and
          the  host  luminosities,  albeit  with  a  large  scatter.  The
          correlation is less apparent for the RQQs than for the RLQs.

          Title: The Epoch of Reionization

          C. G. Lacey (4) ((1) University of Oxford, UK, (2) NAOJ, Tokyo,
          Japan,  (3)  Technion,  Haifa, Israel, (4) University of Durham
          (UK))
          Comments: 21 pages, submitted to MNRAS
          We  have  modelled  the  process  of  reionization  in the high
          redshift  Universe  to  determine  the  epoch  of reionization.
          Reionization  is  driven  by  star  formation  in high redshift
          galaxies.  We  employ a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation
          to  track  the  formation of these galaxies, their influence on
          the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the back-reaction of the IGM
          on  further  galaxy  formation. This represents a more complete
          and  physical modelling of reionization than has been conducted
          in  the  past. In particular, compared to our previous work our
          new   calculations  contain  significant  improvements  in  the
          modelling   of  the  effects  of  reionization  on  the  galaxy
          population and in the cooling model used to compute the rate at
          which galaxies form (our new model includes photoheating from a
          self-consistently   computed   ionizing   background  and  also
          includes  cooling  due  to  molecular  hydrogen).  We find that
          reionization can be achieved by z~14-15 in a cosmological model
          motivated   by   the   results  from  the  Wilkinson  Microwave
          Anisotropy  Probe (WMAP) satellite, consistent with the optical
          depth to reionization measured by WMAP. However, a cosmological
          model  with  a  running  spectral  index  is  able  to  achieve
          reionization  before  z~9  only  with  very extreme assumptions
          about  the physics of feedback at high redshifts. These results
          assume that all ionizing photons in galaxies are able to escape
          and  ionize  the IGM. If this is not the case then the redshift
          of  reionization  could  be  substantially  reduced.  Under the
          assumption  that early star formation leads to the formation of
          very  massive  stars  we  find that extended periods of partial
          reionization and double reionizations can occur. Such models do
          not  fully  reionize  until  z~6-7  but obtain an optical depth
          which  is  consistent with the results from the WMAP satellite.

          Title: Evolution in the black hole mass--bulge mass relation: a
          theoretical perspective
          Authors: Darren J Croton
          Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  explore  the  growth  of super-massive black holes and host
          galaxy bulges in the galaxy population using the Millennium Run
          LCDM  simulation  coupled  with a model of galaxy formation. We
          find  that,  if galaxy mergers are the primary drivers for both
          bulge  and  black hole growth, then in the simplest picture one
          should  expect the mBH-mBulge relation to evolve with redshift,
          with  a  larger  black  hole mass associated with a given bulge
          mass  at earlier times relative to the present day. This result
          is  independent  of an evolving cold gas fraction in the galaxy
          population.   The  evolution  arises  from  the  disruption  of
          galactic  disks  during  mergers  that make a larger fractional
          mass  contribution  to  bulges  at low redshift than at earlier
          epochs.  There  is no comparable growth mode for the black hole
          population.   Thus,  this  effect  produces  evolution  in  the
          mBH-mBulge relation that is driven by bulge mass growth and not
          by black holes.

          Title:  Lyman-alpha forest-CMB cross-correlation and the search
          for the ionized baryons at high redshift
          Authors:  Rupert  A.C. Croft (CMU/MPA), A.J. Banday (MPA), Lars
          Hernquist (CfA)
          Comments: 14 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          The intergalactic neutral hydrogen which is responsible for the
          Lyman  alpha  forest  of  quasar absorption is a tracer of much
          larger  amounts  of ionised hydrogen. The ionised component has
          yet  to  be  detected  directly, but is expected to scatter CMB
          photons   via   the  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich  (SZ)  effect.  We  use
          hydrodynamic simulations of a LambdaCDM universe to create mock
          quasar  spectra  and  CMB sky maps. We find that the high-z Lya
          forest  gas  causes  temperature fluctuations of the order of 1
          muK rms in the CMB on arcmin scales. The kinetic and thermal SZ
          effects  have  a  similar  magnitude  at  z=3, with the thermal
          effect  becoming relatively weaker as expected at higher z. The
          CMB  signal  associated  with  lines  of sight having HI column
          densities  >  10^18 cm^-2 is only marginally stronger than that
          for  lower  column  densities.  The  strong  dependence  of rms
          temperature  fluctuation  on  mean  Lya absorbed flux, however,
          suggests  that  the  CMB  signal  effectively  arises  in lower
          density    material.    We   investigate   the   use   of   the
          cross-correlation   of   the   Lya  forest  and  the  microwave
          background  to  detect  the  SZ  effect at redshifts 2-4. In so
          doing  we  are  able  to  set  direct  limits on the density of
          diffuse   ionised   intergalactic   baryons.  We  carry  out  a
          preliminary  comparison  at  a mean redshift z=3 of 3488 quasar
          spectra  from SDSS Data Release 3 and the WMAP first year data.
          Assuming  that  the  baryons  are  clustered  as in a LambdaCDM
          cosmology,   and   have   the   same   mean   temperature,  the
          cross-correlation  yields a weak limit on the cosmic density of
          ionised  baryons Omega_(b,I), which is Omega_(b,I) < 0.8 at 95%
          confidence.   With   data  from  upcoming  CMB  telescopes,  we
          anticipate that a direct detection of the high redshift ionised
          IGM  will  soon be possible, providing an important consistency
          check on cosmological models.

          Modeling  the multiwavelength emission of successive regions in
          the  jet of the quasar PKS 1136-135 we find indication that the
          jet  suffers deceleration near its end on a (deprojected) scale
          of  ~400  kpc.  Adopting  a  continuous  flow  approximation we
          discuss  the  possibility that the inferred deceleration from a
          Lorentz factor Gamma=6.5 to Gamma=2.5 is induced by entrainment
          of  external  gas.  Some  consequences  of  this  scenario  are
          discussed.

          present-day ellipticals
          Authors:  Masao  Mori  (UCLA/Senshu  Univ.),  Masayuki  Umemura
          (Univ. of Tsukuba)
          Comments: 27 pages including 4 figures, accepted to Nature
          The  current  understanding  of  galaxy  formation  is  that it
          proceeds  in  a  'bottom  up'  way, with the formation of small
          clumps  of  gas and stars that merge hierarchically until giant
          galaxies  are  built  up.  The  baryonic  gas loses the thermal
          energy  by  radiative  cooling and falls towards the centres of
          the  new  galaxies,  while  supernovae  (SNe) blow gas out. Any
          realistic  model therefore requires a proper treatment of these
          processes,  but  hitherto  this has been far from satisfactory.
          Here we report an ultra-high-resolution simulation that follows
          evolution  from the earliest stages of galaxy formation through
          the  period  of  dynamical relaxation. The bubble structures of
          gas revealed in our simulation ($< 3\times10^8$ years) resemble
          closely the high-redshift Lyman $\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). After
          $10^9$  years  these  bodies are dominated by stellar continuum
          radiation  and  look like the Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) known
          as  the  high-redshift star-forming galaxies at which point the
          abundance  of  elements  heavier  than  helium  ("metallicity")
          appears  to  be  solar.  After  $1.3\times10^{10}$ years, these
          galaxies resemble present-day ellipticals.

          Title: Have We Detected Patchy Reionization in Quasar Spectra?
          Authors:  Adam Lidz (Harvard-CFA), S. Peng Oh (UCSB), Steven R.
          Furlanetto (Caltech)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ Letters
          The  Lyman-alpha forest at z >~ 5.5 shows strong scatter in the
          mean  transmission  even  when smoothed over very large spatial
          scales,  >~  50 Mpc/h. This has been interpreted as a signature
          of   strongly   fluctuating   radiation   fields,   or   patchy
          reionization.  To  test  this  claim,  we calculate the scatter
          arising  solely  from  density  fluctuations,  with  a  uniform
          ionizing  background, using analytic arguments and simulations.
          This  scatter  alone  is  comparable to that observed. It rises
          steeply with redshift and is of order unity by z ~ 6, even on ~
          50 Mpc/h scales. This arises because: i) at z ~ 6, transmission
          spectra,  which  are sensitive mainly to rare voids, are highly
          biased  (with  a  linear  bias  factor  b  >~  4-5)  tracers of
          underlying  density  fluctuations, and ii) projected power from
          small-scale  transverse  modes  is  aliased  to long wavelength
          line-of-sight  modes. Inferring patchy reionization from quasar
          spectra  is  therefore  subtle  and requires much more detailed
          modeling.   Similarly,   we  expect  order  unity  transmission
          fluctuations  in the z ~ 3 HeII Lyman-alpha forest from density
          fluctuations alone, on the scales over which these measurements
          are typically made.

          The  delay  in  light  travel  time  along  the  line  of sight
          generates   an   anisotropy  in  the  power  spectrum  of  21cm
          brightness fluctuations from the epoch of reionization. We show
          that  when  the  fluctuations  in the neutral hydrogen fraction
          become  non-linear  at  the  later  stages of reionization, the
          light-cone  anisotropy  becomes  of  order  unity on scales >50
          comoving  Mpc.  During this period the density fluctuations and
          the  associated anisotropy generated by peculiar velocities are
          negligible in comparison.

          Using  a large sample of MgII absorbers with 0.4<z<2.2 detected
          by  Nestor  et al (2005) in the Early Data Release of the SDSS,
          we  present new constraints on the physical properties of these
          systems based on two statistical analyses: (i) By computing the
          ratio between the composite spectra of quasars with and without
          absorbers,  we  measure  the reddening effects induced by these
          intervening  systems; and (ii) by stacking SDSS images centered
          on  quasars with strong MgII absorption lines and isolating the
          excess light around the PSF, we measure the mean luminosity and
          colors  of  the  absorbing  galaxies. This statistical approach
          does  not  require any spectroscopic follow up and allows us to
          constrain the photometric properties of absorber systems.

          Title:   MAMBO  1.2  Millimeter  observations  of  BzK-selected
          star-forming Galaxies at z~2

          Comments: Accepted for publication by ApJL (4 pages, 2 figures)
          We  present  MAMBO 1.2 mm observations of five BzK-pre-selected
          vigorous  starburst galaxies at z~2. Two of these were detected
          at more than 99.5% confidence levels, with 1.2 mm fluxes around
          1.5  mJy.  These millimeter fluxes imply vigorous activity with
          star-formation rates (SFRs) approx. 500-1500 Msun/yr, confirmed
          also  by detections at 24 microns with the MIPS camera on board
          of  the  Spitzer  satellite.  The two detected galaxies are the
          ones  in  the  sample  with the highest SFRs estimated from the
          rest-frame  UV,  and  their  far-IR-  and UV-derived SFRs agree
          reasonably well. This is different from local ULIRGs and high-z
          submm/mm  selected  galaxies  for  which  the UV is reported to
          underestimate  SFRs  by  factors  of 10-100, but similar to the
          average  BzK-ULIRG  galaxy at z~2. The two galaxies detected at
          1.2  mm  are brighter in K than the typical NIR-counterparts of
          MAMBO   and   SCUBA  sources,  implying  also  a  significantly
          different  K-band  to  submm/mm  flux  ratio.  This  suggests a
          scenario  in  which  z~2  galaxies,  after  their rapid (sub)mm
          brightest  phase  opaque  to  optical/UV  light,  evolve into a
          longer  lasting  phase  of  K-band  bright and massive objects.
          Targeting  the  most  UV  active  BzKs  could yield substantial
          detection rates at submm/mm wavelengths.

          Title:  A  Synoptic, Multiwavelength Analysis of a Large Quasar
          Sample
          Authors: Adam W. Rengstorf, Robert J. Brunner, Brian C. Wilhite
          Comments: AJ, accepted for publication 15 Dec 2005
          We   present   variability   and  multi-wavelength  photometric
          information  for the 933 known quasars in the QUEST Variability
          Survey.   These   quasars   are   grouped   into  variable  and
          non-variable   populations   based   on   measured  variability
          confidence levels. In a time-limited synoptic survey, we detect
          an  anti-correlation  between  redshift  and  the likelihood of
          variability. Our comparison of variability likelihood to radio,
          IR,  and  X-ray data is consistent with earlier quasar studies.
          Using already-known quasars as a template, we introduce a light
          curve  morphology  algorithm  that provides an efficient method
          for  discriminating  variable  quasars  from  periodic variable
          objects  in  the  absence  of  spectroscopic  information.  The
          establishment  of  statistically  robust  trends and efficient,
          non-spectroscopic  selection  algorithms  will  aid  in  quasar
          identification  and categorization in upcoming massive synoptic
          surveys.  Finally,  we  report  on  three  interesting variable
          quasars,  including  variability  confirmation  of  the  BL Lac
          candidate PKS 1222+037.

          Title:  XMM-Newton  Archival  Study  of  the  ULX Population in
          Nearby Galaxies
          Authors:   L.M.  Winter  (UMD),  R.F.  Mushotzky  (GSFC),  C.S.
          Reynolds (UMD)
          Comments: 51 pages, submitted to ApJ (March 2005)
          We  have  conducted  an archival XMM-Newton study of the bright
          X-ray  point  sources  in  32 nearby galaxies. From our list of
          approximately  100  point  sources,  we attempt to determine if
          there  is  a  low-state  counterpart to the Ultraluminous X-ray
          (ULX)  population, testing the specific predictions of the IMBH
          hypothesis. Indeed, 16 sources in our sample match the criteria
          we  set  for  a  low-state  ULX,  namely,  L$_X  > 10^{38}$ erg
          s$^{-1}$  and  a spectrum well fit with a simple absorbed power
          law.  Further,  we find evidence for 26 ULXs which are well fit
          by  a combined blackbody and a power law, similar to high-state
          Galactic  black  holes.  As in Galactic black hole systems, the
          spectral  indices,  $\Gamma$, of the low-state objects, as well
          as  the  luminosities,  tend  to  be  lower  than  those of the
          high-state   objects.   The   observed   range   of   blackbody
          temperatures  is  0.1-1  keV  with  the  most  luminous systems
          tending toward the lowest temperatures. We also find a class of
          object whose properties (luminosity, blackbody temperature, and
          power law slopes) are very similar to those of galactic stellar
          mass  black  holes.  In  addition,  we  find  a subset of these
          objects  that can be best fit by a Comptonized spectrum similar
          to  that  used  for  Galactic  black holes in the ``very high''
          state, when they are radiating near the Eddington limit.

          Title: Elemental Abundance Survey of The Galactic Thick Disk

          Allende  Prieto  (2)  ((1)  IIA, Bangalore, (2) Univ. of Texas,
          Austin)
          Comments:  57  pages  (text:  27  pages  in  MNRAS  format + 27
          figures) Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          [Abridged abstract] We have performed an abundance analysis for
          176  F-  and  G-  dwarfs  of the Galactic thick disk component.
          Using  accurate  radial  velocities  combined  with $Hipparcos$
          astrometry,  kinematics  (U,  V,  and  W)  and Galactic orbital
          parameters  were  computed.  We  estimate the probability for a
          star to belong to the thin disk, the thick disk or the halo.
          Abundances  of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe,
          Co,  Ni,  Cu, Zn, Y, Ba, Ce, Nd, and Eu have been obtained. The
          abundances  for  thick  disk  stars are compared with those for
          thin  disk  members  from  Reddy  et  al. (2003). The ratios of
          $\alpha$-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti) to iron for thick disk
          disk  stars  show  a  clear  enhancement  compared to thin disk
          members  in the range $-0.3 <$ [Fe/H] $ < -1.2$. There are also
          other  elements -- Al, Sc, V, Co, and possibly Zn -- which show
          enhanced  ratios to iron in the thick disk relative to the thin
          disk. The abundances of Na, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Cu (relative to Fe)
          are  very similar for thin and thick disk stars. The dispersion
          in abundance ratios [X/Fe] at given [Fe/H] for thick disk stars
          is  consistent  with  the  expected  scatter due to measurement
          errors,  suggesting  a  lack  of `cosmic' scatter. The observed
          compositions  of the thin and thick disks seem to be consistent
          with models of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering in a
          $\Lambda$CDM  universe.  In  particular, the distinct abundance
          patterns observed in the thin and thick disks, and the chemical
          homogeneity  of  the  thick  disk  at  different galactocentric
          distances  favor a scenario in which the majority of thick-disk
          stars were formed {\it in situ}, from gas rich merging blocks.

          Minihalos and the Intergalactic Medium before Reionization
          Authors:  Paul  R.  Shapiro,  Kyungjin Ahn, Marcelo A. Alvarez,

          Comments: 10 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ
          The   H   atoms   inside  minihalos  (i.e.  halos  with  virial
          temperatures  T_vir  <  10^4  K, in the mass range roughly from
          10^4  M_sun  to  10^8  M_sun)  during the cosmic dark ages in a
          LambdaCDM   universe   produce   a   redshifted  background  of
          collisionally-pumped  21-cm line radiation which can be seen in
          emission  relative  to  the  cosmic microwave background (CMB).
          Previously,  we  used semi-analytical calculations of the 21-cm
          signal from individual halos of different mass and redshift and
          the  evolving  mass  function  of minihalos to predict the mean
          brightness temperature of this 21-cm background and its angular
          fluctuations.  Here  we use high-resolution cosmological N-body
          and  hydrodynamic  simulations  of  structure formation at high
          redshift  (z>8)  to  compute the mean brightness temperature of
          this  background  from  both  minihalos  and  the intergalactic
          medium  (IGM) prior to the onset of Ly-alpha radiative pumping.
          We find that the 21-cm signal from gas in collapsed, virialized
          minihalos  dominates  over that from the diffuse shocked gas in
          the IGM.

          Title: On the Robustness of Cool Disc Components in Bright ULXs
          Authors:  J.  M. Miller (1), A. C. Fabian (2), M. C. Miller (3)
          ((1)  University  of Michigan, (2) University of Cambridge, (3)

          Comments: 5 pages, 1 color figure, uses mn2e.cls
          In  this  letter, we comment on the robustness of putative cool
          (kT  ~  0.2 keV) accretion disc components in the X-ray spectra
          of  the  most  luminous  (L ~ 10^40 erg/s) ultra-luminous X-ray
          sources  (ULXs)  in  nearby  normal  galaxies. When compared to
          stellar-mass black holes, the low disc temperatures observed in
          some  ULXs  may  imply  intermediate-mass black hole primaries.
          Recent work has claimed that such soft excesses are unlikely to
          be  actual disc components, based on the lack of variability in
          these  components,  and  in the overall source flux. Other work
          has  proposed  that  alternative  phenomenological  models, and
          complex Comptonisation models, rule-out cool disc components in
          ULX  spectra.  An  inspection  of  the  literature  on Galactic
          stellar-mass black holes and black hole candidates demonstrates
          that  the  flux behaviours seen in specific ULXs are consistent
          with  phenomena observed in well-known Galactic X-ray binaries.
          Applying Comptonisation models to simulated disc blackbody plus
          power-law  spectra  shows  that  at the sensitivity achieved in
          even  the  best  ULX  spectra,  Comptonisation  fits are highly
          model-dependent, and do not yield meaningful constraints on the
          accretion  flow.  In  contrast,  the  need  for a soft, thermal
          component  does  not  appear  to be model-dependent. As we have
          previously  noted,  soft  thermal components in ULX spectra may
          not represent accretion discs, but present alternatives to this
          interpretation are not robust.

          Comments: 12 pages, 3 figures, accepted by ApJ Letters
          We  present  Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the z=2.38
          lya-emitter   over-density   associated   with  galaxy  cluster
          J2143-4423, the largest known structure (110 Mpc) above z=2. We
          imaged 22 of the 37 known lya-emitters within the filament-like
          structure,  using  the  MIPS  24um  band.  We detected 6 of the
          lya-emitters, including 3 of the 4 clouds of extended (>50 kpc)
          lyman  alpha emission, also known as Lya Blobs. Conversion from
          rest-wavelength  7um  to  total  far-infrared  luminosity using
          locally  derived correlations suggests all the detected sources
          are  in  the  class  of  ULIRGs,  with some reaching Hyper-LIRG
          energies.  Lya  blobs frequently show evidence for interaction,
          either  in  HST  imaging,  or  the  proximity  of multiple MIPS
          sources  within  the  Lya  cloud. This connection suggests that
          interaction or even mergers may be related to the production of
          Lya  blobs.  A  connection  to  mergers does not in itself help
          explain  the  origin of the Lya blobs, as most of the suggested
          mechanisms  for  creating  Lya  blobs (starbursts, AGN, cooling
          flows) could also be associated with galaxy interactions.

          Title:  3D  spectroscopy as a tool for investigation of the BLR
          of lensed QSOs
          Authors: L. C. Popovic (AOB)
          Comments:  ESO  Astrophysics Symposia "Science Perspectives for
          3D  Spectroscopy"  (eds,  M.  Kissler-Patig, M.M. Roth and J.R.
          Walsh), Garching, Germany, 10-14 October 2005
          Selective  amplification  of  the  line and continuum source by
          microlensing  in  a  lensed  quasar  can  lead  to  changes  of
          continuum spectral slopes and line shapes in the spectra of the
          quasar   components.   Comparing   the   spectra  of  different
          components  of  the  lensed  quasar and the spectra of an image
          observed  in  different  epochs  one  can infer the presence of
          millilensing,    microlensing    and   intrinsic   variability.
          Especially,  microlensing  can be used for investigation of the
          unresolved  broad  line  (BLR)  and  continuum  emitting region
          structure  in  active  galactic  nuclei  (AGN).  Therefore  the
          spectroscopic  monitoring  of  selected  lensed quasars with 3D
          spectroscopy  open new possibility for investigation of the BLR
          structure  in  AGN.  Here we discuss observational effects that
          may  be  present  during the BLR microlensing in the spectra of
          lensed QSOs.

          Title:  Estimate  black  hole  masses of AGNs using ultraviolet
          emission line properties
          Authors: Min-Zhi Kong, Xue-Bing Wu, Ran Wang, Jin-Lin Han
          Comments: 19 pages, 10 figures
          Based  on  the  measured  sizes  of  broad  line  region of the
          reverberation-mapping  AGN  sample, two new empirical relations
          are  introduced  to  estimate  the central black hole masses of
          radio-loud  high-redshift  ($z  >  0.5$) AGNs. First, using the
          archival  $IUE/HST$  spectroscopy  data  at  UV  band  for  the
          reverberation-mapping  objects,  we  obtained two new empirical
          relations  between  the  BLR  size  and  \Mg/\C  emission  line
          luminosity.  Secondly,  using  the  newly determined black hole
          masses of the reverberation-mapping sample for calibration, two
          new relationships for determination of black hole mass with the
          full  width  of  half maximum and the luminosity of \Mg/\C line
          are  also  found.  We  then apply the relations to estimate the
          black  hole masses of AGNs in Large Bright Quasar Surveyq and a
          sample  of  radio-loud  quasars.  For  the  objects  with small
          radio-loudness, the black hole mass estimated using the $R_{\rm
          BLR}  - L_{\eMg/\eC}$ relation is consistent with that from the
          $R_{BLR}  -  L_{3000\AA/1350 \AA}$ relation. But for radio-loud
          AGNs,  the  mass  estimated  from  the $R_{BLR} - L_{\eMg/\eC}$
          relation  is  systematically lower than that from the continuum
          luminosity   $L_{3000\AA/1350\AA}$.  Because  jets  could  have
          significant   contributions   to   the   UV/optical   continuum
          luminosity  of  radio-loud  AGNs,  we emphasized again that for
          radio-loud  AGNs,  the emission line luminosity may be a better
          tracer   of   the   ionizing   luminosity  than  the  continuum
          luminosity,  so  that the relations between the BLR size and UV
          emission  line  luminosity should be used to estimate the black
          hole masses of high redshift radio-loud AGNs.

          Based  on  the  measured  sizes  of  broad  line  region of the
          reverberation-mapping  AGN  sample, two new empirical relations
          are  introduced  to  estimate  the central black hole masses of
          radio-loud  high-redshift  ($z  >  0.5$) AGNs. First, using the
          archival  $IUE/HST$  spectroscopy  data  at  UV  band  for  the
          reverberation-mapping  objects,  we  obtained two new empirical
          relations  between  the  BLR  size  and  \Mg/\C  emission  line
          luminosity.  Secondly,  using  the  newly determined black hole
          masses of the reverberation-mapping sample for calibration, two
          new relationships for determination of black hole mass with the
          full  width  of  half maximum and the luminosity of \Mg/\C line
          are  also  found.  We  then apply the relations to estimate the
          black  hole masses of AGNs in Large Bright Quasar Surveyq and a
          sample  of  radio-loud  quasars.  For  the  objects  with small
          radio-loudness, the black hole mass estimated using the $R_{\rm
          BLR}  - L_{\eMg/\eC}$ relation is consistent with that from the
          $R_{BLR}  -  L_{3000\AA/1350 \AA}$ relation. But for radio-loud
          AGNs,  the  mass  estimated  from  the $R_{BLR} - L_{\eMg/\eC}$
          relation  is  systematically lower than that from the continuum
          luminosity   $L_{3000\AA/1350\AA}$.  Because  jets  could  have
          significant   contributions   to   the   UV/optical   continuum
          luminosity  of  radio-loud  AGNs,  we emphasized again that for
          radio-loud  AGNs,  the emission line luminosity may be a better
          tracer   of   the   ionizing   luminosity  than  the  continuum
          luminosity,  so  that the relations between the BLR size and UV
          emission  line  luminosity should be used to estimate the black
          hole masses of high redshift radio-loud AGNs.

          The  early  reionization  of the intergalactic medium, which is
          favored      from     the     WMAP     temperature-polarization
          cross-correlations,  contests  the  validity  of  the  standard
          scenario  of  structure  formation  in  the  cold  dark  matter
          cosmogony.  It  is  difficult  to  achieve  early  enough  star
          formation  without rather extreme assumptions such as very high
          escape  fraction  of  ionizing photons from proto-galaxies or a
          top-heavy initial mass function. Here we propose an alternative
          scenario  that  is  additional  fluctuations  on  small  scales
          induced   by  primordial  magnetic  fields  trigger  the  early
          structure  formation.  We  found  that  ionizing  photons  from
          Population  III stars formed in dark haloes can easily reionize
          the  universe  by  $z  \simeq 15$ if the strength of primordial
          magnetic fields is larger than $0.6 \times 10^{-9}$Gauss.

          Comments: 16 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables, MNRAS submitted
          We  use the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) to study the soft X-ray
          properties  of  a homogeneous sample of 46,420 quasars selected
          from  the  third  data  release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
          (SDSS).   Optical  luminosities,  both  at  rest-frame  2500\AA
          ($L_{2500}$)  and  in [OIII] ($L_{[\rm{OIII}]}$) span more than
          three   orders   of   magnitude,  while  redshifts  range  over
          $0.1<z<5.4$.  We  detect  3366 quasars directly in the observed
          0.1--2.4  keV  band.  Sub-samples of radio-loud and radio-quiet
          objects (RLQs and RQQs) are obtained by cross-matching with the
          FIRST  catalogue. We study the distribution of X-ray luminosity
          as  a  function of optical luminosity, redshift and radio power
          using both individual detections and stacks of complete sets of
          similar quasars. At every optical luminosity and redshift $\log
          L_{2\kev}$  is,  to  a good approximation, normally distributed
          with dispersion $\sim 0.40$, at least brightwards of the median
          X-ray  luminosity. This median X-ray luminosity of quasars is a
          power  law  of  optical  luminosity  with index $\sim 0.53$ for
          $L_{2500}$  and  $\sim  0.30$  for  $L_{[\rm{OIII}]}$. RLQs are
          systematically  brighter  than  RQQs  by about a factor of 2 at
          given  optical  luminosity.  The zero-points of these relations
          increase  systematically  with  redshift, possibly in different
          ways for RLQs and RQQs. Evolution is particularly strong at low
          redshift  and  if  the  optical  luminosity is characterised by
          $L_{[\rm{OIII}]}$.    At    low    redshift    and   at   given
          $L_{[\rm{OIII}]}$  the  soft X-ray emission from type II AGN is
          more than 100 times weaker than that from type I AGN.

          Title:  A  Cosmic Milestone I: Constraints from Metal-Poor Halo
          Stars on the Cosmological Reionization Epoch
          Authors: Aparna Venkatesan (University of Colorado, Boulder)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ Letters on Dec. 30, 2005; 4 pages, 2
          figures
          Theoretical   studies   and   current   observations   of   the
          high-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) indicate that at least
          two  cosmic transitions may occur when the universe reaches gas
          metallicities of about $10^{-3}$ of solar values. These are the
          cosmological reionization of the IGM, and the transition from a
          primordial  to  present-day mode of star formation. We quantify
          this  relation  through  calculations of the ionizing radiation
          produced  in  association  with the elements carbon, oxygen and
          silicon  observed  in Galactic metal-poor halo stars, which are
          likely   second-generation   objects  formed  in  the  wake  of
          primordial  supernovae. We demonstrate that sufficient ionizing
          photons  per  baryon are created by enrichment levels of [Fe/H]
          of about -3 in these halo stars to provide the optical depth in
          the  cosmic  microwave  background  (CMB)  exceeding  about 0.1
          detected  by  WMAP.  We  show,  on a star by star basis, that a
          genuine  cosmic  milestone in IGM ionization and star formation
          mode  occurred  at metallicities of $10^{-4}$--$10^{-3}$ solar.
          This  provides  an  important link in the chain of evidence for
          metal-free   first   stars  having  dominated  the  process  of
          reionization  by  redshift  6.  We  conclude  that  many of the
          Fe-poor  halo  stars  formed  close to the end of or soon after
          cosmological  reionization,  making them the ideal probe of the
          physical  conditions  under which the transition from first- to
          second-generation   star   formation   happened  in  primordial
          galaxies.

          Title: Relic keV sterile neutrinos and reionization
          Authors: Peter L. Biermann, Alexander Kusenko
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures
          A  sterile  neutrino  with  mass of several keV can account for
          cosmological  dark  matter,  as  well  as  explain the observed
          velocities  of  pulsars.  We  show  that X-rays produced by the
          decays   of   these  relic  sterile  neutrinos  can  boost  the
          production  of  molecular  hydrogen,  which  can  speed  up the
          cooling  of  gas  and  the  early star formation, which can, in
          turn,  lead  to a reionization of the universe at a high enough
          redshift to be consistent with the WMAP results.

          Authors: Renyue Cen (Princeton University Observatory)
          Comments: submitted to ApJL, 19 pages, 4 figures
          First  galaxies  formed  within halos of mass M=E7.5-E9 Msun at
          z=30-40  in  the  standard  cold dark matter (CDM) universe may
          each display an extended hydrogen 21-cm absorption halo against
          the  cosmic  microwave background with a brightness temperature
          decrement  of  del  T=-(100-150)mK  at  a  radius 0.3 < r < 3.0
          comoving  Mpc,  corresponding  to  an  angular  size  of 10-100
          arcseconds.  A  21-cm  tomographic survey in the redshift shell
          z=30-40  (at  35-45MHz), which could be carried out by the next
          generation  of  radio  telescopes,  is  expected  to be able to
          detect  millions  of  first  galaxies and may prove exceedingly
          profitable in enabling (at least) four fundamental applications
          for  cosmology and galaxy formation. First, it may yield direct
          information  on  star  formation  physics  in  first  galaxies.
          Second,  it  could  provide  a  unique  and  sensitive probe of
          small-scale  power  in  the  standard  cosmological model hence
          physics of dark matter and inflation. Third, it would allow for
          an   independent,   perhaps   "cleaner"   characterization   of
          interesting features on large scales in the power spectrum such
          as  the  baryonic  oscillations.  Finally,  possibly  the  most
          secure,  each  21-cm  absorption  halo is expected to be highly
          spherical  and  faithfully  follow the Hubble flow. By applying
          the  Alcock-Paczynski  test  to  a  significant sample of first
          galaxies, one may be able to determine the dark energy equation
          of  state  with an accuracy likely only limited by the accuracy
          with which the matter density can be determined independently.

          The  accuracy  of  astrometric  observations  conducted  via  a
          space-borne   optical  interferometer  orbiting  the  Earth  is
          expected  to approach a few microarcseconds. Data processing of
          such extremely high-precision measurements requires access to a
          rigorous  relativistic model of light ray propagation developed
          in  the framework of General Relativity. The data-processing of
          the  space  interferometric  observations  must  rely  upon the
          theory  of  general-relativistic  transformations  between  the
          spacecraft, geocentric, and solar barycentric reference systems
          allowing  unique  and unambiguous interpretation of the stellar
          aberration  and  parallax  effects.  On  the  other  hand,  the
          algorithm  must  also  include physically adequate treatment of
          the  relativistic  effect  of  light  deflection  caused by the
          spherically-symmetric    (monopole-dependent)   part   of   the
          gravitational  field  of  the  Sun  and  planets as well as the
          quadrupole-  and  spin-dependent  counterparts  of  it. In some
          particular  cases  the  gravitomagnetic  field  induced  by the
          translational  motion  of  the  Sun  and planets should be also
          taken  into account for unambigious prediction of the light-ray
          deflection   angle.  In  the  present  paper  we  describe  the
          corresponding  software  program  for  taking  into account all
          classical  (proper  motion,  parallax,  etc.)  and relativistic
          (aberration,   deflection   of   light)   effects   up  to  the
          microarcsecond   threshold  and  demonstrate,  using  numerical
          simulations, how observations of stars and/or quasars conducted
          on  board a space optical interferometer orbiting the Earth can
          be processed and disentangled.

          Comments: 25 pages including text, 3 figures and 1 table
          Experimental  verification  of the existence of gravitomagnetic
          fields  generated  by  currents  of  matter  is important for a
          complete   understanding   and   formulation  of  gravitational
          physics.  Although  the  rotational (intrinsic) gravitomagnetic
          field has been extensively studied and is now being measured by
          the  Gravity  Probe  B,  the  extrinsic  gravitomagnetic  field
          generated  by  the translational current of matter is less well
          studied.  The  present  paper introduces a fundamental speed of
          gravity  parameter and uses the parametrized Einstein and light
          geodesics  equations to show that the extrinsic gravitomagnetic
          field  generated  by the translational current of matter can be
          measured by observing the relativistic time delay caused by the
          moving  object.  We  prove  that  the extrinsic gravitomagnetic
          field  is measured by the relativistic effect of the aberration
          of  the  gravity  force caused by the Lorentz transformation of
          the  metric  tensor  and the Levi-Civita connection. We applied
          these concepts to the 2002 deflection experiment of a quasar by
          Jupiter where the aberration of gravity from its orbital motion
          was  measured  with accuracy 20%. We describe a 2005 experiment
          to  measure  the gravitational deflection of radio waves from a
          quasar  by  the  sun,  as  viewed  in  the geocentric frame, to
          improve the measurement accuracy of the aberration of gravity -
          hence the fundamental speed of gravity - to a few percent.

          We  present the results of Chandra ACIS-S snapshot observations
          of   six   radio-loud   quasars   (RLQs)  at  z=3.5-4.7.  These
          observations   sample   luminous   RLQs  with  moderate-to-high
          radio-loudness  (R=200-9600)  and  aim  to  connect  the  X-ray
          properties  of radio-quiet quasars (R<10) and highly radio-loud
          blazars (R>1000) at high redshift. This work extends a study by
          Bassett et al. (2004) which used similar methods to examine z >
          4  RLQs  with  moderate  radio-loudness  (R=40-400). All of our
          targets  are  clearly  detected.  A  search  for extended X-ray
          emission  associated  with  kpc-scale  radio jets revealed only
          limited  evidence  for  X-ray  extension  in  our sample: three
          sources  showed  no  evidence of X-ray extension, and the other
          three  had 3-30% of their total X-ray fluxes extended >1 arcsec
          away  from  their  X-ray cores. Additionally, we do not observe
          any  systematic  flattening  of  the  optical-to-X-ray spectral
          index  (alpha_{ox})  compared  to  low-redshift  quasars. These
          results  suggest  that  kpc-scale  X-ray  jet  emission  is not
          dominated by inverse-Compton scattering of CMB-seed photons off
          jet electrons. We measured X-ray continuum shapes and performed
          individual  and  joint  spectral fits of our data combined with
          eight  archival  RLQs.  A single power-law model acceptably fit
          the  data.  We  added  an intrinsic absorption component to our
          model,  and  neither  the  moderate-R nor the high-R fits set a
          lower bound on N_H. Our spectral results suggest that intrinsic
          absorption  does  not  strongly  depend  on radio-loudness, and
          high-R sources have flatter power laws than moderate-R sources.
          Overall,  our  high-redshift  RLQs  have basic X-ray properties
          consistent with similar RLQs in the local universe.

          MNRAS
          We use galaxy groups selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
          to examine the alignment between the orientation of the central
          galaxy   (defined  as  the  brightest  group  member)  and  the
          distribution   of   satellite  galaxies.  By  construction,  we
          therefore only address the alignment on scales smaller than the
          halo  virial  radius. We find a highly significant alignment of
          satellites with the major axis of their central galaxy. This is
          in  qualitative  agreement  with  the  recent study of Brainerd
          (2005),  but  inconsistent  with  several  previous studies who
          detected  a  preferential  minor  axis alignment. The alignment
          strength  in  our  sample  is  strongest  between  red  central
          galaxies  and  red  satellites.  On the contrary, the satellite
          distribution   in   systems  with  a  blue  central  galaxy  is
          consistent  with  isotropic.  We  also  find that the alignment
          strength  is  stronger  in  more  massive haloes and at smaller
          projected  radii from the central galaxy. In addition, there is
          a weak indication that fainter (relative to the central galaxy)
          satellites  are  more  strongly  aligned. We present a detailed
          comparison  with previous studies, and discuss the implications
          of our findings for galaxy formation.

          We   present   the   first   MIR   spectrum   of  the  z=2.2856
          ultraluminous,  infrared  galaxy  FSC 10214+4724, obtained with
          the  Infrared Spectrograph onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope.
          The spectrum spans a rest wavelength range of 2.3-11.5 microns,
          covering  a  number  of  key diagnostic emission and absorption
          features. The most prominent feature in the IRS spectrum is the
          silicate  emission  at rest-frame 10 microns. We also detect an
          unresolved  emission  line at a rest wavelength of 7.65 microns
          which  we identify with [NeVI], and a slightly resolved feature
          at  5.6  microns  identified as a blend of [Mg VII] and [Mg V].
          There are no strong PAH emission features in the FSC 10214+4724
          spectrum.  We  place  a  limit  of 0.1 micron on the equivalent
          width  of  6.2  micron  PAH  emission  but see no evidence of a
          corresponding  7.7  micron  feature. Semi-empirical fits to the
          spectral   energy   distribution   suggest  about  45%  of  the
          bolometric  luminosity  arises from cold 50 K dust, half arises
          from  warm (190 K) dust, and the remainder, 5%, originates from
          hot  (640 K) dust. The hot dust is required to fit the blue end
          of  the steep MIR spectrum. The combination of a red continuum,
          strong  silicate  emission,  little  or no PAH emission, and no
          silicate  absorption,  makes  FSC  10214+4724 unlike most other
          ULIRGs  or  AGN  observed  thus  far with IRS. These apparently
          contradictory  properties  may  be explained by an AGN which is
          highly  magnified  by  the lens, masking a (dominant) overlying
          starburst with unusually weak PAH emission.

          Sanders, to be published in the special issue of Pub. of PMO
          We  present  results  from two mid-infrared imaging programs of
          ultraluminous  infrared  galaxies  (ULIRGs)  and fine-structure
          elliptical  galaxies.  The  former  are  known to nearly all be
          recent  mergers between two gas-rich spiral galaxies, while the
          latter  are also believed to be even more aged merger remnants.
          An  examination  of  these  two  classes  of objects, which may
          represent   different   stages  of  the  same  putative  merger
          sequence,  should  reveal  similarities  in the distribution of
          their stellar populations and dust content consistent with that
          expected  for time-evolution of the merger. The data reveal for
          the  first  time  extended  dust  emission  in the ULIRG galaxy
          bodies  and  along  their  tidal features. However, contrary to
          expectation,   we   find   that   the   vast  majority  of  the
          fine-structure   elliptical   galaxies   lack  such  structured
          emission. This likely results from the optical selection of the
          elliptical  sample, resulting in a population that reflects the
          IR-activity (or lack thereof) of optically selected interacting
          galaxies. Alternately, this may reflect an evolutionary process
          in the distribution of the dust content of the galaxy bodies.

          The  metallicity in portions of high-redshift galaxies has been
          successfully  measured thanks to the gas observed in absorption
          in  the  spectra  of quasars, in the Damped Lyman-alpha systems
          (DLAs).  Surprisingly, the global mean metallicity derived from
          DLAs  is  about  1/10th solar at 0<z<4 leading to the so-called
          ``missing-metals   problem''.   In   this   paper,  we  present
          high-resolution observations of a sub-DLA system at z_abs=0.716
          with  super-solar  metallicity  toward SDSS J1323-0021. This is
          the  highest  metallicity intervening quasar absorber currently
          known,  and  is  only  the second super-solar absorber known to
          date.  We  provide  a detailed study of this unique object from
          VLT/UVES  spectroscopy.  We  derive [Zn/H]=+0.61, [Fe/H]=-0.51,
          [Cr/H]=<-0.53, [Mn/H] = -0.37, and [Ti/H] = -0.61. Observations
          and  photoionisation  models  using the CLOUDY software confirm
          that  the gas in this sub-DLA is predominantly neutral and that
          the  abundance pattern is probably significantly different from
          a  Solar  pattern. Fe/Zn and Ti/Zn vary among the main velocity
          components   by  factors  of  \~  3  and  ~  35,  respectively,
          indicating  non-uniform dust depletion. Mn/Fe is super-solar in
          almost  all components, and varies by a factor of ~ 3 among the
          dominant  components.  It  would be interesting to observe more
          sub-DLA  systems  and  determine  whether they might contribute
          significantly toward the cosmic budget of metals.

          We  perform  controlled  N-Body/SPH  simulations of disk galaxy
          formation  by  cooling  a  rotating  gaseous  mass distribution
          inside  equilibrium  cuspy  spherical  and triaxial dark matter
          halos.  We  systematically study the angular momentum transport
          and  the  disk  morphology  as  we  increase the number of dark
          matter  and  gas  particles from 10^4 to 10^6, and decrease the
          gravitational  softening  from  2 kpc to 50 parsecs.The angular
          momentum  transport, disk morphology and radial profiles depend
          sensitively  on  force  and mass resolution. At low resolution,
          similar  to that used in most current cosmological simulations,
          the  cold  gas  component  has lost half of its initial angular
          momentum  via  various  numerical  and physical mechanisms. The
          angular  momentum  is  transferred  primarily  to  the hot halo
          component,    by    resolution-dependent   hydrodynamical   and
          gravitational  torques.  In  addition,  disk-particles can lose
          angular  momentum  while  they  are  still  in the hot phase by
          artificial  viscosity.  In  the  central  disk,  particles  can
          transfer away over 99% of their initial angular momentum due to
          spiral  structure  and/or  the  presence  of a central bar. The
          strength  of  this  transport  also  depends  on force and mass
          resolution - large softening will suppress the bar instability,
          low  mass  resolution  enhances the spiral structure. With 10^6
          gas  and dark matter particles, disk particles lose only 10-20%
          of  their  original  angular  momentum,  yet  we  are unable to
          produce pure exponential profiles.

          We study the dependence of galaxy contents within halos on halo
          formation  time  using two galaxy formation models, one being a
          semi-analytic model utilizing halo assembly history from a high
          resolution  N-body  simulation  and  the other being a smoothed
          particle  hydrodynamics simulation including radiative cooling,
          star  formation,  and  energy  feedback from galactic winds. We
          confirm the finding by Gao et al. (2005) that at fixed mass the
          clustering  of halos depends on halo formation time, especially
          for  low  mass  halos.  This  age dependence of halo clustering
          makes  it  desirable  to  study  the  correlation  between  the
          occupation  of  galaxies within halos and the halo age. We find
          that,  in halos of fixed mass, the number of satellite galaxies
          has  a  strong  dependence on halo age with fewer satellites in
          older  halos.  The  youngest one-third of the halos can have an
          order  of  magnitude more satellites than the oldest one-third.
          For  central galaxies, in halos that form earlier, they tend to
          have  more  stars  and thus appear to be more luminous, and the
          dependence  of their luminosity on halo age is not as strong as
          that of stellar mass. The results can be understood through the
          star  formation  history in halos and the merging of satellites
          onto  central  galaxies.  The age dependence of galaxy contents
          within halos would constitute an important ingredient in a more
          accurate halo-based model of galaxy clustering.

          Many  clues about the galaxy assembly process lurk in the faint
          outer  regions  of  galaxies.  The  low surface brightnesses of
          these parts pose a significant challenge for studies of diffuse
          light,  and  few  robust constraints on galaxy formation models
          have  been  derived  to date from this technique. Our group has
          pioneered  the  use  of  extremely  wide-area  star  counts  to
          quantitatively  address  the  large-scale structure and stellar
          content  of  external  galaxies  at very faint light levels. We
          highlight  here some results from our imaging and spectroscopic
          surveys of M31 and M33.

          Title: Gravitational microlensing of quasar Broad Line Regions:
          the influence of fractal structures
          Authors: Geraint F. Lewis, Rodrigo A. Ibata
          Comments:  6  pages,  accepted  for publication in MNRAS (note,
          resolution of figures reduced to size restrictions)
          Recent  models  for  the  emission clouds within the Broad Line
          Region  of  quasars  suggest  that  they  are  due to transient
          overdensities  within an overall turbulent medium. If this were
          the  case,  the  broad  line  emission  would  spatially appear
          fractal,  possessing structure on a range of scales. This paper
          examines  the influence of such fractal structure when a quasar
          is  microlensed  by  a  population of intervening masses. It is
          found  that  while  the  highest  fractal  levels  can  undergo
          significant microlensing magnification, when these light curves
          are  superimposed  to  create  an  emission  line  profile, the
          resultant emission line profile remains relatively constant for
          physical  models of the Broad Line Region. It is concluded that
          the  detection  of the possible fractal structure of Broad Line
          Regions via gravitational microlensing is not practical.

          J1004+4112:  Prospects  for  Determining the Density Profile of
          the Lensing Cluster
          Authors: Yozo Kawano (Nagoya U.), Masamune Oguri (Princeton U.)
          Comments: 21 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ
          We  investigate  the  dependence  of  the  time  delays for the
          large-separation  gravitationally lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112
          on  the inner mass profile of the lensing cluster. Adopting the
          mass  model whose innermost density profile is parameterized as
          \rho  \propto  r^{-\alpha},  we  derive a series of mass models
          which   can   fit  observational  data  and  then  compute  the
          probability distribution functions of time delays. We find that
          larger  \alpha  has  longer  time  delays,  longer tails at the
          higher  end  of  the probability distribution, and larger model
          uncertainties. The ratios of time delays slightly depend on the
          slope  \alpha. Among others, time delays between images C and A
          (or  B) have little dependence on the inner slope, particularly
          when  the  time delays are short. The dependence of time delays
          on  \alpha  is  well  fitted  by  a linear form, which reflects
          well-known degeneracy between the mass profile and time delays.
          We  perform a Monte-Carlo simulation to illustrate how well the
          inner  slope  can  be  constrained  from  measurements  of time
          delays.  We find that measurements of more than one time delays
          result  in  reasonably  tight  constraints  on  the inner slope
          (\sigma_{\alpha}  \lesssim  0.25),  while  only  one time delay
          cannot   determine  the  inner  slope  very  well.  Our  result
          indicates  that  time delays indeed serve as a powerful tool to
          determine  the  mass  profile,  despite  the  complexity of the
          lensing cluster.

          We  present results from the analysis of the optical spectra of
          47 radio-selected narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). These
          objects  are  a subset of the First Bright Quasar Survey (FBQS)
          and  were  initially  detected  at 20 cm (flux density limit ~1
          mJy)  in the VLA FIRST Survey. We run Spearman rank correlation
          tests  on  several sets of parameters and conclude that, except
          for their radio properties, radio-selected NLS1 galaxies do not
          exhibit significant differences from traditional NLS1 galaxies.
          Our  results  are  also  in  agreement  with  previous  studies
          suggesting that NLS1 galaxies have small black hole masses that
          are  accreting  very close to the Eddington rate. We have found
          16  new radio-loud NLS1 galaxies, which increases the number of
          known radio-loud NLS1 galaxies by a factor of ~5.

          used.  We  find  a  population  of Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources
          (ULX;  7  sources with LX [0.5-7 keV] > 7x10^39 erg/s). As with
          the  ULX  populations  in  the Antennae and Cartwheel galaxies,
          those  in  the  HVS are associated with a region of very active
          star   formation.   Several   sources   have  possible  optical
          counterparts  found on HST images, although the X-ray brightest
          one  does not. Absorbed power-law models fit the X-ray spectra,
          with most having a photon index between 2 and 3.

          the  case,  the  broad  line  emission  would  spatially appear
          fractal,  possessing structure on a range of scales. This paper
          examines  the influence of such fractal structure when a quasar
          is  microlensed  by  a  population of intervening masses. It is
          found  that  while  the  highest  fractal  levels  can  undergo
          significant microlensing magnification, when these light curves
          are  superimposed  to  create  an  emission  line  profile, the
          resultant emission line profile remains relatively constant for
          physical  models of the Broad Line Region. It is concluded that
          the  detection  of the possible fractal structure of Broad Line
          Regions via gravitational microlensing is not practical.

          Title:  Time  Delays for the Giant Quadruple Lensed Quasar SDSS
          J1004+4112:  Prospects  for  Determining the Density Profile of
          the Lensing Cluster
          Authors: Yozo Kawano (Nagoya U.), Masamune Oguri (Princeton U.)
          Comments: 21 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ
          We  investigate  the  dependence  of  the  time  delays for the
          large-separation  gravitationally lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112
          on  the inner mass profile of the lensing cluster. Adopting the
          mass  model whose innermost density profile is parameterized as
          \rho  \propto  r^{-\alpha},  we  derive a series of mass models
          which   can   fit  observational  data  and  then  compute  the
          probability distribution functions of time delays. We find that
          larger  \alpha  has  longer  time  delays,  longer tails at the
          higher  end  of  the probability distribution, and larger model
          uncertainties. The ratios of time delays slightly depend on the
          slope  \alpha. Among others, time delays between images C and A
          (or  B) have little dependence on the inner slope, particularly
          when  the  time delays are short. The dependence of time delays
          on  \alpha  is  well  fitted  by  a linear form, which reflects
          well-known degeneracy between the mass profile and time delays.
          We  perform a Monte-Carlo simulation to illustrate how well the
          inner  slope  can  be  constrained  from  measurements  of time
          delays.  We find that measurements of more than one time delays
          result  in  reasonably  tight  constraints  on  the inner slope
          (\sigma_{\alpha}  \lesssim  0.25),  while  only  one time delay
          cannot   determine  the  inner  slope  very  well.  Our  result
          indicates  that  time delays indeed serve as a powerful tool to
          determine  the  mass  profile,  despite  the  complexity of the
          lensing cluster.

          Comments: 18 pages, 20 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  present results from the analysis of the optical spectra of
          47 radio-selected narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). These
          objects  are  a subset of the First Bright Quasar Survey (FBQS)
          and  were  initially  detected  at 20 cm (flux density limit ~1
          mJy)  in the VLA FIRST Survey. We run Spearman rank correlation
          tests  on  several sets of parameters and conclude that, except
          for their radio properties, radio-selected NLS1 galaxies do not
          exhibit significant differences from traditional NLS1 galaxies.
          Our  results  are  also  in  agreement  with  previous  studies
          suggesting that NLS1 galaxies have small black hole masses that
          are  accreting  very close to the Eddington rate. We have found
          16  new radio-loud NLS1 galaxies, which increases the number of
          known radio-loud NLS1 galaxies by a factor of ~5.

          System of NGC 1275
          Authors: O. Gonzalez-Martin, A. C. Fabian, J. S. Sanders
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          We  report  the  results  of  a  study  of  X-ray point sources
          coincident  with  the  High  Velocity System (HVS) projected in
          front  of  NGC 1275. A very deep X-ray image of the core of the
          Perseus  cluster  made  with  the  Chandra Observatory has been
          used.  We  find  a  population  of Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources
          (ULX;  7  sources with LX [0.5-7 keV] > 7x10^39 erg/s). As with
          the  ULX  populations  in  the Antennae and Cartwheel galaxies,
          those  in  the  HVS are associated with a region of very active
          star   formation.   Several   sources   have  possible  optical
          counterparts  found on HST images, although the X-ray brightest
          one  does not. Absorbed power-law models fit the X-ray spectra,
          with most having a photon index between 2 and 3.

          This  work  presents the main ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared
          (FIR)  properties  of  two  samples of nearby galaxies selected
          from  the  GALEX  ($\lambda = 2315$\AA, hereafter NUV) and IRAS
          ($\lambda  =  60\mu$m)  surveys respectively. They are built in
          order  to  get  detection  at  both wavelengths for most of the
          galaxies.  Star formation rate (SFR) estimators based on the UV
          and  FIR  emissions  are  compared.  Systematic differences are
          found  between the SFR estimators for individual galaxies based
          on  the  NUV  fluxes  corrected for dust attenuation and on the
          total  IR  luminosity. A combined estimator based on NUV and IR
          luminosities seems to be the best proxy over the whole range of
          values  of  SFR.  Although both samples present similar average
          values     of     the     birthrate    parameter    b,    their
          star-formation-related  properties are substantially different:
          NUV-selected  galaxies  tend  to  show larger values of $b$ for
          lower  masses,  SFRs and dust attenuations, supporting previous
          scenarios  for  the  star  formation history (SFH). Conversely,
          about 20% of the FIR-selected galaxies show high values of $b$,
          SFR  and  NUV  attenuation.  These galaxies, most of them being
          LIRGs  and  ULIRGs,  break  down the downsizing picture for the
          SFH,  however  their  relative  contribution per unit volume is
          small in the local Universe. Finally, the cosmic SFR density of
          the  local  Universe  is estimated in a consistent way from the
          NUV and IR luminosities.

          (4)Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona
          Among  unidentified  gamma-ray  sources  in the galactic plane,
          there  are  some  that present significant variability and have
          been proposed to be high-mass microquasars. To deepen the study
          of  the  possible  association  between  variable  low galactic
          latitude  gamma-ray sources and microquasars, we have applied a
          leptonic  jet  model  based  on  the  microquasar scenario that
          reproduces   the   gamma-ray  spectrum  of  three  unidentified
          gamma-ray  sources,  3EG  J1735-1500,  3EG  J1828+0142  and GRO
          J1411-64,  and is consistent with the observational constraints
          at  lower  energies.  We  conclude  that  if these sources were
          generated  by microquasars, the particle acceleration processes
          could not be as efficient as in other objects of this type that
          present   harder  gamma-ray  spectra.  Moreover,  the  dominant
          mechanism   of   high-energy  emission  should  be  synchrotron
          self-Compton  (SSC)  scattering, and the radio jets may only be
          observed  at low frequencies. For each particular case, further
          predictions   of   jet   physical  conditions  and  variability
          generation  mechanisms  have  been  made  in the context of the
          model. Although there might be other candidates able to explain
          the  emission coming from these sources, microquasars cannot be
          excluded  as  counterparts.  Observations performed by the next
          generation  of  gamma-ray instruments, like GLAST, are required
          to test the proposed model.

          Title: Quasars and their host galaxies
          Authors: Mark Lacy (Spitzer Science Center)
          Comments: Review article, to appear in Astrophysics Update 2
          This  review attempts to describe developments in the fields of
          quasar  and quasar host galaxies in the past five. In this time
          period,  the  Sloan  and  2dF quasar surveys have added several
          tens of thousands of quasars, with Sloan quasars being found to
          z>6.  Obscured,  or partially obscured quasars have begun to be
          found  in  significant  numbers.  Black hole mass estimates for
          quasars,   and   our   confidence   in   them,   have  improved
          significantly,  allowing  a start on relating quasar properties
          such as radio jet power to fundamental parameters of the quasar
          such  as black hole mass and accretion rate. Quasar host galaxy
          studies  have  allowed  us  to  find  and characterize the host
          galaxies  of  quasars  to z>2. Despite these developments, many
          questions  remain  unresolved,  in particular the origin of the
          close  relationship  between  black  hole mass and galaxy bulge
          mass/velocity dispersion seen in local galaxies.

          Cosmological  variations in the fine structure constant, alpha,
          can be probed through precise velocity measurements of metallic
          absorption lines from intervening gas clouds seen in spectra of
          distant  quasars. Data from the Keck/HIRES instrument support a
          variation  in  alpha  of  6 parts per million. Such a variation
          would  have  profound implications, possibly providing a window
          into  the extra spatial dimensions required by unified theories
          such  as string/M-theory. However, recent results from VLT/UVES
          suggest  no  variation in alpha. The COsmic Dynamics EXperiment
          (CODEX)  spectrograph  currently being designed for the ESO OWL
          telescope  (Pasquini  et al 2005) with a resolution high enough
          to  properly  resolve even the narrowest of metallic absorption
          lines,  R>150,000,  will  achieve  a  2-to-3 order-of-magnitude
          precision  increase  in  Delta\alpha/alpha. This will rival the
          precision  available  from the Oklo natural fission reactor and
          upcoming  satellite-borne  atomic  clock experiments. Given the
          vital  constraints  on  fundamental  physics  possible, the ELT
          community   must   consider   such  a  high-resolution  optical
          spectrograph like CODEX.

          phase  remains  as  the  favored  ground state over the gapless
          phase, even upon the consideration of the surface energy.

          Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures, MNRAS accepted
          We  report on the extreme behaviour of the high redshift blazar
          GB  B1428+4217  at  z=4.72.  A  continued  programme  of  radio
          measurements   has   revealed   an  exceptional  flare  in  the
          lightcurve,  with  the 15.2 GHz flux density rising by a factor
          ~3  from ~140 mJy to ~430 mJy in a rest-frame timescale of only
          ~4  months  -- much larger than any previous flares observed in
          this  source. In addition to new measurements of the 1.4-43 GHz
          radio  spectrum  we  also present the analysis and results of a
          target-of-opportunity  X-ray observation using XMM-Newton, made
          close to the peak in radio flux. Although the X-ray data do not
          show  a  flare  in  the  high energy lightcurve, we are able to
          confirm  the  X-ray  spectral variability hinted at in previous
          observations.  GB  B1428+4217  is  one of several high-redshift
          radio-loud quasars that display a low energy break in the X-ray
          spectrum,  probably due to the presence of excess absorption in
          the  source.  X-ray  spectral analysis of the latest XMM-Newton
          data  is  shown  to  be  consistent  with  the  warm absorption
          scenario which we have hypothesized previously. Warm absorption
          is also consistent with the observed X-ray spectral variability
          of   the   source,   in  which  the  spectral  changes  can  be
          successfully  accounted-for  with  a  fixed  column  density of
          material  in  which  the  ionization  state  is correlated with
          hardness of the underlying power-law emission.

          Title:  Modeling  the  QSO luminosity and spatial clustering at

          Authors:  F.  Marulli, D. Crociani, M. Volonteri, E. Branchini,
          L. Moscardini
          Comments: 13 pages, 9 figures. Accepted by MNRAS
          We  investigate  the  ability  of  hierarchical  models  of QSO
          formation  and  evolution  to  match  the  observed luminosity,
          number  counts  and  spatial  clustering of quasars at redshift
          z<2.  These models assume that the QSO emission is triggered by
          galaxy  mergers,  that  the  mass  of  the  central  black hole
          correlates with halo properties and that quasars shine at their
          Eddington  luminosity  except,  perhaps,  during the very early
          stages  of  evolution.  We  find  that  models  based on simple
          analytic  approximations  successfully  reproduce  the observed
          B-band  QSO luminosity function at all redshifts, provided that
          some  mechanisms  is  advocated to quench mass accretion within
          haloes  larger  than  about 1e13 Msun that host bright quasars.
          These models also match the observed strength of QSO clustering
          at  z~0.8.  At larger redshifts, however, they underpredict the
          QSO   biasing   which,  instead,  is  correctly  reproduced  by
          semi-analytic  models  in  which  the  halo  merger history and
          associated  BHs are followed by Monte Carlo realizations of the
          merger  hierarchy.  We  show  that the disagreement between the
          luminosity  function  predicted  by  semi-analytic  models  and
          observations  can  be ascribed to the use of B-band data, which
          are   a   biased  tracer  of  the  quasar  population,  due  to
          obscuration.

          Title: Formation of Supermassive Black Holes by Direct Collapse
          in Pregalactic Halos
          Authors: Mitchell C. Begelman, Marta Volonteri, Martin J. Rees
          Comments:  10 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Monthly Notices of
          the Royal Astronomical Society
          We  describe  a mechanism by which supermassive black holes can
          form  directly in the nuclei of protogalaxies, without the need
          for  seed  black  holes  left  over  from early star formation.
          Self-gravitating  gas  in  dark  matter  halos can lose angular
          momentum  rapidly  via runaway, global dynamical instabilities,
          the  so-called  "bars within bars" mechanism. This leads to the
          rapid  buildup  of  a dense, self-gravitating core supported by
          gas  pressure  -  surrounded  by a radiation pressure-dominated
          envelope  - which gradually contracts and is compressed further
          by  subsequent  infall.  These  conditions  lead  to  such high
          temperatures   in   the  central  region  that  the  gas  cools
          catastrophically  by  thermal neutrino emission, leading to the
          formation and rapid growth of a central black hole.
          We  estimate the initial mass and growth rate of the black hole
          for typical conditions in metal-free halos with T_vir ~ 10^4 K,
          which  are  the  first to be susceptible to runaway infall. The
          initial  black  hole  should have a mass of <~ 20 solar masses,
          but  in principle could grow at a super-Eddington rate until it
          reaches  ~  10^4-10^6 solar masses. Rapid growth may be limited
          by feedback from the accretion process and/or disruption of the
          mass  supply  by  star  formation  or  halo  mergers.  Even  if
          super-Eddington  growth  stops at ~10^3-10^4 solar masses, this
          process would give black holes ample time to attain quasar-size
          masses by a redshift of 6, and could also provide the seeds for
          all supermassive black holes seen in the present universe.

          The   ultraluminous  X-ray  sources  (ULXs)  were  isolated  in
          external   galaxies   for   the   last  5  years.  Their  X-ray
          luminosities  exceed  100-10000  times those of brightest Milky
          Way  black hole binaries and they are extremely variable. There
          are two models for the ULXs, the best black hole candidates. 1.
          They  are  supercritical  accretion disks around a stellar mass
          black hole like that in SS433, observed close to the disk axes.
          2.  They  are Intermediate Mass Black Holes (of 100-10000 solar
          masses).  Critical  observations which may throw light upon the
          ULXs  nature come from observations of nebulae around the ULXs.
          We present results of 3D-spectroscopy of nebulae around several
          ULXs  located  in  galaxies at 3-6 Mpc distances. We found that
          the  nebulae  to  be  powered by their central black holes. The
          nebulae are shocked and dynamically perturbed probably by jets.
          The nebulae are compared with SS433 nebula (W50).

          We  present  a  study  of  a  peculiar  Supernova Remnant MF16,
          associated  with  the  Ultraluminous X-ray Source (ULX) NGC6946
          ULX-1.  Observations  were  taken  with  the  MultiPupil  Fiber
          Spectrograph  (MPFS)  with  6-m  telescope on January 2005. The
          nebula is found to be highly asymmetric, one of the parts being
          much  denser  and  colder.  The  two-component structure of the
          emission  lines  and  radial  velocity  gradient  argue  for  a
          non-spherical  nebula,  expanding  with a velocity of about 100
          km/s.   Neither   shock  models  nor  the  X-ray  emission  can
          adequately  explain  the actual emission line spectrum of MF16,
          so   we   suggest  an  additional  ultraviolet  source  with  a
          luminosity  of about 10E40 erg/s. We confirm coincidence of the
          ULX with the central star, and identify radio emission observed
          by VLA with the most dense part of the nebula.

          Title: Observational constraints on Cosmic Reionization
          Authors:   Xiaohui  Fan  (Steward  Observatory),  C.L.  Carilli

          Comments: to appear in ARAA 2006. latex. 84 pages. 15 figs
          The epoch of reionization (EoR) is the last unexplored phase of
          cosmic  evolution,  corresponding  to  a  crucial era in cosmic
          structure  formation  --  the  formation  of the first luminous
          objects.  We  review  recent  data  that  have  set  the  first
          observational  constraints on the EoR. These observations paint
          an  interesting picture: spectroscopic studies of Gunn-Peterson
          (GP)  absorption,  and related phenomena, suggest a qualitative
          change in the state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z \sim
          6,  indicating  a rapid increase in the neutral fraction of the
          IGM,  from  x_{HI} < 10^{-4} at z \le 5.5, to x_{HI} > 10^{-3},
          and perhaps as high as 0.1, at z \ge 6. The IGM characteristics
          at  this epoch are consistent with the end of the `percolation'
          stage  of  reionization. On the other hand, transmission spikes
          in the GP trough, and observations of the evolution of the \lya
          galaxy  luminosity function indicate x_{HI} < 50% at z\sim 6.5.
          Similarly,  the  measurement of the large scale polarization of
          the  CMB implies a significant ionization fraction extending to
          higher  redshifts,  z  \sim 15 to 20. Overall, the current data
          suggest  that  reionization  is  less  an event than a process,
          extended  in both time and space, with the process beginning as
          early  as  z \sim 20, and with the last vestiges of the neutral
          IGM  extending  down  to  z \sim 6. Current data are consistent
          with  star  forming  galaxies,  in  particular  low  luminosity
          galaxies,  as being the dominant sources of reionizing photons.
          We  also  show  that  low  frequency radio telescopes currently
          under  construction  should  be  able  to make the first direct
          measurements  of  HI  21cm emission from the neutral IGM during
          the  EoR,  and  that  upcoming  measurements  of  secondary CMB
          temperature   anisotropy  will  provide  fine  details  of  the
          dynamics of the reionized IGM.

          We   present  partial-correlation  analyses  that  examine  the
          strengths of the relationships between L_UV, L_X, Alpha_OX, and
          redshift  for  optically-selected  AGNs.  We extend the work of
          Strateva  et  al. (2005), that analyzed optically-selected AGNs
          from  the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS), by including 52
          moderate-luminosity,  optically-selected AGNs from the COMBO-17
          survey  with  corresponding  deep  (~250  ks  to  1  Ms)  X-ray
          observations  from  the  Extended Chandra Deep Field-South. The
          COMBO-17  survey extends ~3 magnitudes deeper than the SDSS and
          probes  the  moderate-luminosity AGNs that numerically dominate
          the  AGN  population  in the Universe. We also include recently
          published  observations of 19 high-redshift, optically-selected
          AGNs, and 46 luminous, low-redshift AGNs from the Bright Quasar
          Survey.  The  full  sample used in our analysis consists of 333
          AGNs,  extending  out  to  z~6,  with  293  (88%)  having X-ray
          detections.  The sample spans five decades in UV luminosity and
          four  decades  in X-ray luminosity. We confirm that Alpha_OX is
          strongly  anti-correlated  with  L_UV (13.6 sigma), the highest
          significance found for this relation to date, and find evidence
          suggesting  that the slope of this relation may be dependent on
          L_UV.  We  find  that no significant correlation exists between
          Alpha_OX  and  redshift  (1.3 sigma), and constrain the maximum
          evolution of AGN UV-to-X-ray flux ratios to be less than 30% (1
          sigma)  out  to  z=5.  Using  our sample's high X-ray detection
          fraction,  we  also  find  a  significant anti-correlation (3.0
          sigma)  between  Alpha_OX  and  L_X  .  We  make comparisons to
          earlier  studies  on  this  topic  and discuss implications for
          X-ray vs. optical luminosity functions.

          We  have obtained high resolution images of the central regions
          of  14  reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (AGN) using
          the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  Advanced Camera for Surveys High
          Resolution   Camera   to   account  for  host-galaxy  starlight
          contamination  of  measured  AGN  luminosities.  We measure the
          host-galaxy  starlight contribution to the continuum luminosity
          at  5100  A  through the typical ground-based slit position and
          geometry  used  in the reverberation-mapping campaigns. We find
          that   removing   the   starlight  contribution  results  in  a
          significant  correction to the luminosity of each AGN, both for
          lower  luminosity sources, as expected, but also for the higher
          luminosity sources such as the PG quasars. After accounting for
          the host galaxy starlight, we revisit the well-known broad-line
          region  radius--luminosity relationship for nearby AGN. We find
          the  power-law slope of the relationship for the H beta line to
          be  0.518  +/-  0.039,  shallower  than previously reported and
          consistent  with  the  slope  of  0.5  expected  from the naive
          theoretical  assumption that all AGN have, on average, the same
          ionizing  spectrum  and  the  same ionization parameter and gas
          density in the H beta line-emitting region.

          Preliminary  results  from a sensitive survey of the CO J=1--0,

          3--2,  4--3,  6--5, HCN J=1--0, 3--2, 4--3, and CI J=1--0 lines

          presented.  These  reveal a tandalizing picture of the physical
          conditions of the molecular gas in these extraordinary galaxies
          ($\rm   L_{FIR}>10^{12}   L_{\odot}$),  with  a  diffuse  phase
          dominating  the  low-J  CO  lines  and a much denser and warmer
          phase  dominating the CO 4-3 and 6-5 and all the HCN lines. The
          CI  J=1--0  emission  was  found to be a robust tracer of their
          total  molecular  gas  mass  under  a  large  range of physical
          conditions,  a  potent  alternative to the much weaker emission
          from  the  $ ^{13}$CO isotopologue, and especially promising as
          an H$_2$ tracer for similar objects at high redshifts.

          Velocities   close   to   the  speed  of  light  are  a  robust
          observational property of the jets observed in microquasars and
          AGNs,  and  are expected to be behind much of the phenomenology
          of  GRBs. Yet, the mechanism boosting relativistic jets to such
          large Lorentz factors is still essentially unknown. Building on
          recent  general-relativistic,  multidimensional  simulations of
          progenitors   of  short  GRBs,  we  discuss  a  new  effect  in
          relativistic  hydrodynamics  which  can  act  as  an  efficient
          booster  in  jets.  This  effect  is  purely hydrodynamical and
          occurs  when large velocities tangential to a discontinuity are
          present  in  the  flow,  yielding  Lorentz factors $\Gamma \sim
          10^2-10^3$  or  larger  in  flows with moderate initial Lorentz
          factors.  Although without a Newtonian counterpart, this effect
          can   be   explained   easily   through   the  most  elementary
          hydrodynamical flow: i.e., a relativistic Riemann problem.

          Jet  models  for  the  high-energy  emission  of Galactic X-ray
          binary sources have regained significant interest with detailed
          spectral   and  timing  studies  of  the  X-ray  emission  from
          microquasars, the recent detection by the HESS collaboration of
          very-high-energy  gamma-rays  from the microquasar LS~5039, and
          the  earlier  suggestion  of jet models for ultraluminous X-ray
          sources  observed  in  many  nearby galaxies. Here we study the
          synchrotron  and  Compton signatures of time-dependent electron
          injection  and  acceleration,  adiabatic and radiative cooling,
          and   different   jet   geometries  in  the  jets  of  Galactic
          microquasars.    Synchrotron,   synchrotron-self-Compton,   and
          external-Compton radiation processes with soft photons provided
          by  the  companion  star and the accretion disk are treated. An
          analytical  solution  is  presented  to  the  electron  kinetic
          equation  for  general  power-law  geometries  of  the jets for
          Compton  scattering  in  the  Thomson regime. We pay particular
          attention to predictions concerning the rapid flux and spectral
          variability  signatures  expected  in  a  variety of scenarios,
          making   specific   predictions  concerning  possible  spectral
          hysteresis,  similar  to  what has been observed in several TeV
          blazars.  Such  predictions  should  be testable with dedicated
          monitoring    observations   of   Galactic   microquasars   and
          ultraluminous X-ray sources using Chandra and/or XMM-Newton.

          We  have obtained high resolution images of the central regions
          of  14  reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (AGN) using
          the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  Advanced Camera for Surveys High
          Resolution   Camera   to   account  for  host-galaxy  starlight
          contamination  of  measured  AGN  luminosities.  We measure the
          host-galaxy  starlight contribution to the continuum luminosity
          at  5100  A  through the typical ground-based slit position and
          geometry  used  in the reverberation-mapping campaigns. We find
          that   removing   the   starlight  contribution  results  in  a
          significant  correction to the luminosity of each AGN, both for
          lower  luminosity sources, as expected, but also for the higher
          luminosity sources such as the PG quasars. After accounting for
          the host galaxy starlight, we revisit the well-known broad-line
          region  radius--luminosity relationship for nearby AGN. We find
          the  power-law slope of the relationship for the H beta line to
          be  0.518  +/-  0.039,  shallower  than previously reported and
          consistent  with  the  slope  of  0.5  expected  from the naive
          theoretical  assumption that all AGN have, on average, the same
          ionizing  spectrum  and  the  same ionization parameter and gas
          density in the H beta line-emitting region.

          Preliminary  results  from a sensitive survey of the CO J=1--0,
          2--1,
          3--2,  4--3,  6--5, HCN J=1--0, 3--2, 4--3, and CI J=1--0 lines
          of  a sample of 30 Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) are
          presented.  These  reveal a tandalizing picture of the physical
          conditions of the molecular gas in these extraordinary galaxies
          ($\rm   L_{FIR}>10^{12}   L_{\odot}$),  with  a  diffuse  phase
          dominating  the  low-J  CO  lines  and a much denser and warmer
          phase  dominating the CO 4-3 and 6-5 and all the HCN lines. The
          CI  J=1--0  emission  was  found to be a robust tracer of their
          total  molecular  gas  mass  under  a  large  range of physical
          conditions,  a  potent  alternative to the much weaker emission
          from  the  $ ^{13}$CO isotopologue, and especially promising as
          an H$_2$ tracer for similar objects at high redshifts.

          Velocities   close   to   the  speed  of  light  are  a  robust
          observational property of the jets observed in microquasars and
          AGNs,  and  are expected to be behind much of the phenomenology
          of  GRBs. Yet, the mechanism boosting relativistic jets to such
          large Lorentz factors is still essentially unknown. Building on
          recent  general-relativistic,  multidimensional  simulations of
          progenitors   of  short  GRBs,  we  discuss  a  new  effect  in
          relativistic  hydrodynamics  which  can  act  as  an  efficient
          booster  in  jets.  This  effect  is  purely hydrodynamical and
          occurs  when large velocities tangential to a discontinuity are
          present  in  the  flow,  yielding  Lorentz factors $\Gamma \sim
          10^2-10^3$  or  larger  in  flows with moderate initial Lorentz
          factors.  Although without a Newtonian counterpart, this effect
          can   be   explained   easily   through   the  most  elementary
          hydrodynamical flow: i.e., a relativistic Riemann problem.

          Jet  models  for  the  high-energy  emission  of Galactic X-ray
          binary sources have regained significant interest with detailed
          spectral   and  timing  studies  of  the  X-ray  emission  from
          microquasars, the recent detection by the HESS collaboration of
          very-high-energy  gamma-rays  from the microquasar LS~5039, and
          the  earlier  suggestion  of jet models for ultraluminous X-ray
          sources  observed  in  many  nearby galaxies. Here we study the
          synchrotron  and  Compton signatures of time-dependent electron
          injection  and  acceleration,  adiabatic and radiative cooling,
          and   different   jet   geometries  in  the  jets  of  Galactic
          microquasars.    Synchrotron,   synchrotron-self-Compton,   and
          external-Compton radiation processes with soft photons provided
          by  the  companion  star and the accretion disk are treated. An
          analytical  solution  is  presented  to  the  electron  kinetic
          equation  for  general  power-law  geometries  of  the jets for
          Compton  scattering  in  the  Thomson regime. We pay particular
          attention to predictions concerning the rapid flux and spectral
          variability  signatures  expected  in  a  variety of scenarios,
          making   specific   predictions  concerning  possible  spectral
          hysteresis,  similar  to  what has been observed in several TeV
          blazars.  Such  predictions  should  be testable with dedicated
          monitoring    observations   of   Galactic   microquasars   and
          ultraluminous X-ray sources using Chandra and/or XMM-Newton.

          We   present  new  Chandra  observations  of  21  z>4  quasars,
          including  11  sources  at  z>5.  These observations double the
          number of X-ray detected quasars at z>5, allowing investigation
          of  the  X-ray  spectral  properties of a substantial sample of
          quasars  at the dawn of the modern Universe. By jointly fitting
          the  spectra  of  15  z>5 radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), including
          sources  from the Chandra archive, with a total of 185 photons,
          we    find   a   mean   X-ray   power-law   photon   index   of
          Gamma=1.95^{+0.30}_{-0.26},   and   a  mean  neutral  intrinsic
          absorption  column  density  of  N_H<~6x10^{22}  cm^{-2}. These
          results  show  that  quasar  X-ray spectral properties have not
          evolved  up  to  the highest observable redshifts. We also find
          that  the  mean  optical-X-ray  spectral  slope  (alpha_ox)  of
          optically-selected  z>5  RQQs,  excluding broad absorption line
          quasars, is alpha_ox=-1.69+/-0.03, which is consistent with the
          value predicted from the observed relationship between alpha_ox
          and  ultraviolet  luminosity. Four of the sources in our sample
          are  members  of  the rare class of weak emission-line quasars,
          and   we   detect  two  of  them  in  X-rays.  We  discuss  the
          implications  our  X-ray  observations  have  for the nature of
          these  mysterious  sources  and,  in  particular, whether their
          weak-line  spectra are a consequence of continuum boosting or a
          deficit of high-ionization line emitting gas.

          3-4
          Authors: Raul Jimenez (UPenn), Zoltan Haiman (Columbia)
          Comments:  Nature  in  press,  March  23rd  issue. Under Nature
          embargo
          Four   recent   observational   results   have  challenged  our
          understanding  of  high--redshift galaxies, as they require the
          presence of far more ultraviolet photons than should be emitted
          by  normal  stellar  populations.  First,  there is significant
          ultraviolet  emission  from  Lyman  Break  Galaxies  (LBGs)  at
          wavelenghts  shorter than 912\AA. Second, there is strong Lyman
          alpha  emission  from  extended  ``blobs''  with  little  or no
          associated  apparent  ionizing  continuum.  Third,  there  is a
          population   of  galaxies  with  unusually  strong  Lyman-alpha
          emission  lines.  And fourth, there is a strong HeII (1640 \AA)
          emission line in a composite of LBGs. The proposed explanations
          for  the  first three observations are internally inconsistent,
          and  the  fourth puzzle has remained hitherto unexplained. Here
          we  show  that all four problems are resolved simultaneously if
          10-30  percent  of  the  stars  in many galaxies at z ~ 3-4 are
          mainly  primordial - unenriched by elements heavier than helium
          ('metals'). Most models of hierarchical galaxy formation assume
          efficient  intra--galactic  metal  mixing, and therefore do not
          predict  metal-free  star  formation at redshifts significantly
          below  z  ~5.  Our  results  imply  that micro-mixing of metals
          within  galaxies  is  inefficient  on  a  ~  Gyr  time-scale, a
          conclusion   that   can  be  verified  with  higher  resolution
          simulations, and future observations of the HeII emission line.

          by the Spitzer Space Telescope
          Authors: A. Franceschini, G. Rodighiero, S. Berta, P. Cassata
          Comments:  invited  review  at  the Workshop on "AGN and galaxy
          evolution",  Specola  Vaticana,  Castel  Gandolfo,  Italy,  3-6
          October 2005
          We compare the history of the galaxy mass build-up, as inferred
          from  near-IR  observations,  and  the  Star  Formation Rate of
          massive  stars  in the comoving volume traced by deep extensive
          far-IR  surveys,  both  possible  now  with  the  Spitzer Space
          Telescope.  These  two independent and complementary approaches
          to the history of galaxy formation consistently indicate that a
          wide  interval  of  cosmic epochs between z~0.7 to z~2 brackets
          the main evolutionary phases. The rate of the integrated galaxy
          mass  growth  indicated  by  the  IR-based comoving SFR appears
          consistent  with  the  observed  decrease  of  the stellar mass
          densities  with  redshift.  There are also indications that the
          evolution  with  z  of  the  total population depends on galaxy
          mass, being stronger for moderate-mass, but almost absent up to
          z=1.4 for high-mass galaxies, thus confirming previous evidence
          for a "downsizing" effect in galaxy formation. The most massive
          galaxies  appear  already  mostly  in  place by z~1. Although a
          precise  matching  of  this  galaxy build-up with the growth of
          nuclear  super-massive  black-holes  is  not  possible with the
          present data (due to difficulties for an accurate census of the
          obscured AGN phenomenon), some preliminary indications reveal a
          similar mass/luminosity dependence for AGN evolution as for the
          hosting galaxies.

          X-ray emission from Holmberg IX X-1
          Authors: G. C. Dewangan (CMU), R. E. Griffiths (CMU), A. R. Rao
          (TIFR)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ Letters
          We  report the discovery of a 200mHz quasi-periodic oscillation
          (QPO)  in the X-ray emission from a bright ultra-luminous X-ray
          source   (ULX)   Holmberg   IX  X-1  using  a  long  XMM-Newton
          observation.  The QPO has a centroid at 202.5_{-3.8}^{+4.9}mHz,
          a  coherence  Q  ~9.3  and  an  amplitude  (rms)  of  6% in the
          0.2-10keV band. This is only the second detection of a QPO from
          an  ULX,  after  M82  X-1, and provides strong evidence against
          beaming.  The power spectrum is well fitted by a power law with
          an  index of ~0.7. The total integrated power (rms) is ~9.4% in
          the  0.001-1Hz  range.  The X-ray spectrum shows clear evidence
          for  a  soft X-ray excess component that is well described by a
          multicolor  disk  blackbody  (kT_in ~ 0.3keV) and a high energy
          curvature  that  can  be  modeled either by a cut-off power law
          (Gamma  ~  1;  E_cutoff  ~9keV)  or  as  a strongly Comptonized
          continuum  in  an  optically  thick  (tau  ~7.3) and cool (kT_e
          ~3keV)  plasma.  Both  the presence of the QPO and the shape of
          the  X-ray spectrum strongly suggest that the ULX is not in the
          high/soft  or  thermally  dominated state. A truncated disk and
          inner  optically  thick  corona  may explain the observed X-ray
          spectrum and the presence of the QPO.

          The chemical properties of dwarf spheroidals in the local group
          are   shown  to  be  inconsistent  with  star  formation  being
          truncated  after  the reionization epoch (z~8). Enhanced levels
          of  [Ba/Y] in stars in dwarf spheroidals like Sculptor indicate
          strong s-process production from low-mass stars whose lifetimes
          are comparable with the duration of the pre-reionization epoch.
          The  chemical  evolution  of Sculptor is followed using a model
          with    SNeII    and    SNeIa    feedback    and    mass-   and
          metallicity-dependent  nucleosynthetic yields for elements from
          H to Pb. We are unable to reproduce the Ba/Y ratio unless stars
          formed  over  an interval long enough for the low-mass stars to
          pollute  the  interstellar  medium with s-elements. This robust
          result  challenges  the suggestion that most of the local group
          dwarf  spheroidals are fossils of reionization and supports the
          case for large initial dark matter halos.

          Cosmological   hydrodynamic   simulations   have  significantly
          improved over the past several years, and we have already shown
          that  the observed properties of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at
          z=3  can  be  explained  well  by  the  massive galaxies in the
          simulations.  Here  we extend our study to z=6 and show that we
          obtain  good  agreement  for  the LBGs at the bright-end of the
          luminosity function (LF). Our simulations also suggest that the
          cosmic  star  formation  rate density has a peak at z= 5-6, and
          that  the  current LBG surveys at z=6 are missing a significant
          number  of  faint  galaxies  that  are  dimmer than the current
          magnitude   limit.  Together,  our  results  suggest  that  the
          universe  could  be  reionized  at  z=6  by the Pop II stars in
          ordinary  galaxies.  We  also  estimate  the  LF of Lyman-alpha
          emitters  (LAEs)  at z=6 by relating the star formation rate in
          the  simulation  to  the  Ly-alpha luminosity. We find that the
          simulated  LAE  LFs  agree with the observed data provided that
          the  net  escape fraction of Ly-alpha photon is f_{Ly-alpha} <=
          0.1. We investigate two possible scenarios for this effect: (1)
          all  sources in the simulation are uniformly dimmer by a factor
          of 10 through attenuation, and (2) one out of ten LAEs randomly
          lights  up  at  a  given  moment.  We show that the correlation

          proceedings  of  "Relativistic  Astrophysics  and  Cosmology  -

          Germany
          We compare all the available observational data on the redshift
          evolution  of  the  total  stellar mass and star formation rate
          density  in  the  Universe  with  the  mass  and accretion rate
          density  evolution  of supermassive black holes, estimated from
          the  hard  X-ray  selected  luminosity  function of quasars and
          active galactic nuclei. We find that on average black hole mass
          must  have  been  higher  at higher redshift for given spheroid
          stellar  mass. Moreover, we find negative redshift evolution of
          the disk/irregulars to spheroid mass ratio. The total accretion
          efficiency   is  constrained  to  be  between  0.06  and  0.12,
          depending  on  the  exact value of the local SMBH mass density,
          and  on  the  critical  accretion  rate below which radiatively
          inefficient accretion may take place.

          Title: Toward a Clean Sample of Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources
          Authors: M. Lopez-Corredoira, C. M. Gutierrez
          Comments: 9 pages, accepted in A&A
          CONTEXT.    Observational    follow-up   programmes   for   the
          characterization of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) require
          the  construction of clean samples of such sources in which the
          contamination by foreground/background sources is minimum.
          AIMS.   In   this   article   we   calculate   the   degree  of
          foreground/background   contaminants   among   the  ULX  sample
          candidates  in  the Colbert & Ptak (2002) catalogue and compare
          these     computations     with    available    spectroscopical
          identifications.
          METHODS.  We  use  statistics based on known densities of X-ray
          sources  and  AGN/QSOs selected in the optical. The analysis is
          done   individually   for  each  parent  galaxy.  The  existing
          identifications  of  the optical counterparts are compiled from
          the literature.
          RESULTS.  More  than  a  half  of  the  ULXs,  within twice the
          distance  of  the  major axis of the 25 mag/arcsec$^2$ isophote
          from RC3 nearby galaxies and with X-ray luminosities $L_X$[2-10
          keV]  $\ge  10^{39}$  erg/s,  are  expected to be high redshift
          background  QSOs. A list of 25 objects (clean sample) confirmed
          to  be  real  ULXs  or  to  have  a  low  probability  of being
          contaminant foreground/background objects is provided.

          X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies

          Comments:  Submitted  for  publication  in MNRAS (Jan 2006). 10
          pages, 5 figures
          Using  Chandra  X-ray  observations of 9 nearby, X-ray luminous
          ellipticals with good optical velocity dispersion measurements,
          we  show  that  a  tight  correlation  exists between the Bondi
          accretion  rates  calculated  from the X-ray data and estimated
          black hole masses, and the power emerging from these systems in
          relativistic  jets.  The jet powers, inferred from the energies
          and timescales required to inflate the cavities observed in the
          surrounding X-ray emitting gas, can be related to the accretion
          rates   by   a   power   law   model.  A  significant  fraction
          (2.4^{+1.0}_{-0.7}  per  cent,  for P_jet=10^{43} erg/s) of the
          energy  associated  with the rest mass of material entering the
          accretion   radius  emerges  in  the  jets.  Our  results  have
          significant   implications   for   studies  of  accretion,  jet
          formation  and  galaxy formation. The tight correlation between
          P_Bondi  and  P_jet  suggests that the Bondi formulae provide a
          reasonable  description  of  the accretion process, despite the
          likely  presence  of  magnetic pressure and angular momentum in
          the   accreting   gas,   and   that  the  accretion  flows  are
          approximately  stable  over  timescales of a few million years.
          Our  results  show that the black hole engines at the hearts of
          large  elliptical  galaxies  and  groups  feed  back sufficient
          energy to stem cooling and star formation, leading naturally to
          the  observed  exponential  cut  off  at  the bright end of the
          galaxy luminosity function.

          accepted
          We  present  4-7 ks Chandra observations of 35 Broad Absorption
          Line  (BAL)  quasars  from  the Large Bright Quasar Survey, the
          largest  sample of sensitive, 0.5-8.0 keV X-ray observations of
          this  class  of  quasars  to  date.  The limited ranges in both
          redshift  (z=1.42-2.90)  and UV luminosity (a factor of ~12) of
          the  sample  also make it relatively uniform. Of 35 targets, 27
          are  detected  for  a detection fraction of 77%, and we confirm
          previous  studies  that  find BAL quasars to be generally X-ray
          weak. Five of the eight non-detections are known low-ionization
          BAL  quasars,  confirming  reports of extreme X-ray weakness in
          this subset (~10% of optically selected BAL quasars). Those BAL
          quasars  with  the  hardest  X-ray  spectra  are also the X-ray
          weakest,  consistent  with  the  interpretation  that intrinsic
          absorption is the primary cause of X-ray weakness in this class
          of  quasars  as a whole. Furthermore, the observed trend is not
          consistent  with simple neutral absorption, supporting findings
          from  spectroscopic observations of individual targets that BAL
          quasars  typically  exhibit  complex  X-ray  absorption  (e.g.,
          partially    covering    or   ionized   absorbers).   In   sum,
          high-ionization BAL quasars are typically neither intrinsically
          X-ray   weak  nor  suffer  from  Compton-thick  absorption.  In
          general,  we  find  no  evidence for correlations between X-ray
          weakness  and UV absorption-line properties, with the exception
          of a likely correlation between the maximum outflow velocity of
          CIV  absorption and the magnitude of X-ray weakness. We discuss
          the  implications  of  our  results for disk-wind models of BAL
          outflows in quasars. (abridged)

          Authors: M. Valdes, B. Ciardi, A. Ferrara, M. Johnston-Hollitt,
          H. Rottgering
          Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures
          We   use  numerical  simulations  of  cosmic  reionization  and
          radiative  processes  related  to the HI 21 cm emission line to
          produce  synthetic  radio  maps  as  seen by LOFAR, a new radio
          telescope currently under construction that will operate at low
          radio frequencies. Two different scenarios, in which the end of
          reionization  occurs  early  (z approx 13) or late (z approx 8)
          depending on the Initial Mass Function (IMF) of the first stars
          and  ionizing  photon  escape fraction, have been explored. For
          each  of  these  models  we produce synthetic HI 21 cm emission
          maps  by  convolving  the  simulation  outputs  with  the LOFAR
          sampling  function  in  the  frequency  range  76-140  MHz.  If
          reionization   occurs  late,  LOFAR  will  be  able  to  detect
          individual  HI  structures  on  arcmin  scales,  emitting  at a
          brightness  temperature  of approx 35 mK as a 3-sigma signal in
          about  1000  hours  of  observing  time.  In  the case of early
          reionization, the detection would be unlikely, due to decreased
          sensitivity  and  increased  sky  temperatures.  These  results
          assume that ionospheric, interference and foreground issues are
          fully under control.

          In   this  paper  we  present  the  first  results  of  a  deep
          spectroscopic  survey of faint quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky
          Survey  (SDSS)  Southern  Survey,  a deep survey carried out by
          repeatedly  imaging  a  270  deg^2 area. Quasar candidates were
          selected  from the deep data with good completeness over 0<z<5,
          and  2  to  3  magnitudes  fainter  than  the SDSS main survey.
          Spectroscopic  follow-up  was  carried out on the 6.5m MMT with
          Hectospec.  The  preliminary  sample  of this SDSS faint quasar
          survey  (hereafter  SFQS)  covers  ~  3.9  deg^2,  contains 414
          quasars,  and  reaches g=22.5. The overall selection efficiency
          is  ~  66%  (~  80%  at  g<21.5);  the  efficiency  in the most
          difficult redshift range (2<z<3) is better than 40%. We use the
          1/V_{a}  method  to  derive  a  binned  estimate  of the quasar
          luminosity  function  (QLF)  and  model  the  QLF using maximum
          likelihood  analysis.  The  best  model  fits  confirm previous
          results showing that the QLF has steep slopes at the bright end
          and  much flatter slopes (-1.25 at z<2.0 and -1.55 at z>2.0) at
          the  faint  end,  indicating  a break in the QLF slope. Using a
          luminosity-dependent  density evolution model, we find that the
          quasar  density  at M_{g}<-22.5 peaks at z~2, which is later in
          cosmic  time  than the peak of z~2.5 found from surveys of more
          luminous  objects.  The SFQS QLF is consistent with the results
          of  the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey, the SDSS, and the 2dF-SDSS LRG
          and  QSO  Survey, but probes fainter quasars. We plan to obtain
          more  quasars from future observations and establish a complete
          faint quasar sample with more than 1000 objects over 10 deg^2.

          Reviews of Astronomy and Astrophysics
          Globular cluster (GC) systems have now been studied in galaxies
          ranging  from  dwarfs  to  giants  and spanning the full Hubble
          sequence  of morphological types. Imaging and spectroscopy with
          the  Hubble  Space  Telescope and large ground-based telescopes
          have together established that most galaxies have bimodal color
          distributions  that  reflect  two  subpopulations  of  old GCs:
          metal-poor   and   metal-rich.   The  characteristics  of  both
          subpopulations  are  correlated  with  those  of  their  parent
          galaxies.  We argue that metal-poor GCs formed in low-mass dark
          matter  halos  in  the early universe and that their properties
          reflect biased galaxy assembly. The metal-rich GCs were born in
          the  subsequent  dissipational buildup of their parent galaxies
          and  their  ages  and  abundances  indicate  that  most massive
          early-type  galaxies  formed  the  bulk of their stars at early
          times.  Detailed  studies  of both subpopulations offer some of

          The  morphology of the total gas and the neutral hydrogen (H I)
          distributions during the cosmological epoch of reionization can
          be  quantified  with  Minkowski Functionals (MFs) of isodensity
          surfaces.   We   compute   the   MFs   from  the  output  of  a
          high-resolution  numerical  simulation  which includes explicit
          treatment  of  transfer  of  UV  ionizing radiation. "Galaxies"
          identified  in  the  simulation  using  semi-analytic models of
          galaxy  formation  are  assumed  to  be  the sole sources of UV
          photons.  The  MFs  of  the  total  gas  distribution  are well
          described  by  the  analytic  expressions derived for lognormal
          random  fields.  The  statistical properties of the diffuse H I
          depend  on  the gas distribution and on the way ionized regions
          propagate in the inter-galactic medium (IGM). The deviations of
          the  MFs  of  the  H  I  distribution from those of a lognormal
          random field are, therefore, caused by reionization. We use the
          MFs  to discriminate between the various stages of reionization
          in  the  simulation.  We suggest a simple model of reionization
          which  reproduces  the  MFs derived from this simulation. Using
          random realizations of lognormal density fields, we also assess
          the   ability   of   MFs   to   distinguish  between  different
          reionization   scenarios.  Our  results  are  relevant  to  the
          analysis of future cosmological twenty-one centimeter maps.

          Title: Evolution of supermassive black holes
          Authors: Marta Volonteri
          Comments:  Extended  version  of the invited paper to appear in
          the  Proceedings  of  the Conference "Relativistic Astrophysics
          and Cosmology - Einstein's Legacy"
          Supermassive  black  holes  (SMBHs)  are  nowadays  believed to
          reside  in  most local galaxies, and the available data show an
          empirical  correlation  between  bulge  luminosity - or stellar
          velocity  dispersion - and black hole mass, suggesting a single
          mechanism  for  assembling black holes and forming spheroids in
          galaxy  halos.  The  evidence  is  therefore  in  favour  of  a
          co-evolution between galaxies, black holes and quasars. In cold
          dark  matter  cosmogonies,  small-mass subgalactic systems form
          first to merge later into larger and larger structures. In this
          paradigm  galaxy halos experience multiple mergers during their
          lifetime.  If  every  galaxy  with  a bulge hosts a SMBH in its
          center,  and  a  local  galaxy  has  been  made  up by multiple
          mergers,  then  a  black  hole binary is a natural evolutionary
          stage.  The evolution of the supermassive black hole population
          clearly  has  to  be  investigated taking into account both the
          cosmological framework and the dynamical evolution of SMBHs and
          their  hosts.  The  seeds of SMBHs have to be looked for in the
          early  Universe,  as  very  luminous quasars are detected up to
          redshift  higher  than  z=6. These black holes evolve then in a
          hierarchical  fashion,  following the merger hierarchy of their
          host  halos. Accretion of gas, traced by quasar activity, plays
          a fundamental role in determining the two parameters defining a
          black  hole:  mass and spin. A particularly intriguing epoch is
          the  initial  phase  of  SMBH growth. It is very challenging to
          meet the observational constraints at z=6 if BHs are not fed at
          very high rates in their infancy.

          surfaces.   We   compute   the   MFs   from  the  output  of  a
          high-resolution  numerical  simulation  which includes explicit
          treatment  of  transfer  of  UV  ionizing radiation. "Galaxies"
          identified  in  the  simulation  using  semi-analytic models of
          galaxy  formation  are  assumed  to  be  the sole sources of UV
          photons.  The  MFs  of  the  total  gas  distribution  are well
          described  by  the  analytic  expressions derived for lognormal
          random  fields.  The  statistical properties of the diffuse H I
          depend  on  the gas distribution and on the way ionized regions
          propagate in the inter-galactic medium (IGM). The deviations of
          the  MFs  of  the  H  I  distribution from those of a lognormal
          random field are, therefore, caused by reionization. We use the
          MFs  to discriminate between the various stages of reionization
          in  the  simulation.  We suggest a simple model of reionization
          which  reproduces  the  MFs derived from this simulation. Using
          random realizations of lognormal density fields, we also assess
          the   ability   of   MFs   to   distinguish  between  different
          reionization   scenarios.  Our  results  are  relevant  to  the
          analysis of future cosmological twenty-one centimeter maps.

          Title: Evolution of supermassive black holes
          Authors: Marta Volonteri
          Comments:  Extended  version  of the invited paper to appear in
          the  Proceedings  of  the Conference "Relativistic Astrophysics
          and Cosmology - Einstein's Legacy"
          Supermassive  black  holes  (SMBHs)  are  nowadays  believed to
          reside  in  most local galaxies, and the available data show an
          empirical  correlation  between  bulge  luminosity - or stellar
          velocity  dispersion - and black hole mass, suggesting a single
          mechanism  for  assembling black holes and forming spheroids in
          galaxy  halos.  The  evidence  is  therefore  in  favour  of  a
          co-evolution between galaxies, black holes and quasars. In cold
          dark  matter  cosmogonies,  small-mass subgalactic systems form
          first to merge later into larger and larger structures. In this
          paradigm  galaxy halos experience multiple mergers during their
          lifetime.  If  every  galaxy  with  a bulge hosts a SMBH in its
          center,  and  a  local  galaxy  has  been  made  up by multiple
          mergers,  then  a  black  hole binary is a natural evolutionary
          stage.  The evolution of the supermassive black hole population
          clearly  has  to  be  investigated taking into account both the
          cosmological framework and the dynamical evolution of SMBHs and
          their  hosts.  The  seeds of SMBHs have to be looked for in the
          early  Universe,  as  very  luminous quasars are detected up to
          redshift  higher  than  z=6. These black holes evolve then in a
          hierarchical  fashion,  following the merger hierarchy of their
          host  halos. Accretion of gas, traced by quasar activity, plays
          a fundamental role in determining the two parameters defining a
          black  hole:  mass and spin. A particularly intriguing epoch is
          the  initial  phase  of  SMBH growth. It is very challenging to
          meet the observational constraints at z=6 if BHs are not fed at
          very high rates in their infancy.

          Ever   since  their  discovery  in  the  1970's,  UltraLuminous
          InfraRed  Galaxies  (ULIRGs;  classically  Lir>10^12Lsun)  have
          fascinated  astronomers  with  their  immense luminosities, and
          frustrated  them  due to their singularly opaque nature, almost
          in  equal measure. Over the last decade, however, comprehensive
          observations  from the X-ray through to the radio have produced
          a  consensus  picture  of  local  ULIRGs, showing that they are
          mergers  between  gas  rich  galaxies,  where  the  interaction
          triggers  some combination of dust-enshrouded starburst and AGN
          activity,  with  the  starburst usually dominating. Very recent
          results have thrown ULIRGs even further to the fore. Originally
          they  were  thought  of as little more than a local oddity, but
          the  latest  IR  surveys have shown that ULIRGs are vastly more
          numerous  at  high  redshift,  and  tantalizing  suggestions of
          physical  differences between high and low redshift ULIRGs hint
          at  differences in their formation modes and local environment.
          In  this review we look at recent progress on understanding the
          physics and evolution of local ULIRGs, the contribution of high
          redshift  ULIRGs  to  the  cosmic  infrared  background and the
          global  history  of  star  formation, and the role of ULIRGs as
          diagnostics   of   the   formation   of  massive  galaxies  and
          large-scale structures.

          Title:  Lens-Aided  Multi-Angle  Spectroscopy  (LAMAS)  Reveals
          Small-Scale Outflow Structure in Quasars
          Authors: Paul J. Green
          Comments: accepted to ApJ
          Spectral differences between lensed quasar image components are
          common.   Since  lensing  is  intrinsically  achromatic,  these
          differences  are  typically  explained  as the effect of either
          microlensing,  or  as light path time delays sampling intrinsic
          quasar  spectral  variability.  Here  we  advance a novel third
          hypothesis:   some   spectral  differences  are  due  to  small
          line-of-sight differences through quasar disk wind outflows. In
          particular,  we propose that variable spectral differences seen
          only   in   component   A   of   the   widest  separation  lens
          SDSSJ1004+4112  are  due  to  differential absorption along the
          sightlines. The absorber properties required by this hypothesis
          are akin to known broad absorption line (BAL) outflows but must
          have  a  broader,  smoother  velocity profile. We interpret the
          observed  CIV emission line variability as further evidence for
          spatial  fine  structure transverse to the line of sight. Since
          outflows   are  likely  to  be  rotating,  such  absorber  fine
          structure  can  consistently  explain  some of the UV and X-ray
          variability  seen  in  AGN.  The  implications  are  many:  (1)
          Spectroscopic differences in other lensed objects may be due to
          this   ``lens-aided  multi-angle  spectroscopy''  (LAMAS).  (2)
          Outflows  have  fine structure on size scales of arcsec as seen
          from  the  nucleus.  (3)  Assuming either broad absorption line
          region  sizes  proposed  in  recent  wind  models, or typically
          assumed   continuum   emission   region   sizes,  LAMAS  and/or
          variability   provide  broadly  consistent  absorber  sizescale
          estimates  of  about  10^15cm. (4) Very broad smooth absorption
          may  be  ubiquitous  in  quasar  spectra,  even when no obvious
          troughs are seen.

          Title:  Angular momentum transfer in Dark Matter halos: erasing
          the cusp
          Authors: Chiara Tonini, Andrea Lapi, Paolo Salucci
          Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to ApJ
          We  propose  that angular momentum transfer from the baryons to
          the  Dark  Matter  (DM)  during  the  early  stages  of  galaxy
          formation can flatten the halo inner density profile and modify
          the  halo  dynamics.  We  compute  the phase-space distribution
          function  of  DM  halos,  that  corresponds  to the density and
          anisotropy  profiles  obtained  from  N-body simulations in the
          concordance cosmology. We then describe an injection of angular
          momentum  into the halo by modifying the distribution function,
          and  show  that  the  system  evolves  into  a  new equilibrium
          configuration;  the  latter features a constant central density
          and  a  tangentially-dominated  anisotropy profile in the inner
          regions,  while the structure is nearly unchanged beyond 10% of
          the  virial  radius. Then we propose a toy model to account for
          such  a  halo evolution, based on the angular momentum exchange
          due  to  dynamical  friction;  at the epoch of galaxy formation
          this  is  efficiently  exerted  by  the  DM onto the gas clouds
          spiralling  down the potential well. The comparison between the
          angular  momentum  profile gained by the halo through dynamical
          friction  and  that  provided  by  the  perturbed  distribution
          function  reveals  a  surprising  similarity,  hinting  at  the
          reliability of the process.

          Comments: ApJ Letters, accepted
          We  present  measurements of the spatial clustering of galaxies
          with  evolved  stellar masses >10^11Msun, infrared luminosities
          >10^12Lsun,  and  star  formation  rates  >200Msun yr^-1 in two
          redshift  intervals;  1.5<z<2.0 and 2<z<3. Both samples cluster
          moderately   strongly,  with  spatial  correlation  lengths  of
          r0=6.14+/-0.84h^-1    Mpc    for    the   2<z<3   sample,   and
          r0=5.36+/-1.28h^-1   Mpc   for   the  1.5<z<2.0  sample.  These
          clustering  amplitudes  are  consistent  with  both populations
          residing  in  dark  matter  haloes with masses of ~7x10^12Msun,
          which  is  comparable to that seen for optical QSOs at the same
          epochs.  We  infer  that  a minimum dark matter halo mass is an
          important  factor  for all forms of luminous, obscured activity
          in galaxies at z>1, both starbursts and AGN. Adopting plausible
          models  for  the  growth  of  DM haloes with redshift, then the
          haloes  hosting  the 2<z<3 sample will likely host poor to rich
          clusters  of  galaxies  at  z=0, whereas the haloes hosting the
          1.5<z<2.0  sample  will  likely  host  >L*  ellipticals or poor
          clusters  at  z=0.  We  conclude  that  ULIRGs  at z~2.5 likely
          signpost  a  significant  period of stellar buildup in galaxies
          that  will  reside in clusters at z=0, and that ULIRGs at z~1.7
          likely  signpost  stellar  buildup  in sources that will either
          become >L* ellipticals, or reside in poor clusters, at z=0.

          We present a total of 4784 unique broad absorption line quasars
          from  the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  Third  Data Release. An
          automated  algorithm  was  used  to  match  a continuum to each
          quasar  and  to identify regions of flux at least 10% below the
          continuum  over  a  velocity range of at least 1000 km/s in the
          CIV  and  MgII  absorption  regions.  The  model  continuum was
          selected  as  the  best-fit match from a set of template quasar
          spectra   binned   in  luminosity,  emission  line  width,  and
          redshift,  with the power-law spectral index and amount of dust
          reddening  as  additional  free parameters. We characterize our
          sample  through  the  traditional  ``balnicity''  index  and  a
          revised absorption index, as well as through parameters such as
          the  width,  outflow  velocity,  fractional depth and number of
          troughs.  From a sample of 16883 quasars at 1.7 \le z \le 4.38,
          we  identify 4386 (26.0%) quasars with broad CIV absorption, of
          which 1756 (10.4%) satisfy traditional selection criteria. From
          a  sample  of  34973 quasars at 0.5 \le z \le 2.15, we identify
          457  (1.31%) quasars with broad MgII absorption, 191 (0.55%) of
          which satisfy traditional selection criteria. We also provide a
          supplementary  list  of  39  visually identified z>4.38 quasars
          with  broad  CIV absorption. We find that broad absorption line
          quasars  may  have broader emission lines on average than other
          quasars.

          Title: The X-ray nuclei of intermediate-redshift radio sources
          Authors: M. J. Hardcastle, D. A. Evans, J. H. Croston
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS. 12 pages, 5 figures
          We  present  a  Chandra and XMM-Newton spectral analysis of the
          nuclei  of  the  radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars from the
          3CRR  sample  in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.5. In the range
          of  radio luminosity sampled by these objects, mostly FRIIs, it
          has  been  clear  for  some  time  that  a  population of radio
          galaxies   (`low-excitation   radio  galaxies')  cannot  easily
          participate in models that unify narrow-line radio galaxies and
          broad-line objects. We show that low-excitation and narrow-line
          radio  galaxies  have  systematically  different  nuclear X-ray
          properties: while narrow-line radio galaxies universally show a
          heavily  absorbed  nuclear  X-ray  component,  such  a  heavily
          absorbed  component  is  rarely  found  in  sources  classed as
          low-excitation  objects. Combining our data with the results of
          our  earlier  work  on  the  z<0.1 3CRR sources, we discuss the
          implications of this result for unified models, for the origins
          of mid-infrared emission from radio sources, and for the nature
          of  the  apparent  FRI/FRII dichotomy in the X-ray. The lack of
          direct  evidence  for  accretion-related X-ray emission in FRII
          LERGs leads us to argue that there is a strong possibility that
          some,  or most, FRII LERGs accrete in a radiatively inefficient
          mode.  However, our results are also consistent with a model in
          which   the   accretion   mode   is   the  same  for  low-  and
          high-excitation FRIIs, with the lower accretion luminosities in
          FRII   LERGs   attributed   instead  to  more  efficient  radio
          luminosity production in those objects.

          We  report  detections  of  six  high-redshift (1.8 < z < 6.4),
          optically  luminous,  radio-quiet  quasars at 350 micron, using
          the  SHARC  II  bolometer  camera  at the Caltech Submillimeter
          Observatory.    Our   observations   double   the   number   of
          high-redshift  quasars  for  which  350  micron  photometry  is
          available.  By  combining  the  350  micron  measurements  with
          observations at other submillimeter/millimeter wavelengths, for
          each  source we have determined the temperature of the emitting
          dust  (ranging from 40 to 60 K) and the far-infrared luminosity
          (0.6  to  2.2  x  10(13) Lo). The combined mean spectral energy
          distribution  (SED)  of  all  high-redshift quasars with two or
          more  rest  frame far-infrared photometric measurements is best
          fit  with  a  greybody with temperature of 47 +- 3 K and a dust
          emissivity  power-law spectral index of beta = 1.6 +- 0.1. This
          warm  dust component is a good tracer of the starburst activity
          of  the  quasar  host  galaxy. The ratio of the far-infrared to
          radio    luminosities   of   infrared   luminous,   radio-quiet
          high-redshift  quasars  is consistent with that found for local
          star-forming galaxies.

          Title:  Constraints  from  the Old Quasar Apm 08279+5255 on Two
          Classes of $\Lambda($t$)$-Cosmologies
          Authors: J. F. Jesus
          Comments: 7 pages, 2 figures, job presented at the IWARA 2005
          The  viability  of  two  different  classes  of $\Lambda(t)$CDM
          cosmologies  is  tested  by  using  the  APM 08279+5255, an old
          quasar  at  redshift  $z = 3.91$. In the first class of models,
          the  cosmological  term  scales as $\Lambda(t)\sim R^{-n}$. The
          particular case $n=0$ describes the standard $\Lambda$CDM model
          whereas  $n=2$  stands  for  the  Chen  and  Wu  model.  For an
          estimated  age of 2 Gyr, it is found that the power has a lower
          limit  $n  >  0.21$,  whereas for 3 Gyr the limit is $n > 0.6$.
          Since  $n$ can not be so large as $\sim 0.81$, the $\Lambda$CDM
          and Chen and Wu models are also ruled out by this analysis. The
          second class of models is the one recently proposed by Wang and
          Meng   which   describes  several  $\Lambda(t)$CDM  cosmologies
          discussed in the literature. By assuming that the true age is 2
          Gyr  it  is  found  that the $\epsilon$ parameter satisfies the
          lower  bound  $\epsilon > 0.11$, while for 3 Gyr, a lower limit
          of  $\epsilon  >  0.52$  is  obtained. Such limits are slightly
          modified when the baryonic component is included.

          The  study  of  cosmic  reionization  has  acquired  increasing
          significance  over  the  last  few  years  because  of  various
          reasons.  On  the observational front, we now have good quality

          spectra, radiation backgrounds at different frequencies, cosmic
          microwave  background  polarization,  Ly-alpha  emitters and so
          on).  Theoretically, the importance of the reionization lies in
          its   close   coupling  with  the  formation  of  first  cosmic
          structures,   and   there  have  been  numerous  progresses  in
          modelling  the  process. In this article, we review the current
          status of our understanding of the physical processes governing
          the cosmic reionization based on available observational data.

          Selected  results  obtained  in major observational sky surveys
          (DSS,  2MASS,  2dF,  SDSS)  and  deep  field observations (HDF,
          GOODS,   HUDF,  etc.)  are  reviewed.  Modern  surveys  provide
          information  on  the  characteristics and space distribution of
          millions  of  galaxies. Deep fields allow one to study galaxies
          at  the  stage  of  formation and to trace their evolution over
          billions of years. The wealth of observational data is altering
          the  face  of modern astronomy: the formulation of problems and
          their  solutions  are  changing and all the previous knowledge,
          from  planetary studies in the solar system to the most distant
          galaxies and quasars, is being revised.

          Title:  On  the limit cycle instability in magnetized accretion
          discs
          Authors: A. Merloni (MPA), S. Nayakshin (Univ. of Leicester)
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures. MNRAS, submitted
          Observational   evidence   accumulated  over  the  past  decade
          indicates  that accretion discs in X-ray binaries are viscously
          stable  unless  they accrete very close to the Eddington limit.
          This  is  at  odds  with the most basic standard accretion disc
          theory, but could be explained by either having the discs to be
          much  cooler whereby they are not radiation pressure dominated,
          or  by  a  more sophisticated viscosity law. Here we argue that
          the  latter  is  taking  place  in  practice, on the basis of a
          stability analysis that assumes that the
          magneto-rotational-instability (MRI) responsible for generating
          the  turbulent stresses inside the discs is also the source for
          a  magnetically  dominated corona. We show that observations of
          stable discs in the high/soft states of black hole binaries, on
          the  one  hand,  and  of  the strongly variable microquasar GRS
          1915+105  on  the  other,  can all be explained if the magnetic
          turbulent  stresses inside the disc scale proportionally to the
          geometric  mean  of  gas  and total pressure with a constant of
          proportionality  (viscosity  parameter) having a value of a few
          times  10^{-2}.  Implications  for  bright AGN are also briefly
          discussed.

          Title: Six Peaks Visible in the Redshift Distribution of 46,400
          SDSS  Quasars  Agree  with the Preferred Redshifts Predicted by
          the Decreasing Intrinsic Redshift Model
          Authors: M.B. Bell, D. McDiarmid

          The  redshift  distribution  of all 46,400 quasars in the Sloan
          Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS)  Quasar  Catalog  III,  Third Data
          Release,  is  examined. Six Peaks that fall within the redshift
          window below z = 4, are visible. Their positions agree with the
          preferred redshift values predicted by the decreasing intrinsic
          redshift  (DIR) model, even though this model was derived using
          completely  independent  evidence. A power spectrum analysis of
          the full dataset confirms the presence of a single, significant
          power  peak  at  the expected redshift period. Power peaks with
          the predicted period are also obtained when the upper and lower
          halves  of  the  redshift distribution are examined separately.
          The  periodicity  detected  is  in  linear  z,  as  opposed  to
          log(1+z).  Because  the  peaks  in  the  SDSS  quasar  redshift
          distribution  agree well with the preferred redshifts predicted
          by  the  intrinsic  redshift  relation,  we  conclude that this
          relation,  and  the  peaks in the redshift distribution, likely
          both have the same origin, and this may be intrinsic redshifts,
          or  a  common selection effect. However, because of the way the
          intrinsic  redshift  relation  was determined it seems unlikely
          that one selection effect could have been responsible for both.

          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          A   proof   of   the   relativistic  $H$-theorem  by  including
          nonextensive   effects   is   given.   As  it  happens  in  the
          nonrelativistic  limit, the molecular chaos hypothesis advanced
          by  Boltzmann  does  not  remain  valid,  and the second law of
          thermodynamics  combined  with a duality transformation implies
          that  the  q-parameter  lies  on the interval [0,2]. It is also
          proved  that  the  collisional equilibrium states (null entropy
          source  term)  are  described by the relativistic $q$-power law
          extension   of   the  exponential  Juttner  distribution  which
          reduces,  in  the  nonrelativistic domain, to the Tsallis power
          law  function.  As a simple illustration of the basic approach,
          we    derive    the   relativistic   nonextensive   equilibrium
          distribution  for  a  dilute charged gas under the action of an
          electromagnetic  field  $F^{{\mu\nu}}$.  Such results reduce to
          the  standard ones in the extensive limit, thereby showing that
          the  nonextensive entropic framework can be harmonized with the
          space-time ideas contained in the special relativity theory.

          We  study the statistics of the force felt by a particle in the
          class   of   spatially  correlated  distribution  of  identical
          point-like  particles,  interacting  via  a  $1/r^2$ pair force
          (i.e.  gravitational  or  Coulomb),  and  obtained  by randomly
          perturbing  an  infinite  perfect lattice. In the first part we
          specify the conditions under which the force on a particle is a
          well  defined  stochastic  quantity.  We  then  study the small
          displacements approximation, giving both the limitations of its
          validity,  and,  when  it is valid, an expression for the force
          variance.  In  the  second  part of the paper we extend to this
          class  of  particle  distributions  the  method  introduced  by
          Chandrasekhar  to  study the force probability density function
          in  the  homogeneous Poisson particle distribution. In this way
          we  can  derive  an  approximate expression for the probability
          distribution  of the force over the full range of perturbations
          of  the lattice, i.e., from very small (compared to the lattice
          spacing) to very large where the Poisson limit is recovered. We
          show  in  particular  the qualitative change in the large-force
          tail  of  the  force  distribution  between  these  two limits.
          Excellent accuracy of our analytic results is found on detailed
          comparison  with  results  from  numerical  simulations.  These
          results   provide   basic  statistical  information  about  the
          fluctuations   of   the  interactions  (i)  of  the  masses  in
          self-gravitating  systems like those encountered in the context
          of  cosmological N-body simulations, and (ii) of the charges in
          the ordered phase of the One Component Plasma.

          We  study  the mean environment of galaxies in the DEEP2 Galaxy
          Redshift  Survey as a function of rest-frame color, luminosity,
          and  [OII]  equivalent  width. The local galaxy overdensity for
          >14,000  galaxies  at  0.75  <  z < 1.35 is estimated using the
          projected  3rd-nearest-neighbor  surface density. Of the galaxy
          properties  studied,  mean  environment is found to depend most
          strongly on galaxy color; all major features of the correlation
          between  mean  overdensity and rest-frame color observed in the
          local  universe  were already in place at z ~ 1. In contrast to
          local  results,  we  find  a  substantial  slope  in  the  mean
          dependence  of environment on luminosity for blue, star-forming
          galaxies  at  z ~ 1, with brighter blue galaxies being found on
          average in regions of greater overdensity. We discuss the roles
          of  galaxy  clusters  and  groups  in establishing the observed
          correlations  between environment and galaxy properties at high
          redshift,  and  we also explore the evidence for a ``downsizing
          of  quenching''  from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. Our results add weight to
          existing   evidence   that  the  mechanism(s)  that  result  in
          star-formation quenching are efficient in group environments as
          well  as  clusters.  This work is the first of its kind at high
          redshift  and  represents  the  first  in  a  series  of papers
          addressing the role of environment in galaxy formation at 0 < z

          Title:  Fueling  Low-Level  AGN Activity Through the Stochastic
          Accretion of Cold Gas
          Authors: Philip F. Hopkins, Lars Hernquist (Harvard/CfA)
          Comments: 37 pages, 9 figures. Submitted to ApJS
          Using  a  simple  description  of feedback from black hole (BH)
          growth,  we  develop  an  analytic  model  for  the  fueling of
          Seyferts  (low-luminosity AGN) and their relation to their host
          galaxies,   Eddington  ratio  distributions,  and  cosmological
          evolution.  We  derive  a  solution  for evolution of accretion
          rates   in   a   feedback-driven   blast  wave,  applicable  to
          large-scale  outflows  from  bright  quasars in galaxy mergers,
          low-luminosity  AGN,  and  BHs in supernova remnants. Under the
          assumption that cold gas stochastically accretes onto a central
          SMBH  at  a  rate set by the dynamics of that gas, our solution
          determines  the  Seyfert  light curve evolution. We use this to
          predict  the  Seyfert  luminosity  function  (LF), duty cycles,
          lifetimes,  and  distribution  of  host morphologies, Eddington
          ratios,  and  obscuration  as  a function of AGN luminosity and
          mass,  and find agreement with observations at z=0. We consider
          the  breakdown  of  contributions  from  this  and stellar wind
          accretion   and   merger-driven   activity.  We  make  specific
          predictions  for  the  weak  evolution  of  the Seyfert LF with
          redshift (LF of non-merger driven activity), and for changes in
          both  the  slope  and  scatter  of  the  M_BH-sigma relation at
          low-M_BH.  Quiescent  fueling  dominates over a wide luminosity
          range  (-14  >  M_B  > -22) at z=0, where most BH growth occurs
          around  M_BH~10^7  M_sun,  in  S0  and  Sa/b galaxies. However,
          quasar activity from gas-rich mergers evolves more rapidly with
          redshift,  and  by  z=1  quiescent fueling is important only at
          luminosities  an order of magnitude or more below the LF break.
          Although  non-merger  driven fueling is important for BH growth
          and   the   M_BH-sigma  relation  at  low  M_BH,  it  does  not
          significantly  contribute  to  the  total  BH  mass  density or
          cosmological backgrounds.

          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          We  have  investigated  the  proof  of the $H$ theorem within a
          manifestly  covariant  approach by considering the relativistic
          statistical  theory developed in [Phy. Rev. E {\bf 66}, 056125,
          2002;  {\it  ibid.}  {\bf  72},  036108 2005]. In our analysis,
          however,   we   have  not  considered  the  so-called  deformed
          mathematics as did in the above reference. As it happens in the
          nonrelativistic   limit,  the  molecular  chaos  hypothesis  is
          slightly extended within the $\kappa$-formalism, and the second
          law  of thermodynamics implies that the $\kappa$ parameter lies
          on  the  interval  [-1,1].  It  is  shown  that the collisional
          equilibrium  states (null entropy source term) are described by
          a  $\kappa$ power law generalization of the exponential Juttner
          distribution,        e.g.,       $f(x,p)\propto       (\sqrt{1+
          \kappa^2\theta^2}+\kappa\theta)^{1/\kappa}\equiv\exp_\kappa\the
          ta$, with $\theta=\alpha(x)+\beta_\mu p^\mu$, where $\alpha(x)$
          is  a  scalar, $\beta_\mu$ is a four-vector, and $p^\mu$ is the
          four-momentum.   As   a   simple   example,  we  calculate  the
          relativistic  $\kappa$ power law for a dilute charged gas under
          the  action  of  an  electromagnetic  field  $F^{\mu\nu}$.  All
          standard  results  are readly recovered in the particular limit
          $\kappa\to 0$.

          We  present  comparison  of X-ray proxies for the total cluster
          mass,   including  the  spectral  temperature  (Tx),  gas  mass
          measured  within  r500  (Mg), and the new proxy, Yx, which is a
          simple product of Tx and Mg and is related to the total thermal
          energy of the ICM. We use mock Chandra images constructed for a
          sample    of    clusters    simulated    with    the   eulerian
          N-body+gasdynamics  adaptive  mesh  refinement  ART code in the
          concordance   LCDM  cosmology.  The  simulations  achieve  high
          spatial and mass resolution and include radiative cooling, star
          formation,  and  other processes accompanying galaxy formation.
          Our  analysis  shows  that  simulated  clusters  exhibit a high
          degree   of  regularity  and  tight  correlations  between  the
          considered  observables  and  total mass. The normalizations of
          the M-Tx, Mg-Tx, and M-Yx relations agree to better than 10-15%
          with the current observational measurements of these relations.
          Our  results  show  that  Yx  is  the  best  mass  proxy with a
          remarkably low scatter of only ~5-7% in M500 for a fixed Yx, at
          both  low and high redshifts and regardless of whether clusters
          are  relaxed  or  not.  In  addition,  we  show  that  redshift
          evolution  of the Yx-M500 relation is close to the self-similar
          prediction, which makes Yx a very attractive mass indicator for
          measurements  of  the cluster mass function from X-ray selected
          samples.

          Matter and Dark Energy", proceedings of the Third Aegean Summer
          School, Chios, 26 September-1 October, 2005
          The  challenge  of dark matter may be addressed in two ways; by
          studying   the   confrontation   of  structure  formation  with
          observation  and  by  direct  and  indirect  searches.  In this
          review,  I  will focus on those aspects of dark matter that are
          relevant  for  understanding galaxy formation, and describe the
          outlook  for detecting the most elusive component, non-baryonic
          dark matter. Galaxy formation theory is driven by phenomenology
          and  by  numerical  simulations of dark matter clustering under
          gravity.   Once   the   complications  of  star  formation  are
          incorporated,  the  theory  becomes  so  complex that the brute
          force   approach   of   numerical   simulations   needs  to  be
          supplemented  by  incorporation of such astrophysical processes
          as  feedback  by  supernovae  and  by active galactic nuclei. I
          present  a  few semi-analytical perspectives that may shed some
          insight into the nature of galaxy formation.

          Title:  Orientation  dependency of broad-line widths in quasars
          and consequences for black-hole mass estimation
          Authors:  Matt  J.  Jarvis (1), Ross J. McLure (2) ((1) Oxford,
          (2) Edinburgh)
          Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          In  this  paper we report new evidence that measurements of the
          broad-line  widths  in  quasars  are  dependent  on  the source
          orientation,  consistent  with  the  idea  that  the broad-line
          region  is  flattened  or  disc-like.  This reinforces the view
          derived  from  radio-selected  samples,  where  the  radio-core
          dominance  has  been  used  as  a  measure  of orientation. The
          results  presented  here  show  a  highly significant (>99.95%)
          correlation  between  radio  spectral  index (which we use as a
          proxy for source orientation) and broad-line width derived from
          the H-beta and MgII emission lines. This is the first time that
          this  type  of  study  has  used  quasars  derived from a large
          optically  selected quasar sample, where the radio-loud quasars
          (RLQs)  and  radio-quiet  quasars (RQQs) have indistinguishable
          distributions  in  redshift,  bolometric luminosity and colour,
          and therefore overcomes any biases which may be present in only
          selecting  via  radio  emission. We find that the mean FWHM for
          the  flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars (FSQs) to be <FWHM(FSQ)>=
          4990  +/- 536km/s, which differs significant from the mean FWHM
          of   the   steep-spectrum   radio-loud  quasars  (SSQs),  where
          <FWHM(SSQ)>=6464   +/-   506km/s.   We   also   find  that  the
          distribution  in  FWHM  for  the FSQs is indistinguishable from
          that of the radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), where <FWHM(RQQ)>= 4831
          +/-25km/s.  Considering  other  observational  results  in  the
          literature  we  interpret  this  result  in  the  context  of a
          significant  fraction  of  the  FSQs  being  derived  from  the
          underlying  RQQ  population which have their radio flux Doppler
          boosted  above  the  RLQ/RQQ  divide. Under the assumption of a
          disc-like   broad-line   region  we  find  no  evidence  for  a
          difference  in  the  average  line-of-sight  angle for RQQs and
          RLQs,  implying  that the difference is due to black-hole mass.

          We  present  results from a new method of exploring the distant
          Universe.   We   use   3-D   spectroscopy  to  sample  a  large
          cosmological volume at a time when the Universe was less than 3
          billion   years   old   to   investigate   the   evolution   of
          star-formation activity. Within this study we also discovered a
          high   redshift  type-II  quasar  which  would  not  have  been
          identified  with  imaging  studies  alone.  This highlights the
          crucial  role  that  integral-field  spectroscopy  may  play in
          surveying the distant Universe in the future.

          Title: The Relic Neutrino Backround from the First Stars
          Authors: Keith A. Olive, Pearl Sandick
          Comments:  19  pages,  15 figures, Summary of talk given at the
          IIIrd  International  Workshop on: NO-VE "Neutrino Oscillations
          in Venice", Venice Italy, February 2006
          We   consider   the   relic  neutrino  background  produced  by
          Population  III  stars  coupled  with  a  normal  mode  of star
          formation  at  lower  redshift. The computation is performed in
          the  framework of hierarchical structure formation and is based
          on cosmic star formation histories constrained to reproduce the
          observed  star formation rate at redshift z \la 6, the observed
          chemical  abundances in damped Lyman alpha absorbers and in the
          intergalactic medium, and to allow for an early reionization of
          the  Universe  at  z  ~  10-20.  We  consider  both a burst and
          non-burst model for Population III star formation. We find that
          although  the  high redshift burst of Population III stars does
          lead  to  an  appreciable  flux  of neutrinos at relatively low
          energy  (E_\nu  \approx 1 MeV), the observable neutrino flux is
          dominated  by  the  normal mode of star formation. We also find
          that  predicted  fluxes  are at the present level of the SuperK
          limit.   As   a   consequence,  the  supernova  relic  neutrino
          background  has a direct impact on models of chemical evolution
          and/or supernova dynamics.

          Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          One  of  the possible methods to distinguish among various dark
          matter  candidates  is  to  study  the  effects  of dark matter
          decays.  We  consider  four  different  dark  matter candidates
          (light   dark   matter,  gravitinos,  neutralinos  and  sterile
          neutrinos), for each of them deriving the decaying/annihilation
          rate, the influence on reionization, matter temperature and CMB
          spectra.  We  find  that light dark matter particles (1-10 MeV)
          and sterile neutrinos (2-7 keV) can be sources of partial early
          reionization  (z<~100).  However, their integrated contribution
          to  Thomson  optical depth is small (<~0.01). Finally, they can
          significantly affect the behavior of matter temperature. On the
          contrary,  effects  of heavy dark matter candidates (gravitinos
          and  neutralinos)  on reionization and heating are minimal. All
          the considered dark matter particles have completely negligible
          effects on the CMB spectra.

          Comments: ApJ submitted. 23 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables
          In  the  present-day  universe,  supermassive black hole masses
          (MBH)  appear  to  be  strongly  correlated with their galaxy's
          bulge  luminosity,  among  other  properties. In this study, we
          explore  the  analogous relationship between MBH, derived using
          the virial method, and the stellar R-band bulge luminosity (Lr)
          or  stellar  bulge  mass  (M*) at epochs of 1 < z < 4.5 using a
          sample  of  31  gravitationally  lensed  AGNs and 20 non-lensed
          AGNs.  At redshifts z > 1.7 (10--12 Gyrs ago), we find that the
          observed  MBH--Lr  relation  is nearly the same (to within ~0.3
          mag)  as  it  is  today. When the observed Lr are corrected for
          luminosity  evolution,  this means that the black holes grew in
          mass  faster than their hosts, with the MBH/M* mass ratio being
          a  factor  of  >  4(+2)(-1)  times larger at z > 1.7 than it is
          today.  By the redshift range 1 < z < 1.7 (8--10 Gyrs ago), the
          MBH/M*  ratio is only 1.3--2 times higher than today. Combining
          the  results,  we  conclude  that  the  ratio MBH/M* rises with
          look-back  time, although it may saturate at ~6 times the local
          value.  Scenarios  in which moderately luminous quasar hosts at
          z>1.7  were  fully  formed  bulges  that passively faded to the
          present epoch are ruled out.

          Comments: submitted to ApJ; 9 pages, 6 figures, uses emulateapj
          We  present  comparison  of X-ray proxies for the total cluster
          mass,   including  the  spectral  temperature  (Tx),  gas  mass
          measured  within  r500  (Mg), and the new proxy, Yx, which is a
          simple product of Tx and Mg and is related to the total thermal
          energy of the ICM. We use mock Chandra images constructed for a
          sample    of    clusters    simulated    with    the   eulerian
          N-body+gasdynamics  adaptive  mesh  refinement  ART code in the
          concordance   LCDM  cosmology.  The  simulations  achieve  high
          spatial and mass resolution and include radiative cooling, star
          formation,  and  other processes accompanying galaxy formation.
          Our  analysis  shows  that  simulated  clusters  exhibit a high
          degree   of  regularity  and  tight  correlations  between  the
          considered  observables  and  total mass. The normalizations of
          the M-Tx, Mg-Tx, and M-Yx relations agree to better than 10-15%
          with the current observational measurements of these relations.
          Our  results  show  that  Yx  is  the  best  mass  proxy with a
          remarkably low scatter of only ~5-7% in M500 for a fixed Yx, at
          both  low and high redshifts and regardless of whether clusters
          are  relaxed  or  not.  In  addition,  we  show  that  redshift
          evolution  of the Yx-M500 relation is close to the self-similar
          prediction, which makes Yx a very attractive mass indicator for
          measurements  of  the cluster mass function from X-ray selected
          samples.

          Title: Galaxy Formation and Dark Matter
          Authors: Joseph Silk

          Matter and Dark Energy", proceedings of the Third Aegean Summer
          School, Chios, 26 September-1 October, 2005
          The  challenge  of dark matter may be addressed in two ways; by
          studying   the   confrontation   of  structure  formation  with
          observation  and  by  direct  and  indirect  searches.  In this
          review,  I  will focus on those aspects of dark matter that are
          relevant  for  understanding galaxy formation, and describe the
          outlook  for detecting the most elusive component, non-baryonic
          dark matter. Galaxy formation theory is driven by phenomenology
          and  by  numerical  simulations of dark matter clustering under
          gravity.   Once   the   complications  of  star  formation  are
          incorporated,  the  theory  becomes  so  complex that the brute
          force   approach   of   numerical   simulations   needs  to  be
          supplemented  by  incorporation of such astrophysical processes
          as  feedback  by  supernovae  and  by active galactic nuclei. I
          present  a  few semi-analytical perspectives that may shed some
          insight into the nature of galaxy formation.

          Title:  Orientation  dependency of broad-line widths in quasars
          and consequences for black-hole mass estimation
          Authors:  Matt  J.  Jarvis (1), Ross J. McLure (2) ((1) Oxford,
          (2) Edinburgh)
          Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          In  this  paper we report new evidence that measurements of the
          broad-line  widths  in  quasars  are  dependent  on  the source
          orientation,  consistent  with  the  idea  that  the broad-line
          region  is  flattened  or  disc-like.  This reinforces the view
          derived  from  radio-selected  samples,  where  the  radio-core
          dominance  has  been  used  as  a  measure  of orientation. The
          results  presented  here  show  a  highly significant (>99.95%)
          correlation  between  radio  spectral  index (which we use as a
          proxy for source orientation) and broad-line width derived from
          the H-beta and MgII emission lines. This is the first time that
          this  type  of  study  has  used  quasars  derived from a large
          optically  selected quasar sample, where the radio-loud quasars
          (RLQs)  and  radio-quiet  quasars (RQQs) have indistinguishable
          distributions  in  redshift,  bolometric luminosity and colour,
          and therefore overcomes any biases which may be present in only
          selecting  via  radio  emission. We find that the mean FWHM for
          the  flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars (FSQs) to be <FWHM(FSQ)>=
          4990  +/- 536km/s, which differs significant from the mean FWHM
          of   the   steep-spectrum   radio-loud  quasars  (SSQs),  where
          <FWHM(SSQ)>=6464   +/-   506km/s.   We   also   find  that  the
          distribution  in  FWHM  for  the FSQs is indistinguishable from
          that of the radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), where <FWHM(RQQ)>= 4831
          +/-25km/s.  Considering  other  observational  results  in  the
          literature  we  interpret  this  result  in  the  context  of a
          significant  fraction  of  the  FSQs  being  derived  from  the
          underlying  RQQ  population which have their radio flux Doppler
          boosted  above  the  RLQ/RQQ  divide. Under the assumption of a
          disc-like   broad-line   region  we  find  no  evidence  for  a
          difference  in  the  average  line-of-sight  angle for RQQs and
          RLQs,  implying  that the difference is due to black-hole mass.

          IIIrd  International  Workshop on: NO-VE "Neutrino Oscillations
          in Venice", Venice Italy, February 2006
          We   consider   the   relic  neutrino  background  produced  by
          Population  III  stars  coupled  with  a  normal  mode  of star
          formation  at  lower  redshift. The computation is performed in
          the  framework of hierarchical structure formation and is based
          on cosmic star formation histories constrained to reproduce the
          observed  star formation rate at redshift z \la 6, the observed
          chemical  abundances in damped Lyman alpha absorbers and in the
          intergalactic medium, and to allow for an early reionization of
          the  Universe  at  z  ~  10-20.  We  consider  both a burst and
          non-burst model for Population III star formation. We find that
          although  the  high redshift burst of Population III stars does
          lead  to  an  appreciable  flux  of neutrinos at relatively low
          energy  (E_\nu  \approx 1 MeV), the observable neutrino flux is
          dominated  by  the  normal mode of star formation. We also find
          that  predicted  fluxes  are at the present level of the SuperK
          limit.   As   a   consequence,  the  supernova  relic  neutrino
          background  has a direct impact on models of chemical evolution
          and/or supernova dynamics.

          Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          One  of  the possible methods to distinguish among various dark
          matter  candidates  is  to  study  the  effects  of dark matter
          decays.  We  consider  four  different  dark  matter candidates
          (light   dark   matter,  gravitinos,  neutralinos  and  sterile
          neutrinos), for each of them deriving the decaying/annihilation
          rate, the influence on reionization, matter temperature and CMB
          spectra.  We  find  that light dark matter particles (1-10 MeV)
          and sterile neutrinos (2-7 keV) can be sources of partial early
          reionization  (z<~100).  However, their integrated contribution
          to  Thomson  optical depth is small (<~0.01). Finally, they can
          significantly affect the behavior of matter temperature. On the
          contrary,  effects  of heavy dark matter candidates (gravitinos
          and  neutralinos)  on reionization and heating are minimal. All
          the considered dark matter particles have completely negligible
          effects on the CMB spectra.

          Comments: ApJ submitted. 23 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables
          In  the  present-day  universe,  supermassive black hole masses
          (MBH)  appear  to  be  strongly  correlated with their galaxy's
          bulge  luminosity,  among  other  properties. In this study, we
          explore  the  analogous relationship between MBH, derived using
          the virial method, and the stellar R-band bulge luminosity (Lr)
          or  stellar  bulge  mass  (M*) at epochs of 1 < z < 4.5 using a
          sample  of  31  gravitationally  lensed  AGNs and 20 non-lensed
          AGNs.  At redshifts z > 1.7 (10--12 Gyrs ago), we find that the
          observed  MBH--Lr  relation  is nearly the same (to within ~0.3
          mag)  as  it  is  today. When the observed Lr are corrected for
          luminosity  evolution,  this means that the black holes grew in
          mass  faster than their hosts, with the MBH/M* mass ratio being
          a  factor  of  >  4(+2)(-1)  times larger at z > 1.7 than it is
          today.  By the redshift range 1 < z < 1.7 (8--10 Gyrs ago), the
          MBH/M*  ratio is only 1.3--2 times higher than today. Combining
          the  results,  we  conclude  that  the  ratio MBH/M* rises with
          look-back  time, although it may saturate at ~6 times the local
          value.  Scenarios  in which moderately luminous quasar hosts at
          z>1.7  were  fully  formed  bulges  that passively faded to the
          present epoch are ruled out.

          Recently, Zheng et al. (2005) found evidence for an overdensity
          of  galaxies  around  a  radio-loud quasar, SDSS J0836+0054, at

          the  Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. The NB816 narrow-band

          suitable  for  searching  for  Ly$\alpha$ emitters at $z\approx
          5.7$.  We  have  found  a  new  strong Ly$\alpha$ emitter at $z
          \approx  5.7$  close  to  object  B  identified by Zheng et al.
          Further,  the  non  detection  of  the nine objects selected by
          Zheng  et  al.  (2005)  in  our  B,  V,  and r' images provides
          supporting evidence that they are high-z objects.

          We present initial results from a Magellan telescope program to
          image  galaxies that give rise to damped Lyman absorbers (DLAs)
          at  1.63  <  z_DLA  <  2.37.  Our program differs from previous
          efforts  in that we target quasars with intervening Lyman limit
          systems  (LLS) along the line of sight at redshift z_LLS > 3.5.
          The  higher-redshift  LLS  is  applied  as a blocking filter to
          remove  the  glare  of  the background quasar at the rest-frame
          ultraviolet  wavelengths of the foreground galaxy. The complete
          absence  of  quasar  light  offers  an unimpeded view along the
          sightline  to  the  redshift of the LLS, allowing an exhaustive
          search  for  the  DLA  galaxy  to  the sensitivity limit of the
          imaging  data  (at or better than 0.25L*). In both of our pilot
          fields    (PKS2000-330,    z_DLA=2.033    and    SDSS0322-0558,
          z_DLA=1.69),  we  identify  an  L*  galaxy  within  5"  of  the
          sightline which has optical colors consistent with star-forming
          galaxies   at   z~2.   We   examine   the  correlation  between
          absorption-line  properties  and  galaxy  luminosity and impact
          distance,  and  compare  the  high-redshift galaxy and absorber
          pairs with those known at z<1.

          quasar   luminosity   function   tell  us  about  super-massive
          black-hole evolution?
          Authors: Stuart Wyithe, T. Padmanabhan
          Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          In  the local universe, the masses of Super-Massive Black-Holes
          (SMBH)  appear  to  correlate  with  the physical properties of
          their  hosts, including the mass of the dark-matter halo. Using
          these  clues  as  a  starting  point many studies have produced
          models  that  can  explain phenomena like the quasar luminosity
          function.  The  shortcoming  of  this  approach is that working
          models  are  not unique, and as a result it is not always clear
          what  input  physics  is  being  constrained.  Here  we  take a
          different   approach.  We  identify  critical  parameters  that
          describe the evolution of SMBHs at high redshift, and constrain
          their  parameter  space  based on observations of high redshift
          quasars  from  the  Sloan  Digital Sky Survey. We find that the
          luminosity  function  taken in isolation is somewhat limited in
          its  ability  to  constrain  SMBH  evolution due to some strong
          degeneracies. This explains the presence in the literature of a
          range  of equally successful models based on different physical
          hypotheses.  Including the constraint of the local SMBH to halo
          mass  ratio  breaks  some  of the degeneracies, and our results
          suggest  halo  masses  at z~4.8 of 10^{12.5+/-0.3}M_solar (with
          90%  confidence), with a SMBH to halo mass ratio that decreases
          with time (>99%). We also find a quasar luminosity to halo mass
          ratio that increases with halo mass (>99%). These features need
          to  be incorporated in all successful models of SMBH evolution.
          On  the  other  hand  current  observations  do  not permit any
          conclusions  regarding the evolution of quasar lifetime, or the
          SMBH occupation fraction in dark matter halos.

          Dust  plays crucial roles in galaxy formation and evolution. In
          the  early  epoch  of galaxy evolution dust is only supplied by
          supernovae  (SNe). With the aid of a new physical model of dust
          production by SNe, we constructed a model of dust emission from
          forming  galaxies. We show the evolution of the spectral energy
          distribution  (SED).  Then  we  adopt  this  model  to  a local
          starbursting  dwarf  galaxy  SBS 0335$-$052. Further we discuss
          the   SEDs  of  high  redshift  galaxies,  and  consider  their
          observational feasibility.

          This  work  focuses  on  the properties of dusty tori in active
          galactic  nuclei (AGN) derived from the comparison of SDSS type
          1  quasars  with  mid-Infrared  (MIR)  counterparts  and a new,
          detailed  torus  model.  The  infrared  data  were taken by the
          Spitzer  Wide-area InfraRed Extragalactic (SWIRE) Survey. Basic
          model parameters are constraint, such as the density law of the
          graphite  and  silicate  grains, the torus size and its opening
          angle.  A  whole  variety  of  optical depths is supported. The
          favoured models are those with decreasing density with distance
          from  the  centre,  while  there is no clear tendency as to the
          covering  factor,  ie  small, medium and large covering factors
          are almost equally distributed. Based on the models that better
          describe  the  observed  SEDs, properties such as the accretion
          luminosity,  the  mass of dust, the inner to outer radius ratio
          and the hydrogen column density are computed.

          The  first dwarf galaxies, which constitute the building blocks
          of  the  collapsed  objects  we find today in the Universe, had
          formed  hundreds  of millions of years after the big bang. This
          pedagogical   review   describes  the  early  growth  of  their
          small-amplitude  seed  fluctuations from the epoch of inflation
          through  dark  matter decoupling and matter-radiation equality,
          to  the  final collapse and fragmentation of the dark matter on
          all  mass scales above \~10^{-4} solar masses. The condensation
          of  baryons into halos in the mass range of ~10^5-10^{10} solar
          masses  led  to  the  formation  of  the  first  stars  and the
          re-ionization  of the cold hydrogen gas, left over from the big
          bang.  The  production  of  heavy  elements  by the first stars
          started the metal enrichment process that eventually led to the
          formation  of  rocky  planets  and  life.  A  wide  variety  of
          instruments  currently  under  design [including large-aperture
          infrared  telescopes  on  the  ground  or  in space (JWST), and
          low-frequency  arrays  for  the  detection  of  redshifted 21cm
          radiation],  will  establish  better understanding of the first
          sources  of  light  during  an epoch in cosmic history that was
          largely   unexplored   so   far.   Numerical   simulations   of
          reionization  are  computationally challenging, as they require
          radiative transfer across large cosmological volumes as well as
          sufficently  high  resolution  to  identify  the sources of the
          ionizing    radiation.   The   technological   challenges   for
          observations  and  the  computational  challenges for numerical
          simulations,  will motivate intense work in this field over the
          coming decade.

          Title:  The  unprecedented  optical  outburst  of the quasar 3C
          454.3. The WEBT campaign of 2004-2005
          Authors: M. Villata, C. M. Raiteri, T. J. Balonek, for the WEBT
          Collaboration
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, to be published in A&A
          The  radio  quasar  3C  454.3  underwent an exceptional optical
          outburst  lasting  more  than  1 year and culminating in spring
          2005.  The  maximum  brightness  detected  was  R = 12.0, which
          represents  the  most  luminous  quasar state thus far observed
          (M_B ~ -31.4). In order to follow the emission behaviour of the
          source   in   detail,  a  large  multiwavelength  campaign  was
          organized   by   the   Whole  Earth  Blazar  Telescope  (WEBT).
          Continuous  optical, near-IR and radio monitoring was performed
          in  several  bands.  ToO  pointings by the Chandra and INTEGRAL
          satellites  provided additional information at high energies in
          May  2005.  The  historical radio and optical light curves show
          different   behaviours.   Until   about  2001.0  only  moderate
          variability  was present in the optical regime, while prominent
          and  long-lasting  radio  outbursts were visible at the various
          radio  frequencies,  with higher-frequency variations preceding
          the lower-frequency ones. After that date, the optical activity
          increased  and  the  radio flux is less variable. This suggests
          that the optical and radio emissions come from two separate and
          misaligned  jet regions, with the inner optical one acquiring a
          smaller  viewing angle during the 2004-2005 outburst. Moreover,
          the  colour-index  behaviour  (generally  redder-when-brighter)
          during  the  outburst  suggests  the  presence  of  a  luminous
          accretion  disc.  A  huge mm outburst followed the optical one,
          peaking in June-July 2005. The high-frequency (37-43 GHz) radio
          flux started to increase in early 2005 and reached a maximum at
          the  end  of our observing period (end of September 2005). VLBA

          (abridged) The review describes observations of SS433. The main
          difference  between  SS433  and  other  X-ray  binaries  is the
          supercritical   regime   for   the   gas   accretion  onto  the
          relativistic star (most likely a black hole), which has lead to
          the  formation  of collimated relativistic jets. The properties
          of  the  jets are determined by their interaction with the disk
          wind.  The  precession  of  the  disk  and jets, as well as the
          eclipsing  in the binary system, make SS433 a unique laboratory
          for  studies  of  mechanisms  for  the  microquasar phenomenon.
          Essentially  all  photometric  and  spectroscopic properties of
          SS433 are determined by the accretion disk and its orientation,
          but  the disk itself is not observed, being located beneath the
          photosphere  of the dense wind. Observational manifestations of
          the  wind  and of gas flows in the system are described. Little
          is  known  about the structure of the central regions where the
          hot bases of the jets are located. The available X-ray, UV, and
          optical  observations point towards the picture where the bases
          of  the  jets  are surrounded by cocoons of hot gas reradiating
          emission  from  the  inner  regions  of the jet channel. Direct
          investigations  of  this channel in the supercritical accretion
          disk  of  SS433  are  not  possible;  however, a similar object
          oriented  face-on  would  likely  be  an extremely bright X-ray
          source,  such as ultra-luminous X-ray sources observed in other
          galaxies.

          We   report   the   serendipitous   discovery   of  two  strong
          gravitational   lens   candidates  (ACS  J160919+6532  and  ACS
          J160910+6532)  in deep images obtained with the Advanced Camera
          for  Surveys  on  the Hubble Space Telescope, each less than 40
          arcsec  from  the  previously  known  gravitational lens system
          CLASS  B1608+656. The redshifts of both lens galaxies have been
          measured  with  Keck  and  Gemini:  one  is a member of a small
          galaxy  group at z~0.63, which also includes the lensing galaxy
          in  the  B1608+656  system,  and  the  second  is a member of a
          foreground  group  at  z~0.43. By measuring the effective radii
          and  surface  brightnesses  of  the two lens galaxies, we infer
          their  velocity  dispersions  based  on  the passively evolving
          Fundamental  Plane  (FP)  relation.  Elliptical isothermal lens
          mass  models  are  able  to  explain their image configurations
          within   the   lens  hypothesis,  with  a  velocity  dispersion
          compatible  with  that  estimated  from the FP for a reasonable
          source-redshift  range.  Based  on  the large number of massive
          early-type  galaxies  in  the  field  and the number-density of
          faint  blue  galaxies,  the  presence  of  two  additional lens
          systems  around  CLASS  B1608+656 is not unlikely in hindsight.
          Gravitational   lens   galaxies  are  predominantly  early-type
          galaxies,  which  are  clustered,  and  the  lensed quasar host
          galaxies   are   also   clustered.  Therefore,  obtaining  deep
          high-resolution  images  of the fields around known strong lens
          systems  is an excellent method of enhancing the probability of
          finding additional strong gravitational lens systems.

          The  Wilkinson  Microwave  Anisotropy Probe WMAP has mapped the
          entire  sky  in five frequency bands between 23 and 94 GHz with
          polarization   sensitive  radiometers.  We  present  three-year
          full-sky   maps  of  the  polarization  and  analyze  them  for
          foreground   emission   and  cosmological  implications.  These
          observations  open  up  a  new  window  for  understanding  the
          universe.   WMAP   observes  significant  levels  of  polarized
          foreground  emission due to both Galactic synchrotron radiation
          and thermal dust emission. The least contaminated channel is at
          61  GHz.  Informed  by  a  model  of  the  Galactic  foreground
          emission, we subtract the foreground emission from the maps. In
          the  foreground  corrected  maps,  for  l=2-6, we detect l(l+1)
          C_l^{EE}  /  (2  pi)  =  0.086  +-0.029  microkelvin^2. This is
          interpreted  as  the  result of rescattering of the CMB by free
          electrons  released  during  reionization and corresponds to an
          optical  depth  of  tau  = 0.09 +- 0.03. We see no evidence for
          B-modes,  limiting  them to l(l+1) C_l^{BB} / (2 pi) = -0.04 +-
          0.03   microkelvin^2.   We   find   that  the  limit  from  the
          polarization signals alone is r<2.2 (95% CL) corresponding to a
          limit   on   the  cosmic  density  of  gravitational  waves  of
          Omega_{GW}h^2 < 5 times 10^{-12}.
          From   the   full  WMAP  analysis,  we  find  r<0.55  (95%  CL)
          corresponding to a limit of Omega_{GW}h^2 < 10^{-12} (95% CL).

          galaxy formation

          reduced resolution)
          It   is   well   known   that   cosmic  rays  (CRs)  contribute
          significantly to the pressure of the interstellar medium in our
          own  Galaxy, suggesting that they may play an important role in
          regulating star formation during the formation and evolution of
          galaxies.  We  here  discuss a novel numerical treatment of the
          physics  of CRs and its implementation in the parallel smoothed
          particle  hydrodynamics  code GADGET-2. In our methodology, the
          non-thermal  CR  population  of  each  gaseous fluid element is
          approximated  by  a  simple  power  law  spectrum  in  particle
          momentum, characterized by an amplitude, a cut-off, and a fixed
          slope.  Adiabatic  compression, and a number of physical source
          and  sink  terms  are  modelled which modify the CR pressure of
          each  particle.  The  most  important  sources  considered  are
          injection by supernovae and diffusive shock acceleration, while
          the  primary  sinks are thermalization by Coulomb interactions,
          and  catastrophic  losses  by  hadronic  interactions.  We also
          include diffusion of CRs. Our scheme allows us to carry out the
          first   cosmological   structure   formation  simulations  that
          self-consistently  account  for  CR  physics. In simulations of
          isolated  galaxies,  we  find that CRs can significantly reduce
          the  star formation efficiencies of small galaxies, with virial
          velocities   below   \~80   km/s,   an   effect   that  becomes
          progressively stronger towards low mass scales. In cosmological
          simulations  at high redshift, the total mass-to-light ratio of
          small  halos  and  the faint-end of the luminosity function are
          strongly  affected.  When CR acceleration in shocks is followed
          as  well,  up  to  ~40%  of  the energy dissipated at structure
          formation  shocks  can appear as CR pressure at z~3-6, but this
          fraction  drops  to  ~10%  at  low  redshifts  when  the  shock
          distribution  becomes  increasingly  dominated  by  lower  Mach
          numbers. (abridged)

          We  present  FUSE  and  HST/STIS observations of the absorption
          line  system  near  the  emission  redshift of the radio-quiet,
          X-ray  bright  quasar  HE0226-4110  (z  =  0.495,  V=15.2). The
          spectra  cover the rest-frame wavelength range 610--1150 A, and
          we  detect  a  wide range of ionization species, including four
          adjacent  stages  of oxygen (O III-VI), which reveal a striking
          change  in gas kinematics with ionization. Examination of the O
          VI  1031, 1037 doublet profiles reveals no evidence for partial
          coverage  or  unresolved  saturated  structure.  O  III is only
          detected  in a narrow feature which is also traced by H I and C
          III,  suggesting that they arise in the same gas. Absorption at
          the  same  velocity  is  also  present in other species N IV, O
          IV-VI,  S  IV,  and  possibly N VIII, but the kinematics differ
          from the O III, implying production in separate gaseous phases.
          The H I, O II-IV, and C III information in yield an estimate of
          both  the  photoionization  parameter  and metallicity of the O
          III-bearing       gas:       [O/H]=+0.12(-0.03/+0.16),      log
          U=-2.29(-0.23/+0.02). We discuss two possible locations for the
          gas  in  this  associated  absorption-line  system:  the narrow
          emission  line region of the quasar, and the halo of the quasar
          host   galaxy.   An   additional  narrow  (thus,  photoionized)
          component that is only detected in O VI appears 58 km/s redward
          of  the O III-bearing gas with -0.35 < log U < 0.02. Additional
          structure is detected in the associated absorber in the form of
          two  broad  components  which  only  appear in moderate to high
          ionization species. [highly abridged]

          Whether radio intermediate quasars possess relativistic jets as
          radio-loud  quasars  is an important issue in the understanding
          of  the  origin  of  radio emission in quasars. In this letter,
          using  the  two-epoch radio data obtained during Faint Image of
          Radio  Sky  at  Twenty  centimeter sky (FIRST) and NOAO VLA Sky
          Survey  (NVSS),  we  identify  89 radio variable sources in the
          Sloan  Digital Sky Survey. Among them, more than half are radio
          intermediate quasars (RL=f2cm/f2500A<250). For all objects with
          available  multiple  band radio observations, the radio spectra
          are   either  flat  or  inverted.  The  brightness  temperature
          inferred    from   the   variability   is   larger   than   the
          synchrotron-self  Compton  limit  for a stationary source in 87
          objects,  indicating  of  relativistic beaming. Considering the
          sample  selection  and  viewing  angle effect, we conclude that
          relativistic  jets probably exist in a substantianl fraction of
          radio intermediate quasars.

          We  present detailed predictions for the redshifted 21cm signal
          from  the epoch of reionization. These predictions are obtained
          from  radiative  transfer  calculations on the results of large

          simulations. We consider several scenarios for the reionization
          history,  of  both  early  and  extended reionization. From the
          simulations  we  construct and analyze a range of observational
          characteristics,  from  the  global signal, via detailed images
          and    spectra,   to   statistical   representations   of   rms
          fluctuations,    angular   power   spectra,   and   probability
          distribution  functions  to characterize the non-gaussianity of
          the 21cm signal. (abbreviated abstract)

          We  present the results of a search for optical identifications

          F658N  (Halpha).  Our sample consisting of nine ULXs is defined
          by analyzing the three Chandra observations of M51 performed in
          2000 June, 2001 June, and 2003 Aug. We found four ULXs have one
          or  two  candidates  for  counterparts, while two have multiple
          stars  within  their  error  circles.  The  other three have no
          candidate counterparts. Four ULXs are located near or in a star
          cluster, while others have no association with a cluster. These
          results  indicate  that  the  companion  star, environment, and
          origin of ULXs are probably heterogeneous.

          We  report  recent  Chandra  observations  of  the  ULX  in the
          elliptical   galaxy   NGC3379  that  clearly  detect  two  flux
          variability  cycles.  Comparing  these  data  with  the Chandra
          observation  of  ~5yr  ago, we measure a flux modulation with a
          period   of  ~12.6hr.  Moreover,  we  find  that  the  emission
          undergoes  a correlated spectral modulation, becoming softer at
          low  flux. We argue that our results establish this source as a
          ULX binary in NGC3379. Given the old stellar population of this
          galaxy,  the  ULX  is  likely  to  be a soft transient, however
          historical  X-ray  sampling  suggests that the current on phase
          has  lasted  ~10yr.  We discuss our results in terms of ADC and
          wind-feedback  models.  We constrain the donor mass and orbital
          period  at  the  onset  of  mass  transfer within 1.15-1.4M and
          12.5-16hr,  respectively.  The  duration  of  the mass-transfer
          phase  so  far is probably ~1Gyr and the binary has been a soft
          X-ray  transient  throughout  this  time. These constraints are
          insensitive to the mass of the accretor.

          Title:   Was   Star-Formation   Suppressed   in   High-Redshift
          Minihalos?
          Authors: Zoltan Haiman, Greg L. Bryan (Columbia University)
          Comments: ApJL, submitted
          The   primordial   gas  in  the  earliest  dark  matter  halos,
          collapsing  at  redshifts  around z=20, with masses M_halo=10^6
          M_sun,  and  virial  temperatures  T_vir<10^4K,  relied  on the
          presence  of molecules for cooling. Several theoretical studies
          have suggested that gas contraction and star-formation in these
          minihalos  was  suppressed by radiative, chemical, thermal, and
          dynamical  feedback  processes.  The  recent measurement by the
          Wilkinson  Microwave  Anisotropy  Probe  (WMAP)  of the optical
          depth  to  electron  scattering,  tau=0.09+/-0.03, provides the
          first  empirical  evidence  for  this suppression. The new WMAP
          result  is  consistent  with vanilla models of reionization, in
          which  ionizing  sources  populate cold dark matter (CDM) halos
          down to a virial temperature of T_vir=10^4K. On the other hand,
          we show that in order to avoid overproducing the optical depth,
          the  efficiency  for  the  production  of  ionizing  photons in
          minihalos must have been about an order of magnitude lower than
          expected  and lower than the efficiency in large halos that can
          cool  via  atomic  hydrogen (T_vir > 10^4K). This conclusion is
          insensitive  to  assumptions  about  the efficiency of ionizing
          photon  production  in the large halos, as long as reionization
          ends  by  z=6,  as required by the spectra of bright quasars at
          z<6.  Our  conclusion  is  strengthened  if the clumping of the
          ionized   gas   evolves   with   redshift,   as   suggested  by
          semi-analytical  predictions  and  three-dimensional  numerical
          simulations.

          We  consider  the  stochastic background of gravitational waves
          produced by an early generation of Population III stars coupled
          with  a  normal  mode  of star formation at lower redshift. The
          computation  is  performed  in  the  framework  of hierarchical
          structure  formation  and  is  based  on  cosmic star formation
          histories  constrained to reproduce the observed star formation
          rate at redshift $z \la 6$, the observed chemical abundances in
          damped  Lyman  alpha absorbers and in the intergalactic medium,
          and  to  allow  for  an  early  reionization of the Universe at
          $z\sim  10-20$  as indicated by the first year results released
          by  WMAP.  We  find  that  the  normal  mode  of star formation
          produces a gravitational wave background which peaks at 300-500
          Hz  and  is  within  LIGO  III  sensitivity. The Population III

          the  model),  and  could be detected by LIGO III as well as the

          Using  the final version of the VLA FIRST survey (Becker et al.
          2003),  the  optical  Sloan  Digital  Sky Survey Data Release 3
          (DR3)  quasar list and a series of carefully selected criteria,
          we   have   defined   the  largest  homogeneous  population  of
          double-lobed  sources.  With the precise sample definition, the
          increased  depth  and sensitivity of the survey data, the large
          size   of  the  dataset,  and  our  self-consistent  method  of
          analysis,  which addresses many of the problems associated with
          previous  work  in  the  area,  we  are able to: a) explore the
          correlations   between   the   intrinsic   properties   of  the
          double-lobed radio sources (the results are also confirmed by a
          non-parametric  analysis)  and  study their evolution, b) place
          more  interesting  and  tighter constraints on the cosmological
          parameters,  distinguish  among the different cosmology models,
          and  determine  the impact of the angular size-redshift studies
          in  cosmology,  c) further our understanding of the behavior of
          the  intergalactic  medium  (IGM)  density  as  a  function  of
          redshift  and  shed  more  light  to  the  quasar-radio  galaxy
          unification issue.

          Title:   Dwarf   Galaxy  Formation  Was  Suppressed  By  Cosmic
          Reionization
          Authors: Stuart Wyithe, Abraham Loeb
          Comments:  19  pages,  3  figures.  Accepted for publication in
          Nature; press embargo until published
          A  large  number  of  faint  galaxies, born less than a billion
          years  after  the  big bang, have recently been discovered. The
          fluctuations  in the distribution of these galaxies contributed
          to  a  scatter in the ionization fraction of cosmic hydrogen on
          scales  of tens of Mpc, as observed along the lines of sight to
          the  earliest  known  quasars.  Theoretical simulations predict
          that   the   formation  of  dwarf  galaxies  should  have  been
          suppressed  after  cosmic  hydrogen was reionized, leading to a
          drop  in  the  cosmic  star  formation  rate.  Here  we present
          evidence    for    this   suppression.   We   show   that   the
          post-reionization  galaxies which produced most of the ionizing
          radiation  at  a redshift z~5.5, must have had a mass in excess
          of  ~10^{10.9+/-0.5}  solar  masses  or else the aforementioned
          scatter  would  have  been smaller than observed. This limiting
          mass  is  two  orders  of magnitude larger than the galaxy mass
          that  is  thought  to have dominated the reionization of cosmic
          hydrogen  (~10^8  solar masses). We predict that future surveys
          with  space-based  infrared telescopes will detect a population
          of  smaller  galaxies that reionized the Universe at an earlier
          time, prior to the epoch of dwarf galaxy suppression.

          Title:  From  First  Stars  to  the  Spite  Plateau: a Possible
          Reconciliation of Halo Stars Observations with Predictions from
          Big Bang Nucleosynthesis

          Journal
          Since the pioneering observations of Spite & Spite in 1982, the
          constant  lithium  abundance  of  metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-1.3) halo
          stars  near  the  turnoff  has  been  attributed a cosmological
          origin.  Closer  analysis  revealed that the observed abundance
          lies  at  $\Delta$ Li~0.4 dex below the predictions of Big Bang
          Nucleosynthesis.  The  measurements  of deuterium abundances on
          the  lines of sight toward quasars and the recent data from the
          Wilkinson  Microwave  Anisotropy  Probe independently confirmed
          this  gap.  We  suggest  here  that  part of the discrepancy is
          explained  by  the  first  generation of stars that efficiently
          depleted   lithium.   Assuming  that  the  models  for  lithium
          evolution  in  the halo turnoff stars and $\Delta$ Li estimates
          are  correct, we infer that between 1/3 and 1/2 of the baryonic
          matter  of  the  early  halo  (~10^9  Mo) was processed through
          Population  III  stars.  This  new  paradigm  proposes  a  very
          economical    solution   to   the   lingering   difficulty   of
          understanding  the properties of the Spite Plateau and its lack
          of  star-to-star scatter down to [Fe/H]=-2.5. It is moreover in
          agreement  both  with  the  absence of lithium detection in the
          most  metal-poor  star presently known (HE 1327-2326), and also
          with  new  trends of the Plateau suggesting its low metallicity
          edge   may  be  reached  around  [Fe/H]=-2.5.  We  discuss  the
          turbulent mixing associated with enhanced supernovae explosions
          in  the  early  interstellar medium in this picture. Finally we
          show that other chemical properties of the extremely metal-poor
          stars  are  in  agreement  with  a  significant  Population III
          processing in the halo, provided these models include mass-loss
          and rotationally-induced mixing.

          Title:   European   VLBI   Network   observations  of  fourteen
          GHz-Peaked-Spectrum radio sources at 5 GHz

          Comments: 15 pages, 23 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          We  present  the  results  of  EVN polarization observations of
          fourteen  GHz-Peaked-Spectrum  (GPS)  radio  sources  at 5 GHz.
          These  sources were selected from bright GPS source samples and
          we  aimed  at finding Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs). We have
          obtained  full  polarization  5  GHz  VLBI  observations  of 14
          sources  providing  information  on  their source structure and
          spectral  indices.  The  results show that two core-jet sources
          1433$-$040 and DA193, out of 14 GPS sources, exhibit integrated
          fractional  polarizations  of  3.6%  and 1.0% respectively. The
          other   12   sources   have  no  clear  detection  of  pc-scale
          polarization.   The   results  confirm  that  the  GPS  sources
          generally  have  very  low  polarization  at 5 GHz. The sources
          1133+432,  1824+271 and 2121$-$014 are confirmed as CSOs. Three
          new  CSOs  0914+114,  1518+046  and 2322$-$040 (tentative) have
          been  classified  on  the  basis  of  5 GHz images and spectral
          indices.  The  sources  1333+589,  1751+278 and 2323+790 can be
          classified  either as compact doubles, and then they are likely
          CSO  candidates  or  core-jet sources; further observations are
          needed   for   an   appropriate   classification;   0554$-$026,
          1433$-$040  and  1509+054 are core-jet sources. In addition, we
          estimate  that  a  component  in  the  jet  of quasar DA193 has
          superluminal motion of $3.3\pm0.6 h^{-1}c$ in 5.5 years.

          We  present  the  catalog of 477 spectra from the Serendipitous
          Extragalactic  X-ray  Source  Identification (SEXSI) program, a
          survey  designed to probe the dominant contributors to the 2-10
          keV  cosmic  X-ray background. Our survey covers 1 deg^2 of sky
          to  2-10  keV  fluxes of 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1, and 2 deg^2 for
          fluxes of 3 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1. Our spectra reach to R <24
          and  have  produced  redshifts  for 438 hard X-ray sources. The
          vast  majority  of  the  2-10  keV-selected sample are AGN with
          redshifts  between  0.1  and 3. We find that few sources at z<1
          have high X-ray luminosities, reflecting a dearth of high-mass,
          high-accretion-rate   sources   at   low   redshift,  a  result
          consistent  with  other  recent  wide-area surveys. Half of our
          sources  show  significant  obscuration,  with N_H>10^22 cm^-2,
          independent  of  unobscured luminosity. We classify 168 sources
          as  emission-line galaxies; all are X-ray luminous objects with
          optical spectra lacking both high-ionization lines and evidence
          of  a non-stellar continuum. The redshift distribution of these
          emission-line  galaxies peaks at a significantly lower redshift
          than  does that of the sources we spectroscopically identify as
          AGN.  We  conclude  that few of these sources can be powered by
          starburst  activity.  Stacking  spectra  for  a subset of these
          sources,  we  detect  [Ne V] emission, a clear signature of AGN
          activity,  confirming  that  the  majority of these objects are
          Seyfert  2s  in  which the high-ionization lines are diluted by
          stellar  emission.  We  find  33 objects lacking broad lines in
          their  optical  spectra  which  have  quasar X-ray luminosities
          (Lx>10^44  erg  s^-1),  the  largest  sample  of  such  objects
          identified  to  date. In addition, we explore 17 AGN associated
          with  galaxy  clusters  and  find  that  the cluster-member AGN
          sample  has  a  lower  fraction of broad-line AGN than does the
          background sample.

          Aims.  The  aim  of this work is to identify and study spectral
          features in the quasar 3C 273 usually blended by its strong jet
          emission.  Method.  A  historic  minimum  in the sub-millimetre
          emission  of  3C  273  triggered  coordinated  multi-wavelength
          observations   in   June  2004.  X-ray  observations  from  the
          INTEGRAL,  XMM-Newton  and  RXTE satellites are complemented by
          ground-based    optical,   infrared,   millimetre   and   radio
          observations.  The  overall  spectrum  is  used  to  model  the
          infrared  and X-ray spectral components. Results. Three thermal
          dust  emission  components  are identified in the infrared. The
          dust  emission on scales from 1 pc to several kpc is comparable
          to  that  of  other  quasars,  as  expected  by AGN unification
          schemes.  The  observed weakness of the X-ray emission supports
          the hypothesis of a synchrotron self-Compton origin for the jet
          component.  There  is  a clear soft-excess and we find evidence
          for  a  very  broad  iron line which could be emitted in a disk
          around  a  Kerr  black hole. Other signatures of a Seyfert-like
          X-ray component are not detected.

          Authors: L. Christensen, K. Jahnke, L. Wisotzki, S. F. Sanchez,

          Comments: 7 pages, accepted for publication in A&A
          Powerful   radio   galaxies  and  radio-loud  quasars  at  high
          redshifts are frequently associated with extended emission-line
          regions (EELRs). Here we investigate the [O II] EELR around the
          quasar  3C 196 at z=0.871 using integral field spectroscopy. We
          also detect extended [Ne II] emission at a distance of about 30
          kpc  from  the core. The emission is aligned with the radio hot
          spots and shows a redshifted and a blueshifted component with a
          velocity  difference  of ~800 km s^-1. The alignment effect and
          large velocities support the hypothesis that the EELR is caused
          by  a  jet-cloud interaction, which is furthermore indicated by
          the  presence of a pronounced bend in the radio emission at the
          location of the radio hot spots. We also report observations of
          two  other  systems  which  do not show as clear indications of
          interactions. We find a weaker alignment of an [O II] EELR from
          the  z=0.927  quasar  3C 336, while no EELR is found around the
          core-dominated quasar OI 363 at z=0.63.

          Title: Updating reionization scenarios after recent data
          Authors: T. Roy Choudhury, A. Ferrara
          Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure
          The  recent  release of data on (i) high redshift source counts
          from  NICMOS  HUDF,  and (ii) electron scattering optical depth
          from  3-year  WMAP,  require  a  re-examination of reionization
          scenarios.  Using  an  improved self-consistent model, based on
          Choudhury   &   Ferrara  (2005),  we  determine  the  range  of
          reionization  histories  which can match a wide variety of data
          sets  simultaneously.  From this improved analysis we find that
          hydrogen  reionization  starts  around  z  =  15, driven by the
          metal-free  stars  (with  normal Salpeter-like IMF), and is 90%
          complete  by  z  =  10. The photoionizing power of PopIII stars
          fades for z < 10 because of the concomitant action of radiative
          and  chemical  feedbacks, which causes the reionization process
          to  stretch  considerably  and  to  end  only  by  z  =  6. The
          combination  of  different  data  sets still favours a non-zero
          contribution from metal-free stars, forming with efficiencies >
          2%.

          Title:  Quasar  Microlensing:  when compact masses mimic smooth
          matter
          Authors: Geraint F. Lewis, Rodrigo Gil-Merino
          Comments:  6  pages,  to  appear  in  ApJ.  As ever, quality of
          figures reduced
          The  magnification  induced  by  gravitational  microlensing is
          sensitive  to  the  size  of  a source relative to the Einstein
          radius,  the  natural  microlensing  scale  length.  This paper
          investigates  the  effect  of source size in the case where the
          microlensing   masses  are  distributed  with  a  bimodal  mass
          function, with solar mass stars representing the normal stellar
          masses,    and    smaller    masses    (down    to   $8.5\times
          10^{-5}$M$_\odot$)  representing a dark matter component. It is
          found that there exists a critical regime where the dark matter
          is  initially  seen  as  individual compact masses, but with an
          increasing source size the compact dark matter acts as a smooth
          mass  component.  This  study  reveals  that  interpretation of
          microlensing light curves, especially claims of small mass dark
          matter  lenses  embedded in an overall stellar population, must
          consider the important influence of the size of the source.

          Type  II  quasars  are  luminous  Active  Galactic Nuclei whose
          centers  are obscured by large amounts of gas and dust. In this
          paper we present 3-band HST images of nine type II quasars with
          redshifts  0.2  <  z  < 0.4 selected from the Sloan Digital Sky
          Survey  based  on their emission line properties. The intrinsic
          luminosities  of these AGN are estimated to be -24 > M_B > -26,
          but  optical  obscuration  allows  their  host  galaxies  to be
          studied  unencumbered  by  bright  nuclei. Each object has been
          imaged  in  three continuum filters (`UV', `blue' and `yellow')
          placed between the strong emission lines. The spectacular, high
          quality  images  reveal a wealth of details about the structure
          of  the  host  galaxies and their environments. Six of the nine
          galaxies  in  the  sample  are  ellipticals with de Vaucouleurs
          light  profiles,  one  object has a well-defined disk component
          and  the remaining two have marginal disks. Stellar populations
          of  type  II  quasar  hosts  are  more luminous (by a median of
          0.3-0.7  mag,  depending on the wavelength) and bluer (by about
          0.4 mag) than are M* galaxies at the same redshift. When smooth
          fits  to  stellar light are subtracted from the images, we find
          both positive and negative residuals that become more prominent
          toward   shorter   wavelengths.  We  argue  that  the  negative
          residuals  are  due  to  kpc-scale dust obscuration, while most
          positive  residuals  are  due  to  the  light  from the nucleus
          scattered   off  interstellar  material  in  the  host  galaxy.
          Scattered  light  makes a significant contribution to the broad
          band  continuum  emission  and can be the dominant component of
          the extended emission in the UV in extreme cases.

          "Groups of Galaxies in the Nearby Universe"
          We  present the results of our HI survey of six loose groups of
          galaxies analogous to the Local Group. The survey was conducted
          using  the Parkes telescope and the Australia Telescope Compact
          Array  to  produce  a  census  of all the gas-rich galaxies and
          potential  analogs  to  the  high-velocity clouds (HVCs) within
          these  groups  down to M(HI)<10^7 M(sun) as a test of models of
          galaxy formation. We present the HI mass function and halo mass
          function  for  these analogous groups and compare them with the
          Local  Group  and  other environments. We also demonstrate that
          our  non-detection  of HVC analogs in these groups implies that
          they  must  have  low HI masses and be clustered tightly around
          galaxies,  including  around  our  own  Milky  Way, and are not
          distributed throughout the Local Group.

          Comments: 2 pages, 1 figure. Presented at LARIM05; to appear in
          RevMexAst Conf Series
          We  present  a  Supernova  (SN) feedback model that succeeds at
          describing  the chemical and energetic effects of SN explosions
          in  galaxy  formation  simulations.  This new SN model has been
          coupled  to  GADGET-2  and works within a new multiphase scheme
          which  allows  the  description of a co-spatial mixture of cold
          and hot interstellar medium phases.
          No ad hoc scale-dependent parameters are associated to these SN
          and  multiphase  models  making  them  particularly  suited  to
          studies of galaxy formation in a cosmological framework. Our SN
          model  succeeds  not  only  in  setting  a  self-regulated star
          formation  activity  in  galaxies  but in triggering collimated
          chemical-enriched  galactic  winds.  The  effects of winds vary
          with  the  virial  mass  of the systems so that the smaller the
          galaxy,  the  larger  the  fraction  of  swept away gas and the
          stronger  the decrease in its star formation activity. The fact
          that  the  fraction  of  ejected  metals  exceeds  60  per cent
          regardless  of  mass,  suggests  that  SN  feedback  can be the
          responsible  mechanism  of  the enrichment of the intergalactic
          medium to the observed levels.

          Title:  The Orbital Period of the Ultraluminous X-ray Source in
          M82
          Authors: Philip Kaaret, Melanie G. Simet, Cornelia C. Lang
          Comments: 3 pages, appeared in Science
          Journal-ref:  Science  27  January 2006: Vol. 311. no. 5760, p.
          491
          The ultraluminous x-ray source (ULX) in the galaxy M82 has been
          identified  as a possible intermediate-mass black hole. We have
          found  that  the  x-ray  flux  from  M82  is  modulated  with a
          peak-to-peak amplitude corresponding to an isotropic luminosity
          of  2.4x10^40  erg/s  in M82 and a period of 62.0 +/- 2.5 days,
          which  we  interpret  as  the orbital period of the ULX binary.
          This  orbital period implies that the mass-donor star must be a
          giant  or  supergiant. Large mass-transfer rates, sufficient to
          fuel  the  ULX, are expected for a giant-phase mass donor in an
          x-ray  binary. The giant phase has a short lifetime, indicating
          that we see the ULX in M82 in a brief and unusual period of its
          evolution.

          We  present  a  hierarchical  galaxy  formation model which can
          account for the number counts of sources detected through their
          emission  at sub-millimetre wavelengths. The first stage in our
          approach  is  an  ab  initio  calculation of the star formation
          histories  for  a  representative  sample of galaxies, which is
          carried  out  using  the semi-analytical galaxy formation model
          GALFORM. These star formation histories are then input into the
          spectro-photometric  code  GRASIL, to produce a spectral energy
          distribution  for each galaxy. Dust extinction and emission are
          treated  self  consistently  in  our  model,  without having to
          resort to ad-hoc assumptions about the amount of attenuation by
          dust  or  the  temperature at which the dust radiates. We argue
          that  it is necessary to modify the form of the stellar initial
          mass  function  in  starbursts  in  order to match the observed
          number of sub-mm sources, if we are to retain the previous good
          matches  enjoyed  between observations and model predictions in
          the local universe. We also list some other observational tests
          that have been passed by our model.

          Comments:  Astronomical Journal (first submitted in Dec. 2005);
          45 pages incl. 1 colour figure
          We  present  the first systematic study of (non-radio-selected)
          radio-loud    narrow-line    Seyfert    1    (NLS1)   galaxies.
          Cross-correlation  of  the  `Catalogue  of  Quasars  and Active
          Nuclei'  with  several  radio and optical catalogues led to the
          identification  of  11  radio-loud  NLS1 candidates including 4
          previously  known  ones.  Most  of  the  radio-loud  NLS1s  are
          compact,  steep  spectrum sources accreting close to, or above,
          the  Eddington  limit.  The  radio-loud NLS1s of our sample are
          remarkable  in  that  they occupy a previously rarely populated
          regime  in  NLS1  multi-wavelength parameter space. While their
          [OIII]/H_beta and FeII/H_beta intensity ratios almost cover the
          whole  range  observed in NLS1 galaxies, their radio properties
          extend  the  range  of  radio-loud  objects to those with small
          widths of the broad Balmer lines. Among the radio-detected NLS1
          galaxies,  the  radio  index R distributes quite smoothly up to
          the  critical  value  of  R  ~  10 and covers about 4 orders of
          magnitude  in  total.  Statistics  show  that  ~7%  of the NLS1
          galaxies are formally radio-loud while only 2.5% exceed a radio
          index   R   >   100.   Several  mechanisms  are  considered  as
          explanations  for  the  radio loudness of the NLS1 galaxies and
          for  the  lower  frequency  of  radio-louds  among  NLS1s  than
          quasars. While properties of most sources (with 2-3 exceptions)
          generally do not favor relativistic beaming, the combination of
          accretion   mode   and   spin  may  explain  the  observations.

          the  stellar  populations  of  red-sequence  galaxies  from the

          Comments:  Twenty  pages,  thirteen figures; revised version as
          returned to MNRAS following minor comments from the referee
          We   analyse   absorption   line-strength   indices  for  ~3000
          red-sequence  galaxies  in  94  nearby clusters, to investigate
          systematic variations of their stellar content with location in
          the  host cluster. The data are drawn from the NOAO Fundamental
          Plane  Survey.  Our  adopted method is a generalization of that
          introduced by Nelan et al. to determine the global age-mass and
          metallicity-mass relations from the same survey. We find strong
          evidence for a change in galaxy properties, at fixed mass, over
          a  range  from  the cluster centre to the virial radius, R_200.
          For  example, red-sequence galaxies further out in the clusters
          have  weaker  Mgb5177  (at  ~8 sigma significance) and stronger
          Hbeta  and Hgamma absorption (~3 sigma, ~4 sigma) than galaxies
          of  the  same  velocity  dispersion  in  the cluster cores. The
          Fe5270  and  Fe5335  indices  show  only  very weak trends with
          radius.  Using  a  total  of  twelve  indices,  the  pattern of
          cluster-centric  gradients  is  considered  in  light  of their
          different  dependences on stellar age and chemical composition.
          The measured gradients for all twelve indices can be reproduced
          by  a  model in which red-sequence galaxies at ~1 R_200 have on
          average  younger  ages  (by  15+/-4%)  and  lower alpha-element
          abundance  ratios  (by  10+/-2%),  than  galaxies  of  the same
          velocity  dispersion  but  located near the cluster centre. For
          the  total  metallicity,  Z/H, no significant gradient is found
          (2+/-3%  larger at R_200 than in the core). The cluster-centric
          age  and  alpha/Fe  gradients  are  in  the  sense  expected if
          galaxies  in the cluster core were accreted at an earlier epoch
          than  those  at  larger  radii,  and  if this earlier accretion
          contributed to an earlier cessation of star formation. The size
          of  the  observed  age  trend is comparable to predictions from
          semi-analytic models of hierarchical galaxy formation.

          and the Radio Galaxy/Cosmology Interface

          Comments:  10 pages, 0 figures; to appear in J. Korean Physical
          Society;  summary  of  lectures  presented  at  the 2006 Winter
          School on Black Hole Astrophysics, Pohang, Korea
          We  first  review  some  basic properties of the most important
          classes  of  active  galactic  nuclei (AGN), including quasars,
          blazars, Seyfert galaxies and radio galaxies. The most commonly
          accepted  type  of  scheme  designed  to individually unify the
          radio-loud  and  radio-quiet  categories  of  AGN is based upon
          three  parameters:  black  hole  mass,  accretion rate, and our
          orientation  to  the  accretion flow. Some recent evidence from
          optical  microvariability  of  several classes of AGN points in
          favor   of   a  strong  unification  scheme  that  unites  both
          radio-loud  and  radio-quiet  categories. An important question
          concerning  the  nature  of  blazars  and  other  AGN whose jet
          emission    appears   to   dominate   their   spectral   energy
          distributions involves the velocities of those flows. A variety
          of  apparently  contradictory observations can be reconciled if
          such flows are ultrarelativistic but have an opening angle of a
          few  degrees.  Radio  galaxies (RGs) were much more numerous at
          redshifts  ~2 than they are today. Combining this fact with the
          realization that older RGs at such redshifts are very difficult
          to  detect,  and with cosmological simulations of the growth of
          structure  in  the universe has led us to propose that RG lobes
          have  impacted  a  significant  fraction  of  the cosmic web of
          baryons.  These  impacts  may  have  triggered  extensive  star
          formation  and  perhaps even engendered new galaxies; they also
          probably  played  important  roles in the spreading of magnetic
          fields and heavier elements into the intergalactic medium.

          We   discuss   spectral   energy   distributions,   photometric
          redshifts,   redshift   distributions,   luminosity  functions,
          source-counts  and the far infrared to optical luminosity ratio
          for  sources  in  the  SWIRE Legacy Survey. The spectral energy
          distributions  of  selected SWIRE sources are modelled in terms
          of  a  simple set of galaxy and quasar templates in the optical
          and  near  infrared,  and with a set of dust emission templates
          (cirrus,  M82 starburst, Arp 220 starburst, and AGN dust torus)
          in  the  mid infrared. The optical data, together with the IRAC
          3.6  and  4.5  mu data, have been used to determine photometric
          redshifts.  For  galaxies  with  known  spectroscopic redshifts
          there is a notable improvement in the photometric redshift when
          the  IRAC  data  are  used, with a reduction in the rms scatter
          from  10%  in (1+z) to 5%. While further spectroscopic data are
          needed to confirm this result, the prospect of determining good
          photometric  redshifts  for the 2 million extragalactic objects
          in  SWIRE  is  excellent.  The  distribution  of  the different
          infrared  sed  types  in  the  L{ir}/L{opt} versus L{ir} plane,
          where  L{ir} and L{opt} are the infrared and optical bolometric
          luminosities,  is discussed. Source-counts at 24, 70 and 160 mu
          are  discussed,  and  luminosity functions at 3.6 and 24 mu are
          presented.

          With   close   pairs  of  quasars  at  different  redshifts,  a
          background  quasar  sightline can be used to study a foreground
          quasar's  environment  in  absorption.  We  search 149 moderate
          resolution  background  quasar  spectra, from Gemini, Keck, the
          MMT,  and  the  SDSS  to  survey Lyman Limit Systems (LLSs) and
          Damped Ly-alpha systems (DLAs) in the vicinity of 1.8 < z < 4.0
          luminous foreground quasars. A sample of 27 new quasar-absorber
          pairs   is   uncovered   with  column  densities,  17.2  <  log
          (N_HI/cm^2)  <  20.9,  and  transverse (proper) distances of 22
          kpc/h  <  R  <  1.7 Mpc/h, from the foreground quasars. If they
          emit  isotropically,  the  implied ionizing photon fluxes are a
          factor  of ~ 5-8000 times larger than the ambient extragalactic
          UV  background  over  this  range  of  distances.  The observed
          probability  of intercepting an absorber is very high for small
          separations:   six  out  of  eight  projected  sightlines  with
          transverse   separations   R  <  150  kpc/h  have  an  absorber
          coincident  with  the foreground quasar, of which four have log
          N_HI > 10^19. The covering factor of log N_HI > 10^19 absorbers
          is  thus ~ 50 % (4/8) on these small scales, whereas < 2% would
          have  been  expected  at  random.  There  are many cosmological
          applications of these new sightlines: they provide laboratories
          for  studying fluorescent Ly-alpha recombination radiation from
          LLSs,   constrain  the  environments,  emission  geometry,  and
          radiative  histories of quasars, and shed light on the physical
          nature of LLSs and DLAs.

          Title:  Searching  for  a gigamaser in APM08279+5255, and other
          short stories
          Authors: Rob Ivison
          Comments: 7 pages, MNRAS format; comments welcome
          Bolometer  arrays  on  large  antennas  at high, dry sites have
          unveiled  a  dusty  population  of massive, luminous galaxies -
          submillimetre  galaxies,  or  SMGs  -  which make a significant
          contribution  to  the star-formation rate density at z > 1. The
          most  crucial  piece  of  information  required  to  derive the
          history of obscured star formation is the redshift distribution
          of  this  galaxy population, N(z), which breaks degeneracies in
          the  models and allows the mass and dynamics of the galaxies to
          be  explored  via  high-resolution  3D  imaging  in  CO  and by
          determining  their level of clustering. Many SMGs are extremely
          faint,  optically; some have no plausible counterparts, even in
          the  IR,  making  the  determination  of  an unbiased N(z) very
          difficult.  The  arrival  of the Herschel Space Observatory and
          next-generation   ground-based   submm   cameras   will  likely
          exacerbate  this so-called `redshift deadlock'. Here, we report
          the first test of a new method for determining redshifts, based
          on  the observed dependence of maser and IR luminosities, L(OH)
          \propto   L(FIR)^1.2.  We  have  searched  the  dusty,  lensed,
          hyperluminous  quasar,  APM08279+5255, for the 1612-, 1665- and
          1667-MHz  hydroxyl lines as well as the 22-GHz water line. At z
          =  3.9  these  are  shifted  to  329,  340  and  4,538 MHz. Our
          relatively   shallow  test  data  reveal  no  convincing  maser
          activity  but  we  approach  the expected thermal noise levels,
          meaning  progress is possible. As an aside, we present deep new
          submm  and  radio  imaging  of  this  field, and of the z = 4.7
          quasar,  BR1202-0725. Using a simple shift-and-add technique we
          uncover  a  new  submm  galaxy  in  each  of  the  fields,  one
          conceivably at the redshift of APM08279+5255.

          Galaxies", Dublin, 15-19 Aug 2005
          We  present  optical  observations  of  an  ultraluminous X-ray
          source  (ULX)  in Holmberg IX, a dwarf galaxy near M81. The ULX
          has  an  average  X-ray luminosity of some 10^{40} erg/s. It is
          located  in  a  huge  (400pc x 300pc) ionized nebula being much
          larger  than  normal  supernova  remnants.  From  the  observed
          emission  lines  (widths and ratios) we find that the structure
          is  due  to  collisional  excitation  by shocks, rather than by
          photoionization.
          We  identify the optical counterpart to be a 22.8 mag blue star
          (M_V=-5.0) belonging to a small stellar cluster. From isochrone
          fitting  of  our multi-colour photometry we determine a cluster
          age of 20 to 50 Myr. We also discovered strong stellar HeII4686
          emission   (equivalent   width   of  10  A)  which  proves  the
          identification  with  the  X-ray source, and which suggests the
          presence  of an X-ray heated accretion disc around the putative
          black hole.

          September 2005. In press
          We  present  optical observations of a ULX in the nearby spiral
          galaxy  IC  342.  This  variable  source  has  an average X-ray
          luminosity of some 10^{40} erg/s. At the position of the source
          there is an ionized nebula (the "Tooth") having huge dimensions
          (280 x 130 pc), much larger than normal supernova remnants. Our
          optical  spectra  reveal highly supersonic expansion velocities
          and  emission  line ratios typical of SNRs. It has been claimed
          that  two  [OIII]  5007  bright  regions in the nebula might be
          indicative  of  excitation  by  non-isotropic emission from the
          ULX.  However,  our  continuum  subtracted  [OIII]  5007  image
          reveals that O^{++} ions are rather smoothly distributed in the
          nebula,  fully  consistent  with  shock  excitation. Within the
          nebula  we  find  two  candidate  stars  (V=24.0 & 24.6) in the
          Chandra  X-ray  error  circle.  Both are substantially reddened
          being  consistent  with  the patchy interstellar absorption. We
          will discuss the nature of this source in the framework of what
          is currently known about optical counterparts of ULXs.

          Optical  studies of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX) in nearby
          galaxies  have  turned out to be instrumental in discriminating
          between   various   models   including   the   much  advertised
          intermediate  mass  black  hole  hypothesis and various beaming
          scenarios. Here we report on ESO VLT and SUBARU observations of
          ULX that have revealed the parent stellar clusters with ages of
          some  60 million years in two cases. Thus we are able to derive
          upper  limits  of  about  8  M_sun for the mass donors in these
          systems. The optical counterparts are dominated by X-ray heated
          accretion  disks,  and  the  discovery of the HeII4686 emission
          line  now  allows  to derive dynamical masses in these systems.
          Apparent  radial  velocity  variations  of  300  km/s have been
          detected  in  NGC  1313  X-2  which,  if  confirmed  by further
          observations,  would  exclude  the  presence  of  IMBH in these
          systems.

          Title:  A  Unified  Model of Active Galactic Nuclei, Black Hole
          X-Ray Sources and Gamma-Ray Bursts
          Authors: J. I. Katz
          Comments: 22 pages
          I  consider  models  of  active  galactic  nuclei, stellar-mass
          accreting  black  holes  and microquasars based on a previously
          developed  (Katz  1997)  model of gamma-ray bursts. When energy
          fluxes  exceed a critical value ~ 10^{29} erg/cm^2s, as in GRB,
          a black body equilibrium pair plasma forms. At the lower fluxes
          found  in  AGN,  BHXS and microquasars power electrodynamically
          accelerates   a  small  number  of  very  energetic  particles,
          explaining  their  non-thermal  spectra  and  the  high  energy
          gamma-ray  emission  of  blazars. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays
          may   be   accelerated   by   massive  black  holes,  otherwise
          undetectable, with very low thermal luminosities. New-born fast
          high-field pulsars may be in the black-body equilibrium regime,
          resembling  SGR  in  permanent  outburst.  I  also consider the
          question of whether collisionless plasmas interpenetrate rather
          than  forming  hydrodynamic  shocks,  and  propose  this  as an
          alternative to internal shock models of gamma-ray bursts.

          Title: Cosmic Reionization Redux
          Authors: Nickolay Y. Gnedin, Xiaohui Fan
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome
          We show that numerical simulations of reionization that resolve
          the Lyman Limit systems (and, thus, correctly count absorptions
          of  ionizing  photons)  have  converged  to about 10% level for
          5<z<6.2  and  are in reasonable agreement (within 10%) with the
          SDSS  data  in  this  redshift  interval.  The  SDSS  data thus
          constraint  the  redshift  of  overlap of cosmic HII regions to
          z_{OVL}  =  6.1+-0.15. At higher redshifts, the simulations are
          far  from  convergence on the mean Gunn-Peterson optical depth,
          but  achieve  good  convergence  for  the mean neutral hydrogen
          fraction.  The  simulations that fit the SDSS data, however, do
          not  have  nearly  enough  resolution  to  resolve the earliest
          episodes of star formation, and are very far from converging on
          the precise value of the optical depth to Thompson scattering -
          any  value  between  6  and  10%  is possible, depending on the
          convergence   rate   of  the  simulations  and  the  fractional
          contribution of PopIII stars. This is generally consistent with
          the   third-year  WMAP  results,  but  much  higher  resolution
          simulation  are  required  to  come  up  with  the sufficiently
          precise  value  for  the  Thompson  optical  depth  that can be
          statistically compared with the WMAP data.

          Title:  Constraining  the  size  of  the  narrow line region in
          distant quasars
          Authors: Atsunori Yonehara (1, 2) ((1) The University of Tokyo,
          (2) Inoue Fellow)
          Comments: 17 pages including 4 figures, accepted to ApJ
          We  propose  a  proper method to measure the size of the narrow
          line region (NLR) in distant quasars. The apparent angular size
          of  the  NLR  is, in general, too small to resolve technically.
          However,  it  is  possible to map the NLR if with gravitational
          lensing.  In our method, we directly compare the observed image
          of  the  NLR  with  the  expected  lensed images of the NLR for
          various  source  sizes  and  lens  models. Seeking the best fit
          image via the comparison procedures, we can obtain the best-fit
          size  and  the best-fit lens model. We apply this method to the
          two-dimensional  spectroscopic  data of a famous lensed quasar,
          Q2237+0305.  If  the  lens  galaxy  resembles  the applied lens
          model,  an  upper  limit  to  the  NLR  size can be set 750 pc.
          Further, we examine how the fitting results will be improved by
          future   observations,   taking   into  account  the  realistic
          observational effects, such as seeing. Future observations will
          provide  us  more  stringent constraints on the size of the NLR
          and on the density profile of the lens galaxy.

          Comments: 4 page in emulate5.sty, 3 figures. accepted by ApJL
          It  has  long  been  believed  that accretion onto supermassive
          black  holes  powers quasars, but there has been relatively few
          observational  constraints  on the spins of the black holes. We
          address  this  problem  by  estimating  the  average  radiative
          efficiencies  of  a  large  sample of quasars selected from the
          Sloan   Digital  Sky  Survey,  by  combining  their  luminosity
          function  and their black hole mass function. Over the redshift
          interval   $0.4<z<2.1$,  we  find  that  quasars  have  average
          radiative efficiencies of $\sim 30% - 35%$, strongly suggesting
          that  their  black  holes are rotating very fast, with specific
          angular  momentum  $a  \approx 1$, which stays roughly constant
          with  redshift.  The  average  radiative  efficiency  could  be
          reduced  by  a  factor  of  $\sim$2,  depending  on the adopted
          zeropoint  for  the  black  hole mass scale. The inferred large
          spins  and their lack of significant evolution are in agreement
          with  the  predictions  of  recent  semi-analytical  models  of
          hierarchical galaxy formation if black holes gain most of their
          mass through accretion.

          in  the  proceedings  of"  Origin  of  Matter  and Evolution of
          Galaxies  - New Horizon of Nuclear Astrophysics and Cosmology",
          Ed.S.Kubono
          The  processes  governing  both  the formation and evolution of
          elliptical  galaxies are discussed by means of a new multi-zone
          photo-chemical  evolution model for elliptical galaxies, taking
          into  account  detailed  nucleosynthetic  yields, feedback from
          supernovae, Pop III stars and an initial infall episode.
          By  comparing  model predictions with observations, we derive a
          picture  of galaxy formation in which the higher is the mass of
          the  galaxy,  the shorter are the infall and the star formation
          timescales.  In  particular, by means of our model, we are able
          to  reproduce  the overabundance of Mg relative to Fe, observed
          in  the  nuclei  of  bright  ellipticals, and its increase with
          galactic mass.
          This is a clear sign of an anti-hierarchical formation process.
          Therefore, in this scenario, the most massive objects are older
          than  the  less massive ones, in the sense that larger galaxies
          stop forming stars at earlier times.
          Each  galaxy  is created outside-in, i.e. the outermost regions
          accrete  gas,  form  stars  and  develop  a  galactic wind very
          quickly,  compared  to  the  central  core  in  which  the star
          formation  can  last  up  to  ~1.3  Gyr.  This  finding will be
          discussed at the light of recent observations of the galaxy NGC
          4697  which  clearly  show a strong radial gradient in the mean
          stellar [<Mg/Fe>] ratio.
          The  role of galactic winds in the IGM/ICM enrichment will also
          be discussed.

          We  show  that  our  anti-hierarchical baryon collapse scenario
          (Granato  et  al.  2004) for the joint evolution of black holes
          and  host  galaxies  predicts  quasar  luminosity  functions at
          redshifts  1.5 < z < 6 and local demographic properties in nice
          agreement  with  observations. In our model the quasar activity
          marks and originates the transition between an earlier phase of
          violent   and   heavily   dust-enshrouded   starburst  activity
          promoting  rapid black hole growth, and a later phase of almost
          passive    evolution;    the    former   is   traced   by   the
          submillimeter-selected  sources,  while the latter accounts for
          the  high  number  density  of  massive galaxies at substantial
          redshifts z > 1.5, the population of Extremely Red Objects, and
          the properties of local ellipticals.

          Caribbean'' Workshop, St. John, USVI; 28 November - 2 December,
          2005; this http URL
          A  variety  of  investigations  have demonstrated commonalities
          between  the  Baldwin  (1977)  Effect,  the blueshifting of CIV
          emission  lines (e.g., Gaskell 1982; Richards et al. 2002), and
          the   L_UV-L_X  relationship  (e.g.,  Avni  &  Tananbaum  1982;
          Strateva et al. 2005; Steffen et al. 2006); indeed all three of
          these  observational  effects may be manifestations of the same
          underlying  (but  still uncertain) physics. This commonality is
          of  interest  to  investigations of accretion disk winds (e.g.,
          Murray  et  al.  1995;  Proga et al. 2000) from active galactic
          nuclei  (AGN)  as  there is evidence that broad absorption line
          quasars  (BALQSOs)  are  drawn  from a parent sample of quasars
          that  exhibit  larger  than average CIV blueshifts, weaker than
          average  CIV  emission  line  strengths, and bluer than average
          (intrinsic)  colors.  The  properties of the absorption troughs
          appear  to  be  dependent  upon  these  parameters. Thus, it is
          suggested that not all quasars will host bona-fide BAL troughs,
          but  that  all  (broad  emission line) quasars host outflows of
          some  type, the structure of which is strongly dependent on the
          quasar's spectral energy distribution.

          Title:  Discovery of an Extreme MeV Blazar with the Swift Burst
          Alert Telescope
          Authors: Rita M. Sambruna, et al
          Comments: ApJ, in press
          The  Burst  Alert Telescope (BAT) onboard Swift detected bright
          emission  from  15--195  keV from the source SWIFT~J0746.3+2548
          (J0746  in  the following), identified with the optically-faint
          (R  ~  19),  z=2.979  quasar  SDSS J074625.87+244901.2. Here we
          present  Swift and multiwavelength observations of this source.
          The  X-ray  emission  from  J0746  is variable on timescales of
          hours  to  weeks  in  0.5--8 keV and of a few months in 15--195
          keV,  but  there is no accompanying spectral variability in the
          0.5--8  keV  band. There is a suggestion that the BAT spectrum,
          initially  very  hard  (photon index Gamma ~ 0.7), steepened to
          Gamma  ~  1.3  in a few months, together with a decrease of the
          15--195  keV  flux by a factor ~ 2. The 0.5--8 keV continuum is
          well  described  by  a power law with Gamma ~ 1.3, and spectral
          flattening  below  1  keV.  The  latter can be described with a
          column  density  in excess of the Galactic value with intrinsic
          column density N_H^z ~ 10^22 cm-2, or with a flatter power law,
          implying  a  sharp (DeltaGamma >= 1) break across 16 keV in the
          quasar's  rest-frame. The Spectral Energy Distribution of J0746
          is  double-humped,  with  the  first  component  peaking  at IR
          wavelengths  and  the  second  component at MeV energies. These
          properties suggest that J0746 is a a blazar with high gamma-ray
          luminosity  and  low  peak  energy  (MeV) stretching the blazar
          sequence to an extreme.

          Title: Extended Lyman alpha emission around bright quasars
          Authors: L. Christensen, K. Jahnke, L. Wisotzki, S. F. Sanchez
          Comments: 15 pages, submitted to A&A
          Quasars trace the most massive structures at high redshifts and
          their  presence may influence the evolution of the massive host
          galaxies.  We  study  the  extended  Lyman  alpha emission line
          regions (EELRs) around seven bright, mostly radio-quiet quasars
          (QSOs) at 2.7<z<4.5, and compare luminosities with EELRs around
          radio-loud  QSOs  reported  in  the  literature. Using integral
          field spectroscopy, we analyse the morphology and kinematics of
          the  narrow Lya EELRs around the QSOs. We find evidence for the
          presence  of  EELRs  around four radio-quiet and one radio-loud
          QSO.  All  EELRs  appear asymmetric and the optically brightest
          QSOs also have the brightest Lya nebulae. For the two brightest
          nebulae  we  find  velocities  between  ~600 km s^-1 at the QSO
          position  to  ~200 km s^-1 at a distance of 3-4 arcsec from the
          QSO  and surface flux densities up to 2-3*10^-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1
          arcsec^-2.   The   five  EELRs  have  total  Lya  fluxes  which
          corresponds  to  ~1-2% of the flux from the QSOs within a 20 AA
          narrow-band  image  centered  on  Lya at the QSO redshift. This
          fraction  is an order of magnitude smaller than found for EELRs
          around   radio-loud,   steep  spectrum  QSOs  reported  in  the
          literature.  While the nebulae luminosities are correlated with
          the  QSO  luminosities  within  the 20 AA narrow-band image, we
          find  that  nebulae  luminosities  are  not correlated with the
          central  QSO  ionising fluxes. The presence of gas in the EELRs
          can  be  interpreted  based  on two competing scenarios: either
          from  quasar feedback mechanisms, or from infalling matter. The
          relatively  fainter nebulae around radio-quiet QSOs compared to
          lobe-dominated  radio-loud  QSOs  can  be  ascribed to enhanced
          emission  due  to  jet  interactions  in radio-loud QSOs, or to
          significant  differences  in  the  environments between the two
          classes (abridged).

          Title: Surface Tension and the Cosmological Constant
          Authors: Joseph Samuel, Supurna Sinha
          Comments: Dedicated to Rafael Sorkin on his 60th birthday
          Subj-class: Soft Condensed Matter
          The  astronomically observed value of the cosmological constant
          is small but non-zero. This raises two questions together known
          as the cosmological constant problem a) why is lambda so nearly
          zero?  b)  why  is lambda not EXACTLY zero? Sorkin has proposed
          that  b)  can  be naturally explained as a one by square root N
          fluctuation by invoking discreteness of spacetime at the Planck
          scale  due  to  quantum gravity. In this paper we shed light on
          these   questions   by   developing   an  analogy  between  the
          cosmological constant and the surface tension of membranes. The
          ``cosmological constant problem'' has a natural analogue in the
          membrane  context:  the  vanishingly  small  surface tension of
          fluid  membranes  provides  an  example where question a) above
          arises  and  is answered. We go on to find a direct analogue of
          Sorkin's  proposal  for  answering  question b) in the membrane
          context,  where  the  discreteness of spacetime translates into
          the   molecular   structure  of  matter.  We  propose  analogue
          experiments to probe a small and fluctuating surface tension in
          fluid  membranes.  A  counterpart of dimensional reduction a la
          Kaluza-Klein  and  large  extra  dimensions also appears in the
          physics of fluid membranes.

          Title: Mid-Infrared Spectral Diagnostics of Nearby Galaxies
          Authors: Daniel A. Dale, the SINGS Team
          Comments:  To appear in the proceedings of "The Spitzer Science
          Center   2005   Conference:   Infrared  Diagnostics  of  Galaxy
          Evolution", held in Pasadena, November 2005
          The  Spitzer  Space  Telescope is pushing into new frontiers in
          high  redshift  astronomy. Closer to home, Spitzer is making an
          equally  large  impact on our understanding of galaxy formation
          and  evolution.  In  this  contribution we present mid-infrared
          diagnostics  based  largely  on  data from the Spitzer Infrared
          Nearby  Galaxies  Survey (SINGS). Our main result is that these
          mid-infrared   diagnostics  effectively  constrain  a  target's
          dominant  power  source.  The  combination of a high ionization
          line index and PAH strength serves as an efficient discriminant
          between  AGN  and star-forming nuclei, confirming progress made
          with   ISO   spectroscopy  on  starbursting  and  ultraluminous
          infrared  galaxies.  The  sensitivity  of  Spitzer allows us to
          probe  fainter  nuclei  and  star-forming regions within galaxy
          disks.  We  find that both star-forming nuclei and extranuclear
          regions  stand apart from nuclei that are powered by Seyfert or
          LINER  activity.  In  fact,  we  identify  areas  within  three
          diagnostic  diagrams  containing  >90%  Seyfert/LINER nuclei or
          >90%  HII  regions/HII  nuclei.  We also find that, compared to
          starbursting  nuclei,  extranuclear  regions typically separate
          even   further   from   AGN,   especially  for  low-metallicity
          extranuclear   environments.   In   addition,  instead  of  the
          traditional  mid-infrared  approach  to differentiating between
          AGN  and  star-forming  sources  that  utilizes relatively weak
          high-ionization  lines,  we  show  that  strong  low-ionization
          cooling  lines  of  X-ray  dominated  regions like [SiII] 34.82
          micron can alternatively be used as excellent discrimants.

          Title:  A  62 Day X-Ray Periodicity and an X-Ray Flare from the
          Ultraluminous X-Ray Source in M82
          Authors: Philip Kaaret, Melanie G. Simet, Cornelia C. Lang
          Comments: 15 pages, one color figure, to appear in ApJ
          In  240  days of X-ray monitoring of M82, we have discovered an
          X-ray  periodicity  at  $62.0 \pm 2.5$ days with a peak to peak
          amplitude  corresponding  to  an  isotropic  luminosity of $2.4
          \times  10^{40}  \rm  erg  s^{-1}$  in  M82  and an X-ray flare
          reaching  a  peak  luminosity  of  $9.8  \times 10^{40} \rm erg
          s^{-1}$.  The  periodicity  and flare likely originate from the
          ultraluminous   X-ray  source  (ULX)  in  M82  which  has  been
          identified  as  a  possible  intermediate  mass  black hole. We
          suggest  that  the  62~day  modulation is due to orbital motion
          within  an X-ray binary with a Roche-lobe overflowing companion
          star  which  would  imply  that  the  average  density  of  the
          companion  star is near $5 \times 10^{-5} \rm g cm^{-3}$ and is
          therefore  a  giant  or  supergiant.  Chandra observations just
          after the flare show an energy spectrum that is consistent with
          a  power-law  with  no  evidence of a thermal component or line
          emission. Radio observations made with the VLA during the flare
          allow us to rule out a blazar identification for the source and
          place  strong  constraints on relativistically beamed models of
          the  X-ray  emission.  The Chandra observations reveal a second
          X-ray  source  reached  a  flux of $4.4 \times 10^{-12} \rm erg
          cm^{-2}  s^{-1}$  in  the  0.3-7 keV band which is dramatically
          higher  than  any  flux  previously  seen  from this source and
          corresponds  to  an isotropic luminosity of $1.1 \times 10^{40}
          \rm  erg  s^{-1}$.  This source is a second ultraluminous X-ray
          source  in  M82 and may give rise to the QPOs detected from the
          central region of M82.

          Title: The Global 21 Centimeter Background from High Redshifts
          Authors: Steven Furlanetto (Yale)
          Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  consider the evolution of the sky-averaged 21 cm background
          during  the  early  phases of structure formation. Using simple
          analytic  models,  we  calculate  the  thermal  and  ionization
          histories, assuming that stellar photons dominate the radiation
          background.  The  resulting  21  cm  spectra  can constrain the
          properties  of  the  first generations of stars and quasars. If
          Population  II stars dominate, Lyman-alpha coupling renders the
          IGM  visible  before  it  is  heated  by X-rays and long before
          reionization. Thus the 21 cm background has a strong absorption
          epoch   followed   by   weaker   emission   that  fades  during
          reionization. The harder spectra of very massive Population III
          stars  compress  these transitions into a shorter time interval
          and  decreases  the signal amplitude. However, the reionization
          epoch  will  remain visible except in extreme cases. The global
          21  cm  signal  will  be  challenging  to  observe  because  of
          astronomical foregrounds, but it offers an exciting opportunity
          to  study the first sources of light. It also fixes the overall
          amplitude  of  the  fluctuating background whose detection is a
          major  goal  of  several  next-generation  low-frequency  radio
          interferometers.

          Large  telescopes  have allowed astronomers to observe galaxies
          that  formed  as early as 850 million years after the Big Bang.
          We  predict  when the first galaxy that astronomers can observe
          formed  in  the universe, accounting for the first time for the
          size  of  the universe and for three essential ingredients: the
          light  travel  time  from distant galaxies, Poisson and density
          fluctuations on all scales, and the effect of very early cosmic
          history  on galaxy formation. We find that the first observable
          star  is  most likely to have formed 30 million years after the
          Big  Bang  (at  redshift  65),  much  earlier  than  previously
          expected.  Also,  the  first galaxy as massive as our own Milky
          Way  likely  formed  when the universe was only 400 Myr old. We
          also  show  that  significant  modifications  are  required  in
          current  methods of numerically simulating the formation of the
          first galaxies.

          2005
          One  of  the main questions of galaxy formation is how and when
          galaxies  assembled  their mass. Observations suggest that most
          mass assembly and star formation occured at 1 < z < 3. However,
          in  the  same  redshift  range, fully assembled old and massive
          galaxies  co-exist  with  star-bursting  systems still in their
          assembling  stage. In order to explore galaxy evolution in this
          critical  redshift  range,  we  started  a project called GMASS
          (Galaxy Mass Assembly ultra-deep Spectroscopic Survey) based on
          an  145  hours  ESO  Large Program and aimed at doing ultradeep
          spectroscopy with the VLT of a sample of high redshift galaxies
          slected  with  IRAC/Spitzer  m(4.5mu) < 23, z(phot) > 1.4) from
          the  GOODS-South/HUDF  region.  The  selection at 4.5 micron is
          crucial  to  select high redshift galaxies based on the stellar
          mass  or  objects  affected  by  strong  dust  extinction.  The
          spectroscopic deep integration times (15 - 50 hours) are needed
          to  identify  unambiguously  the  redshift  and nature of these
          galaxies,  which  redshifts  are  mostly  in the "desert" where
          spectroscopy  is  traditionally difficult due to the absence of
          strong  emission  lines  at  optical wavelengths. The survey is
          almost  complete  and  some  preliminary  results are presented
          here.

          Title:  B  polarization  of  cosmic  microwave  background as a
          tracer of strings
          Authors: Uros Seljak, Anze Slosar
          Comments: 6 pages, 1 figure, 1 table
          String  models can produce successful inflationary scenarios in
          the  context  of  brane  collisions and in many of these models
          cosmic  strings  may  also  be  produced.  In scenarios such as
          KKLMMT  the  string  contribution  is naturally predicted to be
          well   below  the  inflationary  signal  for  cosmic  microwave
          background  (CMB)  temperature  anisotropies, in agreement with
          the  existing limits. We find that for $B$ type polarization of
          CMB  the  situation  is  reversed and the dominant signal comes
          from  vector  modes  generated by cosmic strings, which exceeds
          the  gravity  wave  signal from both inflation and strings. The
          signal  can  be  detected for a broad range of parameter space:
          future  polarization  experiments  may  be  able  to detect the
          string  signal  down  to  the  string  tension  $G\mu=10^{-9}$,
          although  foregrounds  and  lensing  are likely to worsen these
          limits.  We  argue  that  the  optimal  scale to search for the
          string signature is at $\ell\sim 1000$, but in models with high
          optical depth the signal from reionization peak at large scales
          is also significant. The shape of the power spectrum allows one
          to distinguish the string signature from the gravity waves from
          inflation, but only with a sufficiently high angular resolution
          experiment

          We  report  an extensive search for Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs)
          at z=6.5 in the Subaru Deep Field. Subsequent spectroscopy with
          Subaru/Keck identified eight more LAEs, giving us a total of 17
          spectroscopically  confirmed  LAEs  at z=6.5. Based on these 17
          spectroscopic sample complemented by the 58 photometric sample,
          we derived a more accurate Ly-alpha luminosity function of LAEs
          at  z=6.5,  that reveals an apparent deficit at the bright end,
          of  ~0.75  mag  fainter  L*,  compared  with that of z=5.7. The
          difference  of LAE luminosity functions between z=5.7 and z=6.5
          has  a  3-sigma  significance, which is reduced to 2-sigma when
          taking  into  account the cosmic variance. This result could be
          an  implication  that  the reionization of the universe has not
          been  completed  at  z=6.5. The spatial distribution of LAEs at
          z=6.5  was  found  to be homogeneous over the field. We discuss
          some implications to the reionization of the universe.

          Title:  A  Strong  X-Ray  Flux  Ratio  Anomaly in the Quadruply
          Lensed Quasar PG 1115+080

          Comments: submitted to ApJ
          PG  1115+080 is a quadruply lensed quasar at z=1.72 whose image
          positions  are well fit by simple models of the lens galaxy (at
          z=0.31).  At  optical  wavelengths,  the  bright  close pair of
          images  exhibits  a  modest  flux  ratio  anomaly  (factors  of
          ~1.2-1.4  over  the  past  22 years) with respect to these same
          models.  We  show here that as observed in X-rays with Chandra,
          the flux ratio anomaly is far more extreme, roughly a factor of
          6.  The  contrasting  flux  ratio  anomalies in the optical and
          X-ray  band confirm the microlensing hypothesis and set a lower
          limit on the size of the optical continuum emission region that
          is  \~10-100  times  larger than expected from a thin accretion
          disk model.

          Title:  Simulations  and Analytic Calculations of Bubble Growth
          During Hydrogen Reionization
          Authors:  Oliver  Zahn,  Adam  Lidz,  Matthew McQuinn, Suvendra
          Dutta, Lars Hernquist, Matias Zaldarriaga, Steven R. Furlanetto
          Comments: 15 pages, 11 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  present  results from a large volume simulation of Hydrogen
          reionization. We combine 3d radiative transfer calculations and
          an  N-body  simulation,  describing  structure formation in the
          IGM,  to  detail the growth of HII regions around high redshift
          galaxies.  Our  simulation tracks 1024^3 dark matter particles,
          in a box of side length 65.6 Mpc/h. This large volume allows us
          to accurately characterize the size distribution of HII regions
          throughout  most of the reionization process. At the same time,
          our  simulation  resolves  many  of  the  small galaxies likely
          responsible for reionization. It confirms a picture anticipated
          by  analytic  models:  HII  regions  grow  collectively  around
          highly-clustered    sources,    and    have    a   well-defined
          characteristic  size,  evolving  from  a  sub-Mpc  scale at the
          beginning  of  reionization  to  R>10  Mpc  towards the end. We
          present  a detailed statistical description of our results, and
          compare  them  with  a  numerical  hybrid  scheme  based on the
          analytic  model  by  Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga, and Hernquist. We
          find   that   the  analytic  calculation  reproduces  the  size
          distribution  of  HII  regions, and the 21 cm power spectrum of
          the   radiative   transfer   simulation  remarkably  well.  The
          ionization  field  from the simulation, however, has more small
          scale structure than the analytic calculation, owing to Poisson
          scatter in the simulated abundance of galaxies on small scales.
          We  validate  a  simple scheme to incorporate this scatter into
          our   calculations.   Our   results   suggest   that   analytic
          calculations are sufficiently accurate to aid in predicting and
          interpreting   the   results   of  future  21  cm  surveys.  In
          particular, our fast numerical scheme is useful for forecasting
          constraints from future 21 cm surveys, and in constructing mock
          surveys to test data analysis procedures.

          We  present  new  X-ray  and  optical  spectroscopy of a Type 2
          quasar  candidate  selected  from  a follow-up program of hard,
          optically-dim,  serendipitous  Chandra  sources.  The source is
          confirmed  to  be  a Type 2 quasar at z=0.536 with an intrinsic
          2-10  keV  luminosity L_{2-10}=5x10^{44} h_{0.7}^{-2} erg/s, an
          absorbing column density N_H=8x10^{23} cm^{-2} and a neutral Fe
          K  alpha  line  detected  by  XMM-Newton  EPIC-MOS1  as well as
          Chandra  ACIS-S.  An  extended  optical forbidden emission line
          cloud  is detected at the same redshift, and at about 15 kpc in
          projected separation. This cloud lies in close proximity to the
          peak of the compact steep spectrum radio source 4C+39.29, which
          has  previously been identified with a foreground galaxy in the
          cluster Abell 963. We present evidence to show that 4C+39.29 is
          associated  with  the background X-ray Type 2 quasar. The radio
          luminosity is dominated by lobes with complex structure and the
          radio  core is weak in comparison to narrow-line radio galaxies
          at  the same X-ray luminosity. The morphology and emission line
          properties  of  the  extended  region  are  consistent  with an
          on-going    jet-cloud   interaction.   4C+39.29   possesses   a
          combination  of  high  power  and high absorbing column density
          compared  with  other  X-ray  Type 2 quasars in the literature.
          These  observations  highlight  the efficacy of using X-rays to
          identify the primary energy source of complex radio sources and
          distant obscured AGN.

          Title: Feedback from Clustered Sources During Reionization
          Authors:  Roban  Hultman  Kramer,  Zoltan Haiman (Columbia), S.
          Peng Oh (UCSB)
          Comments: submitted to ApJ, 9 emulateapj pages with 7 figures
          The  reionization  history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at
          high  redshift  (z  >  6) was likely strongly shaped by several
          global   feedback  processes.  Because  the  earliest  ionizing
          sources  formed  at  the  locations  of the rare density peaks,
          their  spatial  distribution  was  strongly  clustered. Here we
          demonstrate  that  this  clustering  significantly  boosts  the
          impact  of  feedback  processes  operating at high redshift. We
          build   a   semi-analytical   model  to  include  feedback  and
          clustering   simultaneously,   and  apply  this  model  to  the
          suppression    of    star-formation   in   minihalos   due   to
          photoionization.  The model is built on the excursion-set-based
          formalism  of  Furlanetto,  Zaldarriaga  and  Hernquist (2004),
          which  incorporates  the  clustering  of  ionizing sources, and
          which  we  here extend to include suppression of star formation
          in  minihalos.  We  find that clustering increases the mean HII
          bubble  size  by  a  factor  of  several,  and  it dramatically
          increases  the  fraction of minihalos that are suppressed, by a
          factor   of  up  to  60  relative  to  a  randomly  distributed
          population.  This enhanced suppression can significantly reduce
          the  electron  scattering  optical  depth,  as  required by the
          three-year  data  from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
          (WMAP).  We argue that source clustering is likely to similarly
          boost the importance of a variety of other feedback mechanisms.

          Title: The 21 Centimeter Forest
          Authors: Steven Furlanetto (Yale)
          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  examine  the  prospects  for  studying the pre-reionization
          intergalactic  medium  (IGM) through the so-called 21 cm forest
          in  spectra  of  bright  high-redshift  radio sources. We first
          compute the evolution of the mean optical depth for models that
          include   X-ray   heating  of  the  IGM  gas,  Wouthuysen-Field
          coupling,  and reionization. Under most circumstances, the spin
          temperature  T_S grows large well before reionization begins in
          earnest.  As  a  result,  the  optical depth is less than 0.001
          throughout  most  of  reionization, and background sources must
          sit well beyond the reionization surface in order to experience
          measurable  absorption.  HII  regions  produce relatively large
          "transmission  gaps"  and  may  therefore  still  be observable
          during the early stages of reionization. Absorption from sheets
          and  filaments  in  the cosmic web fades once T_S becomes large
          and  should  be rare during reionization. Minihalos can produce
          strong  (albeit  narrow)  absorption  features. Measuring their
          abundance would yield useful limits on the strength of feedback
          processes in the IGM as well as their effect on reionization.

          2005
          We  present the results of a comprehensive Spitzer survey of 70
          radio galaxies across 1<z<5.2. Using IRAC, IRS and MIPS imaging
          we  determine  the  rest-frame  AGN contribution to the stellar
          emission  peak  at 1.6um. The stellar luminosities are found to
          be  consistent  with  that of a giant elliptical with a stellar
          mass of 10^11-12Msun. The mean stellar mass remains constant at
          \~10^11.5Msun  up  to  z=3 indicating that the upper end of the
          mass  function is already in place by this redshift. The mid-IR
          luminosities   imply  bolometric  IR  luminosities  that  would
          classify  all sources as ULIRGs. The mid-IR to radio luminosity
          generally   correlate   implying  a  common  origin  for  these
          emissions.  The  ratio  is  higher  than  that  found for lower
          redshift, ie z<1, radio galaxies.

          We  investigate the role of the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG)
          and  ultra-luminous  infrared  galaxy  (ULIRG)  phases  in  the
          evolution of Ks-selected galaxies and, in particular, Extremely
          Red  Galaxies  (ERGs). With this aim, we compare the properties
          of  a  sample  of  2905  Ks<21.5  (Vega  mag)  galaxies  in the
          GOODS/CDFS  with  the sub-sample of those 696 sources which are
          detected  at  24  microns. We find that LIRGs constitute 30% of
          the  galaxies  with  stellar mass M>1x10^{11} Msun assembled at
          redshift   z=0.5.  A  minimum  of  65%  of  the  galaxies  with
          M>2.5x10^{11}  Msun at z~2-3 are ULIRGs at those redshifts. 60%
          of  the ULIRGs in our sample have the characteristic colours of
          ERGs.   Conversely,   40%   of   the  ERGs  with  stellar  mass
          M>1.3x10^{11}  Msun  at 1.5<z<2.0 and a minimum of 52% of those
          with  the  same  mass  cut at 2.0<z<3.0 are ULIRGs. The average
          optical/near-IR  properties  of  the  massive  ERGs  at similar
          redshifts that are identified with ULIRGs and that are not have
          basically  no  difference,  suggesting  that  both  populations
          contain  the  same kind of objects in different phases of their
          lives.
          LIRGs and ULIRGs have an important role in galaxy evolution and
          mass  assembly,  and,  although  they  are only able to trace a
          fraction  of the massive (M>1x10^{11} Msun) galaxies present in
          the  Universe  at  a  given  time,  this  fraction becomes very
          significant (>50%) at redshifts z>~2.

          Implications for the Sources of Cosmic Reionization

          Comments: Submitted to ApJ, 31 pages
          We present a new measurement of the integrated stellar mass per
          comoving  volume  at  redshift 5 determined via spectral energy
          fitting  drawn  from  a  sample of 214 photometrically-selected
          galaxies  with z'<26.5 in the southern GOODS field. We estimate
          stellar  masses  for various sub-samples for which reliable and
          unconfused   Spitzer   IRAC   detections   are   available.   A
          spectroscopic  sample  of  14 of the most luminous sources with
          <z>=4.92 provides a firm lower limit of 2e6 Msun/Mpc^3. We then
          consider  a  larger  sample  whose photometric redshifts in the
          publicly-available   GOODS-MUSIC   catalog  lie  in  the  range
          4.4<z<5.6.  After  excising  probable  stellar contaminants and
          using  the  z'-J  color to exclude any remaining foreground red
          galaxies, we conclude that 153 sources are likely to be at z~5.
          The  implied  mass density from the unconfused IRAC fraction of
          this  sample, scaled to the total available, is 7e6 Msun/Mpc^3.
          We  discuss the likelihood that we have underestimated the true
          mass density. Including fainter and quiescent sources the total
          integrated  density  could be as high as 2e7 Msun/Mpc^3. Such a
          high  mass  density  only  1.2  Gyr  after  the  Big  Bang  has
          interesting  consequences  for  the  implied  past average star
          formation  during  the  period  when cosmic reionization is now
          thought to have taken place. Using the currently available (but
          highly uncertain) rate of decline in the star formation history
          over  5<z<10,  it is only possible to account for the assembled
          mass  at  z~5  by  appealing  to significant dust extinction at
          early  times or extending the luminosity function to very faint
          limits.  As mass density estimates improve at z~5-6, our method
          is  likely  to  provide  one of the tightest constraints on the
          question  of  whether star forming sources were responsible for
          reionizing the Universe. [abridged]

          We  show  that  the algorithm based on the weighted essentially
          nonoscillatory   (WENO)   scheme   with   anti-diffusive   flux
          corrections  can  be used as a solver of the radiative transfer
          equations.  This  algorithm  is  highly  stable  and robust for
          solving  problems with both discontinuities and smooth solution
          structures.  We  test  this code with the ionized sphere around
          point  sources.  It  shows  that the WENO scheme can reveal the
          discontinuity  of  the  radiative or ionizing fronts as well as
          the  evolution  of photon frequency spectrum with high accuracy
          on  coarse  meshes  and  for  a very wide parameter space. This
          method  would  be  useful  to  study the details of the ionized
          patch  given by individual source in the epoch of reionization.
          We  demonstrate this method by calculating the evolution of the
          ionized  sphere  around point sources in physical and frequency
          spaces.  It  shows  that the profile of the fraction of neutral
          hydrogen  and  the  ionized radius are sensitively dependent on
          the intensity of the source.

          Title: Dynamical Masses in Luminous Infrared Galaxies
          Authors:  Joannah  L.  Hinz,  George  H.  Rieke  (University of
          Arizona)
          Comments: 14 pages, 2 figures, accepted to ApJ
          We  have  studied  the  dynamics  and masses of a sample of ten
          nearby  luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGS and
          ULIRGs),  using  2.3 micron CO absorption line spectroscopy and
          near-infrared  H-  and  Ks-band  imaging. By combining velocity
          dispersions  derived  from the spectroscopy, disk scale-lengths
          obtained  from  the  imaging, and a set of likely model density
          profiles,  we calculate dynamical masses for each LIRG. For the
          majority  of  the sample, it is difficult to reconcile our mass
          estimates with the large amounts of gas derived from millimeter
          observations and from a standard conversion between CO emission
          and  H_2  mass.  Our  results imply that LIRGs do not have huge
          amounts of molecular gas (10^10-10^11 Msolar) at their centers,
          and  support  previous indications that the standard conversion
          of  CO  to H_2 probably overestimates the gas masses and cannot
          be  used in these environments. This in turn suggests much more
          modest levels of extinction in the near-infrared for LIRGs than
          previously predicted (A_V~10-20 versus A_V~100-1000). The lower
          gas mass estimates indicated by our observations imply that the
          star  formation efficiency in these systems is very high and is
          triggered  by  cloud-cloud collisions, shocks, and winds rather
          than by gravitational instabilities in circumnuclear gas disks.

          We  used  the  photometric  database  of  the Sloan Digital Sky
          Survey  (SDSS)  to  estimate  the  reddening of 13 SDSS quasars
          selected  on the basis of the presence of zinc absorption lines
          in  an  intervening Damped Ly alpha (DLA) system. In 5 of these
          quasars  the reddening is detected at ~2 sigma confidence level
          in  two independent color indices of the SDSS ugriz photometric
          system.  A  detailed analysis of the data supports an origin of
          the  reddening in the intervening absorbers. We used these rare
          measurements of extinction in DLA systems to probe the relation
          between  extinction and metal column density in the interval of
          absorption  redshift  0.7  </~ z </~ 2.0. We find that the mean
          extinction  in  the  V  band  per  atom  of iron in the dust is
          remarkably  similar to that found in interstellar clouds of the
          Milky  Way.  This result lends support to previous estimates of
          the dust obscuration effect in DLA systems based on a Milky Way
          extinction/metal  column  density relation. We propose a simple
          mechanism,    based   on   dust   grain   destruction/accretion
          properties,  which may explain the approximate constancy of the
          extinction per atom of iron in the dust.

          We  study  the  constraints  that  future multifrequency Cosmic
          Microwave  Background  (CMB) experiments will be able to set on
          the  metal  enrichment  history of the Inter Galactic Medium at
          the  epoch  of  reionisation.  We  forecast the signal to noise
          ratio  for the detection of the signal introduced in the CMB by
          resonant  scattering off metals at the end of the Dark Ages. We
          take  into  account  systematics  associated  to  inter-channel
          calibration,   PSF   reconstruction   errors   and   innacurate
          foreground  removal.  We  develop  an  algorithm  to  optimally
          extract  the signal generated by metals during reionisation and
          to  remove  accurately  the  contamination  due  to the thermal
          Sunyaev-Zel'dovich   effect.   Although   demanding  levels  of
          foreground  characterisation  and  control  of  systematics are
          required,  they  are  very  distinct  from those encountered in
          HI-21cm  studies and CMB polarization, and this fact encourages
          the  study  of resonant scattering off metals as an alternative
          way  of  conducting  tomography  of  the reionisation epoch. An
          ACT-like  experiment  with  optimistic assumtions on systematic
          effects,  and  looking  at clean regions of the sky, can detect
          changes  of  3%-12%  (95%  c.l.)  of  the  OIII abundance (with
          respect  its solar value) in the redshift range $z\in$ [12,22],
          for reionization redshift $z_{\rm re}>10$. However, for $z_{\rm
          re}  <10$,  it  can  only  set  upper  limits  on NII abundance
          increments  of $\sim$ 60% its solar value in the redshift range
          $z\in$  [5.5,9],  (95%  c.l.).  These  constraints  assume that
          inter-channel  calibration  is  accurate  down  to  one part in
          $10^{4}$,   which   constitutes  the  most  critical  technical
          requirement  of  this method, but still achievable with current
          technology.

          hole-bulge relation self-regulated?
          Authors: P. Monaco (DAUT - University of Trieste and INAF-OATs)
          Comments:  8  pages,  3  postscript figures, proceedings of the
          Workshop  on  "AGN  and  galaxy  evolution",  Specola Vaticana,
          Castel Gandolfo, Italy, 3-6 October 2005
          We  discuss  the role of feedback from AGNs on the formation of
          spheroidal  galaxies. The energy released by an accreting Black
          Hole  (BH)  may  be  injected  into the ISM through blast waves
          arising directly from the central engine, radiation pressure or
          radiative  heating.  A scenario is described in which radiative
          heating  perturbs  the  methabolism of a star-forming spheroid,
          leading  to  a  critical  stage where SNe form a cold expanding
          shell,  pushed out of the galaxy by radiation pressure from the
          AGN.  This mechanism can regulate the BH--bulge relation to the
          observed  value. However, this relation may be simply imprinted
          by  the  mechanism  responsible for the nearly complete loss of
          angular  momentum of the gas that accretes onto the BH. Using a
          novel  model  of  galaxy  formation that includes AGNs, we show
          that   models   without   self-regulation   have   problems  in
          reproducing  the  correct slope of the AGN luminosity function,
          while  models  with  winds give a much better fit; however, all
          these  models  are  almost  indistingishable  as  far  as their
          predicted  BH--bulge  relation  is  concerned. Finally, we show
          that  the  downsizing  of  the faint AGNs is most likely due to
          kinetic feedback in star-forming bulges.

          Comments: 12 pages, 9 Figures. Accepted to ApJ April 11, 2006
          As large optical quasar surveys for damped Lya become a reality
          and  the  study  of  star  forming  gas  in  the early Universe
          achieves  statistical  robustness,  it is now vital to identify
          and  quantify  the  sources  of  systematic  error. Because the
          nature   of   optically-selected   quasar  surveys  makes  them
          vulnerable   to   dust   obscuration,   we  have  undertaken  a
          radio-selected  quasar survey for damped Lya systems to address
          this  bias.  We  present  the  definition  and  results of this
          survey.  We  then combine our sample with the CORALS dataset to
          investigate the HI column density distribution function f(N) of
          damped  Lya systems toward radio-selected quasars. We find that
          f(N)  is well fit by a power-law f(N) = k_1 N^alpha_1, with log
          k_1 = 22.90 and alpha_1 = -2.18. This power-law is in excellent
          agreement with that of optically-selected samples at low N(HI),
          an  important yet expected result given that obscuration should
          have  negligible  effect at these gas columns. However, because
          of  the  relatively small size of the radio-selected sample, 26
          damped Lya systems in 119 quasars, f(N) is not well constrained
          at  large  N(HI)  and  the  first moment of the HI distribution
          function,  Omega_g,  is,  strictly speaking, a lower limit. The
          power-law  is  steep  enough, however, that extrapolating it to
          higher  column  densities  implies  only  a modest, logarithmic
          increase in Omega_g. The radio-selected value of Omega_g = 1.15
          x  10^-3,  agrees  well  with the results of optically-selected
          surveys.  While  our  results indicate that dust obscuration is
          likely  not a major issue for surveys of damped Lya systems, we
          estimate  that  a  radio-selected  sample  of approximately 100
          damped  Lya  systems  will  be required to obtain the precision
          necessary to absolutely confirm an absence of dust bias.

          Title:  Cosmological  parameters from combining the Lyman-alpha
          forest with CMB, galaxy clustering and SN constraints
          Authors: Uros Seljak, Anze Slosar, Patrick McDonald
          Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures
          We  combine  the  Ly-alpha forest power spectrum (LYA) from the
          Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS) and high resolution spectra
          with  the  cosmic  microwave  background (CMB) including 3-year
          WMAP,  supernovae  (SN)  and  galaxy  clustering constraints to
          derive new constraints on cosmological parameters. The existing
          LYA  power  spectrum analysis is supplemented by constraints on
          the  mean  flux  decrement  derived using a principal component
          analysis   for   quasar   continua,   which  improves  the  LYA
          constraints on the linear power. The joint analysis reduces the
          errors  on  all parameters and prefers the simplest 6 parameter
          cosmological  model. We find some tension between the WMAP3 and
          LYA  power spectrum amplitudes, at the ~2 sigma level, which is
          partially alleviated by the inclusion of other observations: we
          find  sigma_8=0.85+-0.02 compared to sigma_8=0.80+-0.03 without
          LYA.  For  the  slope  we  find  n_s=0.965+-0.012.  We  find no
          evidence   for   running   of   the   spectral   index,  dn/dln
          k=-0.020+-0.012, in agreement with inflation. The limits on the
          sum    of   neutrino   masses   are   significantly   improved:
          sum(m_nu)<0.17 eV at 95% (<0.32 eV at 99.9%). This result, when
          combined   with   atmospheric   and   solar   neutrino   mixing
          constraints,  requires  that  the  neutrino  masses  cannot  be
          degenerate,  m_3/m_1>1.3  (95%).  Assuming a thermalized fourth
          neutrino  we  find  m_s<0.14  eV  at 95% c.l. and such neutrino
          cannot  be an explanation for the LSND results. The fit is poor
          even  in  the  limit  of  massless  sterile  neutrino since the
          constraint  on  the  number of relativistic neutrino species is
          N_nu=3.19+0.19-0.15  and  N_nu>4  is  excluded  at  99.76%. The
          constraint   on   the   dark   energy   equation  of  state  is
          w=-1.04+-0.06.     The     constraint     on    curvature    is
          Omega_k=-0.003+-0.006. Cosmic strings limits are G mu<2.3 10^-7
          at 95% c.l.

          Title: A photon breeding mechanism for the high-energy emission
          of relativistic jets
          Authors: Boris E. Stern, Juri Poutanen
          Comments: 11 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  propose  a  straightforward and efficient mechanism for the
          high-energy   emission   of   relativistic  astrophysical  jets
          associated  with an exchange of interacting high-energy photons
          between  the  jet  and external environment. Physical processes
          playing  the  main role in this mechanism are electron-positron
          pair  production by photons and the inverse Compton scattering.
          This  scenario  has  been  studied analytically as well as with
          numerical  simulations  demonstrating  that  a relativistic jet
          moving  through  the  sufficiently  dense  soft radiation field
          inevitably  undergoes transformation into a luminous state. The
          process  has a supercritical character: the high-energy photons
          breed  exponentially  being  fed  directly  by the bulk kinetic
          energy  of the jet. Eventually particles feed back on the fluid
          dynamics  and  the  jet  partially  decelerates. As a result, a
          significant  fraction  (at  least  10--20  per cent) of the jet
          kinetic energy is converted into radiation mainly in the MeV --
          GeV  energy range. The mechanism maybe responsible for the bulk
          of the emission of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei,
          microquasars and gamma-ray bursts.

          Comments:   Accepted   for  publication  in  The  Astrophysical
          Journal; 25 pages; 11 figures
          We  present  a detailed analysis of the XMM-Newton long-look of
          the  Seyfert galaxy IC 4329a. The Fe K bandpass is dominated by
          two  resolved  peaks  at  6.4  keV and 7.0 keV, consistent with
          neutral  or  near-neutral Fe K alpha and K beta emission. There
          is  a  prominent  redward  asymmetry in the 6.4 keV line, which
          could indicate emission from a Compton shoulder. Alternatively,
          models  using dual relativistic disklines are found to describe
          the     emission     profile     well.    A    low-inclination,
          moderately-relativistic  dual-diskline model is possible if the
          contribution  from  narrow components, due to distant material,
          is small or absent. A high-inclination, moderately relativistic
          profile  for  each  peak is possible if there are roughly equal
          contributions  from  both  the  broad  and  narrow  components.
          Combining  the  XMM-Newton  data  with RXTE monitoring data, we
          explore the time-resolved spectral behavior on time scales from
          hours to 2 years. We find no strong evidence for variability of
          the Fe K line flux on any time scale, likely due to the minimal
          level   of   continuum   variability.   We   detect,   at  high
          significance,  a  narrow  absorption  line  at  7.68  keV. This
          feature  is  most  likely  due  to  Fe  XXVI K alpha absorption
          blueshifted  to  about  0.1c relative to the systemic velocity,
          suggesting  a  high-velocity, highly-ionized outflow component.
          As   is   often   the   case  with  similar  outflows  seen  in
          high-luminosity  quasars, the power associated with the outflow
          represents  a substantial portion of the total energy budget of
          the AGN. The outflow could arise from a radiatively-driven disk
          wind, or it may be in the form of a discrete, transient blob of
          ejected material.

          Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  examine  the  effect  of  inhomogeneous reionization on the
          galaxy  power  spectrum  and  the consequences for probing dark
          energy.  To  model  feedback  during  reionization, we apply an
          ansatz  setting  the  galaxy  overdensity  proportional  to the
          underlying  ionization  field. Thus, inhomogeneous reionization
          may  leave  an  imprint in the galaxy power spectrum. We evolve
          this   imprint  to  low  redshift  and  use  the  Fisher-matrix
          formalism to assess the effect on parameter estimation. We show
          that  a  combination  of  low- (z=0.3) and high- (z=3) redshift
          galaxy  surveys  can  constrain  the  size  of cosmological HII
          regions  during  reionization.  This  imprint  can  also  cause
          confusion  when  using baryon oscillations or other features of
          the  galaxy  power  spectrum  to probe the dark energy. We show
          that  when bubbles are large, and hence detectable, our ability
          to  constrain  w can be degraded by up to 50%. When bubbles are
          small,  the  imprint  has  little  or  no  effect  on measuring
          dark-energy parameters.

          We  construct  star  formation histories at redshifts z > 5 for
          two  physically  distinct populations of primordial, metal-free
          stars,  motivated  by  theoretical  and observational arguments
          that  have  hinted  towards  the  existence  of an intermediate
          stellar  generation between Population III and Population I/II.
          Taking  into  account  the  cosmological parameters as recently
          revised  by  WMAP  after three years of operation, we determine
          self-consistent   reionization   histories   and   discuss  the
          resulting   chemical   enrichment   from  these  early  stellar
          generations.  We  find  that  the  bulk of ionizing photons and
          heavy  elements produced at high redshifts must have originated
          in Population II.5 stars, which formed out of primordial gas in
          haloes  with  virial  temperatures  >=  10^4 K, and had typical
          masses  >=  10 M_sun. Classical Population III stars, formed in
          minihaloes  and  having masses >= 100 M_sun, on the other hand,
          had  only  a  minor  impact  on  reionization  and  early metal
          enrichment.  Specifically, we find that only 5 - 10 per cent by
          mass went into Population III star formation.

          Title:  Strange  magnification  pattern in the large separation
          lens SDSS J1004+4112 from optical to X-rays
          Authors: G. Lamer, A. Schwope, L. Wisotzki, L. Christensen

          Astronomy & Astrophysics
          We present simultaneous XMM-Newton UV and X-ray observations of
          the   quadruply   lensed  quasar  SDSS  J1004+4112  (RBS  825).
          Simultaneously   with   the  XMM-Newton  observations  we  also
          performed  integral  field spectroscopy on the two closest lens
          images  A  and  B  using  the  Calar Alto PMAS spectrograph. In
          X-rays  the  widely  spaced  components  C  and  D  are clearly
          resolved, while the closer pair of images A and B is marginally
          resolved  in  the XMM-EPIC images. The integrated X-ray flux of
          the system has decreased by a factor of 6 since it was observed
          in  the  ROSAT All Sky Survey in 1990, while the X-ray spectrum
          became  much  harder  with  the  power  law index evolving from
          Gamma=-2.3  to  -1.86.  By  deblending  the X-ray images of the
          lensed  QSO we find that the X-ray flux ratios between the lens
          images   A   and   B   are  significantly  different  from  the
          simultaneously  obtained  UV  ratios  and  previously  measured
          optical flux ratios. Our optical spectrum of lens image A shows
          an  enhancement in the blue emission line wings, which has been
          observed  in previous epochs as a transient feature. We propose
          a  scenario where intrinsic UV and X-ray variability gives rise
          to  line  variations which are selectively magnified in image A
          by  microlensing.  The extended emission of the lensing cluster
          of  galaxies is clearly detected in the EPIC images, we measure
          a 0.5-2.0 keV luminosity of 1.4 E44 erg/s. Based on the cluster
          X-ray properties, we estimate a mass of 2-6 E14 solar masses.

          Title:   A   population   of  high-redshift  type-2  quasars-I.
          Selection Criteria and Optical Spectra
          Authors:  Alejo  Martinez-Sansigre,  Steve Rawlings, Mark Lacy,
          Dario  Fadda,  Matt  J.  Jarvis,  Francine  R.  Marleau,  Chris
          Simpson, Chris J. Willott
          Comments: 22 Pages, 12 Figures
          We  discuss  the  relative  merits  of  mid-infrared  and X-ray
          selection  of  type-2  quasars.  We  describe the mid-infrared,
          near-infrared  and  radio  selection  criteria  used  to find a
          population  of  redshift z~2 type-2 quasars which we previously
          argued suggests that most supermassive black hole growth in the
          Universe  is  obscured  (Martinez-Sansigre  et  al.,  2005). We
          present  the optical spectra obtained from the William Herschel
          Telescope,  and we compare the narrow emission line luminosity,
          radio  luminosity  and maximum size of jets to those of objects
          from  radio-selected samples. This analysis suggests that these
          are genuine radio-quiet type-2 quasars, albeit the radio-bright
          end  of this population. We also discuss the possibility of two
          different  types of quasar obscuration, which could explain how
          the  ~3:1  ratio  of  type-2  to  type-1  quasars  preferred by
          modelling  our population can be reconciled with the ~1:1 ratio
          predicted by unified schemes.

          Title: Magnetic Jets from Swirling Disks
          Authors: D. Lynden-Bell
          Comments: 23 pages, 7 figures. To be published in MNRAS
          A broad swathe of astrophysical phenomena, ranging from tubular
          planetary nebulae through Herbig-Haro objects, radio-galaxy and
          quasar  emissions  to  gamma-ray bursts and perhaps high-energy
          cosmic  rays,  may  be  driven  by  magnetically-dominated jets
          emanating  from  accretion  disks.  We  give  a  self-contained
          account of the analytic theory of non-relativistic magnetically
          dominated  jets  wound  up  by  a  swirling  disk  and making a
          magnetic  cavity  in  a  background  medium  of  any prescribed
          pressure,  p(z).  We  solve  the time-dependent problem for any
          specified  distribution  of  magnetic flux P(R,0) emerging from
          the  disk  at  z=0,  with  any  specified disk angular velocity
          Omega_d(R).  The  physics required to do this involves only the
          freezing of the lines of force to the conducting medium and the
          principle of minimum energy.

          Submitted to MNRAS April 7th 2006
          We  describe the goals, design, and implementation of the UKIRT
          Infrared  Deep  Sky  Survey  (UKIDSS),  a seven year sky survey
          which  began  in  May  2005.  It  is a portfolio of five survey
          components  covering  various  combinations  of  the filter set
          ZYJHK  and  H_2.  The  Large  Area Survey, the Galactic Cluster
          Survey,  and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000
          square  degrees  to  a  depth  of  K~18; the Deep Extragalactic
          Survey  covers  35  square  degrees to K~21, and the Ultra Deep
          Survey  covers  0.77  square  degrees to K~23. The prime aim of
          UKIDSS  is to provide a long term astronomical legacy database;
          the  design  is however driven by a series of specific goals --
          for  example  to  find  the  nearest  and  faintest sub-stellar
          objects;  to  break  the  z=7  quasar barrier; to determine the
          epoch  of  re-ionisation;  to  determine  the  substellar  mass
          function;  to  discover  Population  II  brown  dwarfs, if they
          exist;  to  measure  the  growth  of  structure from z=3 to the
          present  day; to determine the epoch of spheroid formation; and
          to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The data
          are  being  made  available in a series of staged releases, the
          first of which (the "Early Data Release (EDR)") is described in
          Dye   et   al  (2006).  The  data  are  immediately  public  to
          astronomers  in  all  ESO  member  states, and available to the
          world  after  eighteen  months. Before the formal survey began,
          UKIRT  and  the UKIDSS consortium collaborated in obtaining and
          analysing  a series of small science verification (SV) projects
          to  complete  the  commissioning  of  the  camera. We show some
          results  from  these  SV  projects  in order to demonstrate the
          likely power of the eventual complete survey.

          Title:   Parametric  modelling  of  the  3.6um  to  8um  colour
          distributions of galaxies in the SWIRE Survey

          Comments:   44  pages,  10  figures,  6  tables.  Accepted  for
          publication in the Astronomical Journal
          We   fit   a   parametric   model   comprising   a  mixture  of
          multi-dimensional  Gaussian  functions to the 3.6 to 8um colour
          and  optical  photo-z distribution of galaxy populations in the
          ELAIS-N1  and  Lockman  Fields  of SWIRE. For 16,698 sources in
          ELAIS-N1  we  find  our data are best modelled (in the sense of
          the Bayesian Information Criterion) by the sum of four Gaussian
          distributions  or modes (C_a, C_b, C_c and C_d). We compare the
          fit  of  our  empirical  model  with  predictions from existing
          semi-analytic  and  phenomological  models.  We  infer that our
          empirical   model   provides   a   better  description  of  the
          mid-infrared colour distribution of the SWIRE survey than these
          existing  models.  This  colour  distribution  test  is  thus a
          powerful  model  discriminator and complementary to comparisons
          of  number  counts.  We  use  our  model  to  provide  a galaxy
          classification scheme and explore the nature of the galaxies in
          the  different  modes  of  the  model.  C_a  consists  of dusty
          star-forming  systems  such  as ULIRG's. Low redshift late-type
          spirals  are found in C_b, where PAH emission dominates at 8um.
          C_c   consists  of  dusty  starburst  systems  at  intermediate
          redshifts.  Low  redshift  early-type  spirals  and ellipticals
          dominate  C_d.  We  thus find a greater variety of galaxy types
          than  one can with optical photometry alone. Finally we develop
          a  new  technique  to  identify  unusual  objects,  and  find a
          selection of outliers with very red IRAC colours. These objects
          are   not  detected  in  the  optical,  but  have  very  strong
          detections  in  the mid-infrared. These sources are modelled as
          dust-enshrouded,   strongly   obscured   AGN,  where  the  high
          mid-infrared  emission  may either be attributed to dust heated
          by  the  AGN  or substantial star-formation. These sources have
          z_ph  ~  2-4,  making them incredibly infrared luminous, with a
          L_IR ~ 10^(12.6-14.1) L_sun.

          Title: Implications of WMAP Three Year Data for Reionization
          Authors:  Marcelo  A.  Alvarez,  Paul R. Shapiro, Kyungjin Ahn,
          Ilian T. Iliev
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ApJ Letters
          New   results   on  the  anisotropy  of  the  cosmic  microwave
          background  (CMB)  and  its  polarization  based upon the first
          three  years  of  data  from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
          Probe (WMAP) have revised the electron scattering optical depth
          downward  from  tau_es= 0.17+/-0.07 to tau_es=0.09+/-0.03. This
          implies  a  shift  of  the effective reionization redshift from
          z_r~17  to  z_r~11.  Previous  attempts  to  explain  the  high
          redshift  of  reionization  inferred  from the WMAP 1-year data
          have   led  to  widespread  speculation  that  the  sources  of
          reionization  must  have  been  much  more efficient than those
          associated  with  the  star formation observed at low redshift.
          This is consistent, for example, with the suggestion that early
          star  formation  involved massive, Pop III stars which early-on
          produced most of the ionizing radiation escaping from halos. It
          is,  therefore,  tempting  to interpret the new WMAP results as
          implying  that  we can now relax those previous high demands on
          the  efficiency of the sources of reionization and perhaps even
          turn   the  argument  around  as  evidence  against  such  high
          efficiency. We show that this is not the case, however. The new
          WMAP  results also find that the primordial density fluctuation
          power  spectrum  has  a  lower  amplitude, sigma_8, and departs
          substantially  from  the scale-invariant spectrum. We show that
          these  effects  combine  to  cancel  the  impact  of  the later
          reionization implied by the new value of tau_es on the required
          ionizing   efficiency   per  collapsed  baryon.  The  delay  of
          reionization is surprisingly well-matched by a comparable delay
          (by  a  factor of ~1.4 in scale factor) in the formation of the
          halos responsible for reionization.

          Title: Radial Kinematics of Isolated Elliptical Galaxies
          Authors: George Hau, Duncan Forbes
          Comments: 11 pages, 6 figures, MNRAS accepted
          Ellipticals in very low density environments are extremely rare
          but  hold important clues about galaxy formation and evolution.
          In  this  paper  we  continue  our study of isolated elliptical
          galaxies,  presenting  results on the radial stellar kinematics
          for  13 isolated early-type galaxies. We derive radial rotation
          velocity, velocity dispersion and hermite terms to ~1 effective
          radius.  We observe a dichotomy in kinematic properties similar
          to  that  in  the  elliptical  population as a whole, where low
          luminosity  ellipticals  tend to be rotationally supported. For
          all  galaxies  the V/sigma ratio increases with radius. We find
          kinematically  distinct cores (KDCs), or velocity substructure,
          in  ~40%  of the galaxies for which we have major axis spectra.
          Such  a fraction is similar to that observed for ellipticals in
          higher density environments. Most galaxies in the sample reveal
          kinematic   evidence   for  a  nuclear  disk.  The  non-relaxed
          kinematics   in   several  galaxies  suggests  that  they  have
          undergone  a  merger  or  accretion event. Isolated ellipticals
          generally  follow  the  fundamental  plane  defined  by cluster
          ellipticals  --  exceptions  being those galaxies with evidence
          for  young  stellar  populations.  Overall,  we  find  isolated
          ellipticals   have   similar   kinematic  properties  to  their
          counterparts in higher density environments.

          Title:  Heating  and  cooling  of  the  intergalactic medium by
          resonance photons
          Authors: Leonid Chuzhoy, Paul R. Shapiro
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ApJL
          During the epoch of reionization a large number of photons were
          produced with frequencies below the hydrogen Lyman limit. After
          redshifting into the closest resonance, these photons underwent
          multiple scatterings with atoms. We examine the effect of these
          scatterings  on  the  temperature  of the neutral intergalactic
          medium.  Continuum  photons,  emitted  between the Ly_alpha and
          Ly_gamma  frequencies, heat the gas after being redshifted into
          the  hydrogen  Ly_alpha  or  deuterium  Ly_beta  resonance.  By
          contrast,  photons  emitted  between  the Ly_gamma and Ly-limit
          frequencies,  produce  effective  cooling  of the gas. Prior to
          reionization,   the  equilibrium  temperature  of  ~100  K  for
          hydrogen  and  helium  atoms  is  set  by  these  two competing
          processes.   At   the  same  time,  Ly_beta  resonance  photons
          thermally  decouple  deuterium  from other species, raising its
          temperature as high as 10^4 K.

          Title: The Nature of SS433 and the Ultraluminous X-ray Sources
          Authors: M.C. Begelman, A.R. King, J.E. Pringle
          Comments: MNRAS, in press. 7 pages, no figures
          The  periodic  precession  (162--day)  and  nodding  (6.3--day)
          motions of the jets in SS433 are driven in the outer regions of
          the  disc, whereas the jets themselves, being relativistic, are
          launched near the black hole at the disc centre. Given that the
          nutation period is comparable to the dynamical timescale in the
          outer regions of the disc, it seems unlikely that these periods
          can  be  communicated  efficiently  to the disc centre. Here we
          propose  that the massive outflow observed in SS433 is launched
          at  large radii in the disc, about 1/10 of the outer disc edge,
          and  that it is this outflow which responds to the oscillations
          of the outer disc and determines the direction of the jets. The
          massive  outflow  is  launched at large radius because the mass
          transfer  rate  is  hyper-Eddington. This implies not only that
          the  total  luminosity of SS433 exceeds $\le$ by a considerable
          factor,  but also that the radiative output is collimated along
          the  outflow.  We  thus  suggest that SS433 is an ultraluminous
          X-ray source (ULX) viewed `from the side'. We also suggest that
          the obscured {\it INTEGRAL} sources may be SS433--like objects,
          but with slightly lower mass transfer rates.

          Comments: 16 pages, 16 figures, submitted to ApJ
          Standard   LCDM   predicts   that  the  major  merger  rate  of
          galaxy-size  dark matter halos rises rapidly with redshift. The
          average  number  of  close  companions per galaxy, Nc, is often
          used   to   infer  the  galaxy  merger  rate,  however,  recent
          observational  studies suggest that Nc evolves very little with
          redshift.  Here  we  use  a  "hybrid"  N-  body simulation plus
          analytic substructure model to predict Nc directly. We identify
          dark  matter  subhalos with galaxies and show that the observed
          lack  of  close  pair  count  evolution arises because the high
          merger  rate  per  halo  at  early  times  is counteracted by a
          decrease in the number of halos massive enough to host a galaxy
          pair.  We  compare our results to data compiled from the DEEP2,
          SSRS2, and the UZC redshift surveys. Observed pair counts match
          our predictions if we assume a monotonic mapping between galaxy
          luminosity  and the maximum circular velocity that each subhalo
          had  when  it  was  first  accreted  onto  its  host halo. This
          suggests   that   satellite  galaxies  are  significantly  more
          resilient  to  destruction than are dissipationless dark matter
          subhalos.  We  argue  that  while  Nc does not provide a direct
          measure  of the halo merger rate, it offers a powerful means to
          constrain  the  Halo  Occupation  Distribution  and the spatial
          distribution of galaxies within halos. Interpreted in this way,
          close  pair  counts  provide  a useful test of galaxy formation
          processes on < 100 kpc scales.

          Title:  An  unified  model  for  superluminal  motion and state
          transition on microquasars and quasars
          Authors: Biping Gong
          Comments: 15 pages, 5 figures. submitted
          Superluminal  motion  has  been interpreted as relativistically
          moving  out  flow.  The increasing observations of such sources
          provide  chance  to investigate their mechanism in detail. This
          paper  proposes  that superluminal motion may be jet precession
          induced  blob  motion.  This  model  can  interpret a number of
          observational phenomena which are not well understood under the
          scenario  of  bulk  motion, such as the absence of the receding
          blob  after the outburst and the receding blob becomes brighter
          than  the  approaching  one  in  XTE  J1550-564  . Moreover the
          compton  scattering  of photos from a warped accretion disk may
          form a structured jet. And the precession of the structured jet
          may  lead  to  the  complicated  state  transitions observed in
          microquasars like GRS 1915+105. Applying to AGNs, the model may
          explain  the  scales  of  length  and  time  of  the  phenomena
          proportioning  to the mass of the black hole. The new model can
          be tested easily on microquasars, i.e., XTE J1550-564, on which
          the previous receding blob should move towards the core instead
          of  away  from it after 2002, and the previous approaching blob
          shall  disappear.  %For  GRS  1915+105 the vibration of the two
          blobs  should  be observed in both %the time scales of year and
          days.

          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  present  350um  observations  of  15  Chapman et al. (2005)
          submillimeter  galaxies  (SMGs)  with  radio  counterparts  and
          optical  redshifts.  We  detect  12  and obtain sensitive upper
          limits  for  3, providing direct, precise measurements of their
          far-infrared luminosities and characteristic dust temperatures.
          With   these,   we   verify   the   linear  radio--far-infrared
          correlation  at  redshifts  of  z  ~  1-3  and  luminosities of
          10^11-10^13  L_sun,  with  a power-law index of 1.02+-0.12, and
          rms  scatter  of  0.12 dex. However, either the the correlation
          constant  'q'  or  the  dust  emissivity  'beta'  is lower than
          measured  locally. The best fitting q ~ 2.14 is consistent with
          SMGs being predominantly starbust galaxies, without significant
          AGN contribution, at far-infrared wavelengths. Gas-to-dust mass
          ratios  are  estimated  at 54+-13 kappa(850um)/0.15 m^2 kg^-1],
          depending  on  the absoption efficiency 'kappa', with intrinsic
          dispersion  ~  40%  around  the  mean  value. Dust temperatures
          consistent  with  34.6+-3K  [beta/1.5]^-0.71,  at  z ~ 1.5-3.5,
          suggest  that far-infrared photometric redshifts may be viable,
          and  perhaps  accurate to 10% <~ dz/(1+z), for up to 80% of the
          SMG   population  in  this  range,  if  the  above  temperature
          characterizes   the  full  range  of  SMGs.  However,  observed
          temperature  evolution  of  T_d  ~ (1+z) is also plausible, and
          could   result   from  selection  effects.  From  the  observed
          luminosity--temperature (L-T) relation, L ~ T_obs^(2.82+-0.29),
          we derive scaling relations for dust mass vs. dust temperature,
          and   identify   expressions   to   inter-relate  the  observed
          quantities.   These  suggest  that  measurements  at  a  single
          wavelength,   in   the  far-infrared,  submillimeter  or  radio
          wavebands,  might  constrain dust temperatures and far-infrared
          luminosities for most SMGs with redshifts at z ~ 0.5-4.

          sequence, the uncertainty of the estimated cluster redshifts is
          assessed  to  be  \~0.03. Containing over 100 clusters with z >
          0.6,  the  catalogue  contributes  substantially to the current
          total  of  optically-selected,  intermediate-redshift clusters,
          and  complements the existing, usually X-ray selected, samples.

          to  investigate  the  environments  of quasars and the chemical
          evolution of galaxies. We publish here the list of all clusters

          Title: SHARC-2 350 Micron Observations of Distant Submillimeter
          Selected Galaxies
          Authors:  A.  Kovacs, S. C. Chapman, C. D. Dowell, A. W. Blain,

          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  present  350um  observations  of  15  Chapman et al. (2005)
          submillimeter  galaxies  (SMGs)  with  radio  counterparts  and
          optical  redshifts.  We  detect  12  and obtain sensitive upper
          limits  for  3, providing direct, precise measurements of their
          far-infrared luminosities and characteristic dust temperatures.
          With   these,   we   verify   the   linear  radio--far-infrared
          correlation  at  redshifts  of  z  ~  1-3  and  luminosities of
          10^11-10^13  L_sun,  with  a power-law index of 1.02+-0.12, and
          rms  scatter  of  0.12 dex. However, either the the correlation
          constant  'q'  or  the  dust  emissivity  'beta'  is lower than
          measured  locally. The best fitting q ~ 2.14 is consistent with
          SMGs being predominantly starbust galaxies, without significant
          AGN contribution, at far-infrared wavelengths. Gas-to-dust mass
          ratios  are  estimated  at 54+-13 kappa(850um)/0.15 m^2 kg^-1],
          depending  on  the absoption efficiency 'kappa', with intrinsic
          dispersion  ~  40%  around  the  mean  value. Dust temperatures
          consistent  with  34.6+-3K  [beta/1.5]^-0.71,  at  z ~ 1.5-3.5,
          suggest  that far-infrared photometric redshifts may be viable,
          and  perhaps  accurate to 10% <~ dz/(1+z), for up to 80% of the
          SMG   population  in  this  range,  if  the  above  temperature
          characterizes   the  full  range  of  SMGs.  However,  observed
          temperature  evolution  of  T_d  ~ (1+z) is also plausible, and
          could   result   from  selection  effects.  From  the  observed
          luminosity--temperature (L-T) relation, L ~ T_obs^(2.82+-0.29),
          we derive scaling relations for dust mass vs. dust temperature,
          and   identify   expressions   to   inter-relate  the  observed
          quantities.   These  suggest  that  measurements  at  a  single
          wavelength,   in   the  far-infrared,  submillimeter  or  radio
          wavebands,  might  constrain dust temperatures and far-infrared
          luminosities for most SMGs with redshifts at z ~ 0.5-4.

          rms  scatter  of  0.12 dex. However, either the the correlation
          constant  'q'  or  the  dust  emissivity  'beta'  is lower than
          measured  locally. The best fitting q ~ 2.14 is consistent with
          SMGs being predominantly starbust galaxies, without significant
          AGN contribution, at far-infrared wavelengths. Gas-to-dust mass
          ratios  are  estimated  at 54+-13 kappa(850um)/0.15 m^2 kg^-1],
          depending  on  the absoption efficiency 'kappa', with intrinsic
          dispersion  ~  40%  around  the  mean  value. Dust temperatures
          consistent  with  34.6+-3K  [beta/1.5]^-0.71,  at  z ~ 1.5-3.5,
          suggest  that far-infrared photometric redshifts may be viable,
          and  perhaps  accurate to 10% <~ dz/(1+z), for up to 80% of the
          SMG   population  in  this  range,  if  the  above  temperature
          characterizes   the  full  range  of  SMGs.  However,  observed
          temperature  evolution  of  T_d  ~ (1+z) is also plausible, and
          could   result   from  selection  effects.  From  the  observed
          luminosity--temperature (L-T) relation, L ~ T_obs^(2.82+-0.29),
          we derive scaling relations for dust mass vs. dust temperature,
          and   identify   expressions   to   inter-relate  the  observed
          quantities.   These  suggest  that  measurements  at  a  single
          wavelength,   in   the  far-infrared,  submillimeter  or  radio
          wavebands,  might  constrain dust temperatures and far-infrared
          luminosities for most SMGs with redshifts at z ~ 0.5-4.

          We  describe  a  large  sample  of 598 galaxy clusters and rich
          groups  discovered  in  the  data  of the Faint Sky Variability
          Survey.  The  clusters  have  been  identified  using  a  fully
          automated,   semi-parametric   technique  based  on  a  maximum
          likelihood   approach  applied  to  Voronoi  tessellation,  and
          enhanced  by  colour  discrimination.  The sample covers a wide
          range of richness, has a density of ~28 clusters per sqdeg, and
          spans  a  range  of  estimated redshifts of 0.05 < z < 0.9 with
          mean  <z>  =  0.345.  Assuming  the  presence  of a cluster red
          sequence, the uncertainty of the estimated cluster redshifts is
          assessed  to  be  \~0.03. Containing over 100 clusters with z >
          0.6,  the  catalogue  contributes  substantially to the current
          total  of  optically-selected,  intermediate-redshift clusters,
          and  complements the existing, usually X-ray selected, samples.
          The  FSVS  fields are accessible for observation throughout the
          whole year, making them particularly suited for large follow-up
          programmes.  The  construction  of  this FSVS Cluster Catalogue
          completes  a fundamental component of our continuing programmes
          to  investigate  the  environments  of quasars and the chemical
          evolution of galaxies. We publish here the list of all clusters
          with  their  basic  parameters,  and  discuss some illustrative
          examples  in  more  detail.  The  full  FSVS Cluster Catalogue,
          together with images and lists of member galaxies etc., will be
          issued as part of the ``NOAO data products'', and accessible at
          this  http  URL We describe the format of these data and access
          to them.

          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures. Submitted to ApJL
          We  report on a survey for strong (rest equivalent width W_r >=
          1A),   intervening   MgII   systems  along  the  sightlines  to
          long-duration  gamma-ray  bursts  (GRBs). The GRB spectra which
          comprise  the survey have a heterogeneous mix of resolution and
          wavelength  coverage, but we implement a strict, uniform set of
          search criteria to derive a well-defined statistical sample. We
          identify  15  strong  MgII  absorbers  along  13 GRB sightlines
          (nearly  every  sightline  exhibits at least one absorber) with
          spectra  covering  a  total pathlength Delta z = 13.8 at a mean
          redshift  <z>  =  1.1.  In contrast, the predicted incidence of
          such  absorber  systems  along  the  same path length to quasar
          sightlines is only 3.4. The roughly four times higher incidence
          along   GRB  sightlines  is  inconsistent  with  a  statistical
          fluctuation  at  greater  than 99.9% c.l. Several effects could
          explain the result: (i) dust within the MgII absorbers obscures
          faint  quasars  giving  a lower observed incidence along quasar
          sightlines;  (ii)  the gas is intrinsic to the GRB event; (iii)
          the  GRB  are  gravitationally  lensed  by  these absorbers. We
          present strong arguments against the first two effects and also
          consider  lensing  to  be  an unlikely explanation. The results
          suggest  that  at  least  one  of  our  fundamental  beliefs on
          absorption line research is flawed.

          Authors:  A.  Petric, C. L. Carilli, F. Bertoldi, A. Beelen, P.
          Cox, A. Omont
          Comments: accepted for publication in AJ
          We  present Very Large Array observations at 1.4 and 5 GHz of a
          sample  of 16 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) at z = 1.78 to 2.71.
          Half of the chosen quasars are bright at mm wavelengths (250 or
          350  GHz)  while  the  other  half  were  not  detected  at  mm
          wavelengths;  the former QSOs were detected at 1.4 GHz, in most
          cases  at  high  significance (S/N > ~7), but only three of the
          latter  sources were detected at radio frequencies, and only at
          lower  significance  (S/N  ~ 3). The data are consistent with a
          correlation  between  the  mm  and  radio  fluxes  indicating a
          physical  connection between the mechanisms responsible for the
          radio  and  mm  emission.  However, this conclusion is based on
          data  which includes many upper limits, and deeper observations
          are clearly needed to verify this correlation.
          All eight mm detected QSOs are detected in the radio continuum,
          with  radio  flux  densities  consistent  with the radio-to-FIR
          correlation  for  low z star forming galaxies. However, four of
          these  have  flatter  spectral indices than is typical for star
          forming  galaxies  (i.e.  greater  than  -0.5)  suggesting that
          radiation  from  the  central  AGN dominates the observed radio
          emission.  All  the  sources  detected at 1.4 GHz are spatially
          unresolved,  with the size limits typically < 1'' = 6 kpc. High
          star  formation  rate  galaxies  at  low redshift are typically
          nuclear  starbursts,  with  sizes  <  1 kpc. Hence, the current
          radio  size  limits  are insufficient to constrain the emission
          model (AGN or starburst).

          Galaxies
          Authors: O. Guyon, D. B. Sanders, A. Stockton
          Comments: 80 pages, accepted for publication in ApJ Suppl
          We report near-infrared (primarily H-band) adaptive optics (AO)
          imaging   with   the  Gemini-N  and  Subaru  Telescopes,  of  a
          representative  sample  of 32 nearby (z<0.3) QSOs selected from
          the  Palomar-Green (PG) Bright Quasar Survey (BQS), in order to
          investigate  the  properties  of the host galaxies. 2D modeling
          and  visual  inspection  of  the  images shows that ~36% of the
          hosts   are   ellipticals,   \~39%  contain  a  prominent  disk
          component,  and ~25% are of undetermined type. 30% show obvious
          signs  of  disturbance.  The mean M_H(host) = -24.82 (2.1L_H*),
          with  a  range -23.5 to -26.5 (~0.63 to 10 L_H*). At <L_H*, all
          hosts have a dominant disk component, while at >2 L_H* most are
          ellipticals.  "Disturbed"  hosts  are  found  at all M_H(host),
          while  "strongly  disturbed"  hosts  appear  to  favor the more
          luminous  hosts.  Hosts with prominent disks have less luminous
          QSOs,  while  the  most luminous QSOs are almost exclusively in
          ellipticals  or  in  mergers  (which presumably shortly will be
          ellipticals).  At  z<0.13,  where  our  sample  is  complete at
          B-band,  we  find  no  clear  correlation  between M_B(QSO) and
          M_H(host).   However,   at   z>0.15,  the  more  luminous  QSOs
          (M_B<-24.7),  and  4/5  of  the  radio-loud QSOs, have the most
          luminous  H-band hosts (>7L_H*), most of which are ellipticals.
          Finally,   we   find   a   strong   correlation   between   the
          "infrared-excess", L_IR/L_BB, of QSOs with host type and degree
          of  disturbance.  Disturbed  and  strongly  disturbed hosts and
          hosts   with  dominant  disks  have  L_IR/L_BB  twice  that  of
          non-disturbed  and  elliptical  hosts,  respectively. QSOs with
          "disturbed"  and  "strongly-disturbed"  hosts are also found to
          have  morphologies and mid/far-infrared colors that are similar
          to  what  is  found for "warm" ultraluminous infrared galaxies,
          providing   further   evidence   for  a  possible  evolutionary
          connection between both classes of objects.

          Title: The Abundance of Distant and Extremely Red Galaxies: The
          Role of AGN Feedback in Hierarchical Models
          Authors:  N.  Menci,  A.  Fontana, E. Giallongo, A. Grazian, S.
          Salimbeni
          Comments: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal
          We  investigate  the  effect  of AGN feedback associated to the
          bright  QSO  phase onto the color distribution of galaxies from
          z=0 up to z=4. To this aim, we insert a blast-wave model of AGN
          feedback  in our semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, which
          includes  the  growth  of  supermassive black holes and the AGN
          activity  triggered  by  interactions of the host galaxies. The
          AGN  feedback  is  directly  related to the impulsive, luminous
          quasar  phase. We test our model by checking the consistency of
          its results against i) the QSO luminosity functions from z=0 to
          z=4;  ii)  the  observed  local relation between the black hole
          mass  m_{BH}  and  the mass of the host galaxy. At low redshift
          the inclusion of AGN feedback enhances the number of red bright
          galaxies,  so that the color distribution of M_r<-22 objects is
          entirely  dominated  by red (u-r>1.5) galaxies; at 0.5< z< 2 it
          yields  rest-frame  U-V  color  distribution  in agreement with
          existing observations. In the range z=1.5-2.5, we find that 31%
          of galaxies contribute to the EROs population with m_K<20 (Vega
          system);  at such a magnitude, the model yields an EROs surface
          density  of  6.3 10^3 /deg^2 matching existing data; about 80 %
          of  the  above  density is contributed by passive galaxies with
          old  stellar  populations.  Extending  our analysis to z=4, the
          model  matches  the observed surface density 1.5 10^3 /deg^2 of
          DRGs  at m_K=20; such a population is predicted to be dominated
          by galaxies with old stellar populations for z>2.5.

          Journal, 15 pages, uses emulateapj.cls
          We  report  the  discovery  of  an  extremely curved jet in the
          radio-loud   quasar   PKS2136+141.  Multi-frequency  Very  Long
          Baseline  Array  (VLBA)  images  show  a  bending  jet making a
          turn-around  of  210 degrees in the plane of the sky, which is,
          to  our  knowledge,  the  largest  ever  observed change in the
          position  angle  of  an  astrophysical jet. Images taken at six
          different frequencies, from 2.3 to 43 GHz, reveal a spiral-like
          trajectory,  which  is  likely  a  sign of an intrinsic helical
          geometry. A space-VLBI image, taken with the HALCA satellite at
          5  GHz  and having comparable resolution to our ground-based 15
          GHz  data,  confirms  that  the bend is a frequency-independent
          structure. VLBA monitoring data at 15 GHz, covering eight years
          of  observations,  show knots in the jet clearly deviating from
          ballistic motion, which suggests that the bending may be caused
          by  a  growing  helical  Kelvin-Helmholtz  normal mode. The jet
          appearance  suggests  a  helical wave at a frequency well below
          the  "resonant"  frequency of the jet, which indicates that the
          wave  is  driven  by a periodic perturbation at the base of the
          jet. We fit the observed structure in the source with a helical
          twist,  and  we  find  that  a  simple  isothermal model with a
          constant  wave  speed  and  wavelength  gives  a  good fit. The
          measured   apparent   velocities   indicate   some   degree  of
          acceleration  along  the  jet,  which together with an observed
          change  in  the apparent half-opening angle of the jet allow us
          to  estimate  the  changes  in  the angle between the local jet
          direction  and  our  line  of sight. We suggest that the jet in
          PKS2136+141  is  distorted by a helical Kelvin-Helmholtz normal
          mode  externally  driven into the jet (e.g. by precession), and
          that  our  line  of sight falls within the opening angle of the
          helix cone.

          Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table
          It  is  shown  that all of the 32 point X-ray sources which lie
          within  about  10'  of the centre of nearby galaxies, and which
          have so far been optically identified are high redshift objects
          - AGN or QSOs. Thus the surface density of these QSOs p similar
          or  equal  to  0.1  per  square  arc  minute. Some of them were
          originally  discovered  as  X-ray  sources  and  classified  as
          ultraluminous  X-ray  sources  (ULXs),  nearly all of which lie
          near  the  centers of active galaxies. We demonstrate that this
          concentration  around  galactic  nuclei  is of high statistical
          significance:  the  probabiliy  that p that they are accidental
          lies in the range one in a thousand to one in ten thousand, and
          apparently this excess cannot be accounted for by microlensing.

          We  present the far-UV spectrum of the quasar HS1700+6416 taken
          with  FUSE. This QSO provides the second line of sight with the
          HeII  absorption  resolved  into  a  Ly alpha forest structure.
          Since  HS1700+6416  is  slightly  less redshifted (z=2.72) than
          HE2347-4342, we only probe the post-reionization phase of HeII,
          seen  in the evolution of the HeII opacity, which is consistent
          with  a  simple  power  law. The HeII/HI ratio eta is estimated
          using  a line profile-fitting procedure and an apparent optical
          depth   approach,   respectively.   The   expected  metal  line
          absorption  in  the  far-UV  is  taken  into account as well as
          molecular  absorption  of  galactic  H_2.  About 27% of the eta
          values  are  affected  by  metal  line  absorption. In order to
          investigate  the  applicability  of  the  analysis  methods, we
          create  simple  artificial  spectra  based  on  the statistical
          properties  of  the  HI  Ly  alpha  forest. The analysis of the
          artificial  data  demonstrates  that the apparent optical depth
          method  as  well  as the line profile-fitting procedure lead to
          confident  results for restricted data samples only (12.0 < log
          N(HI)  <  13.0).  The reasons are saturation in the case of the
          apparent  optical  depth and thermal line widths in the case of
          the  profile  fits.  Furthermore,  applying  the methods to the
          unrestricted  data  set may mimic a correlation between eta and
          the  strength  of  the  HI  absorption. For the restricted data
          samples  a scatter of 10 - 15% in eta would be expected even if
          the  underlying  value  is  constant.  The  observed scatter is
          significantly   larger   than  expected,  indicating  that  the
          intergalactic  radiation  background  is indeed fluctuating. In
          the  redshift  range 2.58 < z < 2.72, where the data quality is
          best,  we  find  eta  ~  100, suggesting a contribution of soft
          sources like galaxies to the UV background.

          The Extragalactic Lens VLBI Imaging Survey (ELVIS) searches for
          central images of lensed radio quasars, in order to measure the
          central  density  profiles of distant galaxies. Here we present
          sensitive   multi-epoch   Very   Long   Baseline  Array  (VLBA)
          observations  of  PMN J1838-3427 at 8 GHz, with a 1 sigma noise
          level  of  38  microJy  beam^(-1).  Based  on  the absence of a
          central  image  of  the  background  source  at  this level, we
          explore  the  possibilities for the central matter distribution
          in  the  lens  galaxy.  A  power-law  density  profile,  rho  ~
          r^(-gamma), must have gamma > 1.93. Thus the density profile is
          close  to  an  isothermal  profile  (gamma = 2) or steeper. The
          upper  limit  on  any  constant-density  core  in  an otherwise
          isothermal  profile  is  ~<  5  parsecs.  We  also  derive  the
          constraints   on   models  in  which  the  density  profile  is
          isothermal  on  kiloparsec  scales,  but  is  allowed to have a
          different  power  law  in the central ~100 parsecs. If the lens
          galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole, the galaxy profile is
          allowed  to  be shallower, but for the expected black hole mass
          the  galaxy  profile  must  still  be  close  to  isothermal or
          steeper.

          Title: Transport on Adaptive Random Lattices
          Authors: Jelle Ritzerveld, Vincent Icke
          Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures, submitted to PRE
          Subj-class:   Statistical  Mechanics;  Mesoscopic  Systems  and
          Quantum Hall Effect; Computational Physics
          In  this  paper,  we  present  a new method for the solution of
          those  generic  transport  processes that may be described by a
          Master Equation. We base our algorithm on a Markov process on a
          Voronoi-Delaunay  grid,  a nonperiodic lattice which is derived
          from  a  random  point  process  that  is  chosen  to optimally
          represent  certain  properties  of the medium through which the
          transport  occurs. Our grid is locally translation and rotation
          invariant in the mean. We illustrate our approach by means of a
          particular  example,  in  which  the  expectation  value of the
          length  of a grid line corresponds to the local mean free path.
          In  this example, the lattice is a direct representation of the
          `free  path  space'  of  the medium. Subsequently, transport is
          defined  as  simply moving particles from one node to the next,
          interactions   taking  place  at  each  point.  We  derive  the
          statistical  properties of such lattices, describe the limiting
          behaviour, and show how interactions are incorporated as global
          coefficients.  Two elementary transport problems are discussed:
          that   of  free  ballistic  transport,  and  the  transport  of
          particles  through  a  scattering  medium.  We  also  mention a
          combination  of  these  two.  We  discuss the efficiency of our
          method, showing that it is much faster than most other methods,
          because  the  operation count does not scale with the number of
          sources.  We  test  our  method by focusing on the transport of
          ionizing  radiation  through a static medium, and show that the
          computed  results  for the classical test case of an ionization
          front  expanding  in  a homogeneous medium agree perfectly with
          the analytic solution. We finish by illustrating the efficiency
          and  flexibility of our method with the results of a simulation
          of  the  reionization  of  the  large  scale  structure  of the
          Universe.

          Comments:  8  pages,  6  figures, Globular Clusters - Guides to
          Galaxies conference
          We  first  discuss  recent  progress  in  using  the  Milky Way
          globular  cluster  (GC)  system  as a `test-bed' for properties
          derived  from integrated spectra and stellar population models.
          Standard   techniques   may   give   rise  to  spuriously  high
          alpha-element  ratios  at  low  metallicities.  We then discuss
          evidence  for  early  epoch  (z  > 2) formation for most GCs in
          galaxies  today.  Recent  accretions  of  GCs  (and  their host
          galaxy)  make  a small contribution but recent mergers form few
          if  any  new  GCs  in  today's  elliptical  galaxies. The early
          formation  of  metal-poor  GCs  and  the  bimodality seen in GC
          specific  frequency requires a `truncation' which may be due to
          reionization.

          The  old  dream  of integrating into one the study of micro and
          macrocosmos  is  now  a  reality.  Cosmology, astrophysics, and
          particle  physics  intersect  in  a  scenario  (but still not a
          theory)  of  cosmic  structure  formation  and evolution called
          Lambda  Cold  Dark  Matter  (LCDM) model. This scenario emerged
          mainly  to  explain  the  origin  of galaxies. In these lecture
          notes,  I first present a review of the main galaxy properties,
          highlighting  the questions that any theory of galaxy formation
          should  explain.  Then, the cosmological framework and the main
          aspects of primordial perturbation generation and evolution are
          pedagogically  detached.  Next, I focus on the ``dark side'' of
          galaxy  formation,  presenting a review on LCDM halo assembling
          and  properties,  and  on  the main candidates for non-baryonic
          dark  matter. It is shown how the nature of elemental particles
          can  influence  on  the features of galaxies and their systems.
          Finally, the complex processes of baryon dissipation inside the
          non-linearly   evolving  CDM  halos,  formation  of  disks  and
          spheroids,  and  transformation  of  gas into stars are briefly
          described,  remarking  on  the  possibility  of  a  few driving
          factors  and parameters able to explain the main body of galaxy
          properties.  A  summary  and a discussion of some of the issues
          and  open  problems of the LCDM paradigm are given in the final
          part of these notes.

          Astrophysics
          We  investigate  the  relation  between X-ray nuclear emission,
          optical  emission line luminosities and black hole masses for a
          sample  of  47  Seyfert  galaxies.  The  sample, which has been
          selected  from  the  Palomar  optical  spectroscopic  survey of
          nearby  galaxies (Ho, Filippenko & Sargent 1997), covers a wide
          range of nuclear powers, from L_{2-10 keV} ~ 10^{43} erg/s down
          to  very  low luminosities (L_{2-10 keV} ~ 10^{38} erg/s). Best
          available  data  from  Chandra, XMM-Newton and, in a few cases,
          ASCA  observations  have  been  considered.  Thanks to the good
          spatial  resolution  available  from  these  observations and a
          proper modeling of the various spectral components, it has been
          possible  to  obtain  accurate  nuclear  X-ray luminosities not
          contaminated  by  off-nuclear  sources and/or diffuse emission.
          X-ray luminosities have then been corrected taking into account
          the  likely  candidate  Compton thick sources, which are a high
          fraction  (> 30%) among type 2 Seyferts in our sample. The main
          result   of  this  study  is  that  we  confirm  strong  linear
          correlations  between  2-10  keV,  [OIII]\lambda5007, H_{alpha}
          luminosities  which show the same slope as quasars and luminous
          Seyfert  galaxies, independent of the level of nuclear activity
          displayed. Moreover, despite the wide range of Eddington ratios
          (L/L_{Edd}) tested here (six orders of magnitude, from 0.1 down
          to  ~  10^{-7}),  no  correlation is found between the X-ray or
          optical emission line luminosities and the black hole mass. Our
          results   suggest   that  Seyfert  nuclei  in  our  sample  are
          consistent  with  being  a scaled-down version of more luminous
          AGN.

          Title: Gamma-ray binaries: pulsars in disguise ?
          Authors: Guillaume Dubus
          Comments: 20 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          LS  5039  and  LSI  +61  303 are unique amongst high-mass X-ray
          binaries (HMXB) for their spatially-resolved radio emission and
          their  counterpart  at  >GeV  gamma-ray  energies,  canonically
          attributed  to  non-thermal  particles  in an accretion-powered
          relativistic  jet.  The only other HMXB known to emit very high
          energy (VHE) gamma-rays, PSR B1259-63, harbours a non-accreting
          millisecond  pulsar.  I  investigate whether the interaction of
          the  relativistic  wind  from a young pulsar with the wind from
          its stellar companion, as in PSR B1259-63, constitutes a viable
          scenario  to  explain  the  observations of LS 5039 and LSI +61
          303.   Emission  would  arise  from  the  shocked  pulsar  wind
          material,  which  then  flows  away  to  large  distances  in a
          comet-shape  tail,  reproducing  on  a  smaller  scale  what is
          observed  in isolated, high motion pulsars interacting with the
          ISM.  Simple expectations for the SED are derived and are shown
          to  depend  on  few input parameters. Detailed modelling of the
          particle  evolution  is compared to the observations from radio
          to TeV energies. Acceleration at the shock provides high energy
          electrons  that steadily emit synchrotron in X-rays and inverse
          Compton   scatter   stellar   light  to  gamma-rays.  Electrons
          streaming  out  of the system emit at IR frequencies and below.
          The  overall  aspect  of  the SEDs is adequately reproduced for
          standard  values of the parameters. The morphology of the radio
          tail  can mimic a microquasar jet. Good agreement is found with
          the  published  VLBI map of LS 5039 and predictions are made on
          the  expected  change  in  appearance  with  orbital phase. The
          pulsar  wind scenario can provide a common, viable framework to
          interpret the emission from all three gamma-ray binaries.

          Jahnke, G. Meylan, L. Wisotzki
          Comments: 30 pages, 20 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We present the analysis of a representative sample of 20 bright
          low-redshift   quasars   (M_B<-23   and   z  <  0.35)  observed
          spectroscopically  with the VLT. The FORS1 spectra, obtained in
          Multi   Object   Spectroscopy  (MOS)  mode,  allow  to  observe
          simultaneously  the quasars and several reference stars used to
          spatially  deconvolve  the data. Applying the MCS deconvolution
          method,  we  are able to separate the individual spectra of the
          quasar  and  of  the  underlying host galaxy. We find that most
          quasar host galaxies harbour large amounts of gas, irrespective
          of  their  morphological type. Moreover, the stellar content of
          half  of  the  hosts  is a young Sc-like population, associated
          with   a   rather   low   metallicity  interstellar  medium.  A
          significant  fraction  of  the  galaxies contain gas ionized at
          large  distances  by  the quasar radiation. This large distance
          ionization  is always associated with signs of interactions (as
          detected from images or disturbed rotation curves). The spectra
          of  the  quasars themselves provide evidence that gravitational
          interactions bring dust and gas in the immediate surrounding of
          the  super  massive black hole, allowing to feed it. The quasar
          activity  might  thus be triggered (1) in young gas-rich spiral
          galaxies  by  local  events and (2) in more evolved galaxies by
          gravitational  interactions or collisions. The latter mechanism
          gives  rises to the most powerful quasars. Furthermore, we show
          that  the  reddening  deduced  from the Balmer decrement in the
          quasar  broad line spectrum cannot be applied to the continuum.
          This  indicates  that  the  dust is distributed inhomogeneously
          around  the  quasar.  Finally,  we  derive  mass models for the
          isolated  spiral  host  galaxies  and  we  show  that  the most
          reliable  estimators  of  the  systemic  redshift in the quasar
          spectrum are the tips of the Halpha and Hbeta lines.

          We  analyze  MegaZ-LRG, a new photometric-redshift catalogue of
          Luminous  Red  Galaxies (LRGs) based on the imaging data of the
          Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey (SDSS) 4th Data Release. MegaZ-LRG,
          presented  in  a  companion  paper, contains > 10^6 photometric
          redshifts  derived  with  ANNz,  an  Artificial  Neural Network
          method,  constrained  by  a spectroscopic sub-sample of ~13,000
          galaxies  obtained  by  the  2dF-SDSS  LRG  and  Quasar (2SLAQ)
          survey.  The  catalogue spans the redshift range 0.4<z<0.7 with
          an  r.m.s.  redshift  error  ~  0.03(1+z). We present the first
          cosmological  parameter  fits  to  galaxy angular power spectra
          from  a  photometric  redshift  survey.  Combining the redshift
          slices  with  appropriate  covariances, we determine the matter
          density  Omega_m and baryon density Omega_b in the combinations
          Omega_m  h  =  0.20+/-0.03  and  Omega_b/Omega_m = 0.14+/-0.04.
          These  results  are  in  agreement  with and independent of the
          latest  studies  of  the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation,
          and  their  precision is comparable to analyses of contemporary
          spectroscopic-redshift  surveys.  We find visual suggestions of
          baryon   oscillations   in   the  clustering  pattern,  with  a
          "model-independent"  statistical  significance  of  less than 3
          sigma. On the largest scales probed by the survey we measure an
          excess  of  power with respect to the model with a significance
          of  approximately  2  sigma.  We perform an extensive series of
          tests  which  conclude that our power spectrum measurements are
          robust  against  potential systematic photometric errors in the
          catalogue.  We  conclude  that photometric-redshift surveys are
          competitive    with   spectroscopic   surveys   for   measuring
          cosmological  parameters  in  the  simplest  "vanilla"  models.
          Future  deep  imaging  surveys have great potential for further
          improvement, provided that systematic errors can be controlled.

          We  construct rest-frame luminosity functions at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8,
          8 and 24 microns over the redshift range 0<z<2 for galaxies and
          0<z<4  for  optical  QSOs, using optical and infrared data from
          the  Spitzer  Wide-area  InfraRed Extragalactic survey. The 3.6
          and  4.5  micron galaxy LFs show evidence for moderate positive
          luminosity  evolution  up to z~1.5, consistent with the passive
          ageing   of   evolved   stellar   populations.  Their  comoving
          luminosity  density  was  found  to evolve passively, gradually
          increasing out to z~0.5-1 but flattening, or even declining, at
          higher  redshift. Conversely, the 24 micron galaxy LF, which is
          more  sensitive to obscured star formation and/or AGN activity,
          undergoes strong positive evolution, with the derived IR energy
          density  and  SFR  density  proportional  to  (1+z)^gamma  with
          gamma=4.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6}  and  the  majority  of  this evolution
          occurring  since  z~1.  Optical  QSOs,  however,  show positive
          luminosity evolution in all bands, out to the highest redshifts
          (3<z<4).  Modelling  as  L*  proportional  to  (1+z)^gamma gave

          Title: Reionisation scenarios and the temperature of the IGM
          Authors: Eric R. Tittley Avery Meiksin
          Comments:  Submitted  to  MNRAS.  Version  with high resolution
          colour figures available at this http URL
          We have explored reionisation of the universe using a radiative
          transfer (RT) code coupled to a particle-mesh (PM) N-body code.
          Multiple  simulations  were performed with different spectra of
          ionising  radiation:  a power law, miniquasar, starburst, and a
          time-varying spectrum that evolves from a starburst spectrum to
          a  power law. The RT is sufficiently resolved in time and space
          to   correctly   model   both  the  ionisation  state  and  the
          temperature across the ionisation front. The temperature of the
          ionised intergalactic medium (IGM) is sensitive to the spectrum
          of  the  source  of  ionising  radiation.  The  post-ionisation
          temperature  is fairly insensitive to the redshift at which the
          hydrogen  ionising  sources  turns  on  for expected scenarios.
          Hardening  of  the spectrum of the ionising radiation field due
          to  passage  through  the  high  HI  column  densities leads to
          fluctuations  in  the  f_HeII  /  f_HI  ratio  in  the shadowed
          regions.  These variations alone, however, do not reproduce the
          measured  fluctuations.  The post-ionisation temperature of the
          IGM provides strong constraints on the nature of the sources of
          reionisation.

          Title:   Time-Delay  Measurement  for  the  Quadruple  Lens  RX

          Comments: 17 pages, 13 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  have  measured  the  three  time  delays  for the quadruple
          gravitational   lens   RX   J1131-1231  using  two  seasons  of
          monitoring data. The short delays between cusp images are A-B =
          11.98  +1.52,-1.27  days  and  A-C = 9.61 +1.97,-1.57 days. The
          long  A-D  delay  for  the  counter  image  is not as precisely
          determined  because  of the season gaps, but the data suggest a
          delay  of  -87  +-  8  days.  The short delays are difficult to
          explain  using  standard  isothermal halo models of the lensing
          potential,  which  instead  prefer A-B and A-C delays of ~1 day
          for reasonable values of the Hubble constant. Matching the cusp
          delays  is  possible by adding a significant (~5 x 10^10 M_sun)
          amount of matter nearly coincident (~0.05" South-East) with the
          A  image. Adding such a satellite also helps improve the quasar
          and   lens  astrometry  of  the  model,  reduces  the  velocity
          dispersion  of  the  main  lens  and  shifts  it  closer to the
          Fundamental  Plane. This is suggestive of a satellite galaxy to
          the  primary lens, but its expected luminosity and proximity to
          both  image A and the system's bright Einstein ring make visual
          identification  impossible  even with the existing HST data. We
          also  find evidence for significant structure along the line of
          sight  toward  the lens. Archival Chandra observations show two
          nearby regions of extended X-ray emission, each with bolometric
          X-ray  luminosities  of 2-3 x 10^43 ergs/s. The brighter region
          is  located  153"  from  the  lens  and  centered  on  a  z=0.1
          foreground  cD  galaxy,  and  the  fainter  and presumably more
          distant  region  is 4-5 times closer (in angular separation) to
          the lens and likely corresponds to the weaker of two galaxy red
          sequences  (which includes the lens galaxy) previously detected
          at optical wavelengths.

          We  analyze  MegaZ-LRG, a new photometric-redshift catalogue of
          Luminous  Red  Galaxies (LRGs) based on the imaging data of the
          Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey (SDSS) 4th Data Release. MegaZ-LRG,
          presented  in  a  companion  paper, contains > 10^6 photometric
          redshifts  derived  with  ANNz,  an  Artificial  Neural Network
          method,  constrained  by  a spectroscopic sub-sample of ~13,000
          galaxies  obtained  by  the  2dF-SDSS  LRG  and  Quasar (2SLAQ)
          survey.  The  catalogue spans the redshift range 0.4<z<0.7 with
          an  r.m.s.  redshift  error  ~  0.03(1+z). We present the first
          cosmological  parameter  fits  to  galaxy angular power spectra
          from  a  photometric  redshift  survey.  Combining the redshift
          slices  with  appropriate  covariances, we determine the matter
          density  Omega_m and baryon density Omega_b in the combinations
          Omega_m  h  =  0.20+/-0.03  and  Omega_b/Omega_m = 0.14+/-0.04.
          These  results  are  in  agreement  with and independent of the
          latest  studies  of  the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation,
          and  their  precision is comparable to analyses of contemporary
          spectroscopic-redshift  surveys.  We find visual suggestions of
          baryon   oscillations   in   the  clustering  pattern,  with  a
          "model-independent"  statistical  significance  of  less than 3
          sigma. On the largest scales probed by the survey we measure an
          excess  of  power with respect to the model with a significance
          of  approximately  2  sigma.  We perform an extensive series of
          tests  which  conclude that our power spectrum measurements are
          robust  against  potential systematic photometric errors in the
          catalogue.  We  conclude  that photometric-redshift surveys are
          competitive    with   spectroscopic   surveys   for   measuring
          cosmological  parameters  in  the  simplest  "vanilla"  models.
          Future  deep  imaging  surveys have great potential for further
          improvement, provided that systematic errors can be controlled.

          We  construct rest-frame luminosity functions at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8,
          8 and 24 microns over the redshift range 0<z<2 for galaxies and
          0<z<4  for  optical  QSOs, using optical and infrared data from
          the  Spitzer  Wide-area  InfraRed Extragalactic survey. The 3.6
          and  4.5  micron galaxy LFs show evidence for moderate positive
          luminosity  evolution  up to z~1.5, consistent with the passive
          ageing   of   evolved   stellar   populations.  Their  comoving
          luminosity  density  was  found  to evolve passively, gradually
          increasing out to z~0.5-1 but flattening, or even declining, at
          higher  redshift. Conversely, the 24 micron galaxy LF, which is
          more  sensitive to obscured star formation and/or AGN activity,
          undergoes strong positive evolution, with the derived IR energy
          density  and  SFR  density  proportional  to  (1+z)^gamma  with
          gamma=4.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6}  and  the  majority  of  this evolution
          occurring  since  z~1.  Optical  QSOs,  however,  show positive
          luminosity evolution in all bands, out to the highest redshifts
          (3<z<4).  Modelling  as  L*  proportional  to  (1+z)^gamma gave
          gamma=1.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1}  at 3.6 micron, gamma=1.0^{+0.1}_{-0.1}
          at  4.5 micron and stronger evolution at the longer wavelengths
          (5.8,  8  and  24 micron), of gamma~3. Comparison of the galaxy

          Title:  Discovery  of the low-energy cutoff in a powerful giant
          radio galaxy
          Authors:  Katherine Blundell (Oxford), Andy Fabian (Cambridge),

          Celotti (SISSA)
          Comments: Accepted by Ap J Letters
          The  lobes  of  radio  galaxies  and  quasars,  fed by jets and
          hotspots,    represent    a    significant,    and    currently
          ill-constrained, source of energy input into the inter-galactic
          medium  (IGM). How much energy is input into the IGM depends on
          the  minimum  energy  to  which  the  power-law distribution of
          relativistic particles is accelerated in the hotspots. This has
          hitherto  been  unknown to within three orders of magnitude. We
          present  direct  evidence  for the discovery of this low-energy
          cutoff  in  the  lobe  of  a  Mpc-sized  radio  galaxy  via the
          existence of extended X-ray emission, inverse-Compton scattered
          from  aged  radio  plasma,  and  its  separation  by 80kpc from
          regions containing freshly accelerated plasma from the hotspot.
          The  low-energy cutoff of gamma ~ 10^4 in the hotspot is higher
          than  previously  thought,  but  reconciles  discrepancies with
          magnetic  field  estimates  which had been systematically lower
          than  equipartition  values.  The inverse Compton scattering of
          the  spent  synchrotron  plasma  is  at  the  expense of cosmic
          microwave   background   (CMB)   photons;  we  comment  on  the
          importance  of such giant radio galaxies as contaminants of CMB
          anisotropies.

          Authors: Neeraj Gupta, D.J. Saikia (NCRA, TIFR)
          Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We   examine   the   consistency  of  HI  properties  with  the
          unification  scheme  for  radio  galaxies  and quasars, and any
          correlation  with  the  symmetry parameters for a sample of CSS
          and  GPS  sources. In our sample, 15 out of 23 galaxies exhibit
          21-cm  absorption  as  against  1  out  of  9 quasars, which is
          broadly consistent with the unification scheme. Also there is a
          tendency  for  the detection rate as well as the column density
          for   galaxies   to  increase  with  core  prominence,  f_c,  a
          statistical indicator of the orientation of the jet axis to the
          line of sight. This can be understood in a scenario where radio
          sources  are larger than the scale of the circumnuclear HI disk
          so  that  the  lines  of  sight  to  the  lobes  at  very large
          inclinations  do  not  intersect  the  disk. The sources in our
          sample  also  exhibit  the  known  anti-correlation  between HI
          column density and source size. This suggests that small linear
          size,  along  with intermediate values of core prominence, is a
          good  recipe  for  detecting  21-cm  absorption  in CSS and GPS
          objects.  Some  of  the  absorption  could also be arising from
          clouds  which  may  have  interacted with the radio jet. The HI
          column  density  and  velocity  shift of the primary absorption
          component,  however,  show  no  dependence  on  the  degree  of
          misalignment and the separation ratio of the radio sources.

          Title:  Statistics  of  Cosmological  Black  Hole  Jet Sources:
          Blazar Predictions for GLAST
          Authors: Charles D. Dermer (1) ((1) NRL)
          Comments: 30 pages, 17 figures, submitted to ApJ
          A  study  of  the  statistics  of  cosmological  black-hole jet
          sources  is  applied  to EGRET blazar data, and predictions are
          made   for   GLAST.  Black-hole  jet  sources  are  modeled  as
          collimated  relativistic  outflows  with radiation beamed along
          the  jet  axis  due  to  strong  Doppler boosting. The comoving
          density  dependence  of  the  blazar  formation  rate  (BFR) is
          assumed  to  follow the cosmic star formation history or cosmic
          evolution  of IR-luminous galaxies. A parameter study of blazar
          redshift  and size distributions is presented using synchrotron
          and  external  Compton (EC) beaming factors for different BFRs.
          The  redshift and luminosity distributions of gamma-ray blazars
          observed with EGRET, separated into BL Lac object (BL) and flat
          spectrum  radio  quasar  (FSRQ)  distributions,  are  fit  with
          monoparametric  functions  for  the  distributions  of  the jet
          Lorentz  factor  Gamma,  comoving  directional  power l'_e, and
          spectral  slope.  The  detection characteristics of a telescope
          are  approximated  by  its  vF_v  sensitivity threshold f_\e at
          photon  frequency  v  =  m_e c^2\e/h. Values of \Gamma and l'_e
          that fit the data for FSRQs and BLs are estimated. Based on the
          EGRET   observations,  predictions  for  the  detectability  of
          blazars  with  GLAST are made. GLAST would detect a much larger
          fraction of BLs in its sample than found with EGRET but that BL
          evolution  must  be  negative in order that BLs not overproduce
          the  gamma-ray  background.  The FSRQ contribution to the EGRET
          extragalactic gamma-ray background is estimated at the level of

          Title:  The  UV spectrum of HS1700+6416 I. Predicting the metal
          line content of the far UV spectrum

          accepted for publication in A&A
          In  preparation  of  a  study  of the HeII/HI ratio towards the
          bright  QSO  HS1700+6416,  we predict the metal line content of
          the far-UV spectral range by modelling 18 metal absorption line
          systems  with redshifts 0.2<z<2.6 identified in the spectrum of
          this  quasar.  For  that  purpose,  we investigate the spectral
          energy  distribution  of  the  metagalactic  ionizing radiation
          field.  Simple  photoionization  models  based  on  8 different
          shapes  of  the ionizing background are tested for each system.
          The  adopted  energy  distributions comprise the Haardt & Madau
          (2001,  HM)  model  of  metagalactic  UV  background as well as
          typical  spectra  of AGN and starburst galaxies. The models are
          evaluated  and  the favoured one is estimated. We find that the
          majority  of  the  considered systems is best reproduced with a
          HM-like  ionizing  radiation,  where  the  HeII break, formally
          located  at  4  Ryd,  is  shifted  to  lower energies (~3 Ryd),
          probably  due  to  the  opacity of the higher HeII Lyman series
          lines.  The  remaining systems can be reasonably described with
          models  based on the unmodified HM background or the spectra of
          AGN  or starburst galaxies. This finding supports the idea that
          the UV background is spatially variable due to both IGM opacity
          variations and to local sources. In comparison to an unmodified
          HM  background, the resulting ionizing spectrum leads to carbon
          abundances  lower  by  ~0.5  dex.  Furthermore, if the ionizing
          radiation  field  as  determined  from  metal  line systems was
          typical for the IGM, the expected HeII/HI ratio would be 150 to
          190.

          Title:   Probing  radio  source  environments  via  HI  and  OH
          absorption

          Comments: Abridged abstract, 22 pages, 21 figures, submitted to
          MNRAS
          We  present  the  results  of HI and OH absorption measurements
          towards  a  sample  of  radio  sources  using the Arecibo 305-m
          telescope  and  the  GMRT.  In  total,  27  radio  sources were
          searched for associated 21-cm HI absorption. One totally new HI
          absorption  system was detected against the radio galaxy 3C258,
          while  five  previously  known  HI  absorption systems, and one
          galaxy   detected  in  emission,  were  studied  with  improved
          frequency resolution and/or sensitivity. Our sample included 17
          GPS  and  CSS  objects,  4 of which exhibit HI absorption. This
          detection  rate  of  ~25%  compares  with  a  value  of ~40% by
          Vermeulen  et  al.  for similar sources. We detected neither OH
          emission  nor  absorption  towards any of the sources that were
          observed  at  Arecibo,  and  estimate  a limit on the abundance
          ratio  of  N(HI)/N(OH)>4x10^6  for  3C258. We have combined our
          results  with those from other available HI searches to compile
          a  sample  of 96 radio sources consisting of 27 GPS, 35 CSS, 13
          flat spectrum and 21 large sources. The HI absorption detection
          rate  is  highest  (~45%) for the GPS sources and least for the
          large  sources.  We find HI column density to be anticorrelated
          with source size, as reported earlier by Pihlstr\"om et al. The
          HI  column  density  shows  no significant dependence on either
          redshift   or   luminosity,   which   are  themselves  strongly
          correlated.  These  results  suggest  that  the environments of
          radio  sources  on  GPS/CSS  scales  are  similar  at different
          redshifts.  Further, in accordance with the unification scheme,
          the GPS/CSS galaxies have an HI detection rate of ~40% which is
          significantly higher than the detection rate (~20%) towards the
          GPS/CSS  quasars.  Also,  the  principal (strongest) absorption
          component  detected towards GPS sources appears blue-shifted in
          ~65%  of  the cases, in agreement with the growing evidence for
          jet-cloud interactions.

          Title:  A  simple  model  for  the size-evolution of elliptical
          galaxies
          Authors: Sadegh Khochfar, Joseph Silk
          Comments: 4 pages, submitted to ApJ Letters
          We use semi-analytical modelling of galaxy formation to predict
          the  redshift-size-evolution  of  elliptical  galaxies. Using a
          simple  model in which relative sizes of elliptical galaxies of
          a  given  mass correlate with the fraction of stars formed in a
          star  burst  during  a  major  merger  event,  we  are  able to
          reproduce  the  observed  size  redshif  t  evolution. The size
          evolution  is  a  result  of  the  amount of cold gas available
          during the major merger. Mergers at high redshifts are gas-rich
          and  produce  ellipticals  with smaller sizes. In particular we
          find  a  power-law  relation  between  the  sizes  at different
          redshifts,  with  the  power-law  index giving a measure of the
          relative  amount of dissipation during the mergers that lead to
          the  formation of an elliptical. The size evolution is found to
          be  stronger for more massive galaxies as they involve more gas
          at  high  redshifts  when  they  form  compared to less massive
          ellipticals.  Local  ellipticals  more  massive  than $5 \times
          10^{11}$  M$_{\odot}$ will be approximately 4 times larger than
          their  counterparts  at  $z=2$.  Our  results indicate that the
          scatter  in  the size of similar massive present day elliptical
          galaxies  is  a  result  of their formation epoch, with smaller
          ellipticals being formed earlier.

          2006)
          We  report  the  detection  of  HCO+(1-0)  emission towards the
          Cloverleaf  quasar  (z=2.56) through observations with the Very
          Large  Array.  This is the first detection of ionized molecular
          gas  emission  at  high redshift (z>2). HCO+ emission is a star
          formation  indicator  similar  to  HCN, tracing dense molecular
          hydrogen  gas  (n(H_2)  ~=  10^5  cm^{-3})  within star-forming
          molecular  clouds.  We  derive  a  lensing-corrected  HCO+ line
          luminosity  of L'(HCO+) = 3.5 x 10^9 K km/s pc^2. Combining our
          new  results  with CO and HCN measurements from the literature,
          we  find  a  HCO+/CO  luminosity  ratio  of 0.08 and a HCO+/HCN
          luminosity  ratio  of 0.8. These ratios fall within the scatter
          of   the   same  relationships  found  for  low-z  star-forming
          galaxies.  However,  a HCO+/HCN luminosity ratio close to unity
          would  not  be  expected  for  the  Cloverleaf  if the recently
          suggested  relation  between  this  ratio  and the far-infrared
          luminosity  were to hold. We conclude that a ratio between HCO+
          and  HCN  luminosity  close to 1 is likely due to the fact that
          the emission from both lines is optically thick and thermalized
          and  emerges from dense regions of similar volumes. The CO, HCN
          and   HCO+  luminosities  suggest  that  the  Cloverleaf  is  a
          composite AGN--starburst system, in agreement with the previous
          finding that about 20% of the total infrared luminosity in this
          system  results  from dust heated by star formation rather than
          heating by the AGN. We conclude that HCO+ is potentially a good
          tracer for dense molecular gas at high redshift.

          Aims:  We  present  optical  spectroscopy of a sample of BL Lac
          objects,  to  determine  their  redshift,  to study their broad
          emission  line  properties  and  to  characterize  their  close
          environment.  Methods:  Twelve  objects were observed using the
          ESO 3.6m and the NOT 2.5m telescopes, obtaining spectra for the
          BL  Lacs  and  for  nearby sources. Results: For seven objects,
          nuclear  emission  lines  and/or absorption lines from the host
          galaxy  were  detected.  In all the four cases where absorption
          lines were revealed, the host galaxy has been resolved with HST
          or  ground-based  imaging.  The  broad H_alpha luminosities (or
          their  upper  limits)  of  the  BL Lacs are similar to those of
          radio-loud  quasars.  For  two  BL  Lacs, spectroscopy of close
          companions  indicates  that  they are at the redshift of the BL
          Lacs,   and   therefore   physically   associated   and  likely
          interacting. Five BL Lacs have a featureless spectrum. In these
          cases,  we  apply  a  new  technique to derive lower limits for
          their  redshift. which are consistent with lower limits deduced
          from imaging.

          Comments: criticisms appended at end
          The  aim  is  to  investigate  the  region  of  the  sky around
          NGC4410/Mrk1325  for  objects  which  are physically associated
          with  this  active, double nucleus galaxy. We use archived data
          to  study  the  placement,  brightness,  X-ray  properties  and
          redshifts  of objects within 60' of the bright, central galaxy.
          It  is  found that pairs of quasars are aligned across NGC 4410
          which,  if  ejected  from  it, have equal and opposite ejection
          velocities  and  fall  very  close  to  the  quantized Karlsson
          redshift  peaks  for  quasars.  X-ray  sources and Abell galaxy
          clusters  at higher redshifts appear elongated along directions
          away from NGC4410.

          Microquasars  (MQs)  present  emission over the whole spectrum,
          from  radio wavelengths to gamma-rays. The microquasar spectral
          energy  distribution  is very complex, being a signature of the
          different   physical  processes  that  generate  the  radiation
          emitted  by these objects. In this work, we estimate the amount
          of   broad-band  emission  produced  by  relativistic  protons,
          released  from  the  jet of a MQ, interacting with high density
          regions  of  the ISM. We show that a two components source, the
          microquasar  itself  and  the region of interaction between the
          jets  and  the ISM, could be unveiled by the new instruments at
          high-energy and very high-energy gamma-rays.

          Title: Reionization from cosmic string loops
          Authors: Ken D. Olum, Alexander Vilenkin
          Comments: 7 pp., RevTeX, no figures
          Loops  formed from a cosmic string network at early times would
          act  as  seeds  for  early formation of halos, which would form
          galaxies  and  lead  to  early  reionization.  With  reasonable
          guesses  about  astrophysical and string parameters, the cosmic
          string  scale  $G\mu$  must  be  no  more  than  about $3\times
          10^{-8}$ to avoid conflict with the reionization redshift found
          by WMAP. The bound is much stronger for superstring models with
          a  small  string  reconnection probability. For values near the
          bound,  cosmic string loops may explain the discrepancy between
          the WMAP value and theoretical expectations.

          very  probably,  high-energy  gamma-ray  emitters. We propose a

          predictions  for jet emission at different energies and provide
          with  physical  information of the object using multiwavelength

          non-negligible  fraction  of the observed galactic cosmic rays.
          The  protons  accelerated at the jet termination shock interact
          with  the interstellar medium and may produce extended emission
          detectable at different energy bands through several processes:
          neutral  pion-decay  produce  high-energy  and very high-energy
          gamma-rays,  secondary electrons produced by charged pion-decay
          generate  synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission. In addition,
          the jets of MQs themselves are likely sources of gamma-rays. We
          discuss  about  the  association  between the intrinsic and the
          indirect emission coming from these objects.

          radio to very high-energy gamma-rays

          conference: Relativistic Astrophysics and Cosmology: Einstein's
          Legacy
          Microquasars  are  X-ray  binaries  with relativistic jets. The
          microquasar  LS  5039  turned  out  to be the first high-energy
          gamma-ray  microquasar  candidate due to its likely association
          with  the  EGRET  source  3EG  J1824-1514.  Further theoretical
          studies  supported this association, which could be extended to
          other  EGRET  sources.  Very  recently, Aharonian et al. (2005)
          have  communicated  the detection of the microquasar LS 5039 at
          TeV  energies.  This fact confirms the EGRET source association
          and leaves no doubt about the gamma-ray emitting nature of this
          object. The aim of the present work is to show that, applying a
          cold-matter  dominated  jet  model to LS 5039, we can reproduce
          many  of the spectral and variability features observed in this
          source.  Jet  physics is explored, and some physical quantities
          are  estimated  as  a  by-product  of  the  performed modeling.
          Although  at  the  moment only LS 5039 has been detected on the
          entire electromagnetic spectrum, it does not seem unlikely that
          other  microquasars  will  show  similar  spectral  properties.
          Therefore,   an   in-depth   study   of   the  first  gamma-ray
          microquasar,  on theoretical grounds supported by observations,
          can render a useful knowledge applicable elsewhere.

          redshifted  to  43.6  GHz.  As  opposed to the faint rotational
          transitions   of  HCN  (the  standard  high-density  tracer  at

          maser-amplified   H_2O(3_13-2_20)  and  the  thermally  excited
          CO(1-0)  transitions may be as high as factor of 20 (but has to
          be corrected by their relative filling factor). MG 0751+2716 is
          a  strong  CO(4-3)  emitter,  and  therefore  one  of  the most
          suitable  targets to search for H_2O(3_13-2_20) at cosmological
          redshifts.  Our  search  resulted  in  an  upper  limit in line
          luminosity  of  L'(H_2O)  <  0.6 x 10^9 K km/s pc^2. Assuming a
          brightness  temperature  of  T_b(H_2O)  ~=  500 K for the maser
          emission and CO properties from the literature, this translates
          to  a  H_2O(3_13-2_20)/CO(4-3) area filling factor of less than
          1%.  However,  this  limit  is not valid if the H_2O(3_13-2_20)
          maser  emission is quenched, i.e. if the line is only thermally
          excited.  We  conclude  that,  if  our results were to hold for
          other  high-z  sources,  H_2O  does  not  appear  to  be a more
          luminous  alternative  to  HCN  to  detect  high-density gas in
          star-forming environments at high redshift.

          Title:  Recognizing  the  Rirst Radiation Sources Through Their
          21-cm Signature
          Authors: Leonid Chuzhoy Marcelo Alvarez Paul Shapiro
          Comments: 4 pages, submitted to ApJL
          At  the  beginning of the reionization epoch, radiation sources
          produce  fluctuations  in  the  redshifted 21-cm background. We
          show  that different types of sources (such as miniquasars, Pop
          II and III stars, supernovae, etc.) produce distinct signatures
          in   the   21-cm   signal   radial   profiles  and  statistical
          fluctuations, through which they can be identified. Further, we
          show  that the 21-cm signal from X-ray emitting sources is much
          easier  to  observe  than  was  expected,  due  to a previously
          neglected pumping mechanism.

          The  escape  fraction  of  ionizing  photons from galaxies is a
          crucial  quantity  controlling  the  cosmic ionizing background
          radiation  and  the  reionization.  Various  estimates  of this
          parameter can be obtained in the redshift range, z=0--6, either
          from   direct   observations  or  from  the  observed  ionizing
          background  intensities. We compare them homogeneously in terms
          of  the  observed flux density ratio of ionizing ($\sim900$ \AA
          rest-frame)   to   non-ionizing   ultraviolet  ($\sim1500$  \AA
          rest-frame)  corrected  for  the  intergalactic absorption. The
          escape  fraction is found to increase by an order of magnitude,
          from a value less than 0.01 at $z\la1$ to about 0.1 at $z\ga4$.

          The jet in 3C273 is a high-power quasar jet with radio, optical
          and  X-ray  emission whose size and brightness allow a detailed
          study  of  the emission processes acting in it. We present deep
          Chandra  observations  of  this  jet  and  analyse the spectral
          properties  of  the  jet emission from radio through X-rays. We
          find  that  the X-ray spectra are significantly softer than the
          radio  spectra  in  all  regions  of the bright part of the jet
          except  for  the  first  bright "knot A", ruling out a model in
          which the X-ray emission from the entire jet arises from beamed
          inverse-Compton   scattering  of  cosmic  microwave  background
          photons  in a single-zone jet flow. Within two-zone jet models,
          we find that a synchrotron origin for the jet's X-rays requires
          fewer  additional  assumptions  than  an inverse-Compton model,
          especially  if  velocity  shear  leads  to  efficient  particle
          acceleration in jet flows.

          We  have performed infrared imaging of the jet of the quasar 3C
          273  at wavelengths 3.6 and 5.8 microns with the Infrared Array
          Camera  (IRAC)  on  the  Spitzer Space Telescope. When combined
          with  the  radio,  optical  and  X-ray  measurements,  the IRAC
          photometry clearly shows that the optical emission is dominated
          by  the  high-energy  component  of  the  jet, not by the radio
          synchrotron  component,  as  had  been  assumed  to  date.  The
          high-energy  component  may  be  due  to  a  second synchrotron
          component or to IC scattering of ambient photons. In the former
          case, we argue that the acceleration of protons exceeding 10^16
          eV  or  possibly  even to 10^19 eV would be taking place in the
          jet.  In contrast, the IC model, into which highly relativistic
          Doppler   beaming   has   to  be  incorporated,  requires  very
          low-energy  electrons  (~ 1 MeV). The present polarization data
          in  the radio and optical would favor the former interpretation
          in  the  case  of  the  3C  273  jet.  Sensitive  and  detailed
          measurements of optical polarization are important to establish
          the   radiation   mechanism  responsible  for  the  high-energy
          emission.  The  present  study  offers  new  clues  as  to  the
          controversial  origin of the X-ray emission seen in many quasar
          jets.

          Authors: Kanan K. Datta, T. Roy Choudhury, Somnath Bharadwaj
          Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures
          Observations  of  redshifted  21cm  radiation  from  HI at high
          redshifts  is  an  important  future  probe of reionization. We
          consider  the  Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum (MAPS) to
          quantify the statistics of the HI signal as a joint function of
          the angular multipole l and frequency separation \Delta\nu. The
          signal   at  two  different  frequencies  is  expected  to  get
          decorrelated  as  \Delta\nu  is increased, and quantifying this
          decorrelation   is   particularly  important  in  deciding  the
          frequency  resolution  for future HI observations. This is also
          expected  to  play a very crucial role in extracting the signal
          from  foregrounds as the signal is expected to decorrelate much
          faster  than  the  foregrounds  (which  are  largely  continuum
          sources)  with  increasing  \Delta\nu. In this paper we develop
          formulae relating the MAPS to different components of the three
          dimensional  HI  power spectrum taking into account HI peculiar
          velocities.  We show that the flat-sky approximation provides a
          very  good  representation over the angular scales of interest,
          and  a  final  expression which is very simple to calculate and
          interpret. We present results considering two models for the HI
          distribution,  namely,  (i)  DM:  where  the HI traces the dark
          matter  and  (ii)  PR: where the effects of patchy reionization
          are incorporated through two parameters. We find that while the
          DM  signal  is  largely featureless, the PR signal peaks at the
          angular  scales  of  the  individual bubbles, and the signal is
          considerably  enhanced for large bubble size. For most cases of
          interest  at  l  \sim  100  the  signal  is uncorrelated beyond
          \Delta\nu  \sim  1  MHz  or even less, whereas it occurs around
          \sim  0.1  MHz  at  l  \sim 10^3. The \Delta\nu dependence also
          carries  an  imprint  of  the  bubble size and the bias, and is
          expected  to be an important probe of the reionization scenario
          (abridged).

          Comments: 11 pages with 4 figures
          Microquasars   are   binary   star  systems  with  relativistic
          radio-emitting  jets. They are potential sources of cosmic rays
          and  laboratories  for  elucidating the physics of relativistic
          jets.  Here  we  report  the  detection  of  variable gamma-ray
          emission above 100 gigaelectron volts from the microquasar LS I
          +61  303.  Six orbital cycles were recorded. Several detections
          occur  at  a  similar orbital phase, suggesting the emission is
          periodic. The strongest gamma-ray emission is not observed when
          the  two  stars  are  closest to one another, implying a strong
          orbital modulation of the emission or the absorption processes.

          We   present  a  systematic  analysis  of  archival  HST  WFPC2
          ``Association''  data  sets  that  correlate  with  the Chandra
          positions of a set of 44 ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) of
          nearby  galaxies.  We  have  improved  the Chandra-HST relative
          astrometry  whenever  possible.  Disparate numbers of potential
          ULX  counterparts  are found, and in some cases none are found.
          The  lack of or low number of counterparts in some cases may be
          due  to insufficient depth in the WFPC2 images. Particularly in
          late-type  galaxies,  the HST image in the ULX region was often
          complex  or crowded. We therefore address various scenarios for
          the  nature  of the ULX since it is not known which, if any, of
          the   sources   found   are   true  counterparts.  The  optical
          luminosities  of  the sources are typically in the range 10^4-6
          L_sun.  In  several  cases color information is available, with
          the  colors  roughly  tending  to  be  more  red  in early-type
          galaxies.  This  suggests  that,  in  general,  the (potential)
          counterparts  found  in  early-type  galaxies  are likely to be
          older  stellar populations, and are probably globular clusters.
          Several  early-type galaxy counterparts have blue colors, which
          may be due to younger stellar populations in the host galaxies,
          however  these  could  also  be  background  sources. In spiral
          galaxies  the sources may also be due to localized structure in
          the disks rather than bound stellar systems. Alternatively some
          of  the  counterparts  in  late-type  galaxies  may be isolated
          supergiant  stars.  The  observed  X-ray/optical  flux ratio is
          diluted  by  the optical emission of the cluster in cases where
          the system is an X-ray binary in a cluster, particularly in the
          case of a low-mass X-ray binaries in old cluster. (abridged)

          We  present  an  algorithm  for  selecting an uniform sample of
          gravitationally  lensed  quasar  candidates  from  low-redshift
          (0.6<z<2.2)   quasars  brighter  than  i=19.1  that  have  been
          spectroscopically  identified  in  the SDSS. Our algorithm uses
          morphological   and  color  selections  that  are  intended  to
          identify  small- and large-separation lenses, respectively. Our
          selection  algorithm  only  relies  on parameters that the SDSS
          standard image processing pipeline generates, allowing easy and
          fast  selection  of  lens  candidates.  The  algorithm has been
          tested against simulated SDSS images, which adopt distributions
          of field and quasar parameters taken from the real SDSS data as
          input.   Furthermore,   we  take  differential  reddening  into
          account.  We  find  that  our  selection  algorithm  is  almost
          complete down to separations of 1'' and flux ratios of 10^-0.5.
          The  algorithm  selects  both double and quadruple lenses. At a
          separation  of 2'', doubles and quads are selected with similar
          completeness,  and  above (below) 2'' the selection of quads is
          better  (worse)  than  for doubles. Our morphological selection
          identifies  a  non-negligible  fraction  of  single quasars: To
          remove  these  we  fit images of candidates with a model of two
          point  sources  and  reject  those  with  unusually small image
          separations  and/or large magnitude differences between the two
          point  sources.  We  estimate  the  efficiency of our selection
          algorithm  to  be at least 8% at image separations smaller than
          2'',  comparable  to  that  of  radio  surveys.  The efficiency
          declines  as  the image separation increases, because of larger
          contamination  from  stars.  We  also present the magnification
          factor  of lensed images as a function of the image separation,
          which is needed for accurate computation of magnification bias.

          We  present  SEDs, Spitzer colours, and IR luminosities for 850
          micron  selected  galaxies in the GOODS-N field. Using the deep
          Spitzer  Legacy  images  and  new  data  and  reductions of the
          VLA-HDF  radio  data, we find statistically secure counterparts
          for  60  per  cent  (21/35)  of  our submm sample, and identify

          largest  sample  of  submm  galaxies  with statistically secure
          counterparts  detected  in  the radio and with Spitzer. We find
          that  in  most  cases the 850 micron emission is dominated by a
          single  24 micron source. A composite rest-frame SED shows that
          the  submm  sources  peak  at  longer wavelengths than those of
          local  ULIRGs of the same luminosity and therefore appear to be
          cooler.  The  SEDs  of  submm  galaxies are also different from
          those  of  their high redshift neighbours, the near-IR selected
          BzK galaxies, whose mid-IR to radio SEDs are more like those of
          local   ULIRGs.  Using  24  micron.  850  micron  and  1.4  GHz
          observations,  we  fit  templates  that span the mid-IR through
          radio  to  derived  the  integrated  IR luminosity of the submm
          galaxies. By themselves, 24 micron and radio fluxes are able to
          predict   LIR  reasonably  well  because  they  are  relatively
          insensitive  to  temperature. However, the submm flux by itself
          consistently  overpredicts  LIR  when  using spectral templates
          which obey the local ULIRG temperature-luminosity relation. The
          shorter  Spitzer  wavelengths  sample  the  stellar bump at the
          redshifts  of  the  submm sources, and we find that the Spitzer
          photometry  alone  provides a model independent estimate of the
          redshift.  Using  X-ray and mid-IR data, only 5 per cent of our
          secure counterparts show strong evidence for an active galactic
          nucleus dominating the IR luminosity.

          We  report  the  discovery  of  five  new  dwarf novae from the
          Hamburg  Quasar Survey (HQS), and discuss the properties of the
          sample  of  dwarf  novae in the HQS. The orbital periods of the
          new  dwarf  novae are ~105.1 min or ~109.9 min, 114.3+-2.7 min,
          92.66+-0.17  min,  272.317+-0.001  min,  258.02+-0.56  min  for
          HS0417+7445,   HS1016+3412,   HS1340+1524,   HS1857+7127,   and
          HS2214+2845, respectively. HS1857+7127 is found to be partially
          eclipsing.  In  HS2214+2845 the secondary star of spectral type
          M3+-1  is clearly detected, and we estimate the distance to the
          system to be d=390+-40 pc. We recorded one superoutburst of the
          SU  UMa  system  HS0417+7445.  HS1016+3412 and HS1340+1524 have
          rare   outbursts,   and  their  subtype  is  yet  undetermined.
          HS1857+7127  frequently  varies  in  brightness  and may be a Z
          Cam-type  dwarf  nova.  HS2214+2845  is a U Gem-type dwarf nova
          with  a most likely cycle length of 71 d. To date, 14 new dwarf
          novae   have   been   identified  in  the  HQS.  The  ratio  of
          short-period  (<3  h)  to  long-period  (>3  h) systems of this
          sample  is 1.3, much smaller compared to the ratio of 2.7 found
          for  all  known  dwarf  novae.  The  HQS  dwarf  novae  display
          typically   infrequent   or  low-amplitude  outburst  activity,
          underlining   the   strength   of  spectroscopic  selection  in
          identifying  new  CVs  independently  of their variability. The
          spectroscopic properties of short-period CVs in the HQS suggest
          that  most  of  them  are  still  evolving  towards the minimum
          period.  Their  total  number  agrees  with  the predictions of
          population  models  within  an order of magnitude. However, the
          bulk  of  all CVs is predicted to have evolved past the minimum
          period,   and   those   systems   remain   unidentified.  Those
          post-bounce  systems  may  have  markedly weaker Hbeta emission
          lines  compared  to  the  average  known  short-period CVs, and
          probably undergo no or extremely rare outbursts.

          Jets  from  young  stars  represent  one  of  the most striking
          signposts of star formation. The phenomenon has been researched
          for  over  two  decades and there is now general agreement that
          such  jets  are  generated  as  a by-product of accretion; most
          likely  by  the  accretion  disk  itself.  Thus they mimic what
          occurs  in  more  exotic objects such as active galactic nuclei
          and  micro-quasars.  The precise mechanism for their production
          however  remains  a  mystery.  To  a  large degree, progress is
          hampered  observationally  by  the  embedded nature of many jet
          sources  as  well  as  a  lack  of  spatial  resolution:  Crude
          estimates,  as  well as more sophisticated models, nevertheless
          suggest  that  jets  are accelerated and focused on scales of a
          few AU at most.
          It  is only in the past few years however that we have begun to
          probe  such  scales  in detail using classical T Tauri stars as
          touchstones.  Application  of adaptive optics, data provided by
          the    HST,    use    of   specialised   techniques   such   as
          spectro-astrometry,  and the development of spectral diagnostic
          tools,  are  beginning  to  reveal conditions in the jet launch
          zone.  This  has helped enormously to constrain models. Further
          improvements  in  the  quality  of  the  observational data are
          expected  when  the  new  generation  of  interferometers  come
          on-line.  Here  we review some of the most dramatic findings in
          this area since Protostars and Planets~IV including indications
          for jet rotation, i.e. that they transport angular momentum. We
          will also show how measurements, such as those of width and the
          velocity  field close to the source, suggest jets are initially
          launched as warm magneto-centrifugal disk winds. (abridged)

          Title: Transverse and longitudinal correlation functions in the
          Intergalactic  Medium  from  32  close  pairs  of high-redshift

          will be published online only
          We  present  the  transverse  flux  correlation function of the
          Lyman-alpha  forest  in quasar absorption spectra at z~2.1 from
          VLT-FORS  and  VLT-UVES  observations of a total of 32 pairs of
          quasars;  26  pairs  with  separations in the range 0.6<theta<4
          arcmin  and  6  pairs  with  4<theta<10  arcmin. Correlation is
          detected  at the 3sigma level up to separations of the order of
          ~4   arcmin   (or   ~4.4  h^{-1}  Mpc  comoving  at  z=2.1  for
          Omega_{m}=0.3  and  Omega_{Lambda}=0.7).  We have, furthermore,
          measured  the  longitudinal  correlation function at a somewhat
          higher  mean  redshift (z=2.39) from 20 lines of sight observed
          with  high  spectral  resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio
          with   VLT-UVES.   We   compare  the  observed  transverse  and
          longitudinal   correlation  functions  to  that  obtained  from
          numerical  simulations  and  illustrate  the effect of spectral
          resolution,  thermal broadening and peculiar motions. The shape
          and correlation length of the correlation functions are in good
          agreement   with   those   expected   from  absorption  by  the
          filamentary  and sheet-like structures in the photoionized warm
          intergalactic   medium   predicted   in   CDM-like  models  for
          structures  formation.  Using  a  sample  of 139 C_{iv} systems
          detected  along  the lines of sight toward the pairs of quasars
          we also investigate the transverse correlation of metals on the
          same  scales.  The  observed transverse correlation function of
          intervening  C_{iv}  absorption systems is consistent with that
          of  a  randomly  distributed  population  of absorbers. This is
          likely  due  to  the small number of pairs with separation less
          than 2 arcmin. We detect, however, a significant overdensity of
          systems  in  the  sightlines  towards the quartet Q0103-294A&B,
          Q0102-2931  and Q0102-293 which extends over the redshift range
          1.5<z<2.2 and an angular scale larger than 10 arcmin.

          Title:  Population III Generated Cosmic Rays and the Production
          of Li6
          Authors: Emmanuel Rollinde, Elisabeth Vangioni, Keith A. Olive
          Comments: 9 pages 8 figures
          We  calculate  the  evolution of Li6 generated from cosmic rays
          produced   by   an  early  population  of  massive  stars.  The
          computation  is  performed  in  the  framework  of hierarchical
          structure  formation  and  is  based  on  cosmic star formation
          histories  constrained to reproduce the observed star formation
          rate  at  redshift z \la 6, the observed chemical abundances in
          damped  Lyman  alpha absorbers and in the intergalactic medium,
          and to allow for an early reionization of the Universe at z\sim
          11  by  Pop  III  stars  as indicated by the third year results
          released  by  WMAP.  We show that the pregalactic production of
          the  Li6 isotope in the IGM via these Pop III stars can account
          for  the  Li6 plateau observed in metal poor halo stars without
          additional  over-production  of  Li7. Our results depend on the
          efficiency of cosmic rays to propagate out of minihalos and the
          fraction of supernovae energy deposited in cosmic rays. We also
          compute  the  cosmic ray heating of the IGM gas. In general, we
          find somewhat high temperatures (of order 10^5 K) implying that
          the  cosmic  rays  production  of  Li6  may  be  required to be
          confined to the so-called warm-hot IGM.

          S.Maurogordato and J. Tran Than h Van editors
          Combined   investigations   of  the  clustering  properties  of
          galaxies  of  different spectral type and high-redshift quasars
          strongly  suggest local ellipticals to be the parent population
          of  optically bright Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, the
          picture gets more blurred when one extends the analysis to that
          class  of  AGNs  which  show  enhanced  radio emission. Objects
          belonging to this class in fact are found to be associated with
          structures  which  are about an order of magnitude more massive
          than  those  that  host  radio-quiet AGNs. Also, masses for the
          black  holes engines of radio-enhanced AGN emission turn out to
          be   systematically  higher  than  those  which  fuel  'normal'
          quasars.  On  the  other  hand,  the level of radio-activity in
          radio-luminous objects does not seem to be connected with black
          hole/host  galaxy  mass,  at  variance  with  what found in the
          optical  case.  These  results,  together  with  evidences  for
          different  cosmological  evolutions  of different types of AGNs
          pose  a  serious  challenge  to  all  those  models  aiming  at
          providing a unified picture for black hole-powered sources.

          S. Larsen (Springer, New York), 2006
          Mergers  of  gas-rich  galaxies  lead to gravitationally driven
          increases  in  gas  pressure that can trigger intense bursts of
          star  and  cluster formation. Although star formation itself is
          clustered,   most   newborn   stellar  aggregates  are  unbound
          associations  and disperse. Gravitationally bound star clusters
          that survive for at least 10-20 internal crossing times (~20-40
          Myr)  are relatively rare and seem to contain <10% of all stars
          formed  in  the  starbursts.  The  most  massive young globular
          clusters  formed  in present-day mergers exceed omega Cen by an
          order  of  magnitude in mass, yet appear to have normal stellar
          initial mass functions.
          In  the  local universe, recent remnants of major gas-rich disk
          mergers  appear as protoelliptical galaxies with subpopulations
          of  typically  100-1000  young  metal-rich globular clusters in
          their   halos.   The   evidence   is   now  strong  that  these
          "second-generation"   globular   clusters   formed  from  giant
          molecular  clouds  in the merging disks, squeezed into collapse
          by  large-scale  shocks  and  high  gas pressure rather than by
          high-velocity   cloud-cloud   collisions.   Similarly,   first-
          generation  metal-poor globular clusters may have formed during
          cosmological  reionization from low-metallicity giant molecular
          clouds squeezed by the universal reionization pressure.

          Title:   Fe  II  Emission  in  14  Low-Redshift  Quasars:  I  -
          Observations
          Authors:  Yumihiko  Tsuzuki,  Kimiaki  Kawara,  Yuzuru  Yoshii,
          Shinki Oyabu, Toshihiko Tanabe, Yoshiki Matsuoka
          Comments: 50 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  present  the  spectra of 14 quasars with a wide coverage of
          rest  wavelengths from 1000 to 7300 A. The redshift ranges from
          z  =  0.061  to 0.555 and the luminosity from M_{B} = -22.69 to
          -26.32.  We  describe  the procedure of generating the template
          spectrum  of  Fe  II  line  emission  from  the  spectrum  of a
          narrow-line  Seyfert 1 galaxy I Zw 1 that covers two wavelength
          regions  of  2200-3500  A  and  4200-5600 A. Our template Fe II
          spectrum  is  semi-empirical  in  the  sense that the synthetic
          spectrum  calculated  with  the  CLOUDY photoionization code is
          used  to  separate  the Fe II emission from the Mg II line. The
          procedure of measuring the strengths of Fe II emission lines is
          twofold;  (1)  subtracting  the continuum components by fitting
          models  of  the  power-law and Balmer continua in the continuum
          windows  which are relatively free from line emissions, and (2)
          fitting  models  of  the  Fe  II  emission  based  on the Fe II
          template  to the continuum-subtracted spectra. From 14 quasars,
          we  obtained  the  Fe  II  fluxes in five wavelength bands, the
          total  flux  of  Balmer  continuum,  and  the  fluxes of Mg II,
          Halpha,  and other emission lines, together with the full width
          at  half maxima (FWHMs) of these lines. Regression analysis was
          performed  by  assuming  a  linear  relation between any two of
          these   quantities.   Eight  correlations  were  found  with  a
          confidence  level  higher  than 99%. The fact that six of these
          eight  are related to FWHM or M_{BH} may imply that M_{BH} is a
          fundamental quantity that controls Gamma or the spectral energy
          distribution  (SED)  of  the  incident continuum, which in turn
          controls  the  Fe  II  emission.  Furthermore,  it is worthy of
          noting  that  Fe II(O1)/Fe II(U1) is found to tightly correlate
          with Fe II(O1)/Mg II, but not with Fe II(U1)/Mg II.

          High-resolution  colour  images  of  NGC  7424  from the Gemini
          observations are available at this http URL
          We  have  studied  the face-on, barred spiral NGC 7424 (site of
          the  rare  Type  IIb  SN  2001ig)  with Chandra, Gemini and the
          Australia  Telescope  Compact Array. After giving revised X-ray
          colours  and luminosity of the supernova, here we focus on some
          other  interesting  sources  in  the galaxy: in particular, our
          serendipitous  discovery  of  two  ultraluminous  X-ray sources
          (ULXs). The brighter one (~ 10^{40} erg/s) has a power-law-like
          spectrum  with  photon index Gamma ~ 1.8. The other ULX shows a
          spectral  state  transition or outburst between the two Chandra
          observations, 20 days apart. Optical data show that this ULX is
          located  in  a young (age ~ 7-10 Myr), bright complex rich with
          OB  stars  and  clusters.  An  exceptionally bright, unresolved
          radio source (0.14 mJy at 4.79 GHz, implying a radio luminosity
          twice  as  high as Cas A) is found slightly offset from the ULX
          (~  80  pc).  Its  radio  spectral  index alpha ~ -0.7 suggests
          optically-thin   synchrotron  emission,  either  from  a  young
          supernova remnant or from a radio lobe powered by a ULX jet. An
          even  brighter,  unresolved radio source (0.22 mJy at 4.79 GHz)
          is  found  in  another  young,  massive  stellar  complex,  not
          associated  with  any X-ray sources: based on its flatter radio
          spectral  index  (alpha  ~ -0.3), we suggest that it is a young
          pulsar wind nebula, a factor of 10 more radio luminous than the
          Crab.

          Title:  Quasars  Probing Quasars II: The Anisotropic Clustering
          of Optically Thick Absorbers around Quasars
          Authors:  Joseph  F.  Hennawi (UC Berkeley), Jason X. Prochaska
          (UCO/Lick)
          Comments: 14 pages of emulateapj, 7 figures, submitted to ApJ
          With   close   pairs  of  quasars  at  different  redshifts,  a
          background  quasar  sightline can be used to study a foreground
          quasar's  environment  in  absorption.  We  used a sample of 17
          Lyman  limit  systems  with  column  density N_HI > 10^19 cm^-2
          selected   from   149  projected  quasar  pair  sightlines,  to
          investigate the clustering pattern of optically thick absorbers
          around  luminous  quasars at z ~ 2.5. Specifically, we measured
          the  quasar-absorber  correlation  function  in  the transverse
          direction,   and   found   a  comoving  correlation  length  of
          r_0=9.2_{+1.5}_{-1.7}  Mpc/h  (comoving)  assuming  a power law
          correlation  function, with gamma=1.6. Applying this transverse
          clustering  strength to the line-of-sight, would predict that ~
          15-50% of all quasars should show a N_HI > 10^19 cm^-2 absorber
          within  a  velocity  window of v < 3000 km/s. This overpredicts
          the  number  of  absorbers  along  the line-of-sight by a large
          factor,  providing  compelling  evidence  that  the  clustering
          pattern  of  optically thick absorbers around quasars is highly
          anisotropic.  The  most plausible explanationfor the anisotropy
          is   that  the  transverse  direction  is  less  likely  to  be
          illuminated  by  ionizing  photons  than the line-of-sight, and
          that    absorbers    along    the   line-of-sight   are   being
          photoevaporated.  A  simple  model  for the photoevaporation of
          absorbers   subject  to  the  ionizing  flux  of  a  quasar  is
          presented, and it is shown that absorbers with volume densities
          n_H  < 0.1 cm^-3 will be photoevaporated if they lie within ~ 1
          Mpc  (proper) of a luminous quasar. Using this simple model, we
          illustrate  how comparisons of the transverse and line-of-sight
          clustering  around  quasars can ultimately be used to constrain
          the  distribution  of  gas  in  optically thick absorption line
          systems.

          Title:   Cosmic  reionization  constraints  on  the  nature  of
          cosmological perturbations
          Authors: Pedro P. Avelino, Andrew R. Liddle
          Comments: 5 pages, 5 figures
          We   study   the   reionization  history  of  the  Universe  in
          cosmological  models  with  non-Gaussian  density fluctuations,
          taking   them  to  have  a  renormalized  $\chi^2$  probability
          distribution  function parametrized by the number of degrees of
          freedom,  $\nu$.  We  compute  the  ionization  history using a
          simple semi-analytical model, considering various possibilities
          for  the  astrophysics  of  reionization.  In all our models we
          require  that  reionization  is  completed  prior  to $z=6$, as
          required by the measurement of the Gunn--Peterson optical depth
          from  the spectra of high-redshift quasars. We confirm previous
          results  demonstrating  that  such  a non-Gaussian distribution
          leads  to  a  slower  reionization  as compared to the Gaussian
          case.   We   further  show  that  the  recent  WMAP  three-year
          measurement  of  the  optical depth due to electron scattering,
          $\tau=0.09  \pm 0.03$, weakly constrains the allowed deviations
          from  Gaussianity  on the small scales relevant to reionization
          if  a  constant  spectral index is assumed. We also confirm the
          need  for  a  significant  suppression  of  star  formation  in
          mini-halos, which increases dramatically as we decrease $\nu$.

          Title: Quasar Structure and Cosmological Feedback
          Authors: Martin Elvis
          Comments:  8 pages, 3 figures (1 color, 575K). To appear in the
          Proceedings  of  the  Workshop  on  "AGN and Galaxy Evolution",
          Specola Vaticana, Castel Gandolfo, May-June 2005 (Mem. S.A.It.)
          Feedback  from  quasars and AGNs is being invoked frequently in
          several  cosmological  settings. Currently, order of magnitude,
          or  more,  uncertainties  in the structure of both the wind and
          the  'obscuring  torus'  make  predictions highly uncertain. To
          make  testable  models  of  this  'cosmological feedback' it is
          essential   to   understand  the  detailed  structure  of  AGNs
          sufficiently  well  to  predict  their properties for the whole
          quasar  population, at all redshifts. Progress in both areas is
          rapid,  and  I  describe  the  near-term prospects for reducing
          these uncertainties for 'slow' (non-relativistic) AGN winds and
          the obscuring torus.

          Relativistic outflows represent one of the best-suited tools to
          probe  the  physics  of  AGN.  Numerical  modelling of internal
          structure   of  the  relativistic  outflows  on  parsec  scales
          provides  important  clues about the conditions and dynamics of
          the  material  in  the  immediate vicinity of the central black
          holes  in AGN. We investigate possible causes of the structural
          patterns  and  regularities observed in the parsec-scale jet of
          the  well-known quasar 3C 273. We present here the results from
          a  3D  relativistic hydrodynamics numerical simulation based on
          the  parameters  given  for the jet by Lobanov & Zensus (2001),
          and  one  in  which  the  effects  of  jet  precession  and the
          injection  of discrete components have been taken into account.
          We  compare  the  model  with the structures observed in 3C 273
          using very long baseline interferometry and constrain the basic
          properties  of  the flow. We find growing perturbation modes in
          the  simulation with similar wavelengths to those observed, but
          with a different set of wave speeds and mode identification. If
          the  observed  longest  helical  structure  is  produced by the
          precession  of  the  flow,  longer precession periods should be
          expected. Our results show that some of the observed structures
          could be explained by growing Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in
          a  slow  moving  region  of  the jet. However, we point towards
          possible  errors  in the mode identification that show the need
          of  more  complete  linear  analysis  in order to interpret the
          observations.  We  conclude that, with the given viewing angle,
          superluminal  components  and jet precession cannot explain the
          observed structures.

          This  paper  addresses  the  origin  of  the far-infrared (FIR)
          continuum  of  QSOs,  based  on  the Quasar and ULIRG Evolution
          Study (QUEST) of nearby QSOs and ULIRGs using observations with
          the  Spitzer Space Telescope. For 27 Palomar-Green QSOs at z <~
          0.3,  we derive luminosities of diagnostic lines ([NeII]12.8um,
          [NeV]14.3um,   [OIV]25.9um)  and  emission  features  (PAH7.7um
          emission  which  is  related  to  star  formation),  as well as
          continuum  luminosities  over  a  range of mid- to far-infrared
          wavelengths  between  6  and  60um.  We  detect  star-formation
          related  PAH  emission  in  11/26  QSOs and fine-structure line
          emission in all of them, often in multiple lines. The detection
          of   PAHs  in  the  average  spectrum  of  sources  which  lack
          individual  PAH  detections  provides  further evidence for the
          widespread  presence  of  PAHs  in  QSOs.  Similar  PAH/FIR and
          [NeII]/FIR  ratios are found in QSOs and in starburst-dominated
          ULIRGs  and  lower  luminosity starbursts. We conclude that the
          typical  QSO  in our sample has at least 30% but likely most of
          the  far-infrared  luminosity (~ 10^(10...12)Lsun) arising from
          star  formation,  with  a  tendency  for  larger star formation
          contribution  at  the  largest  FIR  luminosities.  In  the QSO
          sample,  we  find  correlations  between most of the quantities
          studied  including  combinations  of  AGN tracers and starburst
          tracers.  The  common scaling of AGN and starburst luminosities
          (and  fluxes)  is  evidence  for  a starburst-AGN connection in
          luminous AGN. Strong correlations of far-infrared continuum and
          starburst related quantities (PAH, low excitation [NeII]) offer
          additional  support  for  the  starburst origin of far-infrared
          emission.

          Comments: 12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          In  this  paper  we  discuss  the  evolution of gravitationally
          unstable  pre-galactic  discs  that result from the collapse of
          haloes  at  high  redshift $z \approx 10$ or so, which have not
          yet  been enriched by metals. In cases where molecular hydrogen
          formation   is   suppressed  the  discs  are  maintained  at  a
          temperature  of  a  few  thousand degrees Kelvin. However, when
          molecular hydrogen is present cooling can proceed down to a few
          hundred  degrees  Kelvin.  Analogous  to the case of the larger
          scale  proto-galactic  discs,  we  assume that the evolution of
          these discs is mainly driven by angular momentum redistribution
          induced  by  the  development of gravitational instabilities in
          the disc. We also properly take into account the possibility of
          disc  fragmentation.  We  thus  show  that  this  simple  model
          naturally predicts the formation of supermassive black holes in
          the nuclei of such discs and provides a robust determination of
          their  mass  distribution  as a function of halo properties. We
          estimate  that  roughly 5% of discs resulting from the collapse
          of  haloes with $M\approx 10^7 M_{\odot}$ should host a massive
          black  hole  with a mass $M_{\rm BH}\approx 10^5 M_{\odot}$. We
          confirm  our  arguments with time-dependent calculations of the
          evolution  of  the surface density and of the accretion rate in
          these  primordial discs. This mechanism offers an efficient way
          to form seed black holes at high redshift. The predicted masses
          for  our  black  hole  seeds enable the comfortable assembly of
          $10^9  M_{\odot}$  black  holes  powering  the luminous quasars
          detected  by  the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey at $z = 6$ for a
          concordance cosmology. (abridged)

          We  have  detected  FIRST  J101614.3+520916 with the XMM-Newton
          X-ray  Observatory.  FIRST  J101614.3+520916,  one  of the most
          extreme  radio-loud, broad absorption line (BAL) quasars so far
          discovered,  is  also  a  Fanaroff-Riley  type II (FR II) radio
          source. We find that, compared to its estimated intrinsic X-ray
          flux,  the  observed X-rays are likely suppressed, and that the
          observed   hardness  ratio  indicates  significant  soft  X-ray
          photons. This is inconsistent with the simplest model, a normal
          quasar  spectrum absorbed by a large neutral HI column density,
          which  would  primarily absorb the softer photons. More complex
          models,   involving  partial  covering,  an  ionized  absorber,
          ionized  mirror  reflection,  or  jet  contributions need to be
          invoked  to  explain this source. The suppressed but soft X-ray
          emission  in  this radio-loud BAL quasar is consistent with the
          behavior  displayed  by  other BAL quasars, both radio-loud and
          radio-quiet.

          The  James  Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large (6.6m), cold
          (50K),   infrared-optimized  space  observatory  that  will  be
          launched  early  in  the next decade. The observatory will have
          four  instruments:  a  near-infrared  camera,  a  near-infrared
          multi-object  spectrograph,  and  a  tunable filter imager will
          cover  the  wavelength  range,  0.6  to  5.0 microns, while the
          mid-infrared  instrument  will do both imaging and spectroscopy
          from 5.0 to 29 microns. The JWST science goals are divided into
          four  themes.  The  End  of  the  Dark  Ages:  First  Light and
          Reionization theme seeks to identify the first luminous sources
          to  form  and  to determine the ionization history of the early
          universe. The Assembly of Galaxies theme seeks to determine how
          galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars, metals, morphological
          structures,  and  active  nuclei  within  them evolved from the
          epoch  of  reionization  to the present day. The Birth of Stars
          and Protoplanetary Systems theme seeks to unravel the birth and
          early  evolution  of  stars,  from infall on to dust-enshrouded
          protostars  to  the genesis of planetary systems. The Planetary
          Systems  and  the  Origins of Life theme seeks to determine the
          physical and chemical properties of planetary systems including
          our  own, and investigate the potential for the origins of life
          in  those  systems. To enable these observations, JWST consists
          of  a  telescope,  an  instrument  package,  a spacecraft and a
          sunshield.  The  telescope  consists  of 18 beryllium segments,
          some  of  which are deployed. The segments will be brought into
          optical  alignment  on-orbit  through  a  process  of  periodic
          wavefront  sensing  and  control.  The  JWST operations plan is
          based  on  that  used for previous space observatories, and the
          majority  of  JWST  observing  time  will  be  allocated to the
          international    astronomical    community    through    annual
          peer-reviewed proposal opportunities.

          wide.  The  IFU  passes  a spectral range of 0.39-1.1 um with a
          throughput of between 45 % and 60 % depending on wavelength and
          field  position.  The  IFU  head  resides  in  an ESI slit mask
          holder,  so  that ESI may be converted to the IFU mode remotely
          by  selecting  the  appropriate slit mask position. This IFU is
          the  first  of  a  family  of  designs  for  the  spectrograph,
          providing  a  range  of  field-coverages  and  dispersions.  In
          addition,  we  present  the  first-light  science  imaging  and
          spectroscopic  observations  of  RXJ1131-123,  a  low-redshift,
          lensed  quasar.  These  observations  show the 4 spectra of the

          Title:  The  detectability  of  HI  21-cm  absorption in damped
          Lyman-alpha systems
          Authors: S. J. Curran, J. K. Webb
          Comments: 7 page, 6 figures, Accpeted by MNRAS
          In  this paper we investigate the possible reasons why HI 21-cm
          absorption  in  damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) has only been
          detected  at  low redshift... We suggest that the lack of 21-cm
          absorption  detections  at  high  redshift arises from the fact
          that  these  DLAs  are at similar angular diameter distances to
          the  background  quasars  (i.e.  the distance ratios are always
          close  to  unity):  Above  z~1.6  the  covering  factor becomes
          largely  independent  of the DLA--QSO distance, making the high
          redshift   absorbers   much  less  effective  at  covering  the
          background  continuum emission. At low redshift, small distance
          ratios  are  strongly favoured by the 21-cm detections, whereas
          large  ratios  are  favoured by the non-detections. This mix of
          distance  ratios  gives  the  observed  mix  of  detections and
          non-detections  at  z<1.6.In  addition  to  the predominance of
          large distance ratios and non-detections at high redshift, this
          strongly  suggests  that  the  observed  distribution  of 21-cm
          absorption in DLAs is dominated by geometric effects.

          Galaxies: Evidence for a Mass-Metallicity Relation?

          We  used  our database of VLT-UVES quasar spectra to build up a
          sample of 70 Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) or strong sub-DLA systems
          with  total  neutral  hydrogen column densities of log N(HI)>20
          and  redshifts  in  the  range  1.7<z_abs<4.3.  For each of the
          systems, we measured in an homogeneous manner the metallicities
          relative  to  Solar,  [X/H]  (with  X=Zn,  or S or Si), and the
          velocity  widths  of  low-ionization line profiles, Delta V. We
          provide  for  the first time evidence for a correlation between
          DLA  metallicity  and  line  profile  velocity  width, which is
          detected  at the 6.1sigma significance level. This confirms the
          trend  previously  observed in a much smaller sample by Wolfe &
          Prochaska    (1998).    The   best-fit   linear   relation   is
          [X/H]=1.55(\pm  0.12)  log Delta V -4.33(\pm 0.23) with Delta V
          expressed  in  km/s.  The slope of the DLA velocity-metallicity
          relation  is  the  same within uncertainties between the higher
          (z_abs>2.43)  and the lower (z_abs<2.43) redshift halves of our
          sample.   However,   the   two   populations   of  systems  are
          statistically  different.  There is a strong redshift evolution
          in  the sense that the mean metallicity and mean velocity width
          increase  with decreasing redshift. We argue that the existence
          of  a  DLA  velocity-metallicity  correlation, over more than a
          factor   of   100   spread  in  metallicity,  is  probably  the
          consequence  of an underlying mass-metallicity relation for the
          galaxies  responsible  for  DLA  absorption  lines.  Assuming a
          simple linear scaling of the galaxy luminosity with the mass of
          the  dark-matter  halo,  we  find  that  the  slope  of the DLA
          velocity-metallicity  relation  is  consistent with that of the
          luminosity-metallicity  relation  derived  for  local galaxies.

          Title: Toward Understanding the Spectral Energy Distribution of
          Microquasars
          Authors: Yongquan Xue, Xue-Bing Wu, Wei Cui
          Comments:  24  pages,  8  figures,  submitted  to ApJ; comments
          welcome
          (Abridged)  We  report  results  from a systematic study of the
          spectral  energy  distribution  (SED) of XTE J1550--564 and its
          evolution  during  outbursts.  The  main objectives include: 1)
          assessing   the   roles   of   jets  and  accretion  flows;  2)
          re-examining  spectral  states, state transitions, and spectral
          hysteresis;  and 3) disentangling variabilities associated with
          the  jets  and  accretion  flows  and  quantifying the coupling
          between  the  two.  XTE  J1550--564 is the first microquasar to
          have  its  jets  directly imaged at X-ray energies. We began by
          applying  a  synchrotron  model  to  the  broadband  SED of the
          western  ``blob''  (in  the  jets)  that  was  seen in 2002, to
          constrain   the   spectral  energy  distribution  of  radiating
          electrons   in   the   ``blob''.  Assuming  that  the  electron
          distribution is the same for all ``blobs'' in the jets, we then
          applied  the  model to the overall radio spectrum of the source
          and  extrapolated the best fits to higher frequencies. In spite
          of  significant degeneracy in the fits, it seems clear that the
          synchrotron  radiation  from  the jet contributes little to the
          observed  X-ray emission, when the source is relatively bright.
          Assuming  that  the  X-ray  emission originated mostly from the
          accretion  flows,  we  took  an empirical approach to model the
          X-ray spectrum and study its evolution. From the compilation of
          the SEDs, we found it straightforward to define spectral states
          based  on  the  shape of SEDs and visualize transitions between
          various  states  thus  defined.  There is evidence for spectral
          hysteresis  associated  with  the  rise  and  fall  of the 2000
          outburst.  We can also see that a specific state transition may
          occur at different fluxes. We also examined correlation between
          the  X-ray  and  radio  fluxes  of  the  source.  While a rough
          correlation  seems to be present, it is a fairly loose one. The
          implication of the results is discussed.

          Title:  Properties of galaxies in SDSS Quasar environments at z
          < 0.2
          Authors: Georgina V. Coldwell, Diego G. Lambas
          Comments: 7 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  analyse  the  environment  of  low  redshift, z < 0.2, SDSS
          quasars  using  the  spectral  and  photometric  information of
          galaxies  from  the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Third Data Release
          (SDSS-DR3).  We  compare  quasar  neighbourhoods with field and
          high  density  environments  through  an analysis on samples of
          typical galaxies and groups.
          We  compute  the surrounding surface number density of galaxies
          finding  that  quasar  environments  systematically  avoid high
          density  regions.  Their mean environments correspond to galaxy
          density enhancements similar to those of typical galaxies.
          We  have  also  explored  several  galaxy  properties  in these
          environments,  such  as spectral types, specific star formation
          rates,   concentration   indexes,  colours  and  active  nuclei
          activity.  We  conclude that low redshift quasar neighbourhoods
          (r_p  <  1 Mpc h^-1, Delta V < 500 km/s) are populated by bluer
          and  more intense star forming galaxies of disk-type morphology
          than  galaxies  in  groups  and  in  the  field.  Although star
          formation  activity is thought to be significantly triggered by
          interactions,  we  find that quasar fueling may not require the
          presence of a close companion galaxy (r_p < 100 kpc h^-1, Delta
          V< 350 km/s).
          As a test of the unified AGN model, we have performed a similar
          analysis  to the neighbours of a sample of active galaxies. The
          results  indicate  that  these neighbourhoods are comparable to
          those  of  quasars  giving  further  support  to  this  unified
          scenario.

          Title: Quasars: What turns them off?

          Comments:  16  pages,  11  figures,  submitted to ApJ, comments
          welcomed
          (Abridged)  We  explore  the  idea  that  the anti-hierarchical
          turn-off   observed   in  the  quasar  population  arises  from
          self-regulating  feedback,  via  an  outflow mechanism. Using a
          detailed  hydrodynamic  simulation  we calculate the luminosity
          function  of  quasars  down  to  a  redshift of z=1 in a large,
          cosmologically  representative  volume.  Outflows  are included
          explicitly by tracking halo mergers and driving shocks into the
          surrounding  intergalactic medium. Our results are in excellent
          agreement  with  measurements  of  the  spatial distribution of
          quasars,  and  we  detect an intriguing excess of galaxy-quasar
          pairs   at  very  short  separations.  We  also  reproduce  the
          anti-hierarchical  turnoff  in  the quasar luminosity function,
          however,  the  magnitude  of  the  turn-off falls short of that
          observed  as  well as that predicted by analogous semi-analytic
          models.  The  difference  can be traced to the treatment of gas
          heating  within  galaxies.  The  simulated galaxy cluster L_X-T
          relationship  is  close  to that observed for z~1 clusters, but
          the  simulated galaxy groups at z=1 are significantly perturbed
          by  quasar  outflows,  suggesting  that  measurements  of X-ray
          emission  in high-redshift groups could well be a "smoking gun"
          for the AGN heating hypothesis.

          March 18-25, 2006
          Galaxy  clusters  furnish  extremely  rich  information  on the
          contents and structure of our universe. The potential of galaxy
          cluster   studies   to  constrain  dark  energy,  for  example,
          motivates  a  number of ambitious cluster surveys. Among these,
          surveys   based  on  the  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich  (SZ)  effect  are
          particularly  powerful  for  their  ability  to  cleanly select
          clusters  out  to  redshifts z>1. Now poised to begin surveying
          substantial  areas of sky, dedicated interferometers, bolometer
          cameras  and  the  Planck  satellite  will  soon  produce large
          cluster  catalogs  that  will  provide a precise measure of the
          cosmic expansion rate over a range of redshifts and precipitate
          a new understanding of structure and galaxy formation. I review
          the  science potential of these surveys and examine some issues
          of SZ cluster catalog construction.

          Quasar 1745+624

          A   newly   identified   kiloparsec-scale   X-ray  jet  in  the
          high-redshift   z=3.89   quasar   1745+624   is   studied  with
          multi-frequency  Very  Large Array, Hubble Space Telescope, and
          Chandra  X-ray imaging data. This is only the third large-scale
          X-ray  jet  beyond  z>3  known  and is further distinguished as
          being  the  most  luminous  relativistic  jet  observed  at any
          redshift,  exceeding  10^45  erg/s  in both the radio and X-ray
          bands.  Apart  from the jet's extreme redshift, luminosity, and
          high  inferred  equipartition  magnetic field (in comparison to
          local  analogues),  its  basic  properties  such as X-ray/radio
          morphology and radio polarization are similar to lower-redshift
          examples.   Its   resolved  linear  structure  and  the  convex
          broad-band  spectral  energy  distributions  of  three distinct
          knots are also a common feature among known powerful X-ray jets
          at  lower-redshift. Relativistically beamed inverse Compton and
          `non-standard'  synchrotron  models  have  been  considered  to
          account  for  such  excess  X-ray  emission in other jets; both
          models  are  applicable  to this high-redshift example but with
          differing   requirements   for   the  underlying  jet  physical
          properties,   such   as   velocity,  energetics,  and  electron
          acceleration   processes.   One   potentially   very  important
          distinguishing  characteristic  between the two models is their
          strongly  diverging  predictions  for  the X-ray/radio emission
          with  increasing  redshift. This is considered, though with the
          limited  sample  of  three  z>3 jets it is apparent that future
          studies  targeted  at  very high-redshift jets are required for
          further elucidation of this issue. Finally, from the broad-band
          jet  emission  we  estimate the jet kinetic power to be no less
          than   10^46  erg/s,  which  is  about  10%  of  the  Eddington
          luminosity corresponding to this galaxy's central [abridged]

          Aims:   The  galactic  superluminal  microquasar  GRO  J1655-40
          started  a  new outburst in February 2005, after seven years in
          quiescence,  rising to a high/soft state in March 2005. In this
          paper  we study the X-ray spectra during this rise. Methods: We
          observed  GRO J1655-40 with XMM-Newton, on 27 February 2005, in
          the  low/hard  state,  and  on  three consecutive days in March
          2005, during the rise of the source to its high/soft state. The
          EPIC-pn  camera  was  used in the fast-read Burst mode to avoid
          photon   pile-up.   Results:   First,  we  contributed  to  the
          improvement  of  the calibration of the EPIC-pn, since the high
          flux  received from the source required some refinements in the
          correction  of  the  Charge  Transfer Efficiency of the camera.
          Second,  we  find  that  the  X-ray spectrum of GRO J1655-40 is
          dominated  in  the high/soft state by the thermal emission from
          the  accretion  disk,  with  an  inner radius of 13-14 km and a
          maximum  temperature  of  1.3  keV.  Fe  XXV K-alpha and K-beta
          absorption  lines  are  detected  in  the  EPIC-pn  spectra, at
          6.7-6.8  and  7.8-8.0  keV.  With  the RGS spectrometers, clear
          absorption  features  are  found for the first time at 17.2 and
          17.4 AA, which may be identified as blueshifted OVII lines from
          a  highly ionized absorbing wind. We find no orbital dependence
          on  the  X-ray  spectra,  which provides an upper limit for the
          inclination  of  the  system  of  73  degr. The interstellar OI
          K-alpha  line  is  also  detected.  Finally, while checking the
          interstellar   origin  of  the  OI  line,  we  find  a  general
          correlation  of  the  OI  K-alpha  line width with the hydrogen
          column   density   using   several  sources  available  in  the
          literature.

          Title: On the weakness of disc models in bright ULXs
          Authors:   Anabela   C.   Goncalves   (Obs.  Astron.  Lisboa  &

          Comments: 12 pages, accepted by MNRAS
          It  is sometimes suggested that phenomenological power-law plus
          cool  disc-blackbody models represent the simplest, most robust
          interpretation  of  the  X-ray  spectra of bright ultraluminous
          X-ray  sources  (ULXs); this has been taken as evidence for the
          presence of intermediate-mass black holes (BHs) (M ~ 10^3 Msun)
          in  those  sources. Here, we assess this claim by comparing the
          cool  disc-blackbody  model  with  a range of other models. For
          example,  we  show  that  the  same  ULX  spectra can be fitted
          equally  well  by subtracting a disc-blackbody component from a
          dominant power-law component, thus turning a soft excess into a
          soft  deficit.  Then, we propose a more complex physical model,
          based  on  a  power-law  component slightly modified at various
          energies   by   smeared  emission  and  absorption  lines  from
          highly-ionized,  fast-moving  gas.  We  use the XMM-Newton/EPIC
          spectra  of  two  ULXs in Holmberg II and NGC 4559 as examples.
          Our  main conclusion is that the presence of a soft excess or a
          soft  deficit  depends on the energy range over which we choose
          to fit the ``true'' power-law continuum; those small deviations
          from the power-law spectrum are well modelled by disc-blackbody
          components  (either  in  emission or absorption) simply because
          they  are  a  versatile  fitting tool for most kinds of smooth,
          broad  bumps.  Hence, we argue that those components should not
          be  taken  as evidence for accretion disc emission, nor used to
          infer  BH  masses. Finally, we speculate that bright ULXs could
          be  in  a  spectral  state  similar to (or an extension of) the
          steep-power-law  state  of Galactic BH candidates, in which the
          disc is now completely comptonized and not directly detectable,
          and  the power-law emission may be modified by the surrounding,
          fast-moving, ionized gas.

          Title: On the radio properties of the highest redshift quasars
          Authors:   M.  Cirasuolo,  M.  Magliocchetti,  G.  Gentile,  A.

          We present deep radio observations of the most distant complete
          quasar   sample  drawn  from  the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey.
          Combining  our  new data with those from literature we obtain a
          sample  which  is  ~100 per cent complete down to S_1.4GHz = 60
          \mu  Jy  over  the  redshift range 3.8 < z < 5. The fraction of
          radio  detections is relatively high (~43 per cent), similar to
          what  observed  locally  in bright optical surveys. Even though
          the  combined  radio  and  optical properties of quasars remain
          overall  unchanged  from  z ~ 5 to the local Universe, there is
          some evidence for a slight over-abundance of radio-loud sources
          at the highest redshifts when compared with the lower-z regime.
          Exploiting the deep radio VLA observations we present the first
          attempt  to  directly  derive  the radio luminosity function of
          bright  quasars at z ~ 4. The unique depth -- both in radio and
          optical  --  allows  us to thoroughly explore the population of
          optically  bright  FR~II quasars up to z ~ 5 and opens a window
          on  the  behaviour  of  the  brightest  FR~I  sources.  A close
          investigation  of  the space density of radio loud quasars also
          suggests  a  differential  evolution,  with  the  more luminous
          sources  showing  a  less  pronounced  cut-off  at  high z when
          compared with the less luminous ones.

          Authors: Steen H. Hansen, Jesper Sommer-Larsen
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
          Extended gas haloes around galaxies are a ubiquitous prediction
          of galaxy formation scenarios. However, the density profiles of
          this  hot  halo  gas  is  virtually  unknown,  although various
          profiles  have  been suggested on theoretical grounds. In order
          to  quantitatively address the gas profile, we compare galaxies
          from  direct cosmological simulations with analytical solutions
          of  the  underlying gas equations. We find remarkable agreement
          between  simulations and theoretical predictions. We present an
          expression  for  this gas profile with a non-trivial dependence
          on  the  total  mass  profile.  This  expression is useful when
          setting up equilibrium galaxy models for numerical experiments.

          In   this   paper  we  use  neutral  hydrogen  HI  and  optical
          spectroscopic  observations  to  compare  the  timescales  of a
          merger  event,  starburst episode and radio-AGN activity in the
          radio  galaxy B2 0648+27. We detect a large ring-like structure
          of  HI  in  emission  around  the  early-type host galaxy of B2
          0648+27  (M_HI  =  8.5  x  10^9  Msun,  diameter = 190 kpc). We
          interpret  this as the result of a major merger that occurred >
          1.5  Gyr  ago. From modelling optical long-slit spectra we find
          that  a  young  stellar  population of 0.3 Gyr, indicative of a
          past  starburst  event,  dominates the stellar light throughout
          the  galaxy.  The  off-set in time between the merger event and
          the   starburst  activity  in  B2  0648+27  suggests  that  the
          starburst  was  triggered  in  an advanced stage of the merger,
          which  can  be  explained  if  the gas-rich progenitor galaxies
          contained  a  bulge. Although the exact age of the radio source
          remains uncertain, there appears to be a significant time-delay
          between  the  merger/starburst event and the current episode of
          radio-AGN activity. We also observe an outflow of emission-line
          gas  in  this  system,  which  is  likely related to superwinds
          driven  by the stars that formed during the starburst event. We
          argue  that  the  radio  galaxy  B2  0648+27  is  a link in the
          evolutionary  sequence between Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies
          (ULIRGs) and genuine early-type galaxies.

          ABRIDGED:  We  use  deep  optical, IR and radio observations to
          explore  the  symbiosis between the nuclear activity and galaxy
          evolution  in  the  southern  compact  radio  source PKS1549-79
          (z=0.1523).   The   optical  imaging  observations  reveal  the
          presence  of  tidal tail features which provide strong evidence
          that the host galaxy has undergone a major merger in the recent
          past.  This  is  further  supported by the detection of a young
          stellar  population which was formed 50-250Myr ago and makes up
          1-30% of the total stellar mass. Despite the core-jet structure
          of  the  radio  source  we detect HI absorption associated with
          both the core and the jet. The luminous, quasar-like AGN (M_V <
          -23.5)   is   highly   extinguished  (A_v  >  4.9)  at  optical
          wavelengths  and  shows  many  properties in common with narrow
          line  Seyfert  1  galaxies  (NLS1), including relatively narrow
          permitted  lines  (FWHM ~ 1940 km/s), highly blueshifted [OIII]
          lines  (~680 km/s), and evidence that the putative supermassive
          black  hole  is  accreting  at  a  high  Eddington  ratio. This
          suggests  that  accretion  at  high  Eddington  ratio  does not
          prevent  the  formation of powerful jets. Our observations lend
          strong  support  to  the  predictions  of some recent numerical
          simulations  of  galaxy  mergers  in which the black hole grows
          rapidly   through   merger-induced   accretion   following  the
          coalescence  of  the  nuclei of two merging galaxies; the major
          growth phase largely hidden by the natal gas and dust. Although
          the  models  predict  that  AGN-driven outflows will eventually
          remove  the  gas from the bulge of the host galaxy, the visible
          warm  outflow  in  PKS1549-79 is not currently capable of doing
          so. ABRIDGED

          We  derive  black hole masses for a sample of about 300 AGNs in
          the redshift range 0 < z < 2.5. We use the same virial velocity
          measure  (FWHM  Hbeta  broad  component)  for all sources which
          represents  a significant improvement over previous studies. We
          review  methods  and  caveats  for  determining  AGN black hole
          masses  via  the  virial  assumption  for  motions  in  the gas
          producing  low  ionization  broad  emission  lines. We derive a
          corrected  FWHM  measure for the broad component of H-beta that
          better  estimates  the  virialized  line  emitting component by
          comparing  our  FWHM  measures  with  a  sample of reverberated
          sources  with  H-beta  radial  velocity dispersion measures. We
          also  consider  the  FWHM of the FeII 4570 blend as a potential
          alternative  velocity  estimator. We find a range of black hole
          mass  between log M ~ 6 - 10, where the black hole mass M is in
          solar  masses.  Estimates  using  corrected  FWHM,  as  well as
          FWHM(Fe II) measures, reduce the number of sources with log M >
          9.5 and suggest that extremely large M values (log M >~ 10) may
          not be realistic. Derived Eddington ratio values values show no
          evidence   for  a  significant  population  of  super-Eddington
          radiators  especially after correction is made for sources with
          extreme   orientation  to  our  line  of  sight.  Sources  with
          FWHM(Hbeta  broad  component)  <~ 4000 km/s show systematically
          higher  Eddington  ratio  and lower M values than broader lined
          AGNs (including almost all radio-loud sources).

          Comments: 9 pages, 12 figures, submitted to A&A
          Aims: To measure the time delay between the two gravitationally
          lensed images of the z = 1.547 quasar SDSS J1650+4251, in order
          to estimate the Hubble constant H_0.
          Methods:  Our  measurement is based on R-band light curves with
          57 epochs obtained at Maidanak Observatory, in Uzbekistan, from
          May  2004  to September 2005. The photometry is performed using
          simultaneous  deconvolution  of  the  data,  which provides the
          individual light curves of the otherwise blended quasar images.
          The  time  delay  is determined from the light curves using two
          very  different  numerical techniques, i.e., polynomial fitting
          and  direct cross-correlation. The time delay is converted into
          H_0 following analytical modeling of the potential well.
          Results:  Our  best estimate of the time delay is Dt = 49.5 +/-
          1.9 days, i.e., we reach a 3.8% accuracy. The R-band flux ratio
          between the quasar images, corrected for the time delay and for
          slow microlensing, is F_A /F_B = 6.2.
          Conclusions:  The  accuracy reached on the time delay allows to
          discriminate  well between families of lens models. As for most
          other  multiply  imaged  quasars,  only  models  of the lensing
          galaxy  that  have a constant mass-to-light ratio give a Hubble
          constant  compatible with the current most popular value (H_0 =
          72 +/- 8 km s-1 Mpc-1). Using a de Vaucouleurs mass profile and
          external  shear,  we  find H_0 = 80.8 +7.0 -3.0 km s-1 Mpc-1. A
          more  realistic  Singular Isothermal Sphere model plus external
          shear gives H_0 = 51.7 +4.0 -3.0 km s-1 Mpc-1.

          halo-mass and equivalent width anti-correlated?

          We measure the mean halo-mass of z=0.5 MgII absorbers using the
          cross-correlation   (over  co-moving  scales  0.05-13h^{-1}Mpc)
          between  1806  MgII  quasar  absorption  systems  and  ~250,000
          Luminous  Red Galaxies (LRGs), both selected from the SDSS DR3.
          The    MgII   systems   have   rest-frame   equivalent   widths
          W_r(2796)>=0.3A.    From    the    ratio    of   the   MgII-LRG
          cross-correlation to the LRG-LRG auto-correlation, we find that
          the  bias ratio between MgII absorbers and LRGs is 0.65+/-0.08,
          which  implies  that  the  absorber  host-galaxies  have a mean
          halo-mass  20-40  times smaller than that of the LRGs; the MgII
          absorbers have halos of mean mass
          <logM_h(M_sol)>=11.94+/-0.31(stat)+/-0.25(sys).  We demonstrate
          that  this  statistical  technique,  which does not require any
          spectroscopic follow-up, does not suffer from contaminants such
          as  stars  or  foreground  and background galaxies. Finally, we
          find  that  the  absorber halo-mass is anti-correlated with the
          equivalent  width.  If MgII absorbers were virialized in galaxy
          halos  a  positive M_h-W_r correlation would have been observed
          since  W_r(2796)  is a direct measure of the velocity spread of
          the MgII sub-components. Thus, our results demonstrate that the
          individual  clouds  of  a MgII system are not virialized in the
          gaseous  halos  of the host-galaxies. We review past results in
          the  literature  on  the  statistics of MgII absorbers and find
          that   they  too  require  an  M_h-W_r  anti-correlation.  When
          combined    with   measurements   of   the   equivalent   width
          distribution,  the  M_h-W_r anti-correlation naturally explains
          why  absorbers  with W_r(2796)>=2A are not seen at large impact
          parameters.  We  interpret  the M_h-W_r anti-correlation within
          the starburst scenario where strong MgII absorbers are produced
          by supernovae-driven winds.

          The   Multi   Unit   Spectroscopic   Explorer   (MUSE)   is   a
          second-generation  VLT  panoramic  integral-field  spectrograph
          under  preliminary  design  study.  MUSE  has  a  field  of 1x1
          arcmin**2  sampled  at 0.2x0.2 arcsec**2 and is assisted by the
          VLT  ground layer adaptive optics ESO facility using four laser
          guide  stars. The simultaneous spectral range is 465-930 nm, at
          a resolution of R~3000. MUSE couples the discovery potential of
          a  large  imaging  device  to  the  measuring capabilities of a
          high-quality   spectrograph,  while  taking  advantage  of  the
          increased  spatial resolution provided by adaptive optics. This
          makes  MUSE  a  unique and tremendously powerful instrument for
          discovering  and  characterizing  objects  that  lie beyond the
          reach of even the deepest imaging surveys. MUSE has also a high
          spatial  resolution  mode  with 7.5x7.5 arcsec**2 field of view
          sampled at 25 milli-arcsec. In this mode MUSE should be able to
          obtain   diffraction  limited  data-cubes  in  the  600-930  nm
          wavelength  range.  Although the MUSE design has been optimized
          for  the study of galaxy formation and evolution, it has a wide
          range  of  possible  applications;  e.g.  monitoring  of  outer
          planets atmosphere, environment of young stellar objects, super
          massive  black  holes  and  active nuclei in nearby galaxies or
          massive  spectroscopic  surveys  of stellar fields in the Milky

          Title:  On  the fraction of X-ray obscured quasars in the local
          universe
          Authors: J. X. Wang, P. Jiang
          Comments: 13 pages, including 4 figures, ApJ letter accepted
          Recent  wide  area  hard  X-ray and soft Gamma ray surveys have
          shown  that  the  fraction  of X-ray obscured AGNs in the local
          universe  significantly decreases with intrinsic luminosity. In
          this letter we point out that two correction have to be made to
          the samples: 1) radio loud AGNs have to be excluded since their
          X-ray  emission  might  be  dominated  by the jet component; 2)
          Compton  thick sources have to be excluded too since their hard
          X-ray  and soft gamma ray emission are also strongly attenuated
          by  Compton scattering. The soft gamma-ray selected AGN samples
          obtained  by SWIFT and INTEGRAL provide the best opportunity to
          study the fraction of obscured AGN in the local universe in the
          least  biased  way.  We  choose  these  samples to check if the
          corrections  could  alter  the  above result on the fraction of
          obscured AGNs. We find that before the corrections both samples
          show   significant   anti-correlation   between  L_X  and  N_H,
          indicating  obvious  decrease  in the fraction of obscured AGNs
          with  luminosity.  However, after the corrections, we find only
          marginal evidence of anti-correlation (at 98% confidence level)
          in  the  SWIFT  sample,  and no evidence at all in the INTEGRAL
          sample  which  consists  of  comparable  number  of objects. We
          conclude  that current samples only show a marginal decrease in
          the  fraction  of obscured AGNs in the local universe, and much
          larger samples are required to reach a more robust conclusion.

          Title: On the formation of dwarf galaxies and stellar halos
          Authors: J.I. Read, A.P. Pontzen, M. Viel
          Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Using  analytic  arguments  and a suite of very high resolution
          (10^3Msun    per    particle)    cosmological   hydro-dynamical
          simulations,  we argue that high redshift, z ~ 10, M ~ 10^8Msun
          halos,  form  the  smallest `baryonic building block' (BBB) for
          galaxy  formation.  These  halos  are  just  massive  enough to
          efficiently  form stars through atomic line cooling and to hold
          onto  their  gas  in  the  presence  of  supernovae  winds  and
          reionisation. These combined effects, in particular that of the
          supernovae  feedback,  create a sharp transition: over the mass
          range  3-10x10^7Msun,  the  BBBs drop two orders ofmagnitude in
          stellar  mass.  Below  ~2x10^7Msun,  galaxies will be dark with
          almost  no  stars  and no gas. Above this scale is the smallest
          unit of galaxy formation: the BBB.
          A  small  fraction  (~100)  of these gas rich BBBs fall in to a
          galaxy  the size of the Milky Way. Ten percent of these survive
          to  become the observed LG dwarf galaxies at the present epoch.
          Those  in-falling  halos  on  benign orbits which keep them far
          away from the Milky Way or Andromeda manage to retain their gas
          and  slowly  form  stars  -  these  become  the  smallest dwarf
          irregular galax ies; those on more severe orbits lose their gas
          faster   than   they  can  form  stars  and  become  the  dwarf
          spheroidals. The remaining 90% of the BBBs will be accreted. We
          show  that  this  gives  a  metallicity  and total stellar mass
          consistent with the Milky Way old stellar halo (abridged).

          submitted to AJ
          We  present short \chandra observations of twelve bright (i<18)
          z_em~1.5  quasars  from  the Sloan Digital Sky Survey chosen to
          have  significantly  redder optical colors than most quasars at
          the  same redshift. Of the five quasars with optical properties
          most  consistent  with  dust  reddening at the quasar redshift,
          four  show  indirect  evidence  of  moderate  X-ray  absorption
          (inferred  N_H~10^22 cm^-2) with a dust-to-gas ratio <1% of the
          SMC  value.  The  remaining  seven objects show no evidence for
          even moderate intrinsic X-ray absorption. Thus, while optically
          red  quasars  are  marginally more likely to show signatures of
          X-ray  absorption  than  optically selected quasars with normal
          colors,  dust-reddened type 1 AGN (as opposed to fully obscured
          type  2  AGN)  are  unlikely to contribute significantly to the
          remaining  unresolved  hard  X-ray  background.  The red quasar
          population  includes objects with intrinsically red continua as
          well  as  objects  with dust-reddened continua. Improved sample
          selection  is  thus  needed  to  increase  our understanding of
          either  subpopulation. To identify dust-reddened quasars likely
          to exhibit X-ray absorption, some measure of spectral curvature
          is preferable to simple cuts in observed or relative broad-band
          colors.

          Title: Inverse Compton e-p pair cascade model for the gamma-ray
          production in massive binary LSI +61^o 303
          Authors: W. Bednarek
          Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  apply  an  inverse  Compton  $e^\pm$ pair cascade model for
          $\gamma$-ray  production in massive binary system LSI +61$^{\rm
          o}$  303 assuming that electrons are accelerated already inside
          the  inner  part  of  the  jet  launched by the compact object.
          $\gamma$-ray  spectra,  affected  by  the  cascade process, and
          lower  energy  spectra,  from  the  synchrotron  cooling of the
          highest  energy  electrons  in  the  jet,  are  calculated as a
          function  of  the  phase  of  this  binary system. $\gamma$-ray
          spectra  expected  in such model have different shape than that
          ones  produced  by  electrons  in the jet directly to observer.
          Moreover,  the  model  predicts  clear anti-correlation between
          $\gamma$-ray  fluxes in the GeV (1-10 GeV) and TeV ($>200$ GeV)
          energy  ranges  with  the peak of the TeV emission at the phase
          $\sim$0.5  (the  peak  half  width  ranges  between  the phases
          $\sim$0.4-0.9 for the inclination of the binary system equal to
          $60^{\rm  o}$,  and  $\sim$0.4-0.1  for $30^{\rm o}$). The fine
          features  of  TeV  $\gamma$-ray  emission  (fluxes and spectral
          shapes)  as  a  function  of the phase of the binary system are
          consistent  with  recent  observations  reported  by  the MAGIC
          collaboration.  Future  simultaneous  observations  in  the GeV
          energies  (by  the  GLAST  and AGILE telescopes) and in the TeV
          energies  (by  the  MAGIC  and  VERITAS telescopes) should test
          other   predictions  of  the  considered  model  supporting  or
          disproving the hypothersis of acceleration of electrons already
          in the inner part of the microquasar jets.

          (accepted June 16, 2006)
          We   present   CO(1-0)   observations   of   the  high-redshift
          quasi-stellar   objects   (QSOs)  BR  1202-0725  (z=4.69),  PSS
          J2322+1944 (z=4.12), and APM 08279+5255 (z=3.91) using the NRAO
          Green  Bank  Telescope  (GBT)  and  the  MPIfR  Effelsberg 100m
          telescope.  We  detect, for the first time, the CO ground-level
          transition   in  BR  1202-0725.  For  PSS  J2322+1944  and  APM
          08279+5255,  our  observations  result  in line fluxes that are
          consistent   with   previous   NRAO   Very  Large  Array  (VLA)
          observations, but they reveal the full line profiles. We report
          a   typical   lensing-corrected  velocity-integrated  intrinsic
          CO(1-0) line luminosity of L'(CO) = 5 x 10^10 K km/s pc^2 and a
          typical  total  H_2  mass  of  M(H2)  = 4 x 10^10 M_sun for the
          sources  in  our  sample. The CO/FIR luminosity ratios of these
          high-z  sources  follow  the  same  trend  as  seen  for  low-z
          galaxies,  leading to a combined solution of log(L_FIR) = (1.39
          +/-  0.05)  x log(L(CO))-1.76. It has previously been suggested
          that  the molecular gas reservoirs in some quasar host galaxies
          may  exhibit luminous, extended CO(1-0) components that are not
          observed  in  the  higher-J  CO transitions. Utilizing the line
          profiles  and  the  total  intensities  of our observations and
          large  velocity gradient (LVG) models based on previous results
          for  higher-J  CO transitions, we derive that emission from all
          CO  transitions  is  described  well  by a single gas component
          where  all  molecular  gas is concentrated in a compact nuclear
          region. Thus, our observations and models show no indication of
          a  luminous  extended,  low  surface  brightness  molecular gas
          component  in  any  of the high-redshift QSOs in our sample. If
          such  extended  components  exist,  their  contribution  to the
          overall luminosity is limited to at most 30%.

          Title:  Anisotropic  Galactic  Outflows  and  Enrichment of the
          Intergalactic Medium. I: Monte Carlo Simulations
          Authors:  Matthew Pieri, Hugo Martel, Cedric Grenon (Universite
          Laval)
          Comments: 29 pages, 9 figures (2 color). Submitted to ApJ
          We  have designed an analytical model to describe the evolution
          of  anisotropic galactic outflows. With this we investigate the
          impact  of  varying  opening  angle on galaxy formation and the
          evolution of the IGM. We have implemented this model in a Monte
          Carlo  algorithm to simulate galaxy formation and outflows in a
          cosmological  context.  Using this algorithm, we have simulated
          the  evolution  of a comoving volume of size [12h^(-1)Mpc]^3 in
          the  LCDM  universe.  Starting from a Gaussian density field at
          redshift z=24, we follow the formation of ~20,000 galaxies, and
          simulate the galactic outflows produced by these galaxies. When
          these outflows collide with density peaks, 80% of the time this
          results  in  ram pressure stripping of the gas inside the peak,
          preventing  the  formation  of  a  galaxy. Anisotropic outflows
          follow   the   path   of  least  resistance,  and  thus  travel
          preferentially into low-density regions, away from cosmological
          structures  (filaments  and pancakes) where galaxies form. As a
          result,  the  number  of  collisions is reduced, leading to the
          formation  of a larger number of galaxies. Anisotropic outflows
          can  significantly  enrich  low-density  systems  with  metals.
          Conversely, the cross-pollution in metals of objects located in
          a   common   cosmological   structure,   like  a  filament,  is
          significantly  reduced.  Highly anisotropic outflows can travel
          across   cosmological  voids,  and  deposit  metals  in  other,
          unrelated cosmological structures.

          Title:  Dust  in  starburst  nuclei  and ULIRGs: SED models for
          observers
          Authors: Ralf Siebenmorgen (ESO), Endrik Kruegel (MPIfR)
          Comments: 10pages, 6 figures, submitted to A&A
          We   provide   a  library  of  some  7000  SEDs  (available  at
          www.eso.org/~rsiebenm)  for  the  nuclei of starburst and ultra
          luminous  galaxies.  Its purpose is to quickly obtain estimates
          of  the  basic parameters, such as luminosity, size and dust or
          gas mass and to predict the flux at yet unobserved wavelengths.
          The  procedure  is simple and consists of finding an element in
          the  library  that matches the observations. The objects may be
          in the local universe or at high z.
          We calculate the radiative transfer in spherical symmetry for a
          stellar  cluster  permeated  by  an  interstellar  medium  with
          standard  (Milky Way) dust properties. The cluster contains two
          stellar  populations: old bulge stars and OB stars. Because the
          latter  are  young, a certain fraction of them will be embedded
          in compact clouds which constitute hot spots that determine the
          MIR fluxes.
          We  present  SEDs  for a broad range of luminosities, sizes and
          obscurations.   We  argue  that  the  assumption  of  spherical
          symmetry  and  the  neglect of clumpiness of the medium are not
          severe  shortcomings  for  computing  the  dust  emission.  The
          validity of the approach is demonstrated by matching the SED of
          seven  of  the best studied galaxies, including M82 and Arp220,
          by  library  elements. In all cases, one finds an element which
          fits  the  observed  SED very well, and the parameters defining
          the  element  are  in  full accord with what is known about the
          galaxy  from  detailed  studies.  We also compare our method of
          computing   SEDs   with   other  techniques  described  in  the
          literature.

          Title:  Properties  of  Galaxy  Groups  in  the  SDSS: II.- AGN
          Feedback and Star Formation Truncation
          Authors:  Simone  M.  Weinmann,  Frank C. van den Bosch, Xiaohu

          Comments: 16 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Successfully reproducing the galaxy luminosity function and the
          bimodality in the galaxy distribution requires a mechanism that
          can  truncate  star formation in massive haloes. Current models
          of  galaxy  formation  consider two such truncation mechanisms:
          strangulation,  which  acts  on  satellite  galaxies,  and  AGN
          feedback,  which  predominantly  affects  central galaxies. The
          efficiencies  of  these  processes  set  the  blue  fraction of
          galaxies  as  function  of  galaxy luminosity and halo mass. In
          this  paper  we use a galaxy group catalogue extracted from the
          Sloan  Digital  Sky Survey (SDSS) to determine these fractions.
          To  demonstrate the potential power of this data as a benchmark
          for  galaxy  formation  models,  we  compare the results to the
          semi-analytical  model  for  galaxy  formation of Croton et al.
          (2006).   Although   this  model  accurately  fits  the  global
          statistics  of  the  galaxy population, as well as the shape of
          the  conditional  luminosity  function,  there  are significant
          discrepancies  when the blue fraction of galaxies as a function
          of mass and luminosity is compared between the observations and
          the model. In particular, the model predicts (i) too many faint
          satellite  galaxies  in massive haloes, (ii) a blue fraction of
          satellites  that  is much too low, and (iii) a blue fraction of
          centrals  that  is  too  high  and  with an inverted luminosity
          dependence.   In   the   same   order,   we  argue  that  these
          discrepancies  owe to (i) the neglect of tidal stripping in the
          semi-analytical  model,  (ii)  the  oversimplified treatment of
          strangulation,  and  (iii) improper modeling of dust extinction
          and/or  AGN feedback. The data presented here will prove useful
          to  test and calibrate future models of galaxy formation and in
          particular  to  discriminate  between  various  models  for AGN
          feedback and other star formation truncation mechanisms.

          The  COMPTEL  unidentified  source GRO J1411-64 was observed by
          INTEGRAL,  and  its  central part, also by XMM-Newton. The data
          analysis  shows  no hint for new detections at hard X-rays. The
          upper  limits  in  flux  herein  presented constrain the energy
          spectrum  of  whatever was producing GRO J1411-64, imposing, in
          the framework of earlier COMPTEL observations, the existence of
          a  peak  in  power output located somewhere between 300-700 keV
          for  the  so-called  low state. The Circinus Galaxy is the only
          source  detected  within  the  4$\sigma$  location error of GRO
          J1411-64,   but   can   be  safely  excluded  as  the  possible
          counterpart:  the  extrapolation of the energy spectrum is well
          below  the one for GRO J1411-64 at MeV energies. 22 significant
          sources  (likelihood  $>  10$) were extracted and analyzed from
          XMM-Newton    data.   Only   one   of   these   sources,   XMMU
          J141255.6-635932,  is  spectrally  compatible with GRO J1411-64
          although  the fact the soft X-ray observations do not cover the
          full  extent of the COMPTEL source position uncertainty make an
          association hard to quantify and thus risky. The unique peak of
          the  power output at high energies (hard X-rays and gamma-rays)
          resembles   that   found   in   the  SED  seen  in  blazars  or
          microquasars.  However,  an  analysis using a microquasar model
          consisting on a magnetized conical jet filled with relativistic
          electrons which radiate through synchrotron and inverse Compton
          scattering  with  star,  disk,  corona  and synchrotron photons
          shows  that  it  is  hard  to  comply  with  all  observational

          an a-posteriori question mark upon the physical reality of this
          source, which is discussed in some detail.

          Title:  The  impact  of dark matter decays and annihilations on
          the formation of the first structures

          Kapteyn  Astronomical  Institute,  University of Groningen, (2)

          Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  derive  the  effects  of  DM  decays  and  annihilations on
          structure   formation.   We   consider  moderately  massive  DM
          particles  (sterile neutrinos and LDM), as they are expected to
          give  the maximum contribution to heating and reionization. The
          energy injection from DM decays and annihilations produces both
          an enhancement in the abundance of coolants (H_2 and HD) and an
          increase   of  gas  temperature.  We  find  that  for  all  the
          considered  DM  models (sterile neutrino decays, LDM decays and
          annihilations)  the critical halo mass for collapse, m_crit, is
          higher  than in the unperturbed case. However, the variation of
          m_crit is small. In the most extreme case, i.e. considering LDM
          decays  and  halos  virializing  at  redshift  z_vir~10, m_crit
          increases  by  a  factor  2.  The variations of m_crit are also
          sensitive   to  the  assumed  concentration  of  the  DM  halo.
          Furthermore, we note that the fraction of gas which is retained
          inside  the  halo  is substantially reduced (to ~40 per cent of
          the  cosmic  value),  especially  in  the  smallest halos, as a
          consequence   of   the   energy  injection  by  DM  decays  and
          annihilations.

          Title:  Discovery of a new high redshift QSO at z=5.96 with the
          Subaru telescope
          Authors: Tomotsugu Goto (ISAS/JAXA)
          Comments: accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  report  a  discovery  of  a  new  high  redshift  quasar at
          $z=5.96$,  observed  with  the  FOCAS long-slit spectrograph on
          board the Subaru telescope. The spectrum shows strong and broad
          Ly$\alpha$+NV  emission lines with a sharp discontinuity to the
          blue  side.  A  Ly$\beta$+OVI  emission  line is also detected,
          providing   a   consistent   redshift   measurement   with  the
          Ly$\alpha$+NV  emission.  The  QSO has an absolute magnitude of
          $M_{AB,1450}=-26.9$    ($H_{0}=50$km    s$^{-1}$    Mpc$^{-1}$,
          $q_0=0.5$).
          The  spectrum  shows  significant  flux in the region 8000-8300
          $\AA$ and thus does not show a complete Gunn-Peterson trough in
          the  redshift  range  5.58  to 5.82, along the line of sight to
          this $z=5.96$
          QSO.  Therefore  the  Universe  was  already  highly ionized at
          $z=5.82$

          Title:    Integral   Field   Spectroscopy   of   the   Extended
          Emission-Line Region of 3C 249.1
          Authors: Hai Fu, Alan Stockton (IfA Hawaii)
          Comments: submitted to ApJ. 7 pages including 7 figures
          We  present  Gemini  Multiobject  Spectrograph  (GMOS) integral
          field   spectroscopy   of  the  extended  emission-line  region
          associated  with quasar 3C 249.1. The complex global kinematics
          revealed  by the velocity field of the [O III] 5007 line cannot
          be  explained  by  a  simple  dynamical  model,  but  the local
          velocity  fields  of some distinct emission clouds appear to be
          consistent  with simple rotating disks. The temperatures of the
          ionized  gas  appear  uniform (varying from ~12000 to 15000 K),
          while  the  densities  vary  from  a few tens to a few hundreds
          cm^{-3}.  The emission mechanism of all of the emission clouds,
          as  indicated by the line-ratio diagnostics, is consistent both
          with  ``shock + precursor" and pure photoionization models. The
          total mass of the ionized gas is on the order of 10^9 M_Sun. We
          estimate  the  total kinetic energy and momentum of 2.5*10^{57}
          M_9   v_{500}^2   ergs   and   10^{50}   M_9  v_{500}  dyne  s,
          respectively.  By  comparing  the  injection  rates  of kinetic
          energy  and momentum of different galactic wind models with the
          observation,  we  argue that the emission-line regions are most
          likely a direct result from the feedback of the quasar. We also
          discuss  the  nature of the extended X-ray emission surrounding
          the quasar.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal
          Using  the  near-infrared integral-field spectrograph SPIFFI on
          the VLT, we have studied the spatially-resolved dynamics in the
          z=3.2   strongly  lensed  galaxy  1E0657-56  ``arc+core''.  The
          lensing configuration suggests that the high surface brightness
          ``core''  is  the  M=20  magnified  central 1 kpc of the galaxy
          (seen  at  a  spatial  resolution of about 200 pc in the source
          plane),   whereas  the  fainter  ``arc''  is  a  more  strongly
          magnified  peripheral  region  of  the  same  galaxy at about a
          half-light  radius, which otherwise appears to be a typical z=3
          Lyman break galaxy.
          The  overall  shape  of the position-velocity diagram resembles
          the  ``rotation  curves''  of  the  inner few kpcs of nearby L*
          spiral  galaxies.  The  projected velocities rise rapidly to 75
          km/s  within the core. This implies a dynamical mass of M_dyn =
          10^9.3  M_sun within the central kpc, and suggests that in this
          system  the equivalent of the mass of a present-day L* bulge at
          the same radius was already in place by z>=3. Approximating the
          circular  velocity  of  the  halo  by  the  measured asymptotic
          velocity  of the rotation curve, we estimate a dark matter halo
          mass  of  M_halo  =  10^11.7  +/-  0.3,  in good agreement with
          large-scale  clustering  studies  of  Lyman break galaxies. The
          baryonic   collapse   fraction  is  low  compared  to  actively
          star-forming  ``BX''  and  low-redshift  galaxies  around  z=2,
          perhaps  implying  comparatively less gas infall to small radii
          or  efficient  feedback.  Even  more  speculatively,  the  high
          central  mass  density  might  indicate  highly dissipative gas
          collapse   in   very  early  stages  of  galaxy  evolution,  in
          approximate  agreement with what is expected for ``inside-out''
          galaxy formation models.

          Title:   The  Tully-Fisher  relation  and  its  evolution  with
          redshift in cosmological simulations of disc galaxy formation
          Authors: L. Portinari, J. Sommer-Larsen
          Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  present  predictions  on  the evolution of the Tully-Fisher
          (TF)    relation   with   redshift,   based   on   cosmological
          N-body/hydrodynamical  simulations of disc galaxy formation and
          evolution.  The  simulations  invoke star formation and stellar
          feedback,  chemical evolution with non-instantaneous recycling,
          metallicity  dependent  radiative  cooling  and  effects  of  a
          meta-galactic   UV   field,   including   simplified  radiative
          transfer.
          At  z=0, the simulated and empirical TF relations are offset by
          about 0.4 magnitudes (1 sigma) in the B and I bands. The origin
          of   these   offsets  is  somewhat  unclear,  but  it  may  not
          necessarily be a problem of the simulations only.
          As  to  evolution,  we  find  a  brightening of the TF relation
          between  z=0  and  z=1  of about 0.85 mag in rest-frame B band,
          with  a  non-evolving  slope.  The  brightening  we  predict is
          intermediate between the (still quite discrepant) observational
          estimates.  This  evolution  is  primarily a luminosity effect,
          while  the stellar mass TF relation shows negligible evolution.
          The  individual  galaxies  do gain stellar mass between z=1 and
          z=0, by a 50-100%; but they also correspondingly increase their
          characteristic  circular  speed. As a consequence, individually
          they  mainly  evolve  ALONG the stellar mass TF relation, while
          the relation as such does not show any significant evolution.

          Title: Unlayered graphenes in red-giant starsmoke
          Authors: Eric Mandell, Nathaniel Hunton, P. Fraundorf
          Comments: 8 pages, 10 figs, 31 refs, RevTeX4 cf. this http URL
          Subj-class: Materials Science
          Electron diffraction, imaging, and energy loss provide evidence
          for   unlayered   graphene   sheets  in  the  core  of  certain
          interstellar  graphite  onions  (from  the meteorite Murchison)
          whose   isotopes   indicate  formation  in  the  atmosphere  of
          late-stage  asymptotic  giant  branch  stars  (like those which
          nucleo-synthesized  much  of  the earth's carbon). The data are
          compared   to   structural   models   loosely  associated  with
          atom-by-atom,   molecule-by-molecule,   and   dendritic-droplet
          solidification processes. In this context the observed density,
          diffraction peak-shapes, and edge-on sheet patterns, along with
          theoretical  limits  on  time  for  growth  in  the presence of
          outgoing  radiation  pressure,  suggest nucleation of hexagonal
          sheets  from  pentagons, perhaps from a supercooled melt. These
          results warrant a closer examination of specimen structure, the
          energetics of unlayered graphene nucleation, and processes such
          as jets in late star atmospheres.

          We  investigate  the  radio  emitting structures of radio-quiet
          active  galactic nuclei with an emphasis on radio-quiet quasars
          to  study  their connection to Seyfert galaxies. We present and
          analyse  high-sensitivity  VLA  radio  continuum  images  of 14
          radio-quiet  quasars  and six Seyfert galaxies. Many of the low
          redshift  radio-quiet quasars show radio structures that can be
          interpreted  as  jet-like outflows. However, the detection rate
          of  extended  radio  structures  on  arcsecond scales among our
          sample  decreases with increasing redshift and luminosity, most
          likely  due  to  a  lack of resolution. The morphologies of the
          detected  radio  emission  indicate  strong interactions of the
          jets  with  the  surrounding  medium. We also compare the radio
          data  of  seven  quasars  with  corresponding HST images of the
          [OIII]  emitting  narrow-line  region  (NLR).  We find that the
          scenario  of  interaction between the radio jet and the NLR gas
          is  confirmed  in  two  sources  by  structures  in the NLR gas
          distribution  as  previously  known  for  Seyfert galaxies. The
          extended   radio   structures   of   radio-quiet   quasars   at
          sub-arcsecond resolution are by no means different from that of
          Seyferts.    Among   the   luminosities   studied   here,   the
          morphological  features  found  are  similar  in  both types of
          objects   while  the  overall  size  of  the  radio  structures
          increases  with  luminosity.  This  supports  the picture where
          radio-quiet  quasars  are  the  scaled-up  versions  of Seyfert
          galaxies.  In  addition to known luminosity relations we find a
          correlation  of  the  NLR  size  and  the  radio size shared by
          quasars and Seyferts.

          Title: Stellar halos and elliptical galaxy formation: Origin of
          dynamical properties of the planetary nebular systems
          Authors: Kenji Bekki, Eric Peng
          Comments:  17  pages,  22  figures  (including  color figures),
          accepted by MNRAS
          Recent spectroscopic observations of planetary nebulae (PNe) in
          several   elliptical  galaxies  have  revealed  structural  and
          kinematical  properties  of  the outer stellar halo regions. In
          order  to  elucidate  the  origin  of  the  properties of these
          planetary   nebula  systems  (PNSs),  we  consider  the  merger
          scenario  in which an elliptical galaxy is formed by merging of
          spiral  galaxies.  Using numerical simulations, we particularly
          investigate  radial profiles of projected PNe number densities,
          rotational   velocities,   and  velocity  dispersions  of  PNSs
          extending  to  the  outer  halo  regions of elliptical galaxies
          formed  from  major  and unequal-mass merging. We find that the
          radial  profiles  of the project number densities can be fitted
          to the power-law and the mean number density in the outer halos
          of  the  ellipticals  can  be  more  than an order of magnitude
          higher  than  that  of the original spiral's halo. The PNSs are
          found  to  show a significant amount of rotation (V/sigma >0.5)
          in  the  outer  halo  regions  ($R$  $>$  $5R_{\rm  e}$) of the
          ellipticals.   Two-dimensional  velocity  fields  of  PNSs  are
          derived  from  the  simulations  and their dependences on model
          parameters  of  galaxy  merging  are  discussed  in  detail. We
          compare  the  simulated kinematics of PNSs with that of the PNS
          observed  in  NGC  5128  and  thereby  discuss  advantages  and
          disadvantages  of  the  merger model in explaining the observed
          kinematics of the PNS. We also find that the kinematics of PNSs
          in  elliptical  galaxies  are  quite  diverse  depending on the
          orbital  configurations  of  galaxy  merging, the mass ratio of
          merger  progenitor  spirals,  and  the  viewing  angle  of  the
          galaxies.  This  variation  translates  directly  into possible
          biases  by  a  factor  of  more  than two in observational mass
          estimation (abridged). ~ ~

          Title:  The  Cosmic  Microwave  Background  and  the Ionization
          History of the Universe
          Authors: Antony Lewis, Jochen Weller, Richard Battye
          Details  of  how  the  primordial plasma recombined and how the
          universe later reionized are currently somewhat uncertain. This
          uncertainty can restrict the accuracy of cosmological parameter
          measurements  from  the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). More
          positively,  future  CMB  data  can  be  used  to constrain the
          ionization  history  using  observations.  We first discuss how
          current  uncertainties  in  the  recombination  history  impact
          parameter  constraints, and show how suitable parameterizations
          can  be used to obtain unbiased parameter estimates from future
          data.  Some  parameters  can  be  constrained robustly, however
          there   is   clear   motivation  to  model  recombination  more
          accurately  with quantified errors. We then discuss constraints
          on   the   ionization   fraction   binned  in  redshift  during
          reionization.  Perfect CMB polarization data could in principle
          distinguish  different  histories  that  have  the same optical
          depth.  We discuss how well the Planck satellite may be able to
          constrain  the  ionization history, and show the currently very
          weak constraints from WMAP three-year data.

          22, 2006
          We  present  abundance  measurements  for two super Lyman Limit
          systems  (SLLS; quasar absorption line systems with 10^19 cm^-2
          <  N_HI  <  10^20.3  cm^-2) selected from a set of metal-strong
          absorbers  in  the  Sloan  Digital  Sky Survey quasar database.
          After   applying   estimate   corrections  for  photoionization
          effects,  we  derive  gas-phase metallicities of [M/H]=+0.7 +/-
          0.2  dex  for  the  SLLS  at  z=1.7749 toward SDSS0927+5621 and
          [M/H]=+0.05  +/-  0.1  dex  for  the  SLLS  at  z=1.7678 toward
          SDSS0953+5230.  The  former  exhibits  among  the  highest  gas
          metallicity  of  any  astrophysical  environment  and its total
          metal surface density exceeds that of nearly every known damped
          Lya   system.   The  properties  of  these  absorbers  --  high
          metallicity  and  large velocity width (> 300 km/s) -- resemble
          those  of  gas observed in absorption in the spectra of bright,
          star-forming  galaxies  at  high redshift. We discuss the metal
          mass  density  of  the SLLS based on these observations and our
          ongoing  SLLS  survey and argue that a conservative estimate to
          the total metal budget at z=2 is greater than 15% of the total,
          suggesting  that  the metal-rich LLS may represent the dominant
          metal reservoir in the young universe.

          LSI  +61  303  has  recently  been  detected  at  TeV gamma-ray
          energies   by   the   MAGIC   telescope.   We  have  applied  a

          energy  distribution  and  orbital  modulation of the very high

          the  adiabatic  and radiative cooling of non-thermal electrons.
          It  includes  synchrotron,  inverse  Compton (with seed photons
          from   the   companion   star  and  the  accretion  disk),  and
          synchrotron  self-Compton  emission,  as  well  as  gamma-gamma
          absorption  of  gamma-rays  by starlight photons. The model can
          successfully    reproduce    the    available   multiwavelength
          observational  data.  Our  best fit to the SED indicates that a
          magnetic  field  of B_0 ~ 5 X 10^3 G at ~ 10^3 R_g is required,
          and  electrons  need  to  be  accelerated  out  to TeV energies
          (gamma_2  =  10^6)  with a nonthermal injection spectrum with a
          spectral  index  of  q  =  1.7,  indicating  the  operation  of
          acceleration  mechanisms  beyond the standard first-order Fermi
          mechanism  at  relativistic  or  non-relativistic  shocks.  The
          orbital  modulation  of  the  VHE  gamma-ray  emission  can  be
          explained  solely  by  the geometrical effect of changes in the
          relative  orientation  of the stellar companion with respect to
          the compact object and jet as it impacts the position and depth
          of the gamma-gamma absorption trough.

          Title:  Clusters  and Groups of Galaxies in the Simulated Local
          Universe
          Authors: L. Casagrande, A. Diaferio
          Comments: 20 pages, 18 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  compare  the properties of galaxy groups extracted from the
          Update  Zwicky  Catalogue  (UZC) with those of groups extracted
          from  the  N-body  simulations  of  the  local  Universe,  in a
          $\Lambda$CDM  and a $\tau$CDM cosmology. In the simulations the
          initial  conditions of the dark matter density field are set to
          reproduce  the present time distribution of the galaxies within
          80  Mpc/h from the Milky Way. These initial conditions minimize
          the  uncertainty  originated  by  cosmic  variance,  which  has
          affected   previous  analyses  of  this  small  volume  of  the
          Universe.  The  simulations  also  model  the  evolution of the
          photometric   properties   of   the   galaxy   population  with
          semi-analytic   prescriptions.   The   models  yield  a  galaxy
          luminosity function sensibly different from that of the UZC and
          are  unable  to  reproduce the distribution of groups and their
          luminosity  content.  The discrepancy between the model and the
          UZC  reduces  substantially,  if we redistribute the luminosity
          among  the  galaxies  in  the  simulation  according to the UZC
          luminosity  function  while  preserving  the  galaxy luminosity
          rank.  The  modified $\Lambda$CDM model provides the best match
          to  the  UZC:  the  abundances  of  groups  by harmonic radius,
          velocity  dispersion,  mass  and luminosity are consistent with
          observations.  We find that this model also reproduces the halo
          occupation   number   of  groups  and  clusters.  However,  the
          large-scale  distribution  of  groups  is marginally consistent
          with  the  UZC  and  the redshift-space correlation function of
          galaxies  on  scales  larger  than  6  Mpc/h is still more than
          3-$\sigma$  smaller than observed. We conclude that reproducing
          the properties of the observed groups certainly requires a more
          sophisticated  treatment  of  galaxy formation, and possibly an
          improvement of the dark matter model.

          Authors: R. S. Bachev (Institute of Astronomy, Bulgaria)
          Comments:   4   pages,   1   figure.   Presented  at  the  5-th
          Bulgarian-Serbian  Conference "Astronomy and Space Science". To
          appear in Bulgarian Journal of Physics
          In  this  work  we  connect  some  measurable properties of the
          CIV1549   emission   line   with  the  quasar  accretion  rates
          (Eddington  ratios).  A tight correlation is found for a sample
          of  more  than  a hundred nearby objects, suggesting a possible
          method  for  a  relatively  accurate  estimate of the Eddington
          ratio  of  high-redshift  quasars, at least for the radio-quiet
          ones.  This paper further confirms the existing notion that the
          CIV changes (shifts) are mostly driven by the accretion rate.

          We  present the results of rest-frame ultraviolet spectroscopic
          observations of a sample of 14 z~3 star-forming galaxies in the
          SSA22a  field. These spectra are characterized by unprecedented
          depth  in  the  Lyman-continuum  region. For the first time, we
          have  detected  escaping  ionizing  radiation  from  individual
          galaxies  at  high redshift, with two of the 14 objects showing
          significant  emission  below  the Lyman limit. We also measured
          the  ratio  of  emergent flux density at 1500 AA to that in the
          Lyman-continuum  region, for the individual detections (C49 and
          D3) and the sample average. If a correction for the average IGM
          opacity is applied to the spectra of the objects C49 and D3, we
          find  f_1500/f_900,corr(C49)=4.5 and f_1500/f_900,corr(D3)=2.9.
          The  average  emergent  flux-density  ratio  in  our  sample is
          <f_1500/f_900,corr>=22,  implying an escape fraction ~4.5 times
          lower  than  inferred from the composite spectrum in Steidel et
          al.  (2001).  If  this  new estimate is representative of LBGs,
          their contribution to the metagalactic ionizing radiation field
          is  J_nu(900)~2.6x10^{-22}  erg/s/cm^2/Hz/sr, comparable to the
          contribution   of   optically-selected   quasars  at  the  same
          redshift.  The  sum  of  the  contributions  from  galaxies and
          quasars is consistent with recent estimates of the level of the
          ionizing  background  at  z~3,  inferred  from  the HI Ly-alpha
          forest  optical  depth. There is significant variance among the
          emergent   far-UV  spectra  in  our  sample,  yet  the  factors
          controlling  the  detection or non-detection of Lyman-continuum
          emission  from  galaxies are not well-determined. Because we do
          not  yet  understand the source of this variance, significantly
          larger samples will be required to obtain robust constraints on

          Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          We  study the synchrotron flaring behaviour of the blazar 3C279
          based  on  an extensive dataset covering 10 years of monitoring
          at  19 different frequencies in the radio-to-optical range. The
          properties   of   a  typical  outburst  are  derived  from  the
          observations by decomposing the 19 lightcurves into a series of
          self-similar  events.  This analysis is achieved by fitting all
          data  simultaneously  to  a  succession  of  outbursts  defined
          according  to the shock-in-jet model of Marscher & Gear (1985).
          We  compare the derived properties of the synchrotron outbursts
          in 3C279 to those obtained with a similar method for the quasar
          3C273.  It  is argued that differences in the flaring behaviour
          of  these  two  sources are intrinsic to the sources themselves
          rather  than  being due to orientation effects. We also compare
          the  start  times  and flux densities of our modelled outbursts
          with  those  measured  from radio components identified in Very
          Long  Baseline  Interferometry  (VLBI)  images.  We  find  VLBI
          counterparts  for  most  of  our model outbursts, although some
          high-frequency  peaking  events are not seen in the radio maps.
          Finally,  we  study  the  link  between the appearance of a new
          synchrotron  component  and  the  EGRET  gamma-ray state of the
          source  at  10  different  epochs.  We find that an early-stage
          shock component is always present during high gamma-ray states,
          while  in  low gamma-ray states the time since the onset of the
          last   synchrotron   outburst  is  significantly  longer.  This
          statistically  significant  correlation  supports the idea that
          gamma-ray  flares are associated with the early stages of shock
          components  propagating  in the jet. We note, however, that the
          shock  wave  is already beyond the broad line region during the
          gamma-ray flaring.

          Comments:  24  pages,  27  figures,  17  tables,  accepted  for
          publication in ApJS
          We present a survey of the extinction properties of ten lensing
          galaxies, in the redshift range z = 0.04 - 1.01, using multiply
          lensed  quasars imaged with the ESO VLT in the optical and near
          infrared.  The  multiple images act as 'standard light sources'
          shining through different parts of the lensing galaxy, allowing
          for  extinction  studies  by  comparison of pairs of images. We
          explore  the  effects  of  systematics  in the extinction curve
          analysis,  including  extinction  along both lines of sight and
          microlensing,  using  theoretical  analysis and simulations. In
          the  sample,  we  see  variation in both the amount and type of
          extinction.  Of  the  ten  systems,  seven  are consistent with
          extinction   along  at  least  one  line  of  sight.  The  mean
          differential  extinction  for  the most extinguished image pair
          for each lens is A(V) = 0.56 +- 0.04, using Galactic extinction
          law parametrization. The corresponding mean R_V = 2.8 +- 0.4 is
          consistent with that of the Milky Way at R_V = 3.1, where R_V =
          A(V)/E(B-V). We do not see any strong evidence for evolution of
          extinction  properties  with  redshift.  Of  the  ten  systems,
          B1152+199  shows the strongest extinction signal of A(V) = 2.43
          +-  0.09  and is consistent with a Galactic extinction law with
          R_V = 2.1 +- 0.1. Given the similar redshift distribution of SN
          Ia  hosts  and  lensing  galaxies, a large space based study of
          multiply  imaged quasars would be a useful complement to future
          dark energy SN Ia surveys, providing independent constraints on
          the statistical extinction properties of galaxies up to z~1.

          Title:   The  jet/disk  connection  in  AGN:  Chandra  and  XMM
          observations of three powerful radio-loud quasars
          Authors: R. M. Sambruna, M. Gliozzi, F. Tavecchio, L. Maraschi,
          L. Foschini
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          The  connection  between  the accretion process that powers AGN
          and  the  formation of jets is still poorly understood. Here we
          tackle   this   issue   using   new,  deep  \chandra  and  \xmm
          observations of the cores of three powerful radio loud quasars:
          1136--135,  1150+497  (\chandra),  and  0723+679 (\xmm), in the
          redshift  range  $z$=0.3--0.8. These sources are known from our
          previous \chandra snapshot survey to have kpc-scale X-ray jets.
          In  1136--135  and 1150+497, evidence is found for the presence
          of  diffuse  thermal X-ray emission around the cores, on scales
          of  40--50 kpc and with luminosity L$_{0.3-2 keV} \sim 10^{43}$
          \lum,  suggesting  thermal  emission  from the host galaxy or a
          galaxy  group.  The  X-ray  continua  of the cores in the three
          sources  are  described  by  an  upward-curved (concave) broken
          power law, with photon indices $\Gamma_{soft} \sim 1.8-2.1$ and
          $\Gamma_{hard}  \sim  1.7$  below  and  above  $\approx 2$ keV,
          respectively.  There  is  evidence for an unresolved \feka line
          with  EW $\sim$ 70 eV in the three quasars. The Spectral Energy
          Distributions  of the sources can be well described by a mix of
          jet  and  disk  emission, with the jet dominating the radio and
          hard X-rays (via synchrotron and external Compton) and the disk
          dominating the optical/UV through soft X-rays. The ratio of the
          jet-to-disk  powers  is $\sim 1$, consistent with those derived
          for a number of gamma-ray emitting blazars. This indicates that
          near  equality  of  accretion  and  jet  power may be common in
          powerful radio-loud AGN.

          3C273.  It  is argued that differences in the flaring behaviour
          of  these  two  sources are intrinsic to the sources themselves
          rather  than  being due to orientation effects. We also compare
          the  start  times  and flux densities of our modelled outbursts
          with  those  measured  from radio components identified in Very
          Long  Baseline  Interferometry  (VLBI)  images.  We  find  VLBI
          counterparts  for  most  of  our model outbursts, although some
          high-frequency  peaking  events are not seen in the radio maps.
          Finally,  we  study  the  link  between the appearance of a new
          synchrotron  component  and  the  EGRET  gamma-ray state of the
          source  at  10  different  epochs.  We find that an early-stage
          shock component is always present during high gamma-ray states,
          while  in  low gamma-ray states the time since the onset of the
          last   synchrotron   outburst  is  significantly  longer.  This
          statistically  significant  correlation  supports the idea that
          gamma-ray  flares are associated with the early stages of shock
          components  propagating  in the jet. We note, however, that the
          shock  wave  is already beyond the broad line region during the
          gamma-ray flaring.

          Title: Extinction Curves of Lensing Galaxies out to z=1

          Comments:  24  pages,  27  figures,  17  tables,  accepted  for
          publication in ApJS
          We present a survey of the extinction properties of ten lensing
          galaxies, in the redshift range z = 0.04 - 1.01, using multiply
          lensed  quasars imaged with the ESO VLT in the optical and near
          infrared.  The  multiple images act as 'standard light sources'
          shining through different parts of the lensing galaxy, allowing
          for  extinction  studies  by  comparison of pairs of images. We
          explore  the  effects  of  systematics  in the extinction curve
          analysis,  including  extinction  along both lines of sight and
          microlensing,  using  theoretical  analysis and simulations. In
          the  sample,  we  see  variation in both the amount and type of
          extinction.  Of  the  ten  systems,  seven  are consistent with
          extinction   along  at  least  one  line  of  sight.  The  mean
          differential  extinction  for  the most extinguished image pair
          for each lens is A(V) = 0.56 +- 0.04, using Galactic extinction
          law parametrization. The corresponding mean R_V = 2.8 +- 0.4 is
          consistent with that of the Milky Way at R_V = 3.1, where R_V =
          A(V)/E(B-V). We do not see any strong evidence for evolution of
          extinction  properties  with  redshift.  Of  the  ten  systems,
          B1152+199  shows the strongest extinction signal of A(V) = 2.43
          +-  0.09  and is consistent with a Galactic extinction law with
          R_V = 2.1 +- 0.1. Given the similar redshift distribution of SN
          Ia  hosts  and  lensing  galaxies, a large space based study of
          multiply  imaged quasars would be a useful complement to future
          dark energy SN Ia surveys, providing independent constraints on
          the statistical extinction properties of galaxies up to z~1.

          Title:   The  jet/disk  connection  in  AGN:  Chandra  and  XMM
          observations of three powerful radio-loud quasars
          Authors: R. M. Sambruna, M. Gliozzi, F. Tavecchio, L. Maraschi,
          L. Foschini
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          The  connection  between  the accretion process that powers AGN
          and  the  formation of jets is still poorly understood. Here we
          tackle   this   issue   using   new,  deep  \chandra  and  \xmm
          observations of the cores of three powerful radio loud quasars:
          1136--135,  1150+497  (\chandra),  and  0723+679 (\xmm), in the
          redshift  range  $z$=0.3--0.8. These sources are known from our
          previous \chandra snapshot survey to have kpc-scale X-ray jets.
          In  1136--135  and 1150+497, evidence is found for the presence
          of  diffuse  thermal X-ray emission around the cores, on scales
          of  40--50 kpc and with luminosity L$_{0.3-2 keV} \sim 10^{43}$
          \lum,  suggesting  thermal  emission  from the host galaxy or a
          galaxy  group.  The  X-ray  continua  of the cores in the three
          sources  are  described  by  an  upward-curved (concave) broken
          power law, with photon indices $\Gamma_{soft} \sim 1.8-2.1$ and
          $\Gamma_{hard}  \sim  1.7$  below  and  above  $\approx 2$ keV,
          respectively.  There  is  evidence for an unresolved \feka line
          with  EW $\sim$ 70 eV in the three quasars. The Spectral Energy
          Distributions  of the sources can be well described by a mix of
          jet  and  disk  emission, with the jet dominating the radio and
          hard X-rays (via synchrotron and external Compton) and the disk
          dominating the optical/UV through soft X-rays. The ratio of the
          jet-to-disk  powers  is $\sim 1$, consistent with those derived
          for a number of gamma-ray emitting blazars. This indicates that
          near  equality  of  accretion  and  jet  power may be common in
          powerful radio-loud AGN.

          Accretion  processes  in quasars and active galactic nuclei are
          still  poorly  understood,  especially as far as the connection
          between observed spectral properties and physical parameters is
          concerned.  Quasars  show  an  additional  degree of complexity
          compared    to   stars   that   is   related   to   anisotropic
          emission/obscuration  influencing  the  observed  properties in
          most  spectral  ranges.  This  complicating factor has hampered
          efforts  to  define  the  equivalent  of  an Hertzsprung-Russel
          diagram for quasars. Even if it has recently become possible to
          estimate  black hole mass and Eddington ratio for sources using
          optical  and  UV  broad  emission  lines, the results are still
          plagued by large uncertainties. Nevertheless, robust trends are
          emerging  from multivariate analysis of large spectral datasets
          of  quasars.  A  firm  observational basis is being laid out by
          accurate   measurements   of  broad  emission  line  properties
          especially when the source rest-frame is known. We consider the
          most   widely   discussed   correlations  (i.e.  the  so-called
          "eigenvector  1  parameter space" and the "Baldwin effect") and
          analyze  how  they  can  be  explained  in  terms  of accretion
          properties,  broad line region structure, and source evolution.
          We  critically  review  recent  estimates  of  black hole mass,
          accretion  rate,  spin  and  possible  orientation  indicators,
          stressing that any improvement in these parameters will provide
          a  much better understanding of the physics and dynamics of the
          region  producing the optical and UV broad emission lines. More
          accurate  measurements  of  Eddington ratio and black hole mass
          may  have  a significant impact on our ideas about evolution of
          quasar  properties  with  redshift and luminosity as well as on
          broader cosmological issues.

          Title: How to calculate the CMB spectrum
          Authors: Petter Callin
          Comments: 18 pages, latex with revtex4, 16 postscript figures
          We present a self-contained description of everything needed to
          write  a program that calculates the CMB power spectrum for the
          standard model of cosmology (LCDM). This includes the equations
          used,   assumptions   and   approximations   imposed  on  their
          solutions,  and most importantly the algorithms and programming
          tricks  needed  to  make  the code actually work. The resulting
          program  is  compared to CMBFAST and typically agrees to within
          0.1%  -  0.4%. It includes both helium, reionization, neutrinos
          and the polarization power spectrum. The methods presented here
          could  serve  as  a  starting point for people wanting to write
          their  own  CMB  program  from scratch, for instance to look at
          more  exotic  cosmological  models  where  CMBFAST or the other
          standard programs can't be used directly.

          Title: Neutral gas density in Damped Lyman Alpha systems
          Authors: M. Trenti (1), M. Stiavelli (1) ((1) STScI)
          Comments:  32 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We  estimate  the intrinsic neutral gas density in Damped Lyman
          Alpha  systems  ($\Omega_{HI}^{(DLA)}$) in the redshift range $
          2.2  \lesssim  z  \lesssim  5$ from the DLA SDSS DR_3 sample of
          optically    selected    quasars.    We   take   into   account
          self-consistently  the obscuration on background quasars due to
          the  dust  present  in Damped Lyman Alpha systems. We model the
          column  density  and  redshift distribution of these systems by
          using  both  a  non-parametric and a parametric approach. Under
          conservative  assumptions  on  the dust content of Damped Lyman
          $\alpha$  systems,  we  show  that  selection  effects  lead to
          underestimating  the  intrinsic neutral gas density by at least
          $15\%$  with  respect to the observed neutral gas density. Over
          the redshift range $[2.2;5.5]$ we find
          $\Omega_{HI}^{(DLA)}=0.97^{+0.08+0.28}_{-0.06-0.15}       \cdot
          10^{-3}$, where the first set of error bars gives the $1\sigma$
          random errors and the second set gives the modeling uncertainty
          dependent on the fraction of metals in dust - from 0\% to 50\%.
          This value compares with
          $\Omega_{HI}^{(DLA)}=0.82^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$   ($1\sigma$   error
          bars),  which  is  obtained  when  no  correction  for  dust is
          introduced.  In  the model with half of the metals mass in dust
          we  cannot  constraint  $\Omega_{HI}^{(DLA)}$  at  a confidence
          level  higher  than  $90\%$.  In  this  case  there is indeed a
          probability  of  about $10\%$ that the intrinsic column density
          distribution  of  DLA systems is a power law $f(N_{HI}) \propto
          1/N_{HI}^{~1.95}$.  In  contrast, with $25 \%$ of the metals in
          dust  -  the most realistic estimate - a power law is ruled out
          at $99.5\%$ of confidence level.

          We  have  used  the HST/ACS images to identify 4700 Lyman break
          galaxies  (LBGs)  in  GOODS.  We  present  the  results  from a
          parametric analysis of the 2-D surface brightness profiles, for
          1333  LBGs  at  z  >  2.5  with rest-frame UV(1600 Angstrom) AB
          magnitude < -20.5. Based on the Sersic index, n, which measures
          the  profile  shape, we find that about 40% of LBGs at z=3 have
          light profiles close to exponential, and only 30% have the high
          concentrations  seen for spheroids. About 30% of LBGs appear to
          have  multiple  cores  or  disturbed morphologies suggestive of
          close  pairs or on-going mergers. The fraction of spheroid-like
          (n  >  2.5)  LBGs  decreases  by  about  15% from z = 5 to 3. A
          comparison  of  LBGs  with  the  starburst galaxies at z = 1.2,
          shows  that the fraction of spheroid-like profiles is about 20%
          higher  among  LBGs.  The  ellipticity  distribution  for  LBGs
          exhibits  a pronounced skew towards high ellipticities (> 0.5),
          which  cannot be explained by morphologies similar to the local
          disks  and spheroids viewed at random orientations. The peak of
          the  distribution  evolves toward lower ellipticities, from 0.7
          at  z  =  4  to  0.5  at  z = 3. At z = 1.2 the distribution is
          relatively  flat  as  seen  among the present-day galaxies. The
          dominance of elongated morphologies among LBGs suggests that in
          a   significant   fraction   of   them  we  may  be  witnessing
          star-formation  in  clumps  along  gas-rich  filaments,  or the
          earliest  gas-rich  bars  that encompass essentially the entire
          visible  galaxy. Similar features are found to be ubiquitous in
          hydrodynamical  simulations  in  which galaxy formation at high
          redshifts occurs in filamentary inflows of dynamically cold gas
          within the dark matter halos, and involves gas- rich mergers.

          Title: Cosmological Evolution of the Duty Cycle of Quasars
          Authors: Jian-Min Wang, Yan-Mei Chen, Fan Zhang (IHEP, Beijing)
          Comments: Accepted by ApJL, 4 pages and 2 Figures
          Quasars are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes,
          but  the  problem  of  the  duty  cycle related to the episodic
          activity  of  the  black holes remains open as one of the major
          questions of cosmological evolution of quasars. In this Letter,
          we  obtain  quasar  duty  cycles  based  on analyses of a large
          sample composed of 10,979 quasars with redshifts $z\le2.1$ from
          the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS) Data Release Three. We
          estimate  masses  of  quasar  black holes and obtain their mass
          function (MF) of the present sample. We then get the duty cycle
          $\bar{\delta}(z)=10^{-3}\sim   1$   based  on  the  So{\l}tan's
          argument,  implying  that  black  holes are undergoing multiple
          episodic  activity.  We  find  that the duty cycle has a strong
          evolution.  By  comparison,  we show that evolution of the duty
          cycle  follows  the history of cosmic star formation rate (SFR)
          density  in  the  Universe, providing intriguing evidence for a
          natural  connection  between  star  formation and triggering of
          black hole activity. Feedback on star formation from black hole
          activity is briefly discussed.

          Title:  Radio  and  X-ray  Properties  of  Relativistic Beaming
          Models for Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources
          Authors: M Freeland, Z Kuncic, R Soria, G V Bicknell
          Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          We  calculate  the  broadband radio--X-ray spectra predicted by
          microblazar  and  microquasar  models  for Ultra-Luminous X-ray
          sources  (ULXs),  exploring the possibility that their dominant
          power-law  component is produced by a relativistic jet, even at
          near-Eddington  mass  accretion  rates.  We  do  this  by first
          constructing  a  generalized disk--jet theoretical framework in
          which  some  fraction  of  the  total  accretion  power  Pa  is
          efficiently  removed  from  the  accretion  disk  by a magnetic
          torque responsible for jet formation. Thus, for different black
          hole   masses,  mass  accretion  rates  and  magnetic  coupling
          strength,   we   self-consistently   calculate   the   relative
          importance  of  the  modified  disk  spectrum,  as  well as the
          overall  jet emission due to synchrotron and Compton processes.
          In  general,  transferring  accretion  power to a jet makes the
          disk  fainter  and cooler than a standard disk at the same mass
          accretion   rate;  this  may  explain  why  the  soft  spectral
          component  appears  less  prominent than the dominant power-law
          component  in most bright ULXs. We show that the apparent X-ray
          luminosity  and spectrum predicted by the microquasar model are
          consistent  with  the  observed  properties  of  most  ULXs. We
          predict that the radio synchrotron jet emission is too faint to
          be  detected at the typical threshold of radio surveys to date.
          This  is  consistent  with the high rate of non-detections over
          detections   in  radio  counterpart  searches.  Conversely,  we
          conclude that the observed radio emission found associated with
          a  few ULXs cannot be due to beamed synchrotron emission from a
          relativistic jet.

          Title: A model for the infrared emission of FSC 10214+4724
          Authors: Andreas Efstathiou
          Comments:  5  pages,  4  figures, accepted for publication as a
          MNRAS Letter
          A  model  for  the  infrared  emission  of  the  high  redshift
          ultraluminous  infrared galaxy FSC 10214+4724 is presented. The
          model  assumes  three  components  of  emission:  a dusty torus
          viewed edge-on, clouds that are associated with the narrow-line
          region and a highly obscured starburst. It is demonstrated that
          the  presence  of  clouds  in  the  narrow-line  region, with a
          covering  factor  of  17%,  can  explain  why  the mid-infrared
          spectrum of FSC 10214+4724 shows a silicate feature in emission
          despite  the  fact that its torus is viewed edge-on. It is also
          shown  that  the same model, but with the torus viewed face-on,
          predicts  a  spectrum  with  silicate emission features that is
          characteristic of the spectra of quasars recently observed with
          Spitzer.

          1333  LBGs  at  z  >  2.5  with rest-frame UV(1600 Angstrom) AB
          magnitude < -20.5. Based on the Sersic index, n, which measures
          the  profile  shape, we find that about 40% of LBGs at z=3 have
          light profiles close to exponential, and only 30% have the high
          concentrations  seen for spheroids. About 30% of LBGs appear to
          have  multiple  cores  or  disturbed morphologies suggestive of
          close  pairs or on-going mergers. The fraction of spheroid-like
          (n  >  2.5)  LBGs  decreases  by  about  15% from z = 5 to 3. A
          comparison  of  LBGs  with  the  starburst galaxies at z = 1.2,
          shows  that the fraction of spheroid-like profiles is about 20%
          higher  among  LBGs.  The  ellipticity  distribution  for  LBGs
          exhibits  a pronounced skew towards high ellipticities (> 0.5),
          which  cannot be explained by morphologies similar to the local
          disks  and spheroids viewed at random orientations. The peak of
          the  distribution  evolves toward lower ellipticities, from 0.7
          at  z  =  4  to  0.5  at  z = 3. At z = 1.2 the distribution is
          relatively  flat  as  seen  among the present-day galaxies. The
          dominance of elongated morphologies among LBGs suggests that in
          a   significant   fraction   of   them  we  may  be  witnessing
          star-formation  in  clumps  along  gas-rich  filaments,  or the
          earliest  gas-rich  bars  that encompass essentially the entire
          visible  galaxy. Similar features are found to be ubiquitous in
          hydrodynamical  simulations  in  which galaxy formation at high
          redshifts occurs in filamentary inflows of dynamically cold gas
          within the dark matter halos, and involves gas- rich mergers.

          Title: Cosmological Evolution of the Duty Cycle of Quasars
          Authors: Jian-Min Wang, Yan-Mei Chen, Fan Zhang (IHEP, Beijing)
          Comments: Accepted by ApJL, 4 pages and 2 Figures
          Quasars are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes,
          but  the  problem  of  the  duty  cycle related to the episodic
          activity  of  the  black holes remains open as one of the major
          questions of cosmological evolution of quasars. In this Letter,
          we  obtain  quasar  duty  cycles  based  on analyses of a large
          sample composed of 10,979 quasars with redshifts $z\le2.1$ from
          the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS) Data Release Three. We
          estimate  masses  of  quasar  black holes and obtain their mass
          function (MF) of the present sample. We then get the duty cycle
          $\bar{\delta}(z)=10^{-3}\sim   1$   based  on  the  So{\l}tan's
          argument,  implying  that  black  holes are undergoing multiple
          episodic  activity.  We  find  that the duty cycle has a strong
          evolution.  By  comparison,  we show that evolution of the duty
          cycle  follows  the history of cosmic star formation rate (SFR)
          density  in  the  Universe, providing intriguing evidence for a
          natural  connection  between  star  formation and triggering of
          black hole activity. Feedback on star formation from black hole
          activity is briefly discussed.

          Title:  Radio  and  X-ray  Properties  of  Relativistic Beaming
          Models for Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources
          Authors: M Freeland, Z Kuncic, R Soria, G V Bicknell
          Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          We  calculate  the  broadband radio--X-ray spectra predicted by
          microblazar  and  microquasar  models  for Ultra-Luminous X-ray
          sources  (ULXs),  exploring the possibility that their dominant
          power-law  component is produced by a relativistic jet, even at
          near-Eddington  mass  accretion  rates.  We  do  this  by first
          constructing  a  generalized disk--jet theoretical framework in
          which  some  fraction  of  the  total  accretion  power  Pa  is
          efficiently  removed  from  the  accretion  disk  by a magnetic
          torque responsible for jet formation. Thus, for different black
          hole   masses,  mass  accretion  rates  and  magnetic  coupling
          strength,   we   self-consistently   calculate   the   relative
          importance  of  the  modified  disk  spectrum,  as  well as the
          overall  jet emission due to synchrotron and Compton processes.
          In  general,  transferring  accretion  power to a jet makes the
          disk  fainter  and cooler than a standard disk at the same mass
          accretion   rate;  this  may  explain  why  the  soft  spectral
          component  appears  less  prominent than the dominant power-law
          component  in most bright ULXs. We show that the apparent X-ray
          luminosity  and spectrum predicted by the microquasar model are
          consistent  with  the  observed  properties  of  most  ULXs. We
          predict that the radio synchrotron jet emission is too faint to
          be  detected at the typical threshold of radio surveys to date.
          This  is  consistent  with the high rate of non-detections over
          detections   in  radio  counterpart  searches.  Conversely,  we
          conclude that the observed radio emission found associated with
          a  few ULXs cannot be due to beamed synchrotron emission from a
          relativistic jet.

          Title: A model for the infrared emission of FSC 10214+4724
          Authors: Andreas Efstathiou
          Comments:  5  pages,  4  figures, accepted for publication as a
          MNRAS Letter
          A  model  for  the  infrared  emission  of  the  high  redshift
          ultraluminous  infrared galaxy FSC 10214+4724 is presented. The
          model  assumes  three  components  of  emission:  a dusty torus
          viewed edge-on, clouds that are associated with the narrow-line
          region and a highly obscured starburst. It is demonstrated that
          the  presence  of  clouds  in  the  narrow-line  region, with a
          covering  factor  of  17%,  can  explain  why  the mid-infrared
          spectrum of FSC 10214+4724 shows a silicate feature in emission
          despite  the  fact that its torus is viewed edge-on. It is also
          shown  that  the same model, but with the torus viewed face-on,
          predicts  a  spectrum  with  silicate emission features that is
          characteristic of the spectra of quasars recently observed with
          Spitzer.

          We  report  on detailed spectroscopic studies performed for the
          secondary  star  in  the black hole binary (micro-quasar) V4641
          Sgr in order to examine its surface chemical composition and to
          see  if  its surface shows any signature of pollution by ejecta
          from  a  supernova  explosion. High-resolution spectra of V4641
          Sgr  observed  in the quiescent state in the blue-visual region
          are compared with those of the two bright well-studied B9 stars
          (14  Cyg  and $\nu$ Cap) observed with the same instrument. The
          effective  temperature  of  V4641  Sgr  (10500  $\pm$ 200 K) is
          estimated  from  the  strengths  of He~{\sc i} lines, while its
          rotational  velocity,  $\it  v$  sin  $\it  i$  (95 $\pm$ 10 km
          s${}^{-1}$),  is  estimated from the profile of the Mg~{\sc ii}
          line  at 4481 \AA. We obtain abundances of 10 elements and find
          definite  over-abundances  of N (by 0.8 dex or more) and Na (by
          0.8  dex)  in V4641 Sgr. From line-by-line comparisons of eight
          other elements (C, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ti, Cr, and Fe) between V4641
          Sgr  and  the two reference stars, we conclude that there is no
          apparent difference in the abundances of these elements between
          V4641 Sgr and the two normal late B-type stars, which have been
          reported  to  have solar abundances. An evolutionary model of a
          massive close binary system has been constructed to explain the
          abundances  observed  in V4641 Sgr. The model suggests that the
          progenitor  of  the black hole forming supernova was as massive
          as  ~  35  Msun on the main-sequence and, after becoming a ~ 10
          Msun  He  star, underwent "dark" explosion which ejected only N
          and  Na-rich  outer  layer  of  the He star without radioactive
          $^{56}$Ni.

          Shocks and blastwaves are expected to be driven driven into the
          intracluster  medium  filling  galaxy  groups  and  clusters by
          powerful  outbursts of active galactic nuclei or quasars in the
          member galaxies; the first footprints of shock fronts have been
          tentatively   traced  out  with  X-ray  imaging.  We  show  how
          overpressures in the blasts behind the shock can prove the case
          and  also  provide  specific marks of the nuclear activity: its
          strength,  its  current stage, and the nature of its prevailing
          output.  We  propose  to  detect  these  marks  with  the aimed
          pressure  probe  constituted by the resolved Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
          effect.  We  compute and discuss the outcomes to be expected in
          nearby  and  distant  sources  at  different  stages  of  their
          activity.

          Authors:  Emma  V. Ryan-Weber (1), Max Pettini (1), Piero Madau

          on June 28th
          We  report  the  discovery of a strong CIV 1548,1550 absorption
          system at z_abs = 5.7238 in the near-infrared spectrum (J-band)
          of  the  z_em  =  6.28 QSO SDSS J1030+0524. These observations,
          obtained  with  the  Infrared  Spectrometer  And  Array  Camera
          (ISAAC)   on  the  European  Southern  Observatory  Very  Large
          Telescope    (ESO   VLT),   demonstrate   that,   with   modern
          instrumentation,   QSO  absorption  line  spectroscopy  can  be
          successfully extended to near-infrared wavelengths to probe the
          intergalactic  medium  near  the end of the reionization epoch.
          Although  the  statistics  of this pilot study are limited, the
          mass  density  of  triply ionized carbon implied by our data is
          comparable  to  the  values  of  Omega_CIV  reported  at  lower
          redshifts.  Neither  the  column  density  distribution  of CIV
          absorbers  nor its integral show significant redshift evolution
          over  a  period of time which stretches from 1 to 4.5 Gyr after
          the big bang, suggesting that a large fraction of intergalactic
          metals  may  already  have  been in place at redshifts above 6.
          Alternatively,  the  strong  CIV system we have detected may be
          associated   with   outflowing,   highly-ionized,  gas  from  a
          foreground  massive  galaxy;  deep  imaging and spectroscopy of
          galaxies  near  the QSO sightline should be able to distinguish
          between these two possibilities.

          We   investigate   the  X-ray  properties  of  PG  1004+130,  a
          low-redshift radio-loud broad absorption line (BAL) quasar with
          a  hybrid  FR  I/FR II radio morphology. The 22.2 ks XMM-Newton
          and  41.6  ks Chandra observations presented here are the first
          X-ray  detections  of  PG  1004+130  and constitute the highest
          spectral  quality X-ray observations of a radio-loud BAL quasar
          available  to  date. The Chandra ACIS-S spectrum shows evidence
          for  complex  soft  X-ray  absorption  not detected in the data
          obtained  1.7  yr  previously  with XMM-Newton, with a best-fit
          intrinsic  column  density of N_H=1.2e22 cm-2 for the preferred
          partial-covering  model.  There is no significant difference in
          the  hard-band  power-law  photon index of ~1.5 between the two
          observations.  The  Chandra  image  also reveals extended X-ray
          emission  ~8'' (30 kpc) south-east of the nucleus, aligned with
          the FR I jet but upstream of the 1.4 GHz radio-brightness peak.
          The  jet  is  not  detected by HST, and the optical upper limit
          rules  out a simple single-component synchrotron interpretation
          of    the    radio-to-X-ray   emission.   The   multiwavelength
          characteristics   of   the   PG  1004+130  jet,  including  its
          relatively  flat  X-ray  power  law and concave spectral energy
          distribution,  are similar to those of powerful FR II jets. The
          lack  of strong beaming in PG 1004+130 limits the efficiency of
          inverse   Compton  upscattering,  and  we  consider  the  X-ray
          emission  to  most  likely  arise  from  a  second  synchrotron
          component generated by highly energetic electrons.

          It  is  argued  that there is a linear correlation between star
          formation  rate  (SFR)  and  accretion  rate  for normal bright
          active  galactic  nuclei  (AGNs).  However, it is still unclear
          whether  this  correlation  holds  for  LINERs,  of  which  the
          accretion  rates  are  relatively  lower  than  those of normal
          bright   AGNs.  The  radiatively  inefficient  accretion  flows
          (RIAFs)  are  believed  to  be present in these LINERs. In this
          work,  we  derive  accretion  rates for a sample of LINERs from
          their  hard  X-ray  luminosities based on spectral calculations
          for  RIAFs.  We  find  that  LINERs follow the same correlation
          between  star  formation  rate  and  accretion  rate defined by
          normal  bright AGNs, when reasonable parameters are adopted for
          RIAFs.  It  means  that  the gases feed the black hole and star
          formation  in  these  low-luminosity LINERs may follow the same
          way  as that in normal bright AGNs, which is roughly consistent
          with recent numerical simulations on quasar evolution.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          We discovered an H alpha absorption in a broad H alpha emission
          line   of   an  unusual  broad  absorption  line  quasar,  SDSS
          J083942.11+380526.3  at  z=2.318, by near-infrared spectroscopy
          with  the  Cooled  Infrared  Spectrograph  and  Camera  for OHS
          (CISCO)  on the Subaru telescope. The Presence of non-stellar H
          alpha  absorption  is known only in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151
          to  date, thus our discovery is the first case for quasars. The
          H  alpha absorption line is blueshifted by 520 km/s relative to
          the  H  alpha  emission line, and its redshift almost coincides
          with  those  of  UV  low-ionization metal absorption lines. The
          width  of  the  H  alpha  absorption (~ 340 km/s) is similar to
          those  of  the  UV low-ionization absorption lines. These facts
          suggest   that   the  H  alpha  and  the  low-ionization  metal
          absorption  lines  are  produced by the same low-ionization gas
          which  has  a  substantial  amount  of  neutral gas. The column
          density  of  the  neutral  hydrogen  is estimated to be ~ 10^18
          cm^-2  by  assuming  a  gas  temperature  of  10,000 K from the
          analysis  of  the  curve  of  growth. The continuum spectrum is
          reproduced  by  a  reddened (E(B-V) ~ 0.15 mag for the SMC-like
          reddening  law)  composite quasar spectrum. Furthermore, the UV
          spectrum   of   SDSS  J083942.11+380526.3  shows  a  remarkable
          similarity to that of NGC 4151 in its low state, suggesting the
          physical  condition of the absorber in SDSS J083942.11+380526.3
          is  similar  to  that of NGC 4151 in the low state. As proposed
          for NGC 4151, SDSS J083942.11+380526.3 may be also seen through
          the close direction of the surface of the obscuring torus.

          A  new  critical behavior in unconventional superconductors and
          superfluids  is  established and described by the Wilson-Fisher
          renormalization-group method. For certain symmetries of order a
          new type of fluctuation-driven first order phase transitions at
          finite  and  zero temperature are predicted. The results can be
          applied  to  a  wide class of ferromagnetic superconductive and
          superfluid systems, in particular, to itinerant ferromagnets as
          UGe_2 and URhGe.

          The  Sloan Digital Sky survey detected luminous quasars at very
          high  redshift,  z>6.  Follow-up observations indicated that at
          least  some  of these quasars are powered by supermassive black
          holes  (SMBHs)  with  masses in excess of billion solar masses.
          SMBHs,  therefore,  seem  to  have  already  existed  when  the
          Universe  was  less  than  1  Gyr  old,  and the bulk of galaxy
          formation still has to take place. We investigate in this paper
          to which extent accretion and dynamical processes influence the
          early  growth  of SMBHs. We assess the impact of (i) black hole
          mergers, (ii) the influence of the merging efficiency and (iii)
          the  negative  contribution  due to dynamical effects which can
          kick  black  holes  out  of  their  host  halos  (gravitational
          recoil).  We  find  that  if accretion is always limited by the
          Eddington   rate   via  a  thin  disc,  the  maximum  radiative
          efficiency  allowed to reproduce the LF at z=6 is of order 12%,
          when  the  adverse  effect of the gravitational recoil is taken
          into  consideration.  Dynamical  effects cannot be neglected in
          studies  of  high-redshift SMBHs. If black holes can accrete at
          super-critical  rate  during  an  early  phase, reproducing the
          observed  SMBH  mass  values  is not an issue, even in the case
          that  the  recoil velocity is in the upper limits range, as the
          mass  ratios of merging binaries are skewed towards low values,
          where  the gravitational recoil effect is very mild. We propose
          that  SMBH  growth  at  early  times  is  very  selective,  and
          efficient  only  for  black  holes  hosted in high density peak
          halos.

          Title:  Dark  energy  and  curvature  from  a  future  baryonic
          acoustic oscillation survey using the Lyman-alpha forest
          Authors: Patrick McDonald (CITA), Daniel Eisenstein (Arizona)
          Comments: 18 pages including 6 figures, submitted to PRD
          We  explore  the  requirements  for a Lyman-alpha forest (LyaF)
          survey  designed  to  measure the angular diameter distance and
          Hubble  parameter  at 2~<z~<4 using the standard ruler provided
          by  baryonic  acoustic oscillations (BAO). The goal would be to
          obtain   a   high  enough  density  of  sources  to  probe  the
          three-dimensional  density  field  on  the  scale  of  the  BAO
          feature. A percent-level measurement in this redshift range can
          almost  double  the  Dark  Energy  Task  Force Figure of Merit,
          relative  to the case with only a similar precision measurement
          at  z~1,  if  the  Universe  is  not  assumed  to be flat. This
          improvement  is  greater  than the one obtained by doubling the
          size  of the z~1 survey, with Planck and a weak SDSS-like z=0.3
          BAO measurement assumed in each case. Galaxy BAO surveys at z~1
          may   be   able   to   make   an   effective  LyaF  measurement
          simultaneously  at  minimal  added  cost,  because the required
          number  density  of quasars is relatively small. We discuss the
          constraining  power  as  a  function  of  area, magnitude limit
          (density  of  quasars),  resolution, and signal-to-noise of the
          spectra.  For  example,  a  survey  covering  2000 sq. deg. and
          achieving  S/N=1.8  per Ang. at g=23 (~40 quasars per sq. deg.)
          with  an  R~>250 spectrograph is sufficient to measure both the
          radial  and transverse oscillation scales to 1.4% from the LyaF
          (or  better,  if  fainter  magnitudes  and possibly Lyman-break
          galaxies  can  be  used).  At fixed integration time and in the
          sky-noise-dominated limit, a wider, noisier survey is generally
          more efficient; the only fundamental upper limit on noise being
          the  need to identify a quasar and find a redshift. Because the
          LyaF  is  much closer to linear and generally better understood
          than  galaxies,  systematic errors are even less likely to be a
          problem.

          Title:  Interacting  Dark Energy and Dark Matter: observational
          Constraints from Cosmological Parameters

          S. Micheletti
          Comments: 20 pages, 9 figures
          Several   observational   constraints   are   imposed   on  the
          interacting  holographic  model of Dark Energy and Dark Matter.
          First  we  use  the  age  parameter today, as given by the WMAP
          results.  Subsequently,  we  explained  the  reason  why  it is
          possible,  as  recently  observed,  for  an  old  quasar  to be
          observed  in  early  stages  of  the  universe. We discuss this
          question in terms of the evolution of the age parameter as well
          as  in  terms  of  the  structure formation. Finally, we give a
          detailed  discussion of the constraints implied by the observed
          CMB  low  $\ell$  suppression.  As  a  result,  the interacting
          holographic  model  has  been  proved  to  be  robust  and with
          reasonable  bounds predicts a non vanishing interaction of Dark
          Energy and Dark Matter.

          Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures, uses natbib.sty and aa.cls
          We  have  searched  for  microlensing  variability in the light
          curves    of   five   gravitationally   lensed   quasars   with
          well-determined  time  delays:  SBS 1520+530, FBQ 0951+2635, RX
          J0911+0551,  B1600+434 and HE 2149-2745. By comparing the light
          curve  of  the  leading image with a suitably time offset light
          curve  of  a  trailing image we find that two (SBS 1520+530 and
          FBQ  0951+2635)  out  of  the  five  quasars  have  significant
          long-term   (years)   and   short-term  (100  days)  brightness
          variations   that   may   be   attributed  to  microlensing.The
          short-term  variations  may  be due to nanolenses, relativistic
          hot  or  cold  spots in the quasar accretion disks, or coherent
          microlensing at large optical depth.

          Title:  Is  there  a  caustic  crossing  in  the  lensed quasar

          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, to appear in MNRAS
          We  re-investigate the gravitationally lensed system Q2237+0305
          data  record  to  quantify  the probability of having a caustic
          crossing  in the A component. Several works assume that this is
          the  case,  but  no  quantitative  analysis is available in the
          literature.  We  combine  the  datasets from the OGLE and GLITP
          collaborations  to  accurately trace the prominent event in the
          lightcurve for the A component of the system. Then the observed
          event  is  compared  with  synthetic  light curves derived from
          trajectories  in  magnification  maps. These maps are generated
          using   a   ray-tracing  technique.  We  take  more  than  10^9
          trajectories  and  test  a  wide  range  of  different physical
          properties  of  the  lensing galaxy and the source quasar (lens
          transverse  velocity,  microlens mass, source intensity profile
          and  source  size).  We  found  that  around  75%  of  our good
          trajectories  (i.e.  that are consistent with the observations)
          are  caustic crossings. In addition, a high transverse velocity
          exceeding  300  km/s, a microlens mass of about 0.1 M_sun and a
          small   standard   accretion   disk   is   the  best  parameter
          combination.  The  results  justify  the  interpretation of the
          OGLE-GLITP   event   in  Q2237+0305A  as  a  caustic  crossing.
          Moreover, the physical properties of the lens and source are in
          very  good agreement with previous works. We also remark that a
          standard   accretion   disk   is   prefered  to  those  simpler
          approaches,  and  that  the former should be used in subsequent
          simulations.

          Title: Oscillating axion bubbles as alternative to supermassive
          black holes at galactic centers
          Authors: Anatoly A. Svidzinsky
          Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures
          Recent  observations  of  near-infrared  and  X-ray flares from
          Sagittarius  A*,  which  is believed to be a supermassive black
          hole  at  the  Galactic  center,  show that the source exhibits
          about 20-minute periodic variability. Here we provide arguments
          based  on  a quantitative analysis that supermassive objects at
          galactic centers are bubbles of dark matter axions, rather then
          black  holes.  An oscillating axion bubble can explain periodic
          variability  of  Sagittarius  A*  and  with  no free parameters
          yields  the  axion  mass  about  1  meV  in  agreement with our
          previous findings obtained from quasar observations. The bubble
          scenario  naturally explains lack of supermassive "black holes"
          with M<10^6M_{Sun}. Low-mass bubbles decay fast and as a result
          are  very  rare. We also found that the mass of an axion bubble
          can  not  exceed  2.5\times  10^9M_{Sun}, in agreement with the
          largest  supermassive  "black  hole" masses measured for active
          galactic  nuclei.  Our  finding,  if  confirmed,  suggests that
          Einstein  general  relativity is invalid for strong gravity and
          the  gravitational force effectively becomes repulsive at large
          potential. Imaging a shadow of the "black hole" at the Galactic
          center  with  VLBI within the next few years will be capable to
          distinguish  between  the  black hole and the oscillating axion
          bubble  scenarios. In the case of axion bubble, a steady shadow
          will  not  be  observed.  Instead,  the  shadow will appear and
          disappear periodically with a period of about 20 min.

          Title:  Evolution  in  the  Halo  Masses  of  Isolated Galaxies

          Comments: 20 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  measure  the  evolution  in  the virial mass-to-light ratio
          (M_{200}/L_B) and virial-to-stellar mass ratio (M_{200}/M_\ast)
          for  isolated  ~  L*  galaxies between z~1 and z~0 by combining
          data  from  the  DEEP2  Galaxy  Redshift  Survey  and the Sloan
          Digital Sky Survey. Utilizing the motions of satellite galaxies
          around  isolated  galaxies,  we  measure line-of-sight velocity
          dispersions and derive dark matter halo virial masses for these
          host  galaxies.  At  both  epochs  the  velocity  dispersion of
          satellites   correlates   with   host   galaxy   stellar  mass,
          \sigma\propto  M_\ast^{0.4+/-0.1},  while  the relation between
          satellite velocity dispersion and host galaxy B-band luminosity
          may  grow somewhat shallower from \sigma\propto L_B^{0.6+/-0.1}
          at  z~1  to \sigma\propto L_B^{0.4+/-0.1} at z~0. The evolution
          in  M_200/M_\ast  from z~1 to z~0 displays a bimodality insofar
          as  host  galaxies  with  stellar  mass  below  M_\ast ~10^{11}
          M_Sun/h  maintain  a  constant ratio (the intrinsic increase is
          constrained to a factor of 1.1+/-0.7) while host galaxies above
          M_\ast  ~10^{11}  M_Sun/h experience a factor of 4+/-3 increase
          in  their  virial-to-stellar  mass  ratio.  This  result can be
          easily  understood  if  galaxies  below this stellar mass scale
          continue  to  form stars while star formation in galaxies above
          this  scale  is  quenched and the dark matter halos of galaxies
          both  above  and  below this scale grow in accordance with LCDM
          cosmological  simulations.  Host  galaxies  that are red in U-B
          color  have  larger  satellite  dispersions and hence reside on
          average  in  more  massive halos than blue galaxies at both z~1
          and  z~0.  The redshift and host galaxy stellar mass dependence
          of  M_200/M_\ast  agrees  qualitatively with the Millennium Run
          semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. (ABRIDGED)

          We    present    the   first   calculation   of   the   kinetic
          Sunyaev-Zel'dovich   (kSZ)   effect  due  to  the  inhomogeneus
          reionization  of  the  universe  based  on detailed large-scale
          radiative  transfer  simulations of reionization. The resulting
          sky  power  spectra  peak at l=2000-8000 with maximum values of
          l(l+1)C_l/(2pi)_{max}~4-7x10^{-13}.     The    scale    roughly
          corresponds to the typical ionized bubble sizes observed in our
          simulations,  of  ~5-20  Mpc.  The  kSZ  anisotropy signal from
          reionization  dominates the primary CMB signal above l=3000. At
          large  scales  the patchy kSZ signal depends only on the source
          efficiencies.  It  is higher when sources are more efficient at
          producing  ionizing  photons, since such sources produce larger
          ionized  regions,  on average, than less efficient sources. The
          introduction of sub-grid gas clumping in the radiative transfer
          simulations  produce  significantly more power at small scales,
          but  has little effect at large scales. The patchy reionization
          kSZ  signal  is  dominated by the post-reionization signal from
          fully-ionized  gas,  but  the  two contributions are of similar
          order   at   scales   l~3000-10^4,   indicating  that  the  kSZ
          anisotropies  from  reionization  are an important component of
          the total kSZ signal at these scales.

          We  present  the  results  from  adaptive  optics (AO) assisted
          imaging  in  the  Ks  band  of  an area of 15 arcmin^2 for SWAN
          (Survey  of  a  Wide  Area  with  NACO).  We  derive  the  high
          resolution near-IR morphology of ~400 galaxies up to Ks~23.5 in
          the  first  21 SWAN fields around bright guide stars, carefully
          taking  into  account the survey selection effects and using an
          accurate  treatment  of  the anisoplanatic AO PSF. The detected
          galaxies are sorted into two morphological classes according to
          their  Sersic index. The extracted morphological properties and
          number counts of the galaxies are compared with the predictions
          of  different  galaxy  formation and evolution models, both for
          the  whole  galaxy  population and separately for late-type and
          early-type  galaxies.  This  is  one  of the first times such a
          comparison has been done in the near-IR, as AO observations and
          accurate   PSF   modeling   are   needed   to  obtain  reliable
          morphological  classification  of faint field galaxies at these
          wavelengths.  For  early-type  galaxies  we  find  that  a pure
          luminosity  evolution  model,  without  evidence  for  relevant
          number  and  size  evolution,  better  reproduces  the observed
          properties of our Ks-selected sample than current semi-analytic
          models  based  on the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation.
          In   particular,  we  find  that  the  observed  flattening  of
          elliptical  galaxy  counts  at  Ks~20 is quantitatively in good
          agreement  with the prediction of the pure luminosity evolution
          model  that  was  calculated  prior  to  the  observation.  For
          late-type galaxies, while both models are able to reproduce the
          number  counts,  we  find some hints of a possible size growth.
          These  results  demonstrate the unique power of AO observations
          to derive high resolution details of faint galaxies' morphology
          in the near-IR and drive studies of galaxy evolution.

          This   review  focuses  on  the  X-ray  emission  processes  of
          extra-galactic  jets  on  scales  resolvable  by the sub arcsec
          resolution of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. It is divided into
          4   parts.  The  introductory  chapter  reviews  the  classical
          problems  for  jets,  as well as those associated directly with
          the  X-ray  emission. Throughout this section, we deal with the
          dualisms of low powered radio sources versus high powered radio
          galaxies and quasars; synchrotron models versus inverse Compton
          models;  and  the  distinction  between the relativistic plasma
          responsible   for   the   received  radiation  and  the  medium
          responsible  for  the  transport  of  energy  down the jet. The
          second  part collects the observational and inferred parameters
          for the currently detected X-ray jets and attempts to put their
          relative  sizes  and luminosities in perspective. In part 3, we
          first  give the relevant radio and optical jet characteristics,
          and then examine the details of the X-ray data and how they can
          be  related  to  various  jet  attributes.  The last section is
          devoted to a critique of the two non-thermal emission processes
          and to prospects for progress in our understanding of jets.

          parameters of early--type galaxies at z~1 down to M_B \leq -20,
          both in the field and in the clusters. The changes in the M/L_B
          ratio  from  z~1 to today are larger for lower mass galaxies in
          all  environments,  and  are  larger  in  the field than in the
          clusters for galaxies with the same mass. By deriving ages from
          the  M/L_B  ratio,  we  estimate  the  formation  redshift  for
          early-type   galaxies   as   a  function  of  galaxy  mass  and
          environment.  We  find  that (1) the age of early-type galaxies
          increases  with  galaxy  mass (downsizing) in all environments,
          (2) cluster galaxies are older than field galaxies at any given
          galaxy  mass, and (3) this age difference increases with galaxy
          mass.  The  first  two results confirm similar ones obtained by
          other  means,  while  the  third  one  is  new. The most recent
          incarnation  of the hierarchical models of galaxy formation and
          evolution  is  capable of explaining the first two results, but
          predicts the opposite of our third result. We also find a total
          lack  of  massive early--type galaxies M>3 10^{11} solar masses
          with  a  formation redshift smaller than 2, which cannot be due
          to selection effects.

          Title:  21  cm  fluctuations  from  inhomogeneous X-ray heating
          before reionization
          Authors:  Jonathan R. Pritchard (Caltech), Steven R. Furlanetto
          (Yale)
          Comments: 14 pages, 11 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Many  models  of  early structure formation predict a period of
          heating  immediately  preceding reionization, when X-rays raise
          the   gas  temperature  above  that  of  the  cosmic  microwave
          background.   These  X-rays  are  often  assumed  to  heat  the
          intergalactic  medium (IGM) uniformly, but in reality they will
          heat  the gas more strongly closer to the sources. We develop a
          framework  for calculating fluctuations in the 21 cm brightness
          temperature  that  originate from this spatial variation in the
          heating  rate.  High-redshift  sources  are  highly  clustered,
          leading  to  significant  gas  temperature  fluctuations  (with
          fractional  variations ~40%, peaking on k~0.1 Mpc^{-1} scales).
          This   induces  a  distinctive  peak-trough  structure  in  the
          angle-averaged 21 cm power spectrum, which may be accessible to
          the  proposed  Square  Kilometre Array. This signal reaches the
          ~10  mK level, and is stronger than that induced by Lyman alpha
          flux  fluctuations. As well as probing the thermal evolution of
          the  IGM  before  reionization,  this  21  cm  signal  contains
          information  about  the  spectra  of  the  first X-ray sources.
          Finally,  we  consider  disentangling  temperature, density and
          Lyman alpha flux fluctuations as functions of redshift.

          Title:   Satellite  Systems  around  Galaxies  in  Hydrodynamic
          Simulations
          Authors:  Noam I Libeskind, Shaun Cole, Carlos S Frenk, Takashi
          Okamoto, Adrian Jenkins
          Comments: MNRAS, submitted
          We  investigate  the properties of satellite galaxies formed in
          N-body/SPH  simulations of galaxy formation in the $\Lambda$CDM
          cosmology.  The  simulations  include the main physical effects
          thought  to  be  important  in galaxy formation and, in several
          cases,  produce realistic spiral discs. In total, a sample of 9
          galaxies   of  luminosity  comparable  to  the  Milky  Way  was
          obtained.  At  magnitudes  brighter  than the resolution limit,
          $M_V=-12$, the luminosity function of the satellite galaxies in
          the  simulations  is  in  excellent agreement with data for the
          Local  Group.  The  radial  number density profile of the model
          satellites,   as   well  as  their  gas  fractions  also  match
          observations  very  well.  In  agreement  with  previous N-body
          studies,  we find that the satellites tend to be distributed in
          highly  flattened  configurations  whose  major axis is aligned
          with the major axis of the (generally triaxial) dark halo. In 2
          out of 3 systems with sufficiently large satellite populations,
          the  satellite  system  is nearly perpendicular to the plane of
          the  galactic  disc, a configuration analogous to that observed
          in  the Milk Way. The discs themselves are perpendicular to the
          minor  axis  of  their  host  halos in the inner parts, and the
          correlation between the orientation of the galaxy and the shape
          of the halo persists even out to the virial radius. However, in
          one  case  the disc's minor axis ends up, at the virial radius,
          perpendicular  to  the  minor  axis  of  the  halo. The angular
          momenta  of  the  galaxies  and their host halo tend to be well
          aligned.

          Title:  Smooth  Boundaries  to  Cosmological  HII  Regions from
          Galaxy Clustering
          Authors: Stuart Wyithe, Abraham Loeb
          Comments: 5 Pages, 3 figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          The HII regions around quasars and galaxies at redshifts beyond
          the  epoch  of  reionisation  will  provide  prime  targets for
          upcoming 21cm campaigns using a new generation of low-frequency
          radio  observatories. Here we show that the boundaries of these
          HII  regions  will  not  be  sharp.  Rather,  the clustering of
          sources  near  massive  galaxies  results in a neutral fraction
          that rises gradually towards large radii from an interior value
          near  zero.  A  neutral  fraction  corresponding  to the global
          background  value  is  typically  reached  at a distance of 2-5
          times  the  radius of the HII region around the central massive
          galaxy.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal
          We  present  a  detection  of  [CI] line emission in the lensed
          quasar  APM 08279+5255 at z=3.91 using the IRAM Plateau de Bure
          interferometer. The [CI] line velocity and width are similar to
          the  values  of  previously detected high-J CO and HCN lines in
          this  source,  suggesting  that  the emission from all of these
          species arises from the same region. The apparent luminosity of
          the  [CI]  line  is  L'(CI)  = (3.1 +/- 0.4)x10^10 K km/s pc^2,
          which  implies  a  neutral  carbon  mass, M(CI) = (4.4+/-0.6)/m
          x10^7  M_sun,  where m is the lensing magnification factor. The
          [CI] line luminosity is consistent with the large molecular gas
          mass  inferred  from  the  nuclear CO line luminosity ~10^11 /m
          M_sun.  We  also  present  an  upper  limit  on  the  H2O  line
          luminosity  in  APM  08279+5255  of, L'(H2O) < 1.8x10^10 K km/s

          Using  data  from  the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey and HST/ACS
          imaging  in  the  Extended  Groth  Strip,  we select nearly 100
          interacting  galaxy systems including kinematic close pairs and
          morphologically-identified  merging  galaxies.  Spitzer MIPS 24
          micron  fluxes  of these systems reflect the current dusty star
          formation  activity,  and  at  fixed  stellar  mass (M_{*}) the
          median  infrared luminosity (L_{IR}) among merging galaxies and
          close  pairs  of  blue  galaxies is twice (1.9 +/- 0.4) that of
          control  pairs  drawn  from isolated blue galaxies. Enhancement
          declines with galaxy separation, being strongest in close pairs
          and  mergers  and  weaker in wide pairs compared to the control
          sample.  At  z  ~  0.9,  7.1  +/-  4.3 % of massive interacting
          galaxies  (M_{*} > 2*10^{10} M_{solar}) are found to be ULIRGs,
          compared  to  2.6  +/-  0.7  % in the control sample. The large
          spread of IR luminosity to stellar mass ratio among interacting
          galaxies  suggests  that  this  enhancement  may  depend on the
          merger  stage  as  well  as  other  as yet unidentified factors
          (e.g.,  galaxy  structure, mass ratio, orbital characteristics,
          presence  of  AGN  or  bar).  The  contribution  of interacting
          systems  to  the total IR luminosity density is moderate (<= 36
          %).

          This  letter  reports  rich  X-ray  jet structures found in the
          Chandra  observation  of  PKS 1055+201. In addition to an X-ray
          jet  coincident  with  the  radio  jet  we  detect  a region of
          extended  X-ray  emission  surrounding  the jet as far from the
          core  as the radio hotspot to the North, and a similar extended
          X-ray  region  along the presumed path of the unseen counterjet
          to  the  Southern radio lobe. Both X-ray regions show a similar
          curvature  to  the  west,  relative to the quasar. We interpret
          this  as the first example where we separately detect the X-ray
          emission  from  a  narrow jet and extended, residual jet plasma
          over the entire length of a powerful FRII jet.

          Comments: 18 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJ
          From  examination  of  only  4  deg^2  of  sky in the NOAO Deep
          Wide-Field  Survey (NDWFS) region, we have identified the first
          radio-loud   quasar  at  a  redshift  z>6.  The  object,  FIRST
          J1427385+331241,  was  discovered  by  matching  the  FLAMEX IR
          survey  to  FIRST survey radio sources with NDWFS counterparts.
          One  candidate  z>6 quasar was found, and spectroscopy with the
          Keck  II  telescope  confirmed  its  identification, yielding a
          redshift  z=6.12.  The  object is a Broad Absorption Line (BAL)
          quasar  with  an  optical  luminosity  of  M_B  ~  -26.9  and a
          radio-to-optical  flux ratio ~ 60. Two MgII absorptions systems
          are  present  at  redshifts  of  z=2.18  and z=2.20. We briefly
          discuss   the   implications   of   this   discovery   for  the
          high-redshift quasar population.

          We  present  deep  Hubble  Space  Telescope Advanced Camera for
          Surveys  / High Resolution Channel U, narrow-V, and I images of
          nine  "ultracompact"  blue dwarf galaxies (UCBDs) selected from
          the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey. We define UCBDs as local (z <
          0.01)  star-forming  galaxies having angular diameters < 6" and
          physical sizes < 1 kpc. They are also among the most metal-poor
          galaxies  known, and are found to reside within voids. Both the
          HST  images  and  the objects' optical spectra reveal that they
          are  composites  of  young  (~1  Myr) populations that dominate
          their  light,  and  older  (~10  Gyr) populations that dominate
          their  stellar  masses,  which  we  estimate to be ~10^7 - 10^8
          Msol.  An intermediate-age population is also indicated in most
          cases.  The  objects  are  not  as dynamically disturbed as the
          prototype  UCBD,  POX 186, but the structure of several of them
          suggests  that  their current starbursts have been triggered by
          the collisions/mergers of smaller clumps of stars. In one case,
          HS  0822+3542,  the  ACS/HRC images resolve the object into two
          small  (~100  pc)  components  which  appear  to  have recently
          collided, supporting this interpretation. In six of the objects
          much  of  their star formation is concentrated in Young Massive
          Star clusters. The evidence that the galaxies consist mainly of
          ~10  Gyr old stars establishes that they are not protogalaxies;
          their low metallicities are more likely to be the result of the
          escape  of supernova ejecta, as opposed to youth. These results
          are  consistent  with recent galaxy formation simulations which
          predict  that  cosmic  re-ionization  at  z  ~  6 significantly
          limited  the  subsequent  star  formation  of dwarf galaxies in
          voids  due  to the photo-evaporation of baryons from their cold
          dark matter halos (Abridged).

          We     present    photoionization    calculations    for    the
          spatially-extended  absorbers  observed  towards  the  extended
          emission  line  spectrum  of  two high-redshift radio galaxies:
          0943-242  (z=2.922)  and  0200+015  (z=2.230),  with the aim of
          reproducing the absorber column ratio, N(CIV)/N(HI). We explore
          the   effects   of   using   different   UV   continua  in  the
          photoionization calculations. A comparison is drawn between the
          absorber  in  0200+015 and the two absorbers in the lensed Lynx
          Arc  Nebula  at  z=3.36,  which  present  similar  N(CIV)/N(HI)
          ratios.  We find that hot stars from a powerful starburst, or a
          metagalactic background radiation (MBR) in which stars dominate
          over  quasars, are equally successful in producing the observed
          N(CIV)/N(HI),  assuming  subsolar absorber metallicities. These
          softer SEDs eliminate the factor 1000 difference in metallicity
          between  the two absorbers encountered in earlier work assuming
          a  powerlaw  SED.  The  detected  level  of  continuum  flux in
          0943-242  is  consistent with stellar ionization. If the MBR is
          responsible  for  the  ionization of the radio galaxy absorbing
          shells,  their  radii (if spherical) would be large (> 100 kpc)
          and  their  mass  would  be huge (>1E12 M_Sun), implying that a
          feedback   event  within  the  radiogalaxy  has  expelled  more
          baryonic  material  than left within it. If, as we believe more
          likely,  stellar sources within the radiogalaxy are responsible
          for  the  absorber's  ionization,  smaller radii of ~25 kpc and
          much smaller masses (~1E8-1E10 M_Sun) are inferred. This radius
          is consistent with the observed transition in radio source size
          between  smaller  sources  where strong HI absorption is almost
          ubiquitous,  and the larger sources where it is mostly lacking.
          Finally,  we  outline  additional  absorption  line diagnostics
          which  could further constrain the properties of the haloes and
          their ionization sources.

          Title: PVLAS Experiment: Some Astrophysical Consequences
          Authors: Yu.N. Gnedin, M.Yu. Piotrovich, T.M. Natsvlishvili
          The   birefringent   effects   of   photon-pseudoscalar   boson
          (Goldstone) particle mixing in intergalactic magnetic field are
          calculated  for cosmological objects. We use the recent results
          of  PVLAS  collaboration that reported recently the observation
          of  a  rotation  of the polarization plane of light propagating
          through  a transverse static magnetic field. Such results which
          were  interpretated as arising due to conversion of photon into
          pseudoscalar  with  coupling  strength $g_{a\gamma}\sim 4\times
          10^{-6}  GeV^{-1}$  allows  us  to  estimate  the intergalactic
          magnetic   field  magnitude  as  $\sim  10^{-16}  G$  based  on
          Hatsemekers  et al. observations of extreme-scale alignments of
          quasar  polarization  vectors. We have analyzed some additional

          radiation

          We  consider  the production of positrons in microquasars, i.e.
          X-ray  binary  systems  that  exhibit  jets frequently, but not
          continuously.  We  estimate the production rate of positrons in
          microquasars,  both  by simple energy considerations and in the
          framework  of  various  proposed  models.  We then evaluate the
          collective emissivity of the annihilation radiation produced by
          Galactic  microquasars  and  we find that it might constitute a
          substantial  contribution  to the annihilation flux measured by
          INTEGRAL/SPI. We also discuss the possible spatial distribution
          of   Galactic  microquasars,  on  the  basis  of  the  (scarce)
          available  data  and  the  resulting  morphology  of  the  flux
          received  on  Earth.  Finally,  we consider nearby 'misaligned'
          microquasars,  with jets occasionally hitting the atmosphere of
          the  companion  star;  these  would represent interesting point
          sources,  for  which we determine the annihilation flux and the
          corresponding  light  curve,  as  well  as  the line's spectral
          profile.  We discuss the possibility of detection of such point
          sources by future instruments.

          Title:   The   nature  and  evolution  of  the  highly  ionized
          near-zones in the absorption spectra of z~6 quasars
          Authors:  James  S.  Bolton,  Martin  G. Haehnelt (Institute of
          Astronomy, University of Cambridge)
          Comments: 24 pages, 11 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  use  state-of-the-art  hydrodynamical  simulations combined
          with a 1D radiative transfer code to assess the extent to which
          the highly ionized regions observed close to z~6 quasars, which
          we  refer  to as near-zones, can constrain the ionization state
          of   the  surrounding  IGM.  We  find  the  appearance  in  Lya
          absorption  of  a  quasar HII ionization front expanding into a
          neutral  IGM can be very similar to a classical proximity zone,
          produced  by the enhancement in ionizing flux close to a quasar
          embedded  in  a highly ionized IGM. The observed sizes of these
          highly  ionized  near-zones and their redshift evolution can be
          reproduced  for  a wide range of IGM neutral hydrogen fractions
          for  plausible  values  of  the  luminosity and lifetime of the
          quasars.  The  observed near-zone sizes at the highest observed
          redshifts   are   consistent   with   a  significantly  neutral
          surrounding  IGM.  However,  they are equally consistent with a
          highly ionized surrounding IGM. Stronger constraints on the IGM
          neutral  hydrogen  fraction  can be obtained by considering the
          relative size of the near-zones in the Lya and Lyb regions of a
          quasar   spectrum.  A  large  sample  of  high  quality  quasar
          absorption  spectra  with  accurate determinations of near-zone
          sizes  and  their  redshift  evolution  in both the Lya and Lyb
          regions  should  confirm  or  exclude  the possibility that the
          Universe  is  predominantly  neutral  at  the  highest observed
          redshifts.  The  width  of  the discrete absorption features in
          these  near-zones will contain important additional information
          on the ionization state and the previous thermal history of the
          IGM at these redshifts.

          Title:  Signals  from  the Noise: Image Stacking for Quasars in
          the FIRST Survey
          Authors:  Richard L. White, David J. Helfand, Robert H. Becker,
          Eilat Glikman, Wim deVries
          Comments: 17 pages, 19 figures, to be published in ApJ
          We  present  a  technique  to  explore  the  radio sky into the
          nanoJansky  regime  by employing image stacking using the FIRST
          survey. We first discuss the non-intuitive relationship between
          the  mean and median values of a distribution that is dominated
          by  noise,  followed  by  an analysis of the systematic effects
          present  in  FIRST's  20cm  VLA snapshot images. Image stacking
          allows  us to recover the properties of source populations with
          fluxes  a  factor of 30 or more below the rms noise level. Mean
          estimates   of   radio  flux  density,  luminosity,  etc.,  are
          derivable  for  any  source  class  having arcsecond positional
          accuracy.
          We  use this technique to compute the mean radio properties for
          41,295  quasars  from  the  SDSS  DR3 catalog. There is a tight
          correlation  between  optical  and  radio  luminosity, with the
          radio  luminosity  increasing  as  the  0.72  power  of optical
          luminosity.  This implies declining radio-loudness with optical
          luminosity:  the  most  luminous  objects  (M=-30) have average
          radio-to-optical ratios ten times lower than the least luminous
          objects  (M=-21).  There is also a striking correlation between
          optical  color  and  radio  loudness:  quasars  that are either
          redder  or bluer than the norm are brighter radio sources, with
          objects  0.8 magnitudes redder than the SDSS composite spectrum
          having  radio-loudness ratios that are higher by a factor of 8.
          We   explore   the   longstanding   question   of   whether   a
          radio-loud/radio-quiet  dichotomy  exists  in  quasars, finding
          that   optical   selection   effects   probably   dominate  the
          distribution  function  of  radio loudness, which has at most a
          modest (~20%) inflection between the radio-loud and radio-quiet
          ends  of  the  distribution.  We  also find, surprisingly, that
          broad  absorption  line  quasars  have  higher  mean radio flux
          densities,  with  the  greatest  disparity  arising in the rare
          low-ionization BAL subclass.

          Title: Astrophysical Effects of Scalar Dark Matter Miniclusters
          Authors: Kathryn M. Zurek, Craig J. Hogan, Thomas R. Quinn (UW,
          Physics and Astronomy Departments)
          Comments: 13 pages, 12 figures
          We  model the formation, evolution and astrophysical effects of
          dark  compact  Scalar  Miniclusters  (``ScaMs''). These objects
          arise  when  a  scalar  field, with an axion-like or Higgs-like
          potential,  undergoes a second order phase transition below the
          QCD  scale.  Such  a  scalar field may couple too weakly to the
          standard  model  to  be  detectable  directly  through particle
          interactions,  but  may  still  be  detectable by gravitational
          effects,  such  as  lensing  and  baryon  accretion  by  large,
          gravitationally bound miniclusters. The masses of these objects
          are shown to be constrained by the Ly$\alpha$ power spectrum to
          be  less  than $\sim 10^4 M_\odot$, but they may be as light as
          classical   axion  miniclusters,  of  the  order  of  $10^{-12}
          M_\odot$. We simulate the formation and nonlinear gravitational
          collapse  of  these  objects  around  matter-radiation equality
          using  an  N-body  code,  estimate  their gravitational lensing
          properties,  and  assess the feasibility of studying them using
          current  and  future  lensing  experiments.  Future  MACHO-type
          variability  surveys  of  many  background  sources  can reveal
          either  high-amplification,  strong  lensing events, or measure
          density   profiles   directly   via  weak-lensing  variability,
          depending  on  ScaM parameters and survey depth. However, ScaMs
          are  unlikely  to  be  responsible  for  apparent  MACHO events
          already  detected  in  the  Galactic halo. A simple estimate is
          made  of  parameters  that  would  give rise to early structure
          formation;  in  principle,  early  stellar  collapse  could  be
          triggered by ScaMs as early as recombination, and significantly
          affect cosmic reionization.

          Title: Luminosity and redshift dependent quasar clustering
          Authors:   Cristiano   Porciani   (ETH-Zurich),  Peder  Norberg
          (IfA-Edinburgh)
          Comments: MNRAS in press, 12 pages, 5 figures
          We  present detailed clustering measurements for a flux limited
          sample  of  14,000  quasars extracted from the 2dF QSO Redshift
          Survey  (2QZ)  in the redshift range 0.8<z<2.1. After splitting
          the  sample  into three redshift bins and each of them into six
          luminosity intervals, we estimate the quasar projected auto and
          cross-correlation functions at a given redshift for separations
          3  <  r/(Mpc/h)  < 20. Fitting the data with a biased CDM model
          and  using  a  frequentist  analysis (the F-test), we find that
          models  with  luminosity dependent clustering are statistically
          favoured  at the 95 per cent confidence level for z>1.3. On the
          other  hand,  a number of tests based on information theory and
          Bayesian  statistics show only marginal evidence for luminosity
          dependent  clustering.  Anyway,  the quality of the data is not
          good  enough  to accurately quantify how quasar biasing depends
          on  luminosity.  We  critically  discuss the limitations of our
          dataset  and  show  that a much larger sample is needed to rule
          out  current  models  for  luminosity segregation. Studying the
          evolution  of the clustering amplitude with redshift, we detect
          an increase of the quasar correlation length with lookback time
          at the 99.3 per cent confidence level. Adopting the concordance
          cosmological  model, we discuss the evolution of quasar biasing
          with cosmic epoch and show that quasars are typically hosted by
          dark matter haloes with mass ~10^{13} M_sol.

          Title:  Numerical  simulations  on  the  relative importance of
          starbursts and AGN in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies
          Authors: Kenji Bekki, Yashuhiro Shioya, Matthew Whiting
          Comments:  18  pages,  15  figures  (f1.jpg for color figure of
          figure 1), accepted in MNRAS
          We investigate the relative importance of starbursts and AGN in
          nuclear activities of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs)
          based    on    chemodynamical    simulations    combined   with
          spectrophotometric  synthesis codes. We numerically investigate
          both  the  gas accretion rates (m_acc) onto super massive black
          holes  (SMBHs)  and  the  star formation rates (m_sf) in ULIRGs
          formed  by  gas-rich  galaxy  mergers  and thereby discuss what
          powers  ULIRGs.  Our  principal  results,  which  can be tested
          against observations, are as follows. (1) ULIRGs powered by AGN
          can  be formed by major merging between luminous, gas-rich disk
          galaxies  with  prominent bulges containing SMBHs, owing to the
          efficient  gas  fuelling m_acc > 1 M_sun/yr of the SMBH. AGN in
          these ULIRGs can be surrounded by compact poststarburst stellar
          populations   (e.g.,  A-type  stars).  (2)  ULIRGs  powered  by
          starbursts  with  m_sf  ~ 100 M_sun/yr can be formed by merging
          between  gas-rich  disk  galaxies  with small bulges having the
          bulge-to-disk-ratio  (f_b)  as  small  as 0.1. (3) The relative
          importance  of  starbursts  and  AGN  can  depend  on  physical
          properties  of  merger  progenitor disks, such as f_b, gas mass
          fraction,  and  total  masses. For example, more massive galaxy
          mergers are more likely to become AGN-dominated ULIRGs. (4) For
          most models, major mergers can become ULIRGs, powered either by
          starbursts  or  by AGN, only when the two bulges finally merge.
          Interacting disk galaxies can become ULIRGs with well separated
          two  cores  (>  20kpc)  at  their pericenter when they are very
          massive  and  have small bulges. (5) Irrespective of the choice
          of   model,   interacting/merging  galaxies  show  the  highest
          accretion rates onto the central SMBHs, and the resultant rapid
          growth  of  the SMBHs occur when their star formation rates are
          very high.

          publication in The Astronomical Journal
          We  report  deep  K-band (18-27GHz) observations with the 100-m
          Green  Bank Telescope of HCN(1-0) line emission towards the two
          submillimeter-selected  galaxies (SMGs) SMMJ02399-0136 (z=2.81)
          and  SMMJ16359+6612 (z=2.52). For both sources we have obtained
          spectra   with   channel-to-channel   rms  noise  of  <=0.5mJy,
          resulting  in velocity-integrated line fluxes better than < 0.1
          Jy  km/s,  although  we  do  not  detect  either  source.  Such
          sensitive observations -- aided by gravitational lensing of the
          sources  --  permit  us  to  put  upper  limits of L_HCN(1-0) <
          2x10^10 K km/s pc^2 on the intrinsic HCN(1-0) line luminosities
          of  the  two  SMGs. The far-infrared (FIR) luminosities for all
          three  SMGs  with  sensitive  HCN(1-0) observations to date are
          found  to  be  consistent  with  the  tight  FIR-HCN luminosity
          correlation  observed  in  Galactic molecular clouds, quiescent
          spirals  and  (ultra)  luminous  infrared galaxies in the local
          Universe.   Thus,  the  observed  HCN  luminosities  remain  in
          accordance  with  what  is  expected  from  the  universal star
          formation  efficiency  per  dense molecular gas mass implied by
          the aforementioned correlation, and more sensitive observations
          with  today's  large aperture radio telescopes hold the promise
          of  detecting  HCN(1-0)  emission  in  similar  objects  in the
          distant Universe.

          Authors: Diego F. Torres, Francis Halzen
          Comments: 6 pages, 1 figure
          High  energy $\gamma$-rays have recently been detected from the
          microquasar   LS  I  +61  303  using  the  MAGIC  telescope.  A
          phenomenological  study on the concomitant neutrinos that would
          be  radiated if the $\gamma$-ray emission is hadronic in origin
          is  herein presented. Neutrino oscillations are considered, and
          the  lower limit to the expected number of events in a km-scale
          detector   such   as   ICECUBE   is  computed  under  different
          assumptions  including  orbital  periodicity and modulation. We
          argue that the upper limits already imposed using AMANDA-II and
          the  forthcoming  measurements  by  ICECUBE  may  significantly
          constrain -in an independent and unbiased way- the $\gamma$-ray
          to  neutrino flux ratio, and thus the possibility of a hadronic
          origin  of  the $\gamma$-rays. The viability of hadronic models
          based  on wind-jet interactions in the LS + 61 303 system after
          MAGIC measurements is discussed.

          figures
          We  report the results of a 2-month campaign conducted with the
          Chandra  X-ray  observatory  to monitor the ultraluminous X-ray
          source  (ULX)  NGC  5204  X-1.  This  was  composed  of a 50-ks
          observation,  followed  by ten 5-ks follow-ups spaced initially
          at  ~  3,  then  at ~ 10 day intervals. The ULX flux is seen to
          vary  by factors ~ 5 on timescales of a few days, but no strong
          variability  is  seen on timescales shorter than an hour. There
          is  no  evidence  for  a  periodic signal in the X-ray data. An
          examination  of  the X-ray colour variations over the period of
          the  campaign  shows  the  ULX  emission  consistently  becomes
          spectrally  harder  as  its  flux increases. The X-ray spectrum
          from  the  50-ks  observation  can  be  fitted  by  a number of
          disparate  spectral  models,  all  of  which  describe a smooth
          continuum  with,  unusually for a ULX, a broad emission feature
          evident  at  0.96 keV. The spectral variations, both within the
          50-ks  observation  and  over the course of the whole campaign,
          can  then  be  explained  solely by variations in the continuum
          component.  In  the  context of an optically-thick corona model
          (as  found  in  other  recent  results  for  ULXs) the spectral
          variations can be explained by the heating of the corona as the
          luminosity  of the ULX increases, consistent with the behaviour
          of   at   least   one   Galactic   black  hole  system  in  the
          strongly-Comptonised  very  high state. We find no new evidence
          supporting  the  presence of an intermediate-mass black hole in
          this ULX.

          The chance projection of the disk of Mrk~1456 onto a background
          QSO  is  similar  to  the  case  of  SBS 1543+593/HS 1543+5921.
          Mrk~1456  is  a  luminous, late-type spiral at z ~ 0.05. Though
          the  QSO,  SDSS  J114719.90+522923.2 at z ~ 2, has not yet been
          observed  with  ultraviolet spectroscopy, it shows strong Ca II
          absorption  at  the  redshift  of Mrk 1456 which gives evidence
          that it is a possible Damped Lyman Alpha absorber. Spectroscopy
          of  the  star-forming  nucleus  of  Mrk~1456 allows us to apply
          emission-line  diagnostics  to infer the chemical abundances at
          the  center  of  the  galaxy,  and  to make a prediction of the

          Title: Vlbi Diagnostics of Jet Instabilities in 0836+710
          Authors: M. Perucho, A.P. Lobanov
          Comments:   Proceedings   of   the  First  meeting  of  Spanish
          Radioastronomy. Valencia 09-11 May 2006
          In  this  paper,  we present new VLBA observations of the radio
          jet   in   the  quasar  S5  0836+710  at  8  and  22  GHz.  The
          identification of the ridge lines allow us to interpret the jet
          structure  in  terms  of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Combined
          with  previous  epochs  of VLBA and VSOP data at 1.6 and 5 GHz,
          these  new observations will allow us to study the evolution of
          the  instabilities  in  the jet. We have detected signatures of
          possible  jet  disruption  in  the  jet  due  to  the growth of
          instabilities,  which  points  towards a possible morphological
          classification  of  the  source  as  an  FRI,  contrary to what
          previously thought in terms of luminosity criteria.

          and cosmological consequences
          Authors: A. Mirizzi (Univ. of Bari & INFN, Bari), G.G. Raffelt,
          P.D. Serpico (Max Planck Inst., Munich)
          Comments: (14 pages, 9 eps figures) Contribution to appear in a
          volume of Lecture Notes in Physics (Springer-Verlag) on Axions
          Photon-axion   conversion  induced  by  intergalactic  magnetic
          fields  causes  an apparent dimming of distant sources, notably
          of  cosmic  standard candles such as supernovae of type Ia (SNe
          Ia).   We   review   the   impact  of  this  mechanism  on  the
          luminosity-redshift  relation  of  SNe Ia, on the dispersion of
          quasar  spectra,  and  on  the spectrum of the cosmic microwave
          background.  The  original  idea  of  explaining  the  apparent
          dimming  of  distant  SNe  Ia  without  cosmic  acceleration is
          strongly  constrained  by  these arguments. However, the cosmic
          equation  of state extracted from the SN Ia luminosity-redshift
          relation  remains  sensitive to this mechanism. For example, it
          can mimic phantom energy.

          C.G.Lacey (1) ((1) ICC-Durham)
          Comments: 24 pages, 16 figures, MNRAS submitted
          We  incorporate  a  model  for  black hole growth during galaxy
          mergers  into  the semi-analytical galaxy formation model based
          on  Lambda-CDM  proposed by Baugh et al. (2005). Our black hole
          model  has  one  free  parameter,  which we set by matching the
          observed  zeropoint of the local correlation between black hole
          mass  and  bulge  luminosity.  We  present  predictions for the
          evolution with redshift of the relationships between black hole
          mass  and  bulge  properties.  Our  simulations  reproduce  the
          evolution  of  the  optical  luminosity function of quasars. We
          study the demographics of the black hole population and address
          the  issue  of how black holes acquire their mass. We find that
          the  direct  accretion  of  cold  gas  during  starbursts is an
          important  growth  mechanism  for lower mass black holes and at
          high   redshift.   On   the  other  hand,  the  re-assembly  of
          pre-existing  black  hole  mass  into  larger units via merging
          dominates  the  growth  of  more  massive  black  holes  at low
          redshift.   This   prediction   could   be   tested  by  future
          gravitational   wave   experiments.   As   redshift  decreases,
          progressively   less  massive  black  holes  have  the  highest
          fractional   growth  rates,  in  line  with  recent  claims  of
          "downsizing" in quasar activity.

          We  have  identified  a  metal-strong  (logN(Zn+)  >  13.15  or
          logN(Si+)  >  15.95)  DLA  (MSDLA) population from an automated
          quasar  (QSO)  absorber  search in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
          Data  Release  3 (SDSS-DR3) quasar sample, and find that MSDLAs
          comprise  ~5%  of  the  entire  DLA population with z_abs > 2.2
          found in QSO sightlines with r < 19.5. We have also acquired 27
          Keck  ESI  follow-up  spectra  of  metal-strong  candidates  to
          evaluate   our   automated  technique  and  examine  the  MSDLA
          candidates  at  higher resolution. We demonstrate that the rest
          equivalent  widths  of  strong ZnII 2026 and SiII 1808 lines in
          low-resolution   SDSS   spectra   are   accurate   metal-strong
          indicators  for  higher-resolution  spectra,  and  predict  the
          observed equivalent widths and signal-to-noise ratios needed to
          detect   certain  extremely  weak  lines  with  high-resolution
          instruments.  We investigate how the MSDLAs may affect previous
          studies    concerning   a   dust-obscuration   bias   and   the
          N(HI)-weighted  cosmic  mean  metallicity  <Z(z)>.  Finally, we
          include  a  brief  discussion  of  abundance  ratios in our ESI
          sample  and  find  that  underlying  mostly  Type II supernovae
          enrichment  are differential depletion effects due to dust (and
          in  a few cases quite strong); we present here a handful of new
          Ti  and  Mn  measurements,  both  of which are useful probes of
          depletion   in   DLAs.  Future  papers  will  present  detailed
          examinations    of    particularly   metal-strong   DLAs   from
          high-resolution KeckI/HIRES and VLT/UVES spectra.

          Title:  A  physical  model  for  active  galactic  nuclei  with
          double-peaked broad emission lines
          Authors: Xinwu Cao, Ting-Gui Wang
          Comments: 7 pages, accepted for publication in ApJ
          The  double-peaked  broad emission lines are usually thought to
          be  linked  to  accretion  disks,  however,  the  local viscous
          heating   in   the   line-emitting   disk  portion  is  usually
          insufficient   for   the   observed   double-peaked  broad-line
          luminosity  in  most sources. Our calculations show that only a
          small  fraction (< 2.3 per cent) of the radiation from the RIAF
          in   the   inner  region  of  the  disk  can  photo-ionize  the
          line-emitting  disk  portion,  because  the  solid angle of the
          outer disk portion subtended to the inner region of the RIAF is
          too  small.  We  propose  that  only those AGNs with sufficient
          matter  above  the  disk  (slowly  moving jets or outflows) can
          scatter  enough  photons radiated from the inner disk region to
          the  outer  line-emitting  disk  portion.  Our model predicts a
          power-law r-dependent line emissivity with an index ~2.5, which
          is consistent with \beta~2-3 required by the model fittings for
          double-peaked  line  profiles.  Using  a  sample  of radio-loud
          double-peaked  line  emitters,  we  show  that  the  outer disk
          regions can be efficiently illuminated by the photons scattered
          from   the   electron-positron  jets  with  \gamma_j<2.  It  is
          consistent with the fact that no double-peaked emission line is
          present  in  strong  radio  quasars with relativistic jets. For
          radio-quiet counterparts, slow outflows with Thomson scattering
          depth  ~0.2 can scatter sufficient photons to the line-emitting
          regions.  This  model  can  therefore  solve  the energy budget
          problem for double-peaked line emitters.

          Yun  eds.  PASP  conference series, proceedings of a Meeting in
          Charlottesville, January 2006
          A  significant  population  of  distant sub-millimeter-selected
          galaxies  (SMGs)  with  powerful  dust  continuum emission that
          matches  the  luminosity of the brightest QSOs and exceeds that
          of most extreme local galaxies detected by IRAS, has been known
          for  almost  a  decade.  The full range of powerful ground- and
          space-based  facilities have been used to investigate them, and
          a  good  deal  of  information  about their properties has been
          gathered.  This meeting addresses some of the key questions for
          better   understanding   their   properties.   While  continuum
          detection   is  relatively  efficient,  a  spectrum  is  always
          required  both to determine a distance/luminosity, and to probe
          astrophysics:  excitation  conditions, the total mass, the mass
          distribution   and  degree  of  dynamical  relaxation.  Once  a
          redshift  is  known,  then  the  associated stellar mass can be
          found, and more specialized spectrographs can be used to search
          for  specific  line  diagnostics. The first generation of submm
          surveys,  have  yielded  a  combined  sample of several hundred
          SMGs.  Here  we  discuss  the  size and follow-up of future SMG
          samples  that  will  be  compiled  in  much  larger  numbers by
          JCMT-SCUBA2,   Herschel,   Planck,  LMT,  ALMA,  and  a  future
          large-aperture     (25-m-class)     submm/far-IR     wide-field
          ground-based  telescope  CCAT,  planned to operate at a Chilean
          site  even  better  than  ALMA's. The issues concerning placing
          SMGs in the context of their environments and other populations
          of high-redshift galaxies are discussed.

          We present the clustering of DEEP2 galaxies at 0.7<z<1.4 around
          quasars  identified  using  both the SDSS and DEEP2 surveys. We
          measure  the  two-point  cross-correlation  of  a  sample of 36
          optically-selected,  spectroscopically-identified  quasars from
          the  SDSS  and  16 more found in the DEEP2 survey with the full
          DEEP2  galaxy  sample  over  scales  0.1  < r_p < 10 Mpc/h. The
          clustering   amplitude   is   found   to   be  similar  to  the
          auto-correlation  function  of  DEEP2 galaxies, with a relative
          bias  of  b=0.89  +/-0.24 between quasars and DEEP2 galaxies at
          z~1.  No  significant  dependence  is  found  on  scale, quasar
          luminosity,  or  redshift  over  the  ranges we probe here. The
          clustering   amplitude  errors  are  smaller  than  those  from
          significantly  larger  quasar  samples,  such  as  the  2dF QSO
          Redshift  Survey.  This  results  from the statistical power of
          cross-correlation  techniques,  which  exploit  the  fact  that
          galaxies  are  much more numerous than quasars. We also measure
          the     local     environments    of    quasars    using    the
          3rd-nearest-neighbor   surface  density  of  surrounding  DEEP2
          galaxies.   Quasars  are  found  in  regions  of  similar  mean
          overdensity  as blue DEEP2 galaxies; they differ in environment
          from  the  red DEEP2 galaxy population at 2 sigma significance.
          Our  results  imply  that quasars do not reside in particularly
          massive  dark matter halos at these redshifts, with a mean dark
          matter  halo  mass  of  M_200  ~  3  10^12  solar  masses  in a
          concordance LCDM cosmology.

          We  present results from our Very Large Telescope large program
          to   study  the  dynamical  evolution  of  local  Ultraluminous
          Infrared  Galaxies  (ULIRGs) and QSOs. This paper is the second
          in  a  series  presenting  the stellar kinematics of 54 ULIRGs,
          derived   from   high   resolution,  long-slit  H-  and  K-band
          spectroscopy.  The  data presented here, including observations
          of  17  new  targets,  are  mainly focused on sources that have
          coalesced  into  a  single  nucleus.  The  stellar  kinematics,
          extracted  from the CO ro-vibrational bandheads in our spectra,
          indicate  that  ULIRG  remnants  are dynamically heated systems
          with  a  mean  dispersion  of  161  km/s.  The  combination  of
          kinematic,   structural,  and  photometric  properties  of  the
          remnants indicate that they mostly originate from major mergers
          and  that  they result in the formation of systems supported by
          random motions, therefore, elliptical galaxies. The peak of the
          velocity dispersion distribution and the locus of ULIRGs on the
          fundamental  plane of early-type galaxies indicate that the end
          products  of  ultraluminous mergers are typically moderate-mass
          ellipticals  (of stellar mass ~10^10 - 10^11 M_sun). Converting
          the  host  dispersion  into black hole mass with the aid of the
          M_BH-sigma  relation  yields  black  hole mass estimates of the
          order 10^7 - 10^8 M_sun and high accretion rates with Eddington
          efficiencies often >0.5.

          We  present 426 epochs of optical monitoring data spanning 1000
          days  from  December  2003 to June 2006 for the gravitationally
          lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112. The time delay between the A and
          B  images is 38.4+/-2.0 days in the expected sense that B leads
          A  and  the  overall  time  ordering is C-B-A-D-E. The measured
          delay  invalidates  all  published  models.  The  models failed
          because  they  neglected  the perturbations from cluster member
          galaxies.  Models including the galaxies can fit the data well,
          but  strong  conclusions  about  the  cluster mass distribution
          should   await   the   measurement  of  the  longer,  and  less
          substructure sensitive, delays of the C and D images. For these
          images,  a  CB delay of 681+/-15 days is plausible but requires
          confirmation,  while  CB  and  AD delays of >560 days and > 800
          days  are  required.  We clearly detect microlensing of the A/B
          images,  with  the  delay-corrected  flux  ratios changing from
          B-A=0.44+/-0.01  mag  in the first season to 0.29+/-0.01 mag in
          the second season and 0.32+/-0.01 mag in the third season.

          Recently,  we  have  presented  the first large-scale radiative
          transfer  simulations  of  reionization.  Here  we  present new
          simulations which extend the source halo mass range downward to
          10^8M_solar,  to  capture the full range of halo masses thought
          to  be  primarily  responsible  for  reionization by their star
          formation  following  atomic  hydrogen  radiative  cooling  and
          gravitational   collapse.   Haloes   below  about  10^9M_solar,
          however,  are  subject  to  Jeans-mass filtering in the ionized
          regions,  which  suppresses  their  baryonic  content and their
          ability  to  release  ionizing  radiation.  By  including these
          smaller-mass  haloes but accounting for their suppression, too,
          we  find  that reionization is ``self-regulating,'' as follows.
          As the mean ionized fraction rises, so does the fraction of the
          volume  within  which  suppression occurs. Hence, the degree of
          suppression  is  related  to  the  mean ionized fraction. Since
          low-mass  haloes  with  high  emissivity  achieve  a given mean
          ionized  fraction  earlier  than  do those with low efficiency,
          Jeans-mass  filtering  compensates  for  the  difference in the
          emissivity  of the suppressible haloes in these two cases. As a
          result,   in   the   presence   of  lower-mass  source  haloes,
          reionization   begins   earlier,   but   the  later  stages  of
          reionization  and  the  time  of  overlap  are  dictated by the
          efficiency  of  the  higher-mass  haloes,  independent  of  the
          efficiency of the suppressible, lower-mass haloes. Reionization
          histories consistent with current observational constraints are
          shown  to be achievable with standard stellar sources in haloes
          above  10^8M_solar.  Neither  minihalos  nor exotic sources are
          required,   and   the  phenomenon  of  ``double  reionization''
          previously suggested does not occur. (abridged)

          We  present  evidence  of a large angle correlation between the
          cosmic  microwave  background measured by WMAP and a catalog of
          photometrically  detected  quasars  from the SDSS. The observed
          cross  correlation is (0.30 +- 0.14) microK at zero lag, with a
          shape  consistent  with  that expected for correlations arising
          from   the   integrated  Sachs-Wolfe  effect.  The  photometric
          redshifts  of  the quasars are centered at z ~ 1.5, making this
          the  deepest  survey  in  which  such  a  correlation  has been
          observed.  Assuming  this correlation is due to the ISW effect,
          this  constitutes the earliest evidence yet for dark energy and
          it can be used to constrain exotic dark energy models.

          We   report   the   results   of   a  systematic  near-infrared
          spectroscopic  survey using the Subaru, VLT and Keck Telescopes
          of  a  sample of high redshift Ultra-luminous Infrared Galaxies
          (ULIRGs)  mainly  composed  of submillimeter-selected galaxies.
          Our  observations  span  the restframe optical range containing
          nebular emission lines such as H_beta, [OIII], and [OII], which
          are  essential  for  making  robust diagnostics of the physical
          properties  of  these ULIRGs. Using the H_alpha/H_beta emission
          line  ratios, we derive internal extinction estimates for these
          galaxies   similar   to  those  of  local  ULIRGs:A_v~2.9+-0.5.
          Correcting the H_alpha estimates of the star formation rate for
          dust  extinction  using  the Balmer decrement, results in rates
          which are consistent with those estimated from the far-infrared
          luminosity.  The  majority  (>60%)  of our sample show spectral
          features  characteristic  of  AGN,  with  ~65% exhibiting broad
          Balmer  emission  lines.  A  proportion  of  these sources show
          relatively  low [OIII]/H_beta line ratios, which are similar to
          those  of  Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies suggesting small mass
          black  holes which are rapidly growing. In the subsample of our
          survey  with both [OIII] and hard X-ray coverage, at least ~60%
          show  an  excess of [OIII] emission, by a factor of 5-10 times,
          relative   to   the  hard  X-ray  luminosity  compared  to  the
          correlation  between  these two properties seen in Seyferts and
          QSOs  locally.  From  our spectral diagnostics, we propose that
          the strong [OIII] emission in these galaxies arises from shocks
          in  dense  gaseous  regions  in  this  vigorously  star-forming
          population.

          We   examine   the   relation  between  galaxy  properties  and
          environment  in  the SDSS DR2, quantifying environment in terms
          of  the  mass  of  the  host halo, which is obtained with a new
          iterative  group  finder.  We  find  that galaxy type fractions
          scale strongly and smoothly with halo mass, but, at fixed mass,
          not  with  luminosity.  We  compare  these  findings  with  the
          semi-analytical galaxy formation model of Croton et al. (2006).
          The   discrepancies   we   find   can   be  explained  with  an
          oversimplified  implementation of strangulation, the neglect of
          tidal  stripping,  and  shortcomings  in the treatments of dust
          extinction and/or AGN feedback.

          The  nonextensivity  in a non-isothermal plasma system with the
          Coulombian  long-range interactions is studied in the framework
          of Tsallis statistics. We present for first time a mathematical
          expression  of  the  nonextensive  parameter  q  based  on  the
          mathematical  theory  about  the generalized Boltzmann equation
          and the q-H theorem and the Maxwellian q-velocity distribution.
          We  obtain  a  new  physical  explanation  for q concerning the
          nature  of non-isothermal configurations in plasma systems with
          Coulombian   long-range   interactions.  We  also  provide  one
          illustration  for Almeida theorem (Physica A 300(2001)424) from
          the  kinetic  analyses  of  plasma  systems,  which  means that
          Tsallis  statistics  might  be  a  suitable  statistics for the

          The  properties of the nonextensive parameter q and the Tsallis
          distribution   for  self-gravitating  systems  are  studied.  A
          mathematical   expression   of   q  is  deduced  based  on  the
          generalized   Boltzmann  equation,  the  q-H  theorem  and  the
          generalized Maxwellian q-velocity distribution in the framework
          of  Tsallis  statistics. We obtain a clear understanding of the
          physics   of   q  different  from  unity  with  regard  to  the
          temperature  gradient  and  the  gravitational potential of the
          self-gravitating  systems.  It  is  suggested  that the Tsallis
          statistics  could  be  statistics  suitable  for describing the
          nonequilibrium  systems  with inhomogeneous temperature and the
          long-range interactions.

          To check the validity of the theory of nonextensive statistical
          mechanics,  we have investigated the nonextensive degree of the
          solar interior and have tried to find the experimental evidence
          by  helioseismological  measurements  that  q is different from
          unity.  We are able to derive a parameter for providing a lower
          limit  to  the  nonextensive  degree inside the sun that can be
          uniquely  determined  by  the  solar  sound  speeds measured by
          helioseismology.  After  calculating the parameter by using the
          solar sound speeds, we get the lower limit of(1-q)not less than
          0.1902  for  all  solar radii between 0.15R(sun) and 0.95R(sun)
          and   (1-q)approximately  equal  to  0.4  for  the  out  layers
          extending  from  0.75R(sun)to  0.95R(sun).Thus, the result that
          the  nonextensive  parameter  q is significantly different from
          unity  has  received the support by the experiment measurements
          for the solar sound speeds in the helioseismology.

          Title:  Nonextensive  power law distributions and the q-kinetic
          theory   for   the  systems  with  self-gravitating  long-range
          interactions
          Authors: Du Jiulin
          Comments: 20 pages,40 references
          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          On  the  basis of q-kinetic theory based on Tsallis entropy, we
          propose  an  approach  to  derive  the  nonextensive  power law
          distributions  for  the many-body systems with self-gravitating
          long-range    interactions.    The   nonextensive   power   law
          distribution  is shown to represent the long-range interactions
          and  the  non-local  correlations  within  the self-gravitating
          system  with  inhomogeneous velocity dispersion when being at a
          nonequilibrium   stationary   state.   An   expression  of  the
          corresponding  nonextensive  parameter q is uniquely determined
          from  the  microscopic  dynamical  equation  and  the  physical
          interpretation  of q different from unity is clearly presented.
          We establish a relation between the nonextensive parameter q to
          deviate  from unity and the measurable quantities: the velocity
          dispersion   gradient   and  the  mass  density.  We  derive  a
          second-order  nonlinear  differential  equation  for the radial
          density  dependence  of  the system with inhomogeneous velocity
          dispersion  and correctly connect with the density profiles for
          dark  matter.  We also study the cases for the self-gravitating
          collisionless and gaseous dynamical system, respectively.

          An  evolutionary  model of star formation in ULIRGs was created
          using  existing  star  formation  and  radiative transfer codes
          (STARBURST99,  RADMC  and  RADICAL)  as  building  blocks.  The
          results  of  the simulations are compared to data from two IRAS
          catalogs.  From  the  simulations  it  is  found  that the dust
          surrounding   the   starburst   region  is  made  up  from  two
          components.  There  is  a  low  optical  depth  (tau=0.1, which
          corresponds  to  0.1%  of  the  total  dust mass), hot (T~400K)
          non-grey component close to the starburst (scale size 10pc) and
          a  large  scale, colder grey component (100pc, 75K) with a much
          larger   column   (tau=10).  The  simulations  also  show  that
          starburst  galaxies  can  be powered by massive star formation.
          The  parameters  for  this star forming region are difficult to
          determine,  since the IR continuum luminosity is only sensitive
          to the total UV input. Therefore, there is a degeneracy between
          the  total  starburst  mass and the initial mass function (IMF)
          slope.  A less massive star formation with a shallower IMF will
          produce  the  same  amount  of  OB stars and therefore the same
          amount  of  irradiating  UV flux. Assuming the stars are formed
          according  to  a  Salpeter  IMF  (Psi(M)  ~  M^-2.35), the star
          formation  region  should produce 10^9 Msun of stars (either in
          one  instantaneous  burst, or in a continuous process) in order
          to produce enough IR radiation.

          Title:   A   Linear   Perturbation   Theory   of  Inhomogeneous
          Reionization
          Authors: Jun Zhang, Lam Hui, Zoltan Haiman
          Comments: 15 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We   develop   an  analytic  approach  to  study  inhomogeneous
          reionization  on  large  scales  by  solving  the  equations of
          ionization  balance  and  radiative  transfer to first order in
          perturbations.  Given  the spatial distribution and spectrum of
          the  ionizing sources, our formalism can be used to predict the
          large  scale power spectra of fluctuations in the abundances of
          HII,   HI   and   radiation.   Our   approach   avoids   common
          approximations/assumptions  in existing analytic methods -- for
          instance,  we do not assume a specific ionization topology from
          the   outset;  nor  do  we  make  a  step-function  bubble-like
          approximation  to  the HII distribution. Applying our formalism
          to    sources   biased   according   to   the   Press-Schechter
          prescription,   we   find:   1.  reionization  always  proceeds
          ``inside--out'',  with  dense  regions  more highly ionized, at
          least on large scales; 2. on sufficiently large scales, HII, HI
          and  radiation  exhibits  a  scale independent bias relative to
          dark  matter; 3. the bias is suppressed on scales comparable to
          or  smaller than the mean free path of the ionizing photons; 4.
          if  the  ionizing source spectrum is sufficiently soft, the HII
          bias   closely   tracks   the  source  bias  for  most  of  the
          reionization process but drops precipitously after percolation;
          5.  if  the  ionizing source spectrum is sufficiently hard, the
          HII  bias  drops  in  a  more  steady  fashion  throughout  the
          reionization  process.  The tools developed here will be useful
          for  interpreting  future  21  cm,  CMB  and Lyman-alpha forest
          observations, both to learn about the reionization astrophysics
          (such  as the hardness of the source spectrum and therefore the
          nature  of  the  ionizing  sources)  and  to  possibly  extract
          interesting cosmological information.

          We  present new measurements of the luminosity function (LF) of
          Luminous  Red Galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
          (SDSS)  and the 2dF-SDSS LRG and Quasar (2SLAQ) survey. We have
          carefully quantified, and corrected for, uncertainties in the K
          and   evolutionary   corrections,  differences  in  the  colour
          selection  methods, and the effects of photometric errors, thus
          ensuring  we  are  studying  the same galaxy population in both
          surveys.  Using  a  limited  subset  of  6326  SDSS  LRGs (with
          0.17<z<0.24)  and  1725 2SLAQ LRGs (with 0.5 <z<0.6), for which
          the  matching  colour  selection  is  most reliable, we find no
          evidence  for any additional evolution in the LRG LF, over this
          redshift  range,  beyond  that  expected  from a simple passive
          evolution   model.   This   lack  of  additional  evolution  is
          quantified  using  the  comoving luminosity density of SDSS and
          2SLAQ  LRGs,  brighter  than  M_r  -  5logh  = -22.5, which are
          2.51+/-0.03  x 10^-7 L_sun Mpc^-3 and 2.44+/-0.15 x 10^-7 L_sun
          Mpc^-3  respectively  (<10% uncertainty). We compare our LFs to
          the  COMBO-17  data  and find excellent agreement over the same
          redshift  range.  Together,  these surveys show no evidence for
          additional  evolution  (beyond  passive)  in  the  LF  of  LRGs
          brighter  than M_r - 5logh = -21 (or brighter than L*). We test
          our  SDSS  and  2SLAQ LFs against a simple ``dry merger'' model
          for  the  evolution  of  massive  red galaxies and find that at
          least  half  of  the  LRGs  at  z=0.2  must  already  have been
          well-assembled  (with  more  than  half  their stellar mass) by
          z=0.6. This limit is barely consistent with recent results from
          semi-analytical models of galaxy evolution.

          We  describe  the  construction  of  MegaZ-LRG,  a  photometric
          redshift  catalogue  of  over one million luminous red galaxies
          (LRGs)  in  the  redshift  range  0.4  <  z < 0.7 with limiting
          magnitude  i  <  20. The catalogue is selected from the imaging
          data  of  the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  Data Release 4. The
          2dF-SDSS   LRG   and   Quasar  (2SLAQ)  spectroscopic  redshift

          photometric  redshift  training  set,  allowing  use of ANNz, a
          neural  network-based  photometric-redshift  estimator. The rms
          photometric  redshift  accuracy  obtained for an evaluation set
          selected from the 2SLAQ sample is sigma_z = 0.049 averaged over
          all galaxies, and sigma_z = 0.040 for a brighter subsample (i <
          19.0). The catalogue is expected to contain ~5 per cent stellar
          contamination.  The  ANNz  code  is  used  to compute a refined
          star/galaxy   probability  based  on  a  range  of  photometric
          parameters;  this  allows  the  contamination  fraction  to  be
          reduced to 2 per cent with negligible loss of genuine galaxies.

          Evidence Against Reionization at z~6

          Comments: 45 pages, 16 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  examine  the  evolution  of  the IGM Ly-alpha optical depth
          distribution    using    the   transmitted   flux   probability
          distribution  function  (PDF)  in  a sample of 63 QSOs spanning
          absorption  redshifts  1.7  < z < 5.8. The data are compared to
          two   theoretical   optical   depth   distributions:   a  model
          distribution    based    on   the   density   distribution   of
          Miralda-Escude   et   al.   (2000)  (MHR00),  and  a  lognormal
          distribution.   We  assume  a  uniform  UV  background  and  an
          isothermal  IGM  for  the  MHR00  model,  as  has  been done in
          previous  works.  Under  these  assumptions,  the  MHR00  model
          produces poor fits to the observed flux PDFs at redshifts where
          the  optical  depth  distribution is well sampled, unless large
          continuum  corrections  are  applied.  However,  the  lognormal
          optical  depth distribution fits the data at all redshifts with
          only   minor   continuum   adjustments.   We   use   a   simple
          parametrization  for  the evolution of the lognormal parameters
          to calculate the expected mean transmitted flux at z > 5.4. The
          lognormal  optical  depth  distribution  predicts  the observed
          Ly-alpha  and Ly-beta effective optical depths at z > 5.7 while
          simultaneously  fitting  the  mean transmitted flux down to z =
          1.6.  If  the  evolution of the lognormal distribution at z < 5
          reflects  a  slowly-evolving density field, temperature, and UV
          background,  then  no  sudden change in the IGM at z ~ 6 due to
          late reionization appears necessary. We have used the lognormal
          optical  depth  distribution  without  any assumption about the
          underlying  density field. If the MHR00 density distribution is
          correct,   then   a   non-uniform   UV  background  and/or  IGM
          temperature may be required to produce the correct flux PDF. We
          find  that  an  inverse  temperature-density  relation  greatly
          improves the PDF fits, but with a large scatter in the equation
          of state index. [Abridged]

          Title:  The Maximum B-mode Polarization of the Cosmic Microwave
          Background from Inhomogeneous Reionization
          Authors: Michael J. Mortonson, Wayne Hu (KICP, UChicago)
          Comments: 14 pages, 11 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  compute  the  B-mode polarization power spectrum of the CMB
          from  an  epoch  of  inhomogeneous reionization, using a simple
          model in which HII regions are represented by ionized spherical
          bubbles   with   a  log  normal  distribution  of  sizes  whose
          clustering  properties are determined by large-scale structure.
          Both  the  global  ionization  fraction  and the characteristic
          radius  of  HII  regions  are  allowed  to be free functions of
          redshift.  Models  that would produce substantial contamination
          to  degree  scale  gravitational  wave B-mode measurements have
          power  that is dominated by the shot noise of the bubbles. Rare
          bubbles  of  >100  Mpc at z>20 can produce signals that in fact
          exceed   the   B-modes   from  gravitational  lensing  and  are
          comparable to the maximal allowed signal of gravitational waves
          (~0.1uK)  while  still being consistent with global constraints
          on  the  total  optical  depth.  Even bubbles down to 20 Mpc at
          z~15,  or  40  Mpc  at  z~10  can be relevant (0.01uK) once the
          lensing  signal  is  removed  either statistically or directly.
          However,   currently   favored  theoretical  models  that  have
          ionization bubbles that only grow to such sizes at the very end
          of  a fairly prompt and late reionization produce signals which
          are at most at these levels.

          X-ray  and optical observations of quadruply lensed quasars can
          provide  a  micro-arcsecond probe of the lensed quasar. In this
          paper  we  utilize  X-ray  observations  of  ten lensed quasars
          recorded   with  the  Chandra  X-ray  Observatory  as  well  as
          corresponding  optical data obtained by either the Hubble Space
          Telescope   or   ground-based  optical  telescopes.  These  are
          analyzed  in  a systematic and uniform way with emphasis on the
          flux-ratio anomalies that are found relative to the predictions
          of smooth lens models. A comparison of the flux ratio anomalies
          between  the X-ray and optical bands allows us to conclude that
          the  optical  emission  regions  of the lensed quasars are much
          larger  than  expected  from  basic  disk models (by factors of
          ~10-100).

          Title: Star-forming QSO host galaxies
          Authors: P.D. Barthel
          Comments: Accepted for publication by Astronomy & Astrophysics
          The  recent finding of substantial masses of cold molecular gas
          as  well  as  young stellar populations in the host galaxies of
          quasars  is  at  odds  with  results  of Hubble Space Telescope
          imaging  studies,  since  the  latter  appear  to yield mature,
          quiescent  early  type  hosts. It is demonstrated here that the
          characterization   as   `quiescent'  is  incorrect.  Radio  and
          far-infrared  properties  of  both  the HST sample and a larger
          comparison  sample  of  uv-excess selected radio-quiet QSOs are
          consistent with substantial recent star-formation activity.

          Title: The role of microquasars in astroparticle physics
          Authors: Sylvain Chaty (AIME)
          Comments:  Invited  review  at Frontier Objects in Astrophysics
          and Particle Physics, Vulcano (Italy) 22nd - 27th May, 2006, 12
          pages, 4 figures
          Journal-ref:  Frontier  Objects  in  Astrophysics  and Particle
          Physics, Italie (2006)
          I  present  an overview of past, present and future research on
          microquasars and jets, showing that microquasars, i.e. galactic
          jet  sources,  are  among the best laboratories for high energy
          phenomena   and  astroparticle  physics.  After  reminding  the
          analogy  with  quasars,  I focus on one of the best microquasar
          representatives,  probably  the archetype, namely GRS 1915+105,
          and present accretion and ejection phenomena, showing that only
          a  multi-wavelength  approach  allows a better understanding of
          phenomena occurring in these sources. Thereafter, I review jets
          at  different  scales:  compact jets, large-scale jets, and the
          interactions  between  ejection  and  the surrounding medium. I
          finish  this  review  by  showing  that  microquasars  are good
          candidates  to  be emitters of astroparticles: very high energy
          photons, cosmic rays and neutrinos.

          We  present  Spitzer observations of thirteen z~6 quasars using
          the   Infrared   Array  Camera  (IRAC)  and  Multiband  Imaging
          Photometer  for  Spitzer  (MIPS).  All  the quasars except SDSS
          J000552.34-000655.8  (SDSS  J0005-0006) were detected with high
          S/N  in  the  four  IRAC channels and the MIPS 24um band, while
          SDSS J0005-0006 was marginally detected in the IRAC 8.0um band,
          and  not  detected  in the MIPS 24um band. We find that most of
          these   quasars  have  prominent  emission  from  hot  dust  as
          evidenced  by  the  observed 24um fluxes. Their spectral energy
          distributions  (SEDs)  are  similar  to  those  of low-redshift
          quasars  at  rest-frame  0.15-3.5 um, suggesting that accretion
          disks  and  hot-dust  structures for these sources already have
          reached  maturity.  However, SDSS J0005-0006 has an unusual SED
          that  lies  significantly  below  low-redshift SED templates at
          rest-frame  1 and 3.5 um, and thus shows a strong near-IR (NIR)
          deficit and no hot-dust emission. Type I quasars with extremely
          small  NIR-to-optical  flux ratios like SDSS J0005-0006 are not
          found  in  low-redshift  quasar  samples,  indicating that SDSS
          J0005-0006  has  different dust properties at high redshift. We
          combine   the  Spitzer  observations  with  X-ray,  UV/optical,
          mm/submm   and   radio  observations  to  determine  bolometric
          luminosities for all the quasars. We find that the four quasars
          with central black-hole mass measurements have Eddington ratios
          of order unity.

          Comments: 5 Pages, including 2 PostScript figures. Accepted for
          publication in MNRAS letters
          We   have  used  the  Very  Large  Telescope  (VLT)  to  obtain
          spectropolarimetry   of   the  radio-loud,  double-lobed  broad
          absorption  line  (BAL)  quasar  PKS 0040-005. We find that the
          optical continuum of PKS 0040-005 is intrinsically polarized at
          0.7%  with an electric vector position angle nearly parallel to
          that  of  the  large-scale radio axis. This result is naturally
          explained in terms of an equatorial scattering region seen at a
          small  inclination, building a strong case that the BAL outflow
          is  not  equatorial.  In  conjunction with other recent results
          concerning   radio-loud   BAL   quasars,   the  era  of  simply
          characterizing these sources as ``edge-on'' is over.

          Simulation:  Public  release of a VO-oriented and SQL-queryable
          database   for  studying  the  evolution  of  galaxies  in  the
          LambdaCDM cosmogony
          Authors: G. Lemson, the Virgo Consortium
          The  Millennium  Run is the largest simulation of the formation
          of  structure  within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony so far carried
          out.  It  uses  $10^{10}$  particles  to follow the dark matter
          distribution  in  a  cubic region 500$h^{-1}$Mpc on a side, and
          has  a  spatial  resolution  of  5  $h^{-1}$kpc. Application of
          simplified  modelling  techniques  to the stored output of this
          calculation  allows  the  formation  and evolution of the $\sim
          10^7$ galaxies more luminous than the Small Magellanic Cloud to
          be  simulated  for  a variety of assumptions about the detailed
          physics  involved.  As  part  of  the  activities of the German
          Astrophysical  Virtual  Observatory  we  have used a relational
          database  to  store the detailed assembly histories both of all
          the haloes and subhaloes resolved by the simulation, and of all
          the   galaxies  that  form  within  these  structures  for  two
          independent  models  of  the  galaxy formation physics. We have
          created  web  applications  that  allow  users  to  query these
          databases remotely using the standard Structured Query Language
          (SQL).  This  allows  easy  access  to  all  properties  of the
          galaxies  and  halos,  as  well  as to the spatial and temporal
          relations  between  them  and their environment. Information is
          output   in  table  format  compatible  with  standard  Virtual
          Observatory  tools and protocols. With this announcement we are
          making   these   structures  fully  accessible  to  all  users.
          Interested  scientists can learn SQL, gain familiarity with the
          database  design and test queries on a small, openly accessible
          version  of  the  Millennium Run (with volume 1/512 that of the
          full simulation). They can then request accounts to run similar
          queries on the databases for the full simulations.

          Title:  A Comparison of Ultraluminous X-ray Sources in NGC 1399
          and the Antennae Galaxies (NGC 4038/4039)
          Authors: Hua Feng, Philip Kaaret (Univ. of Iowa)
          Comments: 10 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          The  temporal  and  spectral  properties of ultraluminous X-ray
          sources  (ULXs,  L>2x10^39  ergs/s)  and  bright  X-ray sources
          (L>3x10^38  ergs/s)  are examined and compared in two extremely
          different host environments: the old elliptical galaxy NGC 1399
          and  the  young, starforming Antennae galaxies (NGC 4038/4039).
          ULXs  in  NGC  1399  show  little variability on either long or
          short time scales. Only 1 of 8 ULXs and 10 of 63 bright sources
          in  NGC 1399 are variable at a confidence level of 90%. On long
          timescales,  the  NGC  1399  sources  are  steadier  than  most
          Galactic   black  hole  X-ray  binaries,  but  similar  to  GRS
          1915+105.  The  outburst  duration  of  the NGC 1399 sources is
          about  20  yrs,  again,  similar  to  that of GRS 1915+105. The
          bright  X-ray  sources  in  NGC  1399  may  be black hole X-ray
          binaries  with  giant  star companions similar to GRS 1915+105.
          The  brightest  ULX  (PSX-1)  in  NGC 1399 is coincident with a
          globular  cluster,  shows  a  hard spectrum with a photon index
          around 1.5, and has a nearly constant luminosity around 5x10^39
          erg/s.  It  may  be an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in a
          hard  spectral  state. In contrast to NGC 1399, the ULXs in the
          Antennae  are  all  variable and a large fraction of the bright
          sources  (9  of  15)  are  also  variable.  The variability and
          luminosity  of ULXs in the Antennae suggest they are black hole
          high  mass  X-ray binaries accreting via Roche-lobe overflow. A
          flare  with  a  duration  of  about 5 ks is found from Antennae
          X-42.  The  most  luminous ULX, X-16, with a very hard spectrum
          (Gamma=1.0~1.3)  and  a  luminosity which varies by a factor of
          10, could be an IMBH candidate.

          the High-Redshift Universe
          Authors:  Steven  Furlanetto  (Yale),  S. Peng Oh (UCSB), Frank
          Briggs (RSAA and ATNF)
          Comments:  extended  review  accepted  by  Physics Reports, 207
          pages,  44  figures  (some  low  resolution); version with high
          resolution figures available at this http URL
          Observations  of  the  high-redshift  Universe  with  the 21 cm
          hyperfine  line of neutral hydrogen promise to open an entirely
          new window onto the early phases of cosmic structure formation.
          Here we review the physics of the 21 cm transition, focusing on
          processes relevant at high redshifts, and describe the insights
          to  be  gained  from such observations. These include measuring
          the  matter  power spectrum at z~50, observing the formation of
          the  cosmic web and the first luminous sources, and mapping the
          reionization   of   the  intergalactic  medium.  The  epoch  of
          reionization  is  of  particular  interest,  because  large HII
          regions  will  seed  substantial  fluctuations  in  the  21  cm
          background.   We   also  discuss  the  experimental  challenges
          involved  in  detecting  this  signal,  with an emphasis on the
          Galactic  and extragalactic foregrounds. These increase rapidly
          toward  low  frequencies  and  are  especially  severe  for the
          highest redshift applications. Assuming that these difficulties
          can  be  overcome,  the redshifted 21 cm line will offer unique
          insight  into  the  high-redshift Universe, complementing other
          probes but providing the only direct, three-dimensional view of
          structure formation from z~200 to z~6.

          In  this  paper  are  presented  the  results  of  Monte  Carlo

          telescope   to   detect   TeV   muon  neutrinos  from  Galactic

          of  detectable  events,  together with the atmospheric neutrino
          and  muon  background  events.  We  also  discuss  the detector
          sensitivity    to   neutrino   fluxes   expected   from   known
          microquasars, optimizing the event selection also to reject the
          background;  the number of events surviving the event selection
          are given.

          Sources X-1 and X-2 in NGC 1313
          Authors: Hua Feng, Philip Kaaret (Univ. of Iowa)
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJL on May 26th
          X-ray  spectral  state transitions are a key signature of black
          hole  X-ray  binaries  and  follow  a  well-defined pattern. We
          examined 12 XMM-Newton observations of the nearby spiral galaxy
          NGC 1313, which harbors two compact ultraluminous X-ray sources
          (ULXs),  X-1  and  X-2,  in  order  to  determine  if the state
          transitions  in ULXs follow the same pattern. For both sources,
          the  spectra  were  adequately  fitted by an absorbed power-law
          with  the  addition  of a low temperature (kT=0.1~0.3 keV) disk
          blackbody  component  required  in 6 of the 12 observations. As
          the  X-ray  luminosity of X-1 increases to a maximum at 3x10^40
          ergs/s,  the  power-law  photon  index softens to 2.5-3.0. This
          behavior is similar to the canonical spectral state transitions
          in  Galactic  black  hole binaries, but the source never enters
          the  high/soft or thermal dominant state and instead enters the
          steep  power-law  state  at  high  luminosities.  X-2  has  the
          opposite  behavior  and appears to be in the hard state, with a
          photon  index  of  Gamma=1.7-2.0  at  high  luminosity, but can
          soften to Gamma=2.5 at the lower luminosities.

          Cosmology
          Authors: Jose L. Prieto, Oleg Y. Gnedin
          Comments:  16  pages,  submitted  to  ApJ, cluster catalogs are
          available online at this http URL
          We  test  the hypothesis that metal-poor globular clusters form
          within  disk  galaxies  at redshifts z>3. Numerical simulations
          demonstrate  that  giant  gas  clouds, which are cold and dense
          enough  to produce massive star clusters, assemble naturally in
          hierarchical  models  of  galaxy formation at high redshift. Do
          model  clusters  evolve  into observed globular clusters or are
          they  disrupted  before  present  as  a result of the dynamical
          evolution? To address this question, we calculate the orbits of
          model  clusters in the time-variable gravitational potential of
          a  Milky  Way-sized galaxy, using the outputs of a cosmological
          N-body  simulation.  We  find  that  at  present the orbits are
          isotropic  in the inner 50 kpc of the Galaxy and preferentially
          radial at larger distances. All clusters located outside 10 kpc
          from the center formed in satellite galaxies, some of which are
          now  tidally  disrupted  and  some  of  which  survive as dwarf
          galaxies.   The  spatial  distribution  of  model  clusters  is
          spheroidal  and  the fit to the density profile has a power-law
          slope  of  2.7.  The  combination of two-body relaxation, tidal
          shocks,  and  stellar  evolution  drives  the  evolution of the
          cluster  mass  function  from  an initial power law to a peaked
          distribution,  in agreement with observations. However, not all
          initial   conditions   and  not  all  evolution  scenarios  are
          consistent  with  the  observed  mass  function of the Galactic
          globular  clusters.  The  successful models require the average
          cluster  density  to  be constant initially for clusters of all
          mass and to remain constant with time. Synchronous formation of
          all  clusters  at a single epoch (z=4) and continuous formation
          over  a  span  of  1.6  Gyr  (between  z=9  and  z=3)  are both
          consistent  with  the  data.  For  both formation scenarios, we
          provide  online  catalogs  of  the  main physical properties of
          model clusters.

          Washington, DC, May 22-24, 2006
          Space-based  instruments provide new and, in some cases, unique
          opportunities to search for dark matter. In particular, if dark
          matter  comprises  sterile  neutrinos,  the  x ray detection of
          their  decay  line  is  by  far the most promising strategy for
          discovery. Sterile neutrinos with masses in the keV range could
          solve   several   long-standing   astrophysical  puzzles,  from
          supernova  asymmetries  and the pulsar kicks to star formation,
          reionization,  and  baryogenesis.  The  best  current limits on
          sterile  neutrinos  come  from  Chandra  and XMM-Newton. Future
          advances   can   be   achieved  with  a  high-resolution  x-ray
          spectrometry in space.

          Authors:  Alan  Stockton  (IfA,  U.  Hawaii), Elizabeth McGrath

          Comments: 25 pages, 13 figures, accepted to ApJ
          We  present an investigation of the properties and environments
          of  bright  extremely red objects (EROs) found in the fields of
          the  quasars  TXS 0145+386 and 4C 15.55, both at z ~ 1.4. There
          is  marginal evidence from Chandra ACIS imaging for hot cluster
          gas  with a luminosity of a few 10^44 ergs/s in the field of 4C
          15.55.  The  TXS 0145+386 field has an upper limit at a similar
          value,  but  it  also  clearly  shows  an  overdensity of faint
          galaxies.  None  of the EROs are detected as X-ray sources. For
          two  of  the  EROs  that have spectral-energy distributions and
          rest-frame  near-UV  spectra  that  show that they are strongly
          dominated    by   old   stellar   populations,   we   determine
          radial-surface-brightness profiles from adaptive-optics images.
          Both  of  these  galaxies  are  best  fit  by profiles close to
          exponentials,  plus  a  compact  nucleus comprising ~30% of the
          total  light  in  one case and 8% in the other. Neither is well
          fit  by  an  r^1/4-law  profile. This apparent evidence for the
          formation of massive ~2 X 10^11 disks of old stars in the early
          universe   indicates   that   at  least  some  galaxies  formed
          essentially  monolithically,  with  high  star-formation  rates
          sustained  over  a few 10^8 years, and without the aid of major
          mergers.

          Title:  Probing  isotopic  ratios  at  z = 0.89: molecular line
          absorption in front of the quasar PKS 1830-211
          Authors: Sebastien Muller, Michel Guelin, Michael Dumke, Robert
          Lucas, Francoise Combes
          Comments: accepted in A&A
          With  the  Plateau de Bure interferometer, we have measured the
          C,  N, O and S isotopic abundance ratios in the arm of a spiral
          galaxy  with  a  redshift  of  0.89. The galaxy is seen face-on
          according to HST images. Its bulge intercepts the line of sight
          to  the  radio-loud  quasar  PKS  1830-211,  giving  rise at mm
          wavelengths to two Einstein images located each behind a spiral
          arm.  The  arms  appear  in  absorption in the lines of several
          molecules,   giving  the  opportunity  to  study  the  chemical
          composition of a galaxy only a few Gyr old. The isotopic ratios
          in  this  spiral  galaxy differ markedly from those observed in
          the  Milky  Way.  The  $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O  and $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N
          ratios are low, as one would expect from an object too young to
          let low mass stars play a major role in the regeneration of the
          gas.

          Quasar Absorption Systems

          We  compare  a  new R = 120,000 spectrum of PG1634+706 (z_QSO =
          1.337,m_V = 14.9) obtained with the HDS instrument on Subaru to
          a  R = 45, 000 spectrum obtained previously with HIRES/Keck. In
          the  strong  MgII  system at z = 0.9902 and the multiple cloud,
          weak  MgII  system  at  z  = 1.0414, we find that at the higher
          resolution,  additional  components  are  resolved in a blended
          profile. We find that two single-cloud weak MgII absorbers were
          already  resolved  at  R  = 45,000, to have b = 2 - 4 km/s. The
          narrowest  line that we measure in the R = 120, 000 spectrum is
          a   component   of  the  Galactic  NaI  absorption,  with  b  =
          0.90+/-0.20  km/s.  We discuss expectations of similarly narrow
          lines  in  various applications, including studies of DLAs, the
          MgI  phases of strong MgII absorbers, and high velocity clouds.
          By  applying  Voigt  profile  fitting  to  synthetic  lines, we
          compare  the consistency with which line profile parameters can
          be  accurately  recovered  at  R  =  45,000 and R = 120,000. We
          estimate  the  improvement  gained from superhigh resolution in
          resolving  narrowly separated velocity components in absorption
          profiles.  We also explore the influence of isotope line shifts
          and   hyperfine  splitting  in  measurements  of  line  profile
          parameters,  and  the  spectral  resolution  needed to identify
          these  effects. Super high resolution spectra of quasars, which
          will be routinely possible with 20-meter class telescopes, will
          lead to greater sensitivity for absorption line surveys, and to
          determination  of  more  accurate  physical conditions for cold
          phases of gas in various environments.

          Title:   Accretion-Ejection   Instability,   MHD   Rossby  Wave
          Instability,  diskoseismology,  and  the  high-frequency QPO of
          microquasars
          Authors: Michel Tagger, Peggy Varniere
          Comments: To be published in Ap.J
          We  present  a  possible  explanation  for  the  high-frequency
          Quasi-Periodic   Oscillations   of   microquasars   by  an  MHD
          instability  that  combines the physics developed, in different
          contexts,   for   the   Accretion-Ejection   Instability,   the
          Rossby-Wave  Instability,  and the normal modes of diskoseismic
          models  (which  rely  on  the  properties  of  the relativistic
          rotation curve in the vicinity of the Marginally Stable Orbit).
          This  instability  can appear as modes of azimuthal wavenumbers
          m=2,  3,...  that  have  very  similar pattern speeds \omega/m,
          while  the  m=1  mode, which would appear as the fundamental of
          this  discrete  spectrum,  is less unstable. This would readily
          explain the 2:3 (and sometimes higher) frequency ratio observed
          between  these  QPO.  These  instabilites form eigenmodes, i.e.
          standing  wave  patterns  at  a constant frequency in the disk;
          they  are  strongly  unstable, and thus do not need an external
          excitation  mechanism  to  reach  high amplitudes. Furthermore,
          they  have the property that a fraction of the accretion energy
          can be emitted toward the corona: this would explain that these
          QPO  are  seen  in  a spectral state where Comptonized emission
          from  the  corona  is  always  present. Their existence depends
          critically  on the existence of a magnetic structure, formed by
          poloidal flux advected in the accretion process, in the central
          region between the disk and the black hole.

          Observations  of  low  mean  metallicity  of damped Lyman-alpha
          (DLA)  quasar  absorbers  at  all  redshifts  studied appear to
          contradict  the  predictions  for  the global mean interstellar
          metallicity  in galaxies from cosmic chemical evolution models,
          unless  selection effects are invoked. We investigate what role
          in  cosmic metal evolution is played by another important class
          of  quasar  absorbers, i.e. the sub-DLAs. We find that the mean
          Zn  metallicity of the observed sub-DLAs may evolve faster than
          that  of  the observed DLAs and reach a near-solar level at low
          redshift.  We  also  estimate  the  sub-DLA contribution to the
          total  metal  budget  using  measures  of their metallicity and
          comoving  gas  density.  These calculations suggest that at z ~
          2.5,  the sub-DLAs contribute 25 %, and possibly higher, of the
          DLA  contribution  to  the  total metal budget. Furthermore, we
          find  that at z <~ 1, the contribution of sub-DLAs to the total
          metal budget may be several times that of DLAs.

          Comments: 7 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We apply the stellar population synthesis code by Cid Fernandes
          et  al.  to  model the stellar contribution for a sample of 209
          type II AGNs at $0.3<z<0.83$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
          The  reliable  stellar  velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{*}$) are
          obtained   for   33  type  II  AGNs  with  significant  stellar
          absorption   features.  According  to  the  $L_{\rm  [O  III]}$
          criterion  of  $3\times  10^{8}  \Lsolar$,  20  of which can be
          classified  as  type II quasars. We use the formula of Greene &
          Ho   to  obtain  the  corrected  stellar  velocity  dispersions
          ($\sigma_{*}^c$).  We  also  calculate  the  supermassive black
          holes masses from $\sigma_{*}^c$ in these high-redshift type II
          AGNs.  The [O III] luminosity is correlated with the black hole
          mass  (although no correlation between the extinction-corrected
          [O III] luminosity and the black hole mass), and no correlation
          is found between the Eddington ratio and the [O III] luminosity
          or   the   corrected   [O   III]   luminosity.  Three  sets  of
          two-component   profile  are  used  to  fit  multiple  emission
          transitions   ([O   III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,   5007   and   [O
          II]$\lambda\lambda$3727,   3729)   in  these  33  stellar-light
          subtracted spectra. We also measure the gas velocity dispersion
          ($\sigma_{g}$)  from  these multiple transitions, and find that
          the  relation  between  $\sigma_{g}$ and $\sigma_{*}^c$ becomes
          much  weaker at higher redshifts than in smaller redshifts. The
          distribution  of  $<\sigma_{g}/\sigma_{*}^c>$  is $1.24\pm0.76$
          for  the  core  [O  III]  line and $1.20\pm0.96$ for the [O II]
          line,  which suggests that $\sigma_{g}$ of the core [O III] and
          [O  II]  lines can trace $\sigma_{*}^c$ within about 0.1 dex in
          the  logarithm  of $\sigma_{*}^c$. For the secondary driver, we
          find  that the deviation of $\sigma_{g}$ from $\sigma_{*}^c$ is
          correlated with the Eddington ratio.

          We  use  a series of cosmological N-body simulations for a flat
          LCDM  cosmology  to  investigate  the properties of dark matter
          haloes  in  the  mass range 3.0e9-3.0e13 Msun. These properties
          include  the  concentration  parameter  (c), the spin parameter
          (lambda)    and    the   mean   axis   ratio   (q).   For   the
          concentration-mass  relation  we  find c~M^(-0.11) in agreement
          with the model proposed by Bullock et al.(2001) even if we find
          a  lower  normalization (15%). The results for lambda and q are
          in good agreement with previous studies, while c and lambda are
          anti-correlated.  In  an attempt to remove unrelaxed haloes, we
          use  the  offset  parameter  (xoff),  defined  as  the distance
          between  the  most  bound  particle  and  the  center  of mass.
          Removing haloes with large xoff increases the c by ~10%, lowers
          the  lambda  by  ~15%,  and removes the most prolate haloes. In
          addition, it largely removes the anti-correlation between c and
          lambda  though not entirely. We also investigate the effects of
          the  large-scale  environment.  We find that low mass haloes in
          overdense regions have slightly higher c and are more spherical
          than  haloes  of  the same mass in underdense regions, although
          both  trends  are  definitely  weak  compared  to  the scatter.
          Finally, using a simple model for disk galaxy formation we show
          that  haloes  that  host  low  surface  brightness galaxies are
          expected  to  be hosted by a biased sub-set of haloes. Not only
          do  these  haloes  have  spin  parameters  that are larger than
          average,  they  also have c that are 15% percent lower than the
          average  at  a  given halo mass. We discuss the implications of
          all  these  findings  for the claimed disagreement between halo
          concentrations  inferred  from  LSB  rotation curves, and those
          expected for a LCDM cosmology. (abridged)

          We  report  on  the  first  census  of INTEGRAL/IBIS detections
          ($\gtrsim  4\sigma$  significance)  above  100 keV based on the
          Core  Program  and  public  Open  time observations up to April
          2005.  There are 49 sources detected in the 100-150 keV band of
          which 14 are also seen in the 150-300 keV range. The low energy
          sample  is  dominated  by  X-ray binary systems of both low and
          high  mass, but also includes 10 active galaxies. Of the binary
          systems  that  are  detected  above  150 keV, more than 50% are
          associated  with  black  hole  candidates,  often  reported  as
          microquasars.  The  present  survey  results  are  then used to
          construct  LogN-LogS  curves  for  galactic  and  extragalactic
          objects  in  the  100-150 keV band: above a 1 mCrab sensitivity
          limit we expect that around 200 galactic sources and almost 350
          active  galaxies  populate  the  sky  above  100 keV. While the
          contribution  of individual point sources to the total Galactic
          emission has been estimated to be around 70-80% between 100-300
          keV,  we  find  that  active  galaxies  detected  above 1 mCrab
          account  for  only about 3% of the cosmic hard X-ray background
          in the 100-150 keV band.

          from a sample of SDSS quasars
          Authors: Vincent Desjacques, Adi Nusser, Ravi K. Sheth
          Comments: 16 pages. submitted to MNRAS
          We  present  a  measurement  of  the  probability  distribution
          function (PDF) of the transmitted flux in the Lya forest from a
          sample  of  3492 quasars included in the SDSS DR3 data release.
          Our intention is to investigate the sensitivity of the Lya flux
          PDF  as  measured  from  low resolution and low signal-to-noise
          data  to a number of systematic errors such as uncertainties in
          the  mean  flux,  continuum  and  noise  estimate.  The  quasar
          continuum  is described by the superposition of a power law and
          emission  lines.  We perform a power law continuum fitting on a
          spectrum-by-spectrum  basis,  and  obtain  an average continuum
          slope  of 0.59 +/- 0.36 in the redshift range 2.5<z<3.5. Taking
          into  account  the variation in the continuum indices increases
          the mean flux by 3 and 7 per cent at z=3 and 2.4, respectively,
          as  compared  to  the  values  inferred  with  a  single (mean)
          continuum  slope.  We  compare  our  measurements  to  the  PDF
          obtained   with   mock  lognormal  spectra,  whose  statistical
          properties have been constrained to match the observed Lya flux
          PDF and power spectrum of high resolution data. Using our power
          law  continuum  fitting  and  the  SDSS pipeline noise estimate
          yields  a  poor  agreement  between the observed and mock PDFs.
          Allowing   for  a  break  in  the  continuum  slope  and,  more
          importantly,  for  residual  scatter  in  the  continuum  level
          substantially  improves  the agreement. A decrease of 10-15 per
          cent  in  the mean quasar continuum with a typical rms variance
          at  the  20  per  cent level can account for the data, provided
          that the noise excess correction is no larger than 10 per cent.

          Arms near NGC3077
          Authors: F. Walter (MPIA), C.L. Martin (UCSB), J. Ott (ATNF)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal
          We  report  the  detection  of  ongoing  star  formation in the
          prominent  tidal  arms  near  NGC  3077  (member  of  the  M 81
          triplet).   In   total,  36  faint  compact  HII  regions  were
          identified,  covering  an  area  of ~4x6 kpc^2. Most of the HII
          regions  are  found  at HI column densities above 1x10^21 cm^-2
          (on  scales  of  200  pc),  well  within the range of threshold
          columns   measured  in  normal  galaxies.  The  HII  luminosity
          function  resembles  the  ones derived for other low-mass dwarf
          galaxies  in  the  same group; we derive a total star formation
          rate  of  2.6x10^-3  M_sun/yr  in  the  tidal  feature. We also
          present  new  high-resolution  imaging  of  the  molecular  gas
          distribution  in  the  tidal arm using CO observations obtained
          with the OVRO interferometer. We recover about one sixth of the
          CO  flux  (or M_H2~2x10^6 M_sun, assuming a Galactic conversion
          factor)  originally  detected  in  the  IRAM  30m  single  dish
          observations,  indicating  the  presence of a diffuse molecular
          gas  component  in  the tidal arm. The brightest CO peak in the
          interferometer map (comprising half of the detected CO flux) is
          coincident  with  one  of  the  brightest  HII  regions  in the
          feature.  Assuming  a  constant  star  formation rate since the
          creation of the tidal feature (presumably ~3x10^8 years ago), a
          total  mass of ~7x10^5 M_sun has been transformed from gas into
          stars.  Over  this  period, the star formation in the tidal arm
          has resulted in an additional enrichment of Delta(Z)>0.002. The
          reservoir  of  atomic  and  molecular  gas  in the tidal arm is
          ~3x10^8  M_sun,  allowing  star  formation  to  continue at its
          present  rate  for  a  Hubble time. Such wide-spread, low-level
          star  formation would be difficult to image around more distant
          galaxies  but  may be detectable through intervening absorption
          in quasar spectra.

          compact  extragalactic  radio  sources  at  15 GHz was recently
          compiled  to  conduct  the  MOJAVE  program.  The MOJAVE sample
          comprises   133   radio-loud  flat-spectrum  AGN  with  compact
          relativistic  outflows  detected  at  parsec scales. The source
          counts of compact AGN shows that the MOJAVE sample represents a
          flux-limited  complete  sample.  Analysis  of the population of
          flat-spectrum  quasars  of the sample reveals that the pc-scale
          jets  of  quasars  have  intrinsic  luminosities  in  the range
          between  ~10^24  W/Hz  and  ~10^27  W/Hz  and  Lorentz  factors
          distributed  between  3 and 30. We find that the apparent speed
          (or  Lorentz  factor) of jets evolves with redshift, increasing
          from z~0 to z~1 and then falling at higher redshifts (z~2.5) by
          a  factor  of  2.5.  The  evolution of apparent speeds does not
          affect  significantly  the  evolution  of the beamed luminosity
          function  of  quasars,  which is most likely to be dependent on
          the  evolution  of  radio  luminosity.  Furthermore, the beamed
          radio   luminosity   function   suggests   that  the  intrinsic
          luminosity  function of quasars has a double power-law form: it
          is  flat  at  low  luminosities and steep at high luminosities.
          There  is  a  positive  evolution  of  quasars at low redshifts
          (z<0.5)  and  strong  negative evolution at redshifts >1.7 with
          space  density  decline  up  to  z~2.5.  This  implies that the
          powerful  jets  were more populous at redshifts between 0.5 and
          1.7.   We  show  that  the  evolution  of  compact  quasars  is
          luminosity  dependent  and  it depends strongly on the speed of
          the  jet  suggesting that there are two distinct populations of
          quasars  with  slow and fast jets which evolve differently with
          redshift.

          Title:  Gravitational  Dynamics of an Infinite Shuffled Lattice
          of Particles
          Authors: Thierry Baertschiger, Michael Joyce, Andrea Gabrielli,
          Francesco Sylos Labini
          Comments: 21 pages, 16 figures
          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          We  study, using numerical simulations, the dynamical evolution
          of  self-gravitating point particles in static euclidean space,
          starting  from  a simple class of infinite ``shuffled lattice''
          initial    conditions.   These   are   obtained   by   applying
          independently to each particle on an infinite perfect lattice a
          small  random  displacement,  and  are characterized by a power
          spectrum  (structure  factor)  of density fluctuations which is
          quadratic  in  the  wave  number k, at small k. For a specified
          form   of   the   probability   distribution  function  of  the
          ``shuffling''  applied  to  each  particle,  and  zero  initial
          velocities, these initial configurations are characterized by a
          single  relevant  parameter:  the  variance  $\delta^2$  of the
          ``shuffling''  normalized  in  units  of  the  lattice  spacing
          $\ell$.  The  clustering,  which develops in time starting from
          scales  around  $\ell$,  is  qualitatively very similar to that
          seen  in  cosmological  simulations,  which begin from lattices
          with   applied  correlated  displacements  and  incorporate  an
          expanding   spatial   background.  From  very  soon  after  the
          formation of the first non-linear structures, a spatio-temporal
          scaling  relation describes well the evolution of the two-point
          correlations.   At   larger   times   the   dynamics  of  these
          correlations  converges  to  what  is  termed  ``self-similar''
          evolution  in  cosmology,  in  which the time dependence in the
          scaling   relation   is  specified  entirely  by  that  of  the
          linearized  fluid  theory. Comparing simulations with different
          $\delta$,  different  resolution,  but  identical  large  scale
          fluctuations, we are able to identify and study features of the
          dynamics  of  the system in the transient phase leading to this
          behavior.  In  this  phase,  the  discrete nature of the system
          explicitly plays an essential role.

          The  discovery  of  luminous  quasars  at  redshift  $z \sim 6$
          indicates  the  presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of
          mass  $\sim  10^9  \Msun$  when  the Universe was less than one
          billion years old. This finding presents several challenges for
          theoretical  models,  because  whether such massive objects can
          form  so early in the $\Lambda$-cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM)
          cosmology,  the  leading theory for cosmic structure formation,
          is an open question. Furthermore, whether the formation process
          requires  exotic  physics  such  as  super-Eddington  accretion
          remains  undecided.  Here,  we  present  the  first multi-scale
          simulations  that, together with a self-regulated model for the
          SMBH  growth,  produce a luminous quasar at $z \sim 6.5$ in the
          $\Lambda$CDM  paradigm.  We  follow  the  hierarchical assembly
          history of the most massive halo in a $\sim 3 \Gpc^{3}$ volume,
          and find that this halo of $\sim 8\times 10^{12} \Msun$ forming
          at  $z  \sim  6.5$  after  several  major  mergers  is  able to
          reproduce  a  number of observed properties of SDSS J1148+5251,
          the  most distant quasar detected at $z =6.42$ \citep{Fan2003}.
          Moreover,  the  SMBHs  grow  through  gas  accretion  below the
          Eddington  limit  in a self-regulated manner owing to feedback.
          We  find  that  the  progenitors  experience  significant  star
          formation  (up  to  $10^4  \Msun \yr^{-1}$) preceding the major
          quasar  phase  such  that  the  stellar mass of the quasar host
          reaches  $10^{12}  \Msun$  at  $z  \sim  6.5$,  consistent with
          observations   of   significant   metal   enrichment   in  SDSS
          J1148+5251. (Abridged)

          We  investigate  the possibility of constraining the ionization
          state  of  the  Intergalactic  Medium (IGM) close to the end of
          reionization  (z  ~ 6) by measuring the size of the HII regions
          in   high-z  quasars  spectra.  We  perform  a  combination  of
          multiphase  SPH  and  3D radiative transfer (RT) simulations to
          reliably  predict  the  properties of typical high-z quasar HII
          regions, embedded in a partly neutral IGM. From the analysis of
          mock  spectra  along  lines  of sight through the simulated QSO
          environment  we  find  that  the  HII  region size derived from
          quasar  spectra  is  on  average 30 % smaller than the physical
          one.  Additional  maximum  likelihood  analysis shows that this
          offset   induces   an  overestimate  of  the  neutral  hydrogen
          fraction,  x_HI,  by  a  factor  ~  3.  By  applying  the  same
          statistical  method  to  a  sample  of  observed QSOs our study
          favors a mostly ionized (x_HI < 0.06) universe at z=6.1.

          MNRAS
          Spectral  properties  of  super-Eddington  accretion  flows are
          investigated  by means of a parallel line-of-sight calculation.
          The  subjacent  model,  taken  from  two-dimensional  radiation
          hydrodynamic simulations by Ohsuga et al. (2005), consists of a
          disc  accretion  region  and  an  extended atmosphere with high
          velocity  outflows. The non-gray radiative transfer equation is
          solved,  including  relativistic  effects,  by applying the FLD
          approximation.
          The   calculated   spectrum   is   composed   of   a   thermal,
          blackbody-like emission from the disc which depends sensitively
          on  the  inclination  angle,  and  of  high  energy  X-ray  and
          gamma-ray  emission  from  the atmosphere. We find mild beaming
          effects  in the thermal radiation for small inclination angles.
          If  we  compare  the  face-on  case  with the edge-on case, the
          average  photon energy is larger by a factor of ~1.7 due mainly
          to  Doppler boosting, while the photon number density is larger
          by   a   factor  of  ~3.7  due  mainly  to  anisotropic  matter
          distribution  around  the  central  black  hole.  This gives an
          explanation  for  the observed X-ray temperatures of ULXs which
          are   too   high   to   be   explained   in  the  framework  of
          intermediate-mass black holes.
          While  the  main features of the thermal spectral component are
          consistent  with  more  detailed calculations of slim accretion
          discs,  the atmosphere induces major changes in the high-energy
          part,  which  cannot be reproduced by existing models. In order
          to  interpret  observational  data  properly, simple approaches
          like the Eddington-Barbier approximation cannot be applied.

          Authors: Shinta Kasuya, Masahiro Kawasaki
          Comments: 5 pages, 11 figures
          We  study  the reionization histories where ionizing UV photons
          are  emitted  from  decaying  particle,  in  addition  to usual
          contributions  from  stars and quasars, and consistent with the
          fact  that  the  universe  is  not fully ionized until z = 6 as
          observed  by  Sloan  Digital Sky Survey. Likelihood analysis of
          the three-year data of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
          severely   constrains   the   decaying  particle  scenario  due
          especially to polarization data.

          Title:  The  Evolution of Lyman alpha Absorbers in the Redshift
          Range 0.5<z<1.9
          Authors: E. Janknecht, D. Reimers, S. Lopez, D. Tytler
          Comments:  15  pages,  18  figures, accepted for publication in
          Astronomy & Astrophysics
          We  investigate the evolution and the statistical properties of
          the  Lya  absorbers  of  the  intergalactic medium (IGM) in the
          largely   unexplored   redshift   range   z=0.5-1.9.   We   use
          high-resolution  (R  >  30,000) UV (STIS) and optical (VLT/UVES
          and  Keck/HIRES)  spectra  of  nine  bright quasars with z_em <
          1.94.  The  main  results  for the combined Lya line sample are
          summarized  as  follows: 1. The evolution of the number density
          of  the  absorbers  can  be  described by the power law dn/dz ~
          (1+z)^gamma. The number density of the low column density lines
          decreases  with  decreasing  z  with  gamma=0.74+-0.31  in  the
          interval   z=0.7-1.9.  A  comparison  with  results  at  higher
          redshifts shows that it is decelerated in the explored redshift
          range  and turns into a flat evolution for z -> 0. The stronger
          absorbers  thin  out  faster  (gamma=1.50+-0.45).  The break in
          their  evolution predicted for z=1.5-1.7 cannot be seen down to
          z=0.7.  On  the  other  hand, a comparison with values from the
          literature  for the local number density gives a hint that this
          break  occurs  at  lower  redshift.  2. The distribution of the
          column   densities   of  the  absorbers  is  complete  down  to
          N_HI=10^12.90  cm^-2.  It can be approximated by a single power
          law  with the exponent beta=1.60+-0.03 over almost three orders
          of  magnitude.  beta  is redshift independent. 3. The Lya lines
          with  lower  column  densities  as  well  as  the higher column
          density   lines   show  marginal  clustering  with  a  2  sigma
          significance over short distances (Delta v < 200 km/s and Delta
          v  <  100  km/s, respectively). We do not see any difference in
          the clustering with either column density or redshift.

          Title: What aspects of galaxy environment matter?
          Authors: Michael R. Blanton, Andreas A. Berlind, David W. Hogg
          Comments: 23 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  determine  what  aspects  of  the density field surrounding
          galaxies  most  affect  their properties. For Sloan Digital Sky
          Survey  galaxies, we measure the group environment, meaning the
          host  group  luminosity  and the distance from the group center
          (hereafter,  ``groupocentric  distance'').  For  comparison, we
          measure  the  surrounding  density field on scales ranging from
          100  kpc/h  to  10 Mpc/h. We use the relationship between color
          and group environment to test the null hypothesis that only the
          group  environment matters, searching for a residual dependence
          of  properties  on  the  surrounding  density.  Generally,  red
          galaxies  are  slightly  more  clustered on small scales (about
          100--300  kpc/h)  than  the  null hypothesis predicts, possibly
          indicating that substructure within groups has some importance.
          At  large  scales (> 1 Mpc/h), the actual projected correlation
          functions of galaxies are biased at less than the 5% level with
          respect to the null hypothesis predictions. We exclude strongly
          the converse null hypothesis, that only the surrounding density
          (on  any  scale) matters. These results generally encourage the
          use  of the halo model description of galaxy bias, which models
          the  galaxy distribution as a function of host halo mass alone.
          We compare these results to proposed galaxy formation scenarios
          within the Cold Dark Matter cosmological model.

          We  show  that Eddington-limited black hole luminosities can be
          sufficient  to  deplete a galaxy bulge of gas through radiation
          pressure, when the ionization state of the gas and the presence
          of  dust  are properly taken into account. Once feedback starts
          to  be  effective  it can consistently drive all the gas out of
          the whole galaxy. We estimate the amount by which the effect of
          radiation pressure on dusty gas boosts the mass involved in the
          Eddington  limit  and  discuss  the  expected column density at
          which  the gas is ejected. An example is shown of the predicted
          observed nuclear spectrum of the system at the end of an early,
          obscured phase of growth when the remaining column density NH ~
          f * 1e24 cm^-2 where f is the gas fraction in the bulge.

          Title:  Spitzer  IRAC confirmation of z_850-dropout galaxies in
          the Hubble Ultra Deep Field: stellar masses and ages at z~7
          Authors:  Ivo  labbe (1), Rychard Bouwens (2), G.D. Illingworth

          Using   Spitzer   IRAC  mid-infrared  imaging  from  the  Great
          Observatories  Origins  Deep  Survey,  we  study  z_850-dropout
          sources  in  the  Hubble  Ultra  Deep  Field.  After  carefully
          removing contaminating flux from foreground sources, we clearly
          detect  two  z_850-dropouts at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron, while
          two  others  are  marginally  detected. The mid-infrared fluxes
          strongly  support their interpretation as galaxies at z~7, seen
          when  the  Universe was only 750 Myr old. The IRAC observations
          allow us for the first time to constrain the rest-frame optical
          colors,  stellar  masses,  and  ages  of  the  highest redshift
          galaxies.  Fitting  stellar  population  models to the spectral
          energy  distributions,  we  find  photometric  redshifts in the
          range    6.7-7.4,   rest-frame   colors   U-V=0.2-0.4,   V-band
          luminosities  L_V=0.6-3  x  10^10  L_sun, stellar masses 1-10 x
          10^9 M_sun, stellar ages 50-200 Myr, star formation rates up to
          ~25  M_sun/yr,  and  low  reddening  A_V<0.4.  Overall, the z=7
          galaxies  appear  substantially  less  massive and evolved than
          Lyman  break  galaxies  or  Distant  Red Galaxies at z=2-3, but
          fairly  similar  to  recently  identified systems at z=5-6. The
          stellar  mass  density  inferred  from our z=7 sample is rho* =
          1.6^{+1.6}_{-0.8}  x  10^6  M_sun  Mpc^-3  (to  0.3 L*(z=3), in
          apparent   agreement   with  recent  cosmological  hydrodynamic
          simulations,   but  we  note  that  incompleteness  and  sample
          variance  may  introduce  larger uncertainties. The ages of the
          two  most  massive  galaxies suggest they formed at z>8, during
          the  era  of  cosmic  reionization, but the star formation rate
          density  derived  from  their  stellar  masses  and ages is not
          nearly  sufficient  to  reionize  the  universe.  The  simplest
          explanation  for  this  deficiency  is that lower-mass galaxies
          beyond our detection limit reionized the universe.

          Title: The First Stars in the Universe and Cosmic Reionization
          Authors: Rennan Barkana (1) ((1) Tel Aviv University)
          Comments: 8 Latex pages, 3 Figures, Science, Invited Review
          Journal-ref: Science 313 (2006) 931-934
          The  earliest  generation  of  stars,  far  from  being  a mere
          novelty,  transformed  the universe from darkness to light. The
          first atoms to form after the Big Bang filled the universe with
          atomic hydrogen and a few light elements. As gravity pulled gas
          clouds  together,  the  first stars ignited and their radiation
          turned  the  surrounding  atoms  into  ions.  By looking at gas
          between  us  and distant galaxies, we know that this ionization
          eventually  pervaded  all  space,  so  that  few hydrogen atoms
          remain  today between galaxies. Knowing exactly when and how it
          did  so  is  a primary goal of cosmologists, because this would
          tell  us  when  the  early  stars  formed  and in what kinds of
          galaxies.   Although   this   ionization  is  beginning  to  be
          understood   by   using   theoretical   models   and   computer
          simulations, a new generation of telescopes is being built that
          will map atomic hydrogen throughout the universe.

          Multifrequency,   high-resolution  radio  observations  of  the
          quasar  3C254  using  MERLIN  are  presented.  The quasar has a
          highly  asymmetric  radio structure, with the eastern component
          of  the double-lobed structure being much closer to the nucleus
          and significantly less polarized than the western one. However,
          the two lobes are more symmetric in their total flux densities.
          The  observations  show  the detailed structure of the hotspots
          which  are  very different on opposite sides of the radio core,
          reveal  no  radio  jet and suggest that the oppositely-directed
          jets may be intrinsically asymmetric.

          Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ
          We observed the narrow-line quasar SDSS J094857.3+002225, which
          has   the  highest  known  radio  loudness  for  a  narrow-line
          Seyfert~1  galaxy  (NLS1),  at 1.7--15.4 GHz with the Very Long
          Baseline  Array  (VLBA).  This  is the first very-long-baseline
          interferometry  (VLBI)  investigation for a radio-loud NLS1. We
          independently  found very high brightness temperatures from (1)
          its  compactness  in  a VLBA image and (2) flux variation among
          the VLBA observation, our other observations with the VLBA, and
          the  Very  Large  Array  (VLA).  A  Doppler  factor larger than
          2.7--5.5  was required to meet an intrinsic limit of brightness
          temperature  in  the  rest  frame.  This is evidence for highly
          relativistic  nonthermal  jets  in an NLS1. We suggest that the
          Doppler   factor   is   one  of  the  most  crucial  parameters
          determining  the radio loudness of NLS1s. The accretion disk of
          SDSS  J094857.3+002225  is  probably  in  the  very high state,
          rather than the high/soft state, by analogy with X-ray binaries
          with  strong  radio outbursts and superluminal jets such as GRS
          1915+105.

          We present the results of Monte Carlo simulation studies of the
          capability  of  the  proposed NEMO telescope to detect TeV muon
          neutrinos   from   Galactic   microquasars.  In  particular  we
          determined  the number of the detectable events from each known
          microquasar together with the expected atmospheric neutrino and
          muon   background   events.   We   also  discuss  the  detector
          sensitivity  to  neutrino  fluxes  expected  from microquasars,
          optimizing   the   event  selection  in  order  to  reject  the
          atmospheric  background,  and  we  show  the  number  of events
          surviving the event selection.

          X-rays  provide one of the few bands through which we can study
          the epoch of reionization, when the first galaxies, black holes
          and stars were born. To reach the sensitivity required to image
          these  first  discrete  objects  in  the universe needs a major
          advance  in X-ray optics. Generation-X (Gen-X) is currently the
          only  X-ray astronomy mission concept that addresses this goal.
          Gen-X  aims  to  improve  substantially  on the Chandra angular
          resolution  and  to  do  so with substantially larger effective
          area.  These  two  goals can only be met if a mirror technology
          can  be  developed  that yields high angular resolution at much
          lower  mass/unit area than the Chandra optics, matching that of
          Constellation-X  (Con-X).  We describe an approach to this goal
          based  on  active  X-ray  optics that correct the mid-frequency
          departures  from an ideal Wolter optic on-orbit. We concentrate
          on  the  problems  of  sensing  figure  errors, calculating the
          corrections  required, and applying those corrections. The time
          needed  to  make  this  in-flight  calibration is reasonable. A
          laboratory  version  of these optics has already been developed
          by  others  and  is successfully operating at synchrotron light
          sources.  With  only  a moderate investment in these optics the
          goals of Gen-X resolution can be realized.

          Gamma-Ray Bursts", ed. Philip A. Hughes and Joel N. Bregman
          Connections between accretion disks and jets in accreting black
          holes are anticipated theoretically. In recent years, potential
          evidence  for  such connections has been emerging, most vividly
          in  the  convenient regime of stellar-mass black holes. In this
          contribution,   various   lines   of   evidence   for  disk-jet
          connections  are  briefly  examined,  from the standpoint of an
          observer  focused  on the role of the disk. While many lines of
          investigation   may  be  promising  in  the  future,  obtaining
          multi-wavelength  lightcurves  and  correlating jet flux in the
          radio  band  with physical parameters and phenomena tied to the
          accretion disk in X-rays may be the most direct.

          Title:  Time  delay  observations  of  the  lensed quasars SDSS
          J1004+4112  and  HE0435-1223:  are  they  consistent  with  the
          2dFGRS/WMAP1 primordial density fluctuation?
          Authors: Richard Lieu
          Comments: ApJL submitted
          A  test was performed to find out if time delay observations of
          the  multiple images of two strongly lensed quasars reflect the
          theoretical  expectation  based  upon the 2dFGRS/WMAP1 spectrum
          $P(k)$  of primordial density perturbation. Our estimate of the
          expected  time  delay  anisotropy  is  expressed  as  a  simple
          analytical  formula, which when applied to the (observationally
          non-verifiable)  scenario  of  the  CMB  resulted  in a typical
          amplitude  on par with the calculation of Hu and Cooray (2001).
          Our prediction is in substantial disagreement with the temporal
          (light  curve)  alignment  of  the  two  quasars,  in  that the
          observed   delay   is   $\sim$  350  times,  or  five  standard
          deviations,  smaller. The probability of this discrepancy being
          a   chance   coincidence  is  completely  negligible.  Previous
          investigators  only  considered the relatively minor effect, on
          the  light  arrival  times,  of the lensing mass itself. If the
          additional disturbance on the light paths by non-linear density
          growths, viz. the galaxies and clusters, are also included with
          the  prediction,  the  gulf  between  the  standard  model  and
          observations will further widen.

          We  discuss  color  selection  of rare objects in a wide-field,
          multiband survey spanning from the optical to the mid-infrared.
          Simple  color  criteria simultaneously identify and distinguish
          two of the most sought after astrophysical sources: the coolest
          brown   dwarfs   and  the  most  distant  quasars.  We  present
          spectroscopically-confirmed  examples  of each class identified
          in the IRAC Shallow Survey of the Bootes field of the NOAO Deep
          Wide-Field  Survey.  ISS J142950.9+333012 is a T4.5 brown dwarf
          at  a distance of approximately 42 pc, and ISS J142738.5+331242
          is  a  radio-loud  quasar  at  redshift  z=6.12.  Our selection
          criteria  identify  a  total  of  four candidates over 8 square
          degrees  of the Bootes field. The other two candidates are both
          confirmed  5.5<z<6  quasars, previously reported by Cool et al.
          (2006).  We  discuss  the implications of these discoveries and
          conclude  that there are excellent prospects for extending such
          searches to cooler brown dwarfs and higher redshift quasars.

          Comments: 27 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We report measurements of time delays of up to 8 minutes in the
          centimeter  wavelength  variability  patterns of the intra-hour
          scintillating  quasar  PKS 1257-326 as observed between the VLA
          and  the  ATCA  on  three  separate  epochs.  These time delays
          confirm interstellar scintillation as the mechanism responsible
          for  the rapid variability, at the same time effectively ruling
          out the coexistence of intrinsic intra-hour variability in this
          source.  The  time delays are combined with measurements of the
          annual  variation  in  variability  timescale exhibited by this
          source   to  determine  the  characteristic  length  scale  and
          anisotropy  of the quasar's intensity scintillation pattern, as
          well  as  attempting  to  fit  for  the  bulk  velocity  of the
          scattering  plasma  responsible  for the scintillation. We find
          evidence   for  anisotropic  scattering  and  highly  elongated
          scintillation  patterns  at both 4.9 and 8.5 GHz, with an axial
          ratio > 10:1, extended in a northwest direction on the sky. The
          characteristic  scale  of  the  scintillation pattern along its
          minor axis is well determined, but the high anisotropy leads to
          degenerate   solutions  for  the  scintillation  velocity.  The
          decorrelation  of  the  pattern  over  the  baseline  gives  an
          estimate  of  the  major axis length scale of the scintillation
          pattern.  We  derive  an  upper  limit  on  the distance to the
          scattering plasma of no more than 10 pc.

          Nuclei: analogies with X-ray binaries
          Authors:   Elmar   Koerding   (Southampton),  Sebastian  Jester
          (Southampton), Rob Fender (Southampton)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Hardness-intensity  diagrams  (HIDs)  have been used with great
          success  to  study the accretion states and their connection to
          radio  jets  in X-ray binaries (XRBs). The analogy between XRBs
          and active galactic nuclei (AGN) suggests that similar diagrams
          may help to understand and identify accretion states in AGN and
          their    connection    to    radio   loudness.   We   construct
          ``disc-fraction    luminosity    diagrams''    (DFLDs)   as   a
          generalization  of  HIDs,  which plot the intensity against the
          fraction  of  the  disc  contribution  in  the overall spectral
          energy distribution (SED). Using a sample of 4963 Sloan Digital
          Sky   Survey   (SDSS)  quasars  with  ROSAT  matches,  we  show
          empirically  that  an  AGN  is  more  likely  to  have  a  high
          radio:optical flux ratio when it has a high total luminosity or
          a  large  non-thermal contribution to the SED. We find that one
          has to consider at least two-dimensional diagrams to understand
          the  radio  loudness  of  AGN.  To  extend  our  DFLD  to lower
          luminosities  we  also  include a sample of low-luminosity AGN.
          Using  a  simulated population of XRBs we show that stellar and
          supermassive  BHs populate similar regions in the DFLD and show
          similar  radio/jet  properties.  This supports the idea the AGN
          and  XRBs  have  the  same  accretion states and associated jet
          properties.

          Title: Variation of fundamental constants
          Authors: V.V. Flambaum
          Comments:  Brief  review  of recent works, Talk at ICAP 2006, 5
          pages
          Subj-class: Atomic Physics
          We present a review of recent works devoted to the variation of
          the  fine  structure  constant  alpha,  strong  interaction and
          fundamental  masses.  There are some hints for the variation in
          quasar  absorption  spectra, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and Oklo
          natural nuclear reactor data. A very promising method to search
          for  the  variation  of  the  fundamental constants consists in
          comparison  of different atomic clocks. Huge enhancement of the
          variation  effects  happens  in transition between accidentally
          degenerate atomic and molecular energy levels. A new idea is to
          build  a  ``nuclear'' clock based on the ultraviolet transition
          between  very  low  excited  state  and ground state in Thorium
          nucleus. This may allow to improve sensitivity to the variation
          up to 10 orders of magnitude!
          Huge  enhancement  of the variation effects is also possible in
          cold atomic and molecular collisions near Feschbach resonance.

          Title: Growth of structure seeded by primordial black holes
          Authors:  Katherine  J.  Mack,  Jeremiah  P.  Ostriker, Massimo
          Ricotti
          Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures. Submitted to ApJ
          We  discuss the possibilities for primordial black holes (PBHs)
          to  grow  via  the  accretion of dark matter. In agreement with
          previous   works,   we   find   that   accretion   during   the
          radiation-dominated  era  does  not  lead to a significant mass
          increase.  However,  during matter-domination, PBHs may grow by
          up  to  two orders of magnitude in mass through the acquisition
          of  large dark matter halos. We discuss the possibility of PBHs
          being  an  important component in dark matter halos of galaxies
          as  well as their potential to explain the ultra-luminous x-ray
          sources  (ULXs) observed in nearby galactic disks. We point out
          that  although  PBHs are ruled out as the dominant component of
          dark  matter,  there  is  still a great deal of parameter space
          open  to  them  playing  a role in the modern-day universe. For
          example, a primordial halo population of PBHs each at $10^{2.5}
          M_\odot$  making  up  0.1% of the dark matter grow to $10^{4.5}
          M_\odot$  via  the accumulation of dark matter halos to account
          for  $\sim  10%$  of  the  dark matter mass by a redshift of $z
          \approx  30$.  These  intermediate  mass  black  holes may then
          ``light  up''  when  passing through molecular clouds, becoming
          visible  as ULXs at the present day, or they may form the seeds
          for supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.

          Authors: James Overduin, Hans-Joachim Blome, Josef Hoell
          Comments:  12  pages, 7 figures, optimized for A4 paper. Partly
          biographical,  partly  historical  review  of subjects to which
          Priester  contributed  (quasars,  nonsingular  cosmology,  dark
          energy).  Preprint version only; published version to appear in
          Naturwissenschaften
          Wolfgang  Priester  was  one  of  Germany's  most versatile and
          quixotic  astrophysicists, re-inventing himself successively as
          a radio astronomer, space physicist and cosmologist, and making
          a  lasting  impact  on  each  field.  We focus in this personal
          account  on  his  contributions  to cosmology, where he will be
          most remembered for his association with quasars, his promotion
          of  the  idea of a nonsingular "big bounce" at the beginning of
          the  current  expansionary  phase,  and  his recognition of the
          importance  of  dark  energy  (Einstein's cosmological constant
          Lambda)  well  before  this  became  the  standard  paradigm in
          cosmology.

          The on-line table is available at this http URL
          We  describe  observations  of  9.7  um silicate features in 97
          AGNs,  exhibiting  a  wide  range  of  AGN  types  and of X-ray
          extinction toward the central nuclei. We find that the strength
          of  the  silicate feature correlates with the HI column density
          estimated from fitting the X-ray data, such that low HI columns
          correspond  to  silicate emission while high columns correspond
          to  silicate  absorption.  The behavior is generally consistent
          with  unification  models  where  the  large  diversity  in AGN
          properties  is caused by viewing-angle-dependent obscuration of
          the  nucleus.  Radio-loud  AGNs  and radio-quiet quasars follow
          roughly  the correlation between HI columns and the strength of
          the silicate feature defined by Seyfert galaxies. The agreement
          among  AGN types suggests a high-level unification with similar
          characteristics for the structure of the obscuring material. We
          demonstrate    the    implications   for   unification   models
          qualitatively  with a conceptual disk model. The model includes
          an  inner  accretion  disk  (< 0.1 pc in radius), a middle disk
          (0.1-10  pc  in radius) with a dense diffuse component and with
          embedded  denser clouds, and an outer clumpy disk (10-300 pc in
          radius).

          Title: A ULX associated with a cloud collision in M99
          Authors:  Roberto  Soria  (CfA  &  MSSL),  Diane Sonya Wong (UC
          Berkeley)
          Comments: 10 pages, accepted by MNRAS
          The  Sc  galaxy  M99  in  the  Virgo  cluster has been strongly
          affected  by  tidal  interactions  and recent close encounters,
          responsible  for  an  asymmetric spiral pattern and a high star
          formation  rate. Our XMM-Newton study shows that the inner disk
          is dominated by hot plasma at kT ~ 0.30 keV, with a total X-ray
          luminosity  ~  10^{41}  erg/s  in  the 0.3--12 keV band. At the
          outskirts  of  the  galaxy,  away  from  the  main star-forming
          regions,  there  is an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) with an
          X-ray  luminosity  ~ 2 x 10^{40} erg/s and a hard spectrum well
          fitted  by a power law of photon index Gamma ~ 1.7. This source
          is close to the location where a massive HI cloud appears to be
          falling  onto  the  M99 disk at a relative speed > 100 km/s. We
          suggest  that  there may be a direct physical link between fast
          cloud collisions and the formation of bright ULXs, which may be
          powered  by  accreting  black  holes  with  masses  ~ 100 Msun.
          External collisions may trigger large-scale dynamical collapses
          of  protoclusters, leading to the formation of very massive (>~
          200  Msun)  stellar  progenitors;  we argue that such stars may
          later   collapse  into  massive  black  holes  if  their  metal
          abundance is sufficiently low.

          Authors:  Ioannis  Contopoulos  Demosthenes Kazanas Dimitris M.
          Christodoulou
          We  reinvestigate  the  generation and accumulation of magnetic
          flux   in   optically   thin   accretion  flows  around  active
          gravitating  objects.  The  source of the magnetic field is the
          azimuthal     electric     current    associated    with    the
          Poynting-Robertson  drag  on  the  electrons  of  the accreting
          plasma.  This current generates magnetic field loops which open
          up  because  of  the differential rotation of the flow. We show
          through  simple  numerical  simulations that what regulates the
          generation and accumulation of magnetic flux near the center is
          the value of the plasma conductivity. Although the conductivity
          is  usually considered to be effectively infinite for the fully
          ionized  plasmas  expected  near  the  inner  edge of accretion
          disks, the turbulence of those plasmas may actually render them
          much   less   conducting  due  to  the  presence  of  anomalous
          resistivity.  We  have  discovered  that  if the resistivity is
          sufficiently  high  throughout  the  turbulent disk while it is
          suppressed   interior   to   its  inner  edge,  an  interesting
          steady-state  process  is  established:  accretion  carries and
          accumulates magnetic flux of one polarity inside the inner edge
          of  the disk, whereas magnetic diffusion releases magnetic flux
          of  the opposite polarity to large distances. In this scenario,
          magnetic flux of one polarity grows and accumulates at a steady
          rate in the region inside the inner edge and up to the point of
          equipartition  when  it becomes dynamically important. We argue
          that    this   inward   growth   and   outward   expulsion   of
          oppositely-directed magnetic fields that we propose may account
          for  the  ~30  min  cyclic variability observed in the galactic
          microquasar GRS1915+105.

          I+61 303: the hadronic contribution revisited

          Comments:  5  pages,  6  figures, submitted to Astrophysics and
          Space Science
          LS  I+61 303 has been detected by the Cherenkov telescope MAGIC
          at  very  high  energies,  presenting a variable flux along the
          orbital  motion  with  a  maximum  clearly  departed  from  the
          periastron  passage.  In  the  light  of  the new observational
          constraints,  we  revisit  the  discussion of the production of
          high-energy  gamma rays from particle interactions in the inner
          jet of this system. The hadronic contribution could represent a
          major  fraction  of the TeV emission detected from this source.
          The   spectral   energy   distribution   resulting   from   p-p
          interactions is recalculated. Opacity effects introduced by the
          photon  fields  of  the  primary star and the stellar decretion
          disk  are  shown  to  be  essential  in shaping the high-energy
          gamma-ray  light  curve  at  energies close to 200 GeV. We also
          present   results   of   Monte   Carlo   simulations   of   the
          electromagnetic cascades developed very close to the periastron
          passage.  We conclude that a hadronic microquasar model for the
          gamma-ray  emission  in  LS  I  +61  303 can reproduce the main
          features of its observed high-energy gamma-ray flux.
