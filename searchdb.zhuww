          Title: The BATSE-Swift luminosity and redshift distributions of
          short-duration GRBs
          Authors: Dafne Guetta, Tsvi Piran
          We  compare  the luminosity function and rate inferred from the
          BATSE  short hard bursts (SHBs) peak flux distribution with the
          redshift  and  luminosity  distributions  of  SHBs  observed by
          Swift/HETE   II.   While   the  Swift/HETE  II  SHB  sample  is
          incompatible   with   SHB  population  that  follows  the  star
          formation rate, it is compatible with a SHB rate that reflect a
          distribution  of  delay  times after the SFR. This would be the
          case  if  SHBs are associated with binary neutron star mergers.
          The  available data allows, however, different interpretations.
          For  example,  a  population  whose  rate is independent of the
          redshift fits the data very well. The implied SHB rates that we
          find range from $\sim 8$ to $\sim
          30h_{70}^3$Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. This is a much higher rate than
          what  was previously estimated. A detailed (2 dimensional) look
          at the best fit models shows, however, some discrepancy between
          the four Swift/HETE II SHBs and the models based on BATSE SHBs.
          This  could  be  a  statistical fluke. It could also arise from
          wrong  estimates  of  the triggering criteria or from selection
          effects.  If  real  it  may  indicate  the existence of two SHB
          populations  with  different  luminosity functions and redshift
          distributions.

          Title:  Low Frequency Radio Observations of Galaxy Clusters Can
          Reveal Global Signatures in the Cosmological 21-cm Background
          Authors: Asantha Cooray
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          While  the  low  frequency spectrum of the radio sky is rich in
          features  associated  with  the  cosmic  21-cm  background from
          neutral  Hydrogen,  a  direct  measurement  of  this  frequency
          spectrum  is  challenging. We propose a technique to indirectly
          establish global signatures in the cosmic 21-cm radiation based
          on  differential  observations  towards  and away from a galaxy
          cluster  such  that  modifications  imposed  by inverse-Compton
          scattering  via  electrons  in galaxy clusters can be detected.
          While  the unscattered spectrum has features with amplitudes up
          to  40  mK in the brightness temperature relative to the cosmic
          microwave background, after scattering, the observable spectrum
          contains  decrements  and increments with amplitudes around 0.2
          to  1  mK  in addition to a uniform few mK decrement associated
          with  the  black-body  CMB. Low frequency radio interferometers
          that  are  now planned for 21-cm anisotropy measurements can be
          easily  utilized  for  the proposed measurement. The signatures
          towards clusters will also confirm the 21-cm signal is produced
          at a redshift higher than the cluster, in addition to providing
          an   easy,   and   a   necessary,  cross-check  on  fluctuation
          measurements.

          Title: Halo Spacetime
          Authors: Mark D. Roberts
          Comments: 8 pages
          Subject to the four assupmtions:
          1)a  galactic  halo  can  be  modeled  by  a static spherically
          symmetric spacetime,
          2)in  the  limit  of  no  rotation  halo spacetime is Minkowski
          spacetime  and  that  the  speed  of  rotation is a permissible
          parameter   to   expand  in,  3)the  constraint  on  the  first
          derivatives  of  the metric needed in order to produce constant
          rotation  curves  can  be applied, 4)the perfect fluid Einstein
          equations;    it    is    shown    that    the    density    is
          $\rho=-2v^2/r^2+O(v^4)$,  where  $v=v_c/c$  is  the velocity of
          rotation  of  the  galaxy.  The  negative  density  is taken to
          indicate  that  one of the above four assumptions is wrong, the
          last  is  the most likely, implying that there is no such thing
          as dark matter.

          Title:  Three-Body  Kick  to  a Bright Quasar out of Its Galaxy
          During a Merger
          Authors: Loren Hoffman, Abraham Loeb (Harvard U.)
          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Nature
          The  quasar HE0450-2958 was recently discovered to reside ~7kpc
          away  from  a  galaxy  that  was  likely  disturbed by a recent
          merger.  The  lack  of  a  massive spheroid of stars around the
          quasar  raised  the unlikely suggestion that it may have formed
          in  a  dark galaxy. Here we explain this discovery as a natural
          consequence  of  a  dynamical kick imparted to the quasar as it
          interacted  with  a  binary  black  hole system during a galaxy
          merger  event.  The  typical stalling radius (~1pc) for a ~10^9
          solar  mass binary provides a kick of order the escape velocity
          of  the stellar spheroid, bringing the quasar out to around the
          observed radius before it turns around. This is consistent with
          the  observed  low relative velocity between the quasar and the
          merger-remnant  galaxy.  The  gas  carried  with the black hole
          throughout  the three-body interaction fuels the quasar for the
          duration of its journey, ~2x10^7 years. Gravitational radiation
          recoil could not have produced the required kick.

          Workshop
          In  order  to  study  the  possibility of acoustic detection of
          ultra-high  energy neutrinos in water, our group is planning to
          deploy  and  operate  an  array  of  acoustic sensors using the
          ANTARES Neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore,
          acoustic  sensor  hardware  has  to  be developed which is both
          capable  of  operation under the hostile conditions of the deep
          sea  and  at  the  same  time  provides  the  high  sensitivity
          necessary  to  detect  the weak pressure signals resulting from
          the  neutrino's  interaction  in  water.  In  this  paper,  two
          different  approaches  to  building  such  sensors,  as well as
          performance   studies  in  the  laboratory  and  in  situ,  are
          presented.

          Title:  First  optical images of circumstellar dust surrounding
          the debris disk candidate HD 32297
          Authors: P. Kalas
          Comments: 5 pages; Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters
          Near-infrared  imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope recently
          revealed  a circumstellar dust disk around the A star HD 32297.
          Dust  scattered  light  is detected as far as 400 AU radius and
          the  linear  morphology  is  consistent with a disk ~10 degrees
          away  from  an  edge-on  orientation. Here we present the first
          optical  images  that  show the dust scattered light morphology
          from  560 to 1680 AU radius. The position angle of the putative
          disk  midplane  diverges  by  31  degrees and the color of dust
          scattering  is  most  likely blue. We associate HD 32297 with a
          wall  of interstellar gas and the enigmatic region south of the
          Taurus molecular cloud. We propose that the extreme asymmetries
          and  blue disk color originate from a collision with a clump of
          interstellar  material as HD 32297 moves southward, and discuss
          evidence consistent with an age of 30 Myr or younger.

          Title:  Possible  evidence  for  the ejection of a supermassive
          black hole from an ongoing merger of galaxies
          Authors:  Martin  G.  Haehnelt  (IoA), Melvyn B. Davies (Lund),
          Martin J. Rees (IoA)
          Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX, no figures; MNRAS in press
          Attempts  of  Magain  et al (2005) to detect the host galaxy of
          the  bright  QSO  HE0450--2958  have  not  been  successful. We
          suggest  that  the supermassive black hole powering the QSO was
          ejected from the observed ULIRG at the same redshift and at 1.5
          arcsec distance. Ejection could have either be caused by recoil
          due  to gravitational wave emission from a coalescing binary of
          supermassive  black  holes  or  the  gravitational slingshot of
          three or more supermassive black holes in the ongoing merger of
          galaxies  which  triggered the starburst activity in the ULIRG.
          We  discuss implications for the possible hierarchical build-up
          of  supermassive  black  holes from intermediate and/or stellar
          mass   black   holes,  and  for  the  detection  of  coalescing
          supermassive binary black holes by LISA.

          Title:  Rotational  Broadening of Atomic Spectral Features from
          Neutron Stars
          Authors: P. Chang, S. Morsink, L. Bildsten, I. Wasserman
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, to appear in ApJ Letters
          The  discovery of the first gravitationally redshifted spectral
          line from a neutron star (NS) by Cottam, Paerels and Mendez has
          triggered  theoretical  studies  of  the physics of atomic line
          formation  in  NS  atmospheres.  Chang,  Bildsten and Wasserman
          showed  that  the hydrogenic Fe H$\alpha$ line formed above the
          photosphere  of  a  bursting  NS is intrinsically broad. We now
          include  rotational  broadening  within  general relativity and
          compare  the  resulting  profile to that observed during Type I
          bursts  from  EXO  0748-676.  We  show  that the fine structure
          splitting  of the line precludes a meaningful constraint on the
          radius.  Our  fitting of the data show that the line forming Fe
          column    is    ${\rm    log}_{10}    (N_{\rm   Fe,   n=2}/{\rm
          cm^{-2}})=17.9_{-0.42}^{+0.27}$ and gravitational redshift $1+z
          =1.345_{-0.008}^{+0.005}$ with 95% confidence. We calculate the
          detectability  of  this  spectral  feature for a large range of
          spins  and  inclinations  assuming that the emission comes from
          the  entire  surface.  We find that at 300 (600) Hz only 10-20%
          (5-10%)  of  NSs  would  have spectral features as deep as that
          seen in EXO 0748-676.

          Title:  Exposing  the Nuclear Burning Ashes of Radius Expansion
          Type I X-ray Bursts
          Authors:  Nevin  N.  Weinberg  (Caltech,  KITP),  Lars Bildsten
          (KITP, UCSB), Hendrik Schatz (MSU, JINA)
          Comments: 15 pages, 15 figures (emulateapj), accepted to ApJ
          We  solve  for  the  evolution  of  the  vertical extent of the
          convective  region of a neutron star atmosphere during a Type I
          X-ray  burst. The convective region is well-mixed with ashes of
          nuclear  burning and its extent determines the rise time of the
          burst  light  curve.  Using a full nuclear reaction network, we
          show  that the maximum vertical extent of the convective region
          during   photospheric  radius  expansion  (RE)  bursts  can  be
          sufficiently  great that: (1) some ashes of burning are ejected
          by  the radiation driven wind during the RE phase and, (2) some
          ashes  of  burning  are  exposed  at  the  neutron star surface
          following the RE phase. We find that ashes with mass number A ~
          30  -  60  are mixed in with the ejected material. We calculate
          the  expected  column  density  of ejected and surface ashes in
          hydrogen-like states and determine the equivalent widths of the
          resulting  photoionization edges from both the wind and neutron
          star  surface.  We  find  that  these can exceed 100 eV and are
          potentially  detectable.  A  detection  would probe the nuclear
          burning processes and might enable a measurement of the neutron
          star  gravitational  redshift.  In  addition,  we  find that in
          bursts with pure helium burning layers, protons from (alpha, p)
          reactions  cause  a  rapid onset of the 12C(p, gamma)13N(alpha,
          p)16O  reaction  sequence. The sequence bypasses the relatively
          slow  12C(alpha, gamma)16O reaction and leads to a sudden surge
          in  energy production that is directly observable as a rapid (~
          ms) increase in flux during burst rise.

          Title:  Fluctuations  along Velocity Coordinate: Statistics and
          Effects of Absorption
          Authors: A. Lazarian, D. Pogosyan
          Comments: 31 page, 1 figure
          We  discuss  statistics of Doppler-broadened spectral lines, in
          particular,     the     statistics     of    fluctuations    in
          Position-Position-Velocity data cub along the velocity axis. We
          show  that absorption substantially changes the long wavelength
          statistics of fluctuations compared to the optically thin case.
          At  the  same time, short-wavelength asymptotic is not affected
          by  absorption and remains power-law. We consider both the case
          of  high  spatial  resolution  and  the  case  of  poor spatial
          resolution  and  discuss  the retrieval of power-law indexes of
          velocity and density spectra. This provides a new technique for
          studies of turbulence from observations. A big advantage of the
          technique  is  that studies of turbulence can accomplished even
          when spatial resolution of the turbulent volume is poor.

          Using   the   Florida   Multi-object   Imaging   Near-IR  grism
          Observational  Spectrometer  (FLAMINGOS), we have conducted the
          FLAMINGOS  Extragalactic Survey (FLAMEX), a deep imaging survey
          covering  7.1  square degrees within the 18.6 sq. deg NOAO Deep
          Wide-Field  Survey  (NDWFS)  regions. FLAMEX is the first deep,
          wide-area  near-infrared  survey  to image in both the J and Ks
          filters,  and  is  larger  than  any  previous  NIR  surveys of
          comparable  depth.  The  intent  of FLAMEX is to facilitate the
          study  of  galaxy  and  galaxy  cluster  evolution  at 1<z<2 by
          providing  rest-frame optical photometry for the massive galaxy
          population  at  this  epoch. This effort is designed to yield a
          public  data  set  that  complements  and augments the suite of

          FLAMEX  and  initial  results  based  upon ~150,000 Ks-selected
          sources  in  the Bootes field. We describe the observations and

          number   counts  are  consistent  with  results  from  previous
          surveys.  Finally,  we  comment upon the utility of this sample
          for  detailed  study  of the ERO population, and present one of
          the  first  spectroscopically  confirmed  z>1  galaxy  clusters

          We  present data obtained with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC)
          aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer) for a sample of 74
          young  (t  <  30 Myr old) Sun-like (0.7 < M(star)/M(Sun) < 1.5)
          stars.  These  are  a sub-set of the observations that comprise
          the  Spitzer  Legacy science program entitled the Formation and
          Evolution  of Planetary Systems (FEPS). Using IRAC we study the
          fraction  of  young  stars that exhibit 3.6-8.0 micron infrared
          emission   in   excess   of  that  expected  from  the  stellar
          photosphere,  as  a  function  of  age  from 3-30 Myr. The most
          straightforward  interpretation  of such excess emission is the
          presence  of hot (300-1000K) dust in the inner regions (< 3 AU)
          of  a circumstellar disk. Five out of the 74 young stars show a
          strong  infrared  excess,  four of which have estimated ages of
          3-10  Myr.  While  we  detect  excesses  from 5 optically thick
          disks,  and  photospheric  emission  from  the remainder of our
          sample,  we  do  not  detect any excess emission from optically
          thin  disks  at  these wavelengths. We compare our results with
          accretion  disk fractions detected in previous studies, and use
          the  ensemble  results  to  place additional constraints on the
          dissipation timescales for optically-thick, primordial disks.

          of diffuse star cluster systems are red, 1.1 < g-z < 1.6, which
          is  redder  than  metal-rich GCs and often as red as the galaxy
          itself.  Most  DSC systems thus have mean ages older than 5 Gyr
          or  else  have  super-solar  metallicities.  We  find  that  12
          galaxies  in our sample contain a significant excess of diffuse
          star cluster candidates -- nine are lenticulars (S0s), and five
          visibly  contain dust. We also find a substantial population of
          DSCs  in  the halo of the giant elliptical M49, associated with
          the  companion  galaxy  VCC 1199. Most DSC systems appear to be
          both aligned with the galaxy light and associated with galactic
          disks,  but  at  the  same  time  many  lenticulars do not host
          substantial  DSC  populations.  Diffuse  star  clusters  in our
          sample  share  similar  characteristics  to those identified in
          other  nearby  lenticular,  spiral,  and dwarf galaxies, and we
          suggest  that  DSCs  preferentially form, survive, and coevolve
          with  galactic  disks.  Their properties are broadly consistent
          with  those  of merged star cluster complexes, and we note that
          despite   being   3   -   5   magnitudes  brighter  than  DSCs,
          ultra-compact  dwarfs  have  similar  surface brightnesses. The
          closest Galactic analogs to the DSCs are the old open clusters.
          We  suggest that if a diffuse star cluster population did exist
          in  the  disk  of  the Milky Way, it would be very difficult to
          find. (Abridged)

          Title:   The   baseline   intracluster   entropy  profile  from
          gravitational structure formation
          Authors: G. Mark Voit, Scott T. Kay, Greg L. Bryan
          Comments: Accepted to MNRAS, 8 pages, 9 figures
          The  radial  entropy  profile  of  the  hot  gas in clusters of
          galaxies  tends  to follow a power law in radius outside of the
          cluster  core. Here we present a simple formula giving both the
          normalization  and  slope for the power-law entropy profiles of
          clusters   that   form  in  the  absence  of  non-gravitational
          processes such as radiative cooling and subsequent feedback. It
          is  based  on  seventy-one  clusters  drawn  from four separate
          cosmological    simulations,    two   using   smoothed-particle
          hydrodynamics  (SPH)  and  two  using  adaptive-mesh refinement
          (AMR),  and  can be used as a baseline for assessing the impact
          of  non-gravitational  processes  on  the  intracluster  medium
          outside  of cluster cores. All the simulations produce clusters
          with  self-similar  structure in which the normalization of the
          entropy  profile  scales linearly with cluster temperature, and
          these profiles are in excellent agreement outside of 0.2 r_200.
          Because  the observed entropy profiles of clusters do not scale
          linearly    with   temperature,   our   models   confirm   that
          non-gravitational   processes   are   necessary  to  break  the
          self-similarity  seen  in  the  simulations.  However, the core
          entropy  levels  found by the two codes used here significantly
          differ,  with  the  AMR  code  producing  nearly  twice as much
          entropy at the centre of a cluster.

          Title: Gas distribution, kinematics and star formation in faint

          Comments:   15  pages,  6  tables,  13  figures.  Accepted  for
          publication in MNRAS
          We  compare  the  gas  distribution, kinematics and the current
          star  formation  in  a  sample of 10 very faint (-13.37 < M_B <
          -9.55)  dwarf  galaxies.  For  5  of  these galaxies we present
          fresh, high sensitivity, GMRT HI 21cm observations. For all our
          galaxies  we  construct  maps  of  the  HI  column density at a
          constant  linear resolution of ~300 pc; this forms an excellent
          data  set  to  check  for  the  presence  of a threshold column
          density  for  star  formation.  We find that while current star
          formation (as traced by Halpha emission) is confined to regions
          with  relatively  large  (N_HI  >  (0.4  -1.7)  X 10^{21} atoms
          cm^{-2})  HI  column  density,  the  morphology  of  the Halpha
          emission  is in general not correlated with that of the high HI
          column  density gas. Thus, while high column density gas may be
          necessary  for  star  formation, in this sample at least, it is
          not  sufficient  to  ensure  that  star  formation does in fact
          occur.  We examine the line profiles of the HI emission, but do
          not  find  a  simple relation between regions with complex line
          profiles  and  those  with on-going star formation. Finally, we
          examine the very fine scale (~20-100 pc) distribution of the HI
          gas,  and  find  that  at  these scales the emission exhibits a
          variety  of  shell  like,  clumpy and filamentary features. The
          Halpha  emission  is  sometimes associated with high density HI
          clumps,  sometimes  the  Halpha  emission  lies  inside  a high
          density shell, and sometimes there is no correspondence between
          the  Halpha  emission  and  the  HI  clumps.  In  summary,  the
          interplay  between  star  formation  and  gas  density in these
          galaxy  does  not  seem to show the simple large scale patterns
          observed in brighter galaxies (abridged).

          Title: The Local Rate and the Progenitor Lifetime of Short-Hard
          Gamma-Ray Bursts: Synthesis and Predictions for LIGO
          Authors: Ehud Nakar, Avishay Gal-Yam, Derek B. Fox
          The  properties  of the short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) with
          known  host-galaxies  suggest  that  these events result from a
          long-lived progenitor system. The most popular progenitor model
          of  SHBs invokes the merger of either double neutron star (DNS)
          binaries  or  neutron  star-black  hole  (NS-BH)  systems. Such
          events  produce  strong  gravitational waves (GWs) at frequency
          range   that  is  accessible  to  current  and  next-generation
          ground-based  GW  observatories.  In  this  work we combine the
          census of SHB observations with refined theoretical analysis to
          critically  evaluate  the  compact  binary progenitor model. We
          then explore the implications for GW detection of these events.
          Beginning  from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic
          time,  we  consider  what  intrinsic  luminosity  and  lifetime
          distributions  can  reproduce  both the known SHB redshifts and
          luminosities, and the peak flux distribution of the large BATSE
          SHB  sample.  We  find  that (1) Short progenitor lifetimes, <3
          Gyr,  are ruled out, and lifetimes of about 6 Gyr favored. This
          result  is  difficult to reconcile with the observed properties
          of  the  DNS  population  in  our  galaxy. We show that for DNS
          systems to remain viable SHB progenitors, a large population of
          old  undetectable  NS  binaries must be postulated. (2) We find
          that  the  local  rate  of SHBs is at least 10 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 and
          likely as high as 10^5 Gpc^-3 yr-1, significantly above earlier
          estimates.  (3)  We find that assuming that SHBs do result from
          compact   binaries,  either  through  the  old  DNS  population
          mentioned   above   or   from   NS-BH  mergers,  our  resulting
          predictions  for the LIGO event rate are extremely encouraging:
          several   detections   per  year  may  be  expected  at  design
          sensitivity,   and   the   first   coincident   observation  of
          electromagnetic  and  gravitational  radiation  from an SHB may
          well be made with current facilities.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          The  1<z<2 redshift window hosts the peak of the star formation
          and metal production rates. Studies of the metal content of the
          star  forming  galaxies  at these epochs are however sparse. We
          report  VLT-ISAAC  near-infrared  spectroscopy  for a sample of
          five  [OII]-selected, M_B,AB<-21.5, z~1.4 galaxies, by which we
          measured  Hbeta and [OIII]5007 emission line fluxes from J-band
          spectra, and Halpha line fluxes plus upper limits for [NII]6584
          fluxes   from   H-band   spectra.   The   z~1.4   galaxies  are
          characterized   by  the  high  [OIII]/[OII]  line  ratios,  low
          extinction  and  low  metallicity  that  are  typical  of lower
          luminosity  CADIS  galaxies  at 0.4<z<0.7, and of more luminous
          Lyman  Break  Galaxies at z~3, but not seen in CFRS galaxies at
          0.4<z<0.9.  This  type of spectrum (e.g., high [OIII]/[OII]) is
          seen  in  progressively  more luminous galaxies as the redshift
          increases.  These  spectra  are caused by a combination of high
          ionisation  parameter  q  and  lower  [O/H].  Pegase2  chemical
          evolution  models are used to relate the observed metallicities
          and  luminosities  of z~1.4 galaxies to galaxy samples at lower
          and  higher redshift. Not surpringsingly, we see a relationship
          between redshift and inferred chemical age. We suppose that the
          metal-enriched  reservoirs  of  star  forming  gas  that we are
          probing  at intermediate redshifts are being mostly consumed to
          build  up  both  the  disk  and  the bulge components of spiral
          galaxies.  Finally,  our analysis of the metallicity-luminosity
          relation  at 0<z<1.5 suggests that the period of rapid chemical
          evolution may take place progressively in lower mass systems as
          the   universe  ages.  These  results  are  consistent  with  a
          ``downsizing''  type  picture  in  the  sense  that  particular
          signatures  (e.g.,  high [OIII]/[OII] or low [O/H]) are seen in
          progressively   more   luminous  (massive)  systems  at  higher
          redshifts.

          Title: The Initial Mass Function as given by the fragmentation

          Journal-ref: Astronomische Nachrichten (2005), 326,754
          The  dichotomy  between  a  universal mass function (IMF) and a
          variable   IMF  which  depends  on  local  physical  parameters
          characterises  observational and theoretical stellar astronomy.
          In this contribution the available distributions of probability
          are briefly reviewed. The physical nature of two of them, gamma
          variate  and lognormal, is then explained once the framework of
          the  fragmentation  is introduced. Interpolating techniques are
          then  applied  to the sample of the first 10 pc and to the open
          cluster  NGC6649: in both cases lognormal distribution produces
          the  best  fit.  The  three  power  law  function has also been
          investigated   and   visual  comparison  with  an  artificially
          generated  sample  of 100000 stars suggests that the variations
          in  the  spectral  index  are simply due to the small number of
          stars available in the observational sample. In order to derive
          the  sample  of masses, a new formula that allows us to express
          the  mass as a function of the absolute magnitude and (B-V) for
          MAIN V, GIANTS III and SUPERGIANTS I is derived.

          clouds

          Observations", Leuven, Belgium, September 12-16, 2005
          The  most  geoeffective  solar  drivers are magnetic clouds - a
          subclass of coronal mass ejections (CME's) distinguished by the
          smooth rotation of the magnetic field inside the structure. The
          portion of CME's that are magnetic clouds is maximum at sunspot
          minimum  and  mimimum  at  sunspot  maximum.  This  portion  is
          determined  by  the  amount  of  helicity carried away by CME's
          which  in  turn  depends  on the amount of helicity transferred
          from  the  solar  interior  to  the surface, and on the surface
          differential  rotation.  The  latter can increase or reduce, or
          even  reverse  the  twist of emerging magnetic flux tubes, thus
          increasing  or  reducing the helicity in the corona, or leading
          to   the   violation   of   the   hemispheric   helicity  rule,
          respectively.  We  investigate  the  CME's  associated with the
          major  geomagnetic  storms  in the last solar cycle whose solar
          sources  have  been  identified,  and find that in 10 out of 12
          cases  of  violation  of  the  hemispheric  helicity rule or of
          highly geoeffective CME's with no magnetic field rotation, they
          originate  from  regions  with  "anti-solar"  type  of  surface
          differential rotation.

          We review the main properties, demographics and applications of
          binary  and  millisecond  radio pulsars. Our knowledge of these
          exciting  objects has greatly increased in recent years, mainly
          due  to  successful surveys which have brought the known pulsar
          population   to   over  1700.  There  are  now  80  binary  and
          millisecond pulsars associated with the disk of our Galaxy, and
          a  further 103 pulsars in 24 of the Galactic globular clusters.
          Recent  highlights  have  been  the discovery of the first ever
          double  pulsar  system  and  a  recent flurry of discoveries in
          globular clusters, in particular Terzan 5.

          Title: Can brane dark energy model be probed observationally by
          distant supernovae?
          Authors: Marek Szydlowski, Wlodzimierz Godlowski
          Comments: 14 pages 7 figures
          The  recent  astronomical measurements of distant supernovae as
          well  as  other  observations  indicate  that  our  universe is
          presently  accelerating.  There are different proposals for the
          explanation  of  this  acceleration.  Most  of  these proposals
          require  the  existence of exotic matter with negative pressure
          violating the strong energy condition. On the other hand, there
          have  appeared  many  models which offer dramatically different
          mechanism  for  the  current acceleration, in which dark energy
          emerges  from  the  gravity  sector rather than from the matter
          sector.  In this paper, we compare the concordance $\Lambda$CDM
          model with the braneworld models of dark energy by using Akaike
          and  Bayesian  informative critera. We show that, although this
          model  has  extra  parameters (the fundamental constants of the
          bulk  space)  resulting  in  an  improved fit to the SNIa data,
          these new parameters are actually not important for description
          of   present  acceleration  epoch.  With  the  example  of  the
          Sahni--Shtanov    braneworld    model    \cite{Shtanov03},   we
          demonstrate  that,  although  this  model has better fit to the
          SNIa data than $\Lambda$CDM model, the information criterion of
          model selection prefers the $\Lambda$CDM model. This is because
          the informative criteria of model selection compensate for this
          advantage  by penalizing models having more free parameters. We
          conclude  that  only new future observational data are powerful
          enough  to  give  advantage to dark-energy models of braneworld
          origin, i.e., a very high-significance detection is required to
          justify the presence of new parameters.

          We  discuss  the  distribution of radial velocities of galaxies
          belonging  to  the  Local  Group.  Two  independent  samples of
          galaxies  as  well  as  several  methods  of reduction from the
          heliocentric   to  the  galactocentric  radial  velocities  are
          explored. We applied the power spectrum analysis using the Hann
          function  as  a  weighting  method, together with the jackknife
          error  estimation.  We  performed  a  detailed analysis of this
          approach.  The  distribution  of  galaxy  redshifts seems to be
          non-random.  An  excess  of  galaxies with radial velocities of
          $\sim 24 {km} \cdot {s}^{-1}$ and $\sim 36 {km} \cdot {s}^{-1}$
          is  detected,  but  the  effect is statistically weak. Only one
          peak  for  radial  velocities  of $\sim 24 {km} \cdot {s}^{-1}$
          seems to be confirmed at the confidence level of 95%.

          We  present  7  mm and 3.5 cm wavelength continuum observations
          toward  the  Herbig  AeBe star HD169142 performed with the Very
          Large  Array  (VLA)  with an angular resolution of ~1". We find
          that this object exhibits strong (~4.4 mJy), unresolved (~1") 7
          mm  continuum  emission,  being  one  of the brightest isolated
          Herbig   AeBe   stars  ever  detected  with  the  VLA  at  this
          wavelength. No emission is detected at 3.5 cm continuum, with a
          3  sigma upper limit of ~0.08 mJy. From these values, we obtain
          a  spectral  index  of  ~2.5  in  the 3.5 cm to 7 mm wavelength
          range, indicating that the observed flux density at 7mm is most
          likely  dominated  by  thermal  dust  emission  coming  from  a
          circumstellar  disc. We use available photometric data from the
          literature  to  model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
          this  object  from  radio  to near-ultraviolet frequencies. The
          observed  SED  can  be  understood  in  terms  of an irradiated
          accretion  disc  with  low  mass  accretion rate, 10^{-8} solar
          masses  per year, surrounding a star with an age of ~10 Myr. We
          infer  that  the mass of the disc is ~0.04 solar masses, and is
          populated by dust grains that have grown to a maximum size of 1
          mm everywhere, consistent with the lack of silicate emission at
          10  microns. These features, as well as indications of settling
          in the wall at the dust destruction radius, led us to speculate
          the disc of HD169142 is in an advanced stage of dust evolution,
          particularly in its inner regions.

          In this paper another class of Dark Matter candidate particles:
          the  pseudoscalar  and  scalar  light  bosonic  candidates,  is
          discussed.  Particular  care  is  devoted  to  the study of the
          processes  for  their  detection (which only involves electrons
          and  photons/X-rays)  in  a  suitable  underground experimental
          set-up.  For this purpose the needed calculations are developed
          and  various related aspects and phenomenologies are discussed.
          In particular, it is shown that - in addition to the WIMP cases
          already  discussed  elsewhere - there is also possibility for a
          bosonic  candidate  to  account  for  the  6.3 sigma C.L. model
          independent   evidence  for  the  presence  of  a  particle  DM
          component  in  the  galactic halo observed by DAMA/NaI. Allowed
          regions in these scenarios are presented also paying particular
          care on the cosmological interest of the bosonic candidate.

          Title:  Central  energy  equipartition  in multi-mass models of
          globular clusters
          Authors: P. Miocchi (Universita' di Roma "La Sapienza", Dip. di
          Fisica, Rome, Italy)
          Comments:  LaTeX  2e,  9  pages  with  7  figures. Accepted for
          publication in MNRAS
          In   the  construction  of  multi-mass  King-Michie  models  of
          globular clusters, an approximated central energy equipartition
          between stars of different masses is usually imposed by scaling
          the  velocity  parameter  of each mass class inversely with the
          stellar  mass, as if the distribution function were isothermal.
          In  this  paper,  this 'isothermal approximation' (IA) has been
          checked and its consequences on the model parameters studied by
          a comparison with models including central energy equipartition
          correctly.  It  is found that, under the IA, the 'temperatures'
          of  a  pair of components can differ to a non-negligible amount
          for  low concentration distributions. It is also found that, in
          general,  this  approximation  leads to a significantly reduced
          mass  segregation in comparison with that given under the exact
          energy   equipartition  at  the  centre.  As  a  representative
          example,   an  isotropic  3-component  model  fitting  a  given
          projected   surface   brightness   and  line-of-sight  velocity
          dispersion profiles is discussed. In this example, the IA gives
          a    cluster   envelope   much   more   concentrated   (central
          dimensionless    potential   W=3.3)   than   under   the   true
          equipartition  (W=0.059),  as well as a higher logarithmic mass
          function  slope. As a consequence, the inferred total mass (and
          then the global mass-to-light ratio) results a factor 1.4 times
          lower  than  the  correct value and the amount of mass in heavy
          dark remnants is 3.3 times smaller. Under energy equipartition,
          the  fate  of  stars  having a mass below a certain limit is to
          escape  from the system. This limit is derived as a function of
          the mass and W of the giants and turn-off stars component.

          Title:  Astrometric  Light-Travel  Time signature of sources in
          nonlinear motion
          Authors: Guillem Anglada, Jordi Torra
          Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures
          Context:Very  precise  planned  space  astrometric missions and
          recent  improvements on imaging capabilities require a detailed
          review of the assumptions of classical astrometric modeling.
          Aims:We  show that Light-Travel Time must be taken into account
          to  model  the  kinematics of astronomical objects in nonlinear
          motion, even at stellar distances.
          Methods:A closed expression to include Light-Travel Time in the
          actual  astrometric  models  with nonlinear motion is provided.
          Using   a   perturbative   approach   the   expression  of  the
          Light-Travel  Time signature is derived. We propose a practical
          form  of the astrometric modelling to be applied in astrometric
          data reduction of sources at stellar distances($d>1 pc$).
          Results  :We  show  that  the  Light-Travel  Time  signature is
          relevant  at  $\muas$  accuracy (or even at $mas$) depending on
          the  time  span of the astrometric measurements. We explain how
          information  about  the  radial  motion  of  a  source  can  be
          obtained. Some estimative numbers are provided for known nearby
          binary systems
          Conclusions  :In the light of the obtained results, it is clear
          that  this  effect  must be taken into account to interpret any
          kind   of  precise  astrometric  measurements.  The  effect  is
          particularly  interesting  in  measurements  performed  by  the
          planned   astrometric   space  missions  (GAIA,  SIM,  JASMINE,
          TPF/DARWIN).  Finally  an  objective  criterion  is provided to
          quickly  evaluate  whether  the  Light-Travel  Time modeling is
          required for a given source or system.

          Title:  Influence of gravity waves on the internal rotation and
          Li abundance of solar-type stars
          Authors: Corinne Charbonnel, Suzanne Talon
          Comments:  Published  in Science, Vol.309, p.2189, 30 September
          2005. pdf only
          The  Sun's  rotation  profile  and  lithium  content  have been
          difficult  to  understand in the context of conventional models
          of  stellar  evolution. Classical hydrodynamical models predict
          that  the  solar interior must rotate highly differentially, in
          disagreement with observations. It has recently been shown that
          internal  waves  produced  by  convection  in  solar-type stars
          produce  an  asymmetric,  shear  layer  oscillation, similar to
          Earth's  quasi-biennial  oscillation,  that  leads to efficient
          angular  momentum redistribution from the core to the envelope.
          We  presents  results  of  a model that successfully reproduces
          both  the rotation profile and the surface abundance of lithium
          in solar-type stars of various ages.

          The   low   background,   good  spatial  resolution  and  great
          sensitivity  of  the  EPIC-pn  camera on XMM-Newton give useful
          limits  for  the  detection of extended sources even during the
          short  exposures  made during slewing maneouvers. In this paper
          we  attempt  to illustrate the potential of the XMM-Newton slew
          survey as a tool for analysing flux-limited samples of clusters
          of  galaxies  and  other  sources  of  spatially extended X-ray
          emission.

          The  Global  mm-VLBI  Array  is at present the most sensitive 3
          mm-VLBI   interferometer  and  provides  images  of  up  to  40
          micro-arcsecond resolution. Using this array, we have monitored
          the rotation of the innermost jet in the quasar NRAO 150, which
          shows an angular speed of ~ 7 deg./yr. Future 3 mm arrays could
          include  additional  stations  like ALMA, GBT, LMT, CARMA, SRT,
          Yebes,  Nobeyama  and  Noto,  which would allow to push VLBI at
          this   wavelength  to  sensitivity  and  image  quality  levels
          comparable  to those of present VLBI at centimeter wavelengths.
          This  would  improve our knowledge of the accretion systems and
          the  magneto-hydrodynamics  of  the  innermost  jets in AGN and
          microquasars.

          Title:   Single   massive  stars  at  the  critical  rotational
          velocity: possible links with Be and B[e] stars
          Authors: Georges Meynet, Andre Maeder
          Comments: 11 pages, 13 figures, Stars with the B[e] phenomenon,
          M. Kraus and A. Miroshnichenko, ASP Conference Series, in press
          Using  single  star  models  including the effects of shellular
          rotation with and without magnetic fields, we show that massive
          stars at solar metallicity with initial masses lower than about
          20-25  M$_\odot$  and with an initial rotation above $\sim 350$
          km  s$^{-1}$  likely  reach  the critical velocity during their
          Main-Sequence  phase.  This results from the efficient outwards
          transport  of  angular  momentum by the meridional circulation.
          This could be a scenario for explaining the Be stars. After the
          Main-Sequence  phase,  single star in this mass range can again
          reach  the  critical limit when they are on a blue loop after a
          red supergiant phase \citep{HL98}. This might be a scenario for
          the  formation  of B[e] stars, however as discussed by Langer &
          Heger  (1998),  this  scenario would predict a short B[e] phase
          (only  some 10$^4$ years) with correspondingly small amounts of
          mass lost.

          We  present the spectral and temporal analysis of the 2004/2005
          outburst  of  the  transient  X-ray pulsar V0332+53 as observed
          with  Integral. After the discovery of the third cyclotron line
          in  phase averaged spectra (Kreykenbohm et al 2005, Pottschmidt
          et   al  2005),  detailed  pulse  phase  spectroscopy  revealed
          remarkably  little  variability  of the cyclotron lines through
          the  4.4s  X-ray  pulse  (Pottschmidt  et  al 2005). During the
          decline  of  the  outburst,  the  flux  was  observed  to decay
          exponentially  until  2005  Feb 10 and linearly thereafter. The
          spectrum  was  found  to  become  harder  with  time, while the
          folding energy remained constant. The energy of the fundamental
          cyclotron  line  increased  with  time from 26.5kev in the RXTE
          observation  up  to 29.5kev in the last Integral one indicating
          that the emission region is moving closer to the surface of the
          neutron  star.  For  a  detailed  analysis,  see  Mowlavi et al

          Comments:  16  pages, 6 color figures, 4 b/w figures, submitted
          to Astronomy and Astrophysics
          (ABBREVIATED)  We study the spectrum of the prompt emission and
          the  X-ray  and  optical  afterglow  fluxes of XRRs and XRFs. A
          comparison  is  then performed with GRBs. We derive a sample of
          54 events XRRs/XRFs observed by BeppoSAX and HETE-2. We analyze
          the  distribution  of  the  spectral  parameters  of  the  Band
          function finding that the spectral indexes are similar to those
          of classical GRBs, whereas the peak energy is lower by a factor
          of  4  for  the  XRRs/XRFs.  We  study  the  optical  and X-Ray
          afterglow  properties  of  the  XRRs/XRFs;  in  particular  XRR
          011030. We find that the X-ray and optical flux distribution of
          the  XRRs/XRFs  sample,  observed 40 ks from burst trigger, are
          consistent  with those of classical GRBs. We find also that the
          XRRs/XRFs  lightcurves  seems to be similar to the GRB ones. In
          addition,  they  never  show  a  rising slope at early time. We
          compare  this  result  with  the  afterglow  predictions of two
          models : the high redshift scenario, and the off-axis scenario.
          In  this last framework, we consider jets with a homogeneous, a
          -2   power-law   shaped   and  a  Gaussian  luminosity  angular
          distribution.  We  find  that  the  high  redshift scenario can
          explain  some events but not the total sample of XRRs/XRFs. The
          off-axis model may be consistent with our foundings only when a
          power-law   shaped   jet  is  considered.  However,  given  the
          uncertainties  on  the  selection  effects  in  our sample, the
          Gaussian  jet  viewed  at  small  angles from the Gaussian core
          cannot  be  ruled  out.  On the contrary, our analysis strongly
          disfavored a homogeneous jet seen off-axis.

          15-19, 2005
          Today's  sensistive, high resolution Chandra X-ray observations
          allow  the  study  of  many  populations  of X-ray sources. The
          traditional  astronomical  tools  of  photometric  diagrams and
          luminosity  functions are now applied to these populations, and
          provide the means for classifying the X-ray sources and probing
          their  evolution.  While overall stellar mass drives the amount
          of  X-ray  binaries  in  old  stellar population, the amount of
          sources  in  star-forming  galaxies  is  related  to  the  star
          formation  rate.  Shart-lived,  luminous,  high  mass  binaries
          (HNXBs) dominate these young populations.

          Authors:   Huaiyu   Duan   (UCSD),  George  M.  Fuller  (UCSD),
          Yong-Zhong Qian (UMN)
          Comments: 16 pages, 9 figures
          We   examine   the  coherent  active-active  channel  nonlinear
          neutrino  flavor  evolution  in  the post-core-bounce supernova
          environment. We improve on the previous spin precession analogy
          to  neutrino  oscillation,  and propose the concept of neutrino
          flavor isospin, which treats neutrinos and anti-neutrinos on an
          equal  footing.  We  point  out  a  key conserved quantity, the
          "total  effective energy". This conservation condition suggests
          a  simple explanation for previous numerical results. We employ
          a  co-rotating  frame  in  the  spin precession picture to gain
          physical  insights into the collective behaviors of this system
          when  neutrino-neutrino  forward  scattering dominates the weak
          potentials which govern flavor conversion. We also use the spin
          precession analogy to analyze previously-derived limits for the
          behavior  of supernova neutrinos, e.g., the Background Dominant
          Solution, and we speculate on how such solutions could arise in

          Title: Investigating Galaxy Evolution with Chandra
          Authors: G. Fabbiano
          Comments:  To  be  included  in  the  proceedings of the 'X-ray
          universe  2005  meeting'  held  in  San  Lorenzo de El Escorial
          (Spain), 26-30 Sep 2005
          Chandra  observations show the importance of the X-ray band for
          studying the evolution of galaxies. Binary X-ray sources are an
          easily  detectable  tracer  of  the stellar population. Chandra
          studies  of  these  populations are giving us insights into the
          nature  and  formation of these binaries, and provide the basis
          for   diagnostics   of   galaxy  evolution.  With  Chandra  and
          XMM-Newton  we  can  explore relatively poorly known aspects of
          the black hole population of the universe: ultra-luminous X-ray
          sources,  that may be connected with the 'missing' intermediate
          mass  black  holes  predicted  by hierarchical galaxy and black
          hole  formation  scenarios;  and quiescent supermassive nuclear
          black  holes and their surroundings, as a way to understand the
          full  range  of  the  AGN  phenomenon.  Finally, the X-ray band
          provides  the  only  way  to  explore  hot plasmas in galaxies;
          recent  observations  are  revealing  the  importance  of these
          plasmas as vehicles of both chemical enrichment and energy.

          Title: Gamma Ray Astronomy with Magnetized Zevatrons

          Nearby  sources  of cosmic rays up to a ZeV(=10^21 eV) could be
          observed  with  a  multi-messenger approach including secondary
          gamma-rays  and  neutrinos.  If cosmic rays above ~10^18 eV are
          produced  in  magnetized  environments such as galaxy clusters,
          the  flux  of secondary gamma-rays below ~1 TeV can be enhanced
          up  to  several  orders  of magnitudes compared to unmagnetized
          sources. A particular source of enhancement are synchrotron and
          cascade  photons  from  e^+e^-  pairs  produced by protons from
          sources with relatively steep injection spectra proportional to
          E^-2.6.  Such  sources  should  be  visible at the same time in
          ultra-high   energy   cosmic   ray  experiments  and  gamma-ray
          telescopes.

          publication in Astron. Nachrichten
          We  present  results  of  an optical and near-infrared (IR) 1.8
          deg^2  survey  in  the  Pleiades  open  cluster  to  search for
          substellar  objects.  From  optical I-band images from the CFHT
          and J-band images from the 3.5 m CAHA Telescope, we identify 18
          faint  and  very red L brown dwarf candidates, with I> 20.9 and
          I-J>  3.2. The follow-up observations of nine objects in the H-
          and  Ks-bands  confirm  that eight belong to the IR sequence of
          the  cluster  and  the  proper  motion  measurements  of  seven
          candidates   confirm   that   they   are  Pleiades  members.  A
          preliminary estimation of the substellar mass spectrum dN/dM in
          the  form of a power law M^-alpha provides alpha=0.57+-0.14. We
          extrapolate  this  function  to  estimate  the  number  of very
          low-mass  brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects that could be
          present  in  the  cluster  down  to 1 M_Jup. Sensitive searches
          combining  far  red  and  near infrared observations may unveal
          these objects in a near future.

          Title:  Size  and Properties of the NLR in the Seyfert-2 Galaxy
          NGC 1386

          Komossa  (MPE Garching), Martin Haas (Univ. Bochum), Rolf Chini
          (Univ. Bochum)
          Comments: 14 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          We  study  the narrow-line region (NLR) of the Seyfert-2 galaxy
          NGC 1386 by means of long-slit spectroscopy obtained with FORS1
          at  the  VLT.  We  use  the  galaxy  itself for subtracting the
          stellar  template,  applying  reddening  corrections to fit the
          stellar  template to the spectra of the NLR. The continuum gets
          steadily  redder  towards the nucleus. The spatial distribution
          of the reddening derived from the Balmer decrement differs from
          the  continuum reddening, indicating dust within the NLR with a
          varying column density along the line of sight. Using spatially
          resolved  spectral  diagnostics,  we  find a transition between
          central  line ratios falling into the AGN regime and outer ones
          in  the  HII-region  regime,  occuring at a radius of ~6 arcsec
          (310  pc)  in  all  three  diagnostic diagrams. Applying CLOUDY
          photoionisation  models,  we show that the observed distinction
          between  HII-like  and AGN-like ratios in NGC 1386 represents a
          true difference in ionisation source and cannot be explained by
          variations of physical parameters such as ionisation parameter,
          electron  density  or  metallicity.  We  interpret it as a real
          border  between  the  NLR,  i.e.  the  central AGN-photoionised
          region   and   surrounding   HII  regions.  We  derive  surface
          brightness,  electron  density,  and  ionisation parameter as a
          function  of  distance  from  the  nucleus.  Both  the electron
          density  and  the ionisation parameter decrease with radius. We
          discuss   the   consequences  of  these  observations  for  the
          interpretation  of  the empirical NLR size-luminosity relation.
          In  the  outer  part  of  the NLR, we find evidence for shocks,
          resulting  in  a  secondary  peak  of  the electron-density and
          ionisation-parameter  distribution  north  of  the  nucleus. We
          compare the NLR velocity curve with the stellar one and discuss
          the differences.

          Title: [OIII] profile substructure in radio-quiet quasars
          Authors:  Christian  Leipski  (Univ.  Bochum),  Nicola  Bennert
          (Univ. Bochum)
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Interactions  between the radio jet and the optical emission of
          the  narrow-line  region  (NLR)  are a well known phenomenon in
          Seyfert  galaxies.  Here,  we  present  the  study  of possible
          jet-NLR interactions in five radio-quiet PG quasars with double
          or triple radio structure. High spatial and spectral resolution
          observations   were   carried   out   in  the  Hbeta-[OIII]5007
          wavelength  range.  In  all cases, there is evidence for [OIII]
          profile    substructure   (shoulders,   subpeaks,   blueshifted
          ''broad''  components)  with  different clarity. To measure the
          velocity,  line  width, intensity, and location of these [OIII]
          components,   several   Gaussians   were   fitted.  Often,  the
          substructures  are  more  pronounced  close to the radio lobes,
          suggestive  of  jet-NLR  interactions. Our observations support
          the unification scheme in which radio-quiet quasars are assumed
          to be the luminous cousins of Seyfert galaxies.

          Authors:  D.  Paulson,  J.  Allred,  R. Anderson, S. Hawley, W.
          Cochran, S. Yelda
          Comments: Accepted for publication in PASP
          We  present  optical  spectra  of  a  flare  on Barnard's star.
          Several  photospheric  as  well  as  chromospheric species were
          enhanced  by the flare heating. An analysis of the Balmer lines
          shows  that their shapes are best explained by Stark broadening
          rather   than  chromospheric  mass  motions.  We  estimate  the
          temperature of the flaring region in the lower atmosphere to be
          >8000  K and the electron density to be ~10^14 cm^{-3}, similar
          to  values  observed in other dM flares. Because Barnard's star
          is  considered  to  be  one of our oldest neighbors, a flare of
          this magnitude is probably quite rare.

          Comments:   27   pages,  7  figures,  2  tables;  Accepted  for
          publication in AJ
          In  order  to  examine  the  relative  importance  of  powerful
          starbursts and Compton-thick AGNs in NGC 6240, we have obtained
          mid-infrared  images  and  low-resolution spectra of the galaxy
          with   sub-arcsecond   spatial   resolution   using   the  Keck
          Telescopes.  Despite  the  high spatial resolution (~200 pc) of
          our  data, no signature of the hidden AGNs has been detected in
          the  mid-infrared. The southern nucleus, which we show provides
          80-90%  of  the  total  8-25 um luminosity of the system, has a
          mid-infrared  spectrum  and a mid-/far-infrared spectral energy
          distribution  consistent  with  starbursts.  At  the same time,
          however,  it  is  also  possible  to attribute up to 60% of the
          bolometric   luminosity   to  an  AGN,  consistent  with  X-ray
          observations,  if  the AGN is heavily obscured and emits mostly
          in   the   far-infrared.  This  ambiguity  arises  because  the
          intrinsic   variation   of  properties  among  a  given  galaxy
          population (e.g., starbursts) introduces at least a factor of a
          few   uncertainty  even  into  the  most  robust  AGN-starburst
          diagnostics.  We  conclude that with present observations it is
          not possible to determine the dominant power source in galaxies
          when  AGN  and  starburst luminosities are within a factor of a
          few of each other.

          article  with  uncompressed figures may be downloaded from this

          The  spectral energy distribution of the dark cloud LDN1622, as
          measured  by  Finkbeiner using WMAP data, drops above 30GHz and
          is   suggestive   of  a  Boltzmann  cutoff  in  grain  rotation
          frequencies, characteristic of spinning dust emission.
          LDN1622 is conspicuous in the 31 GHz image we obtained with the
          Cosmic  Background  Imager, which is the first cm-wave resolved
          image  of a dark cloud. The 31GHz emission follows the emission
          traced by the four IRAS bands. The normalised cross-correlation
          of  the 31 GHz image with the IRAS images is higher by 6.6sigma
          for  the 12um and 25um bands than for the 60um and 100um bands:
          C(12+25) = 0.76+/-0.02 and C(60+100) = 0.64+/-0.01.
          The  mid-IR  -- cm-wave correlation in LDN 1622 is evidence for
          very small grain (VSG) or continuum emission at 26-36GHz from a
          hot  molecular phase. In dark clouds and their photon-dominated
          regions  (PDRs)  the  12um  and  25um emission is attributed to
          stochastic  heating  of  the  VSGs. The mid-IR and cm-wave dust
          emissions  arise in a limb-brightened shell coincident with the
          PDR  of  LDN1622,  where the incident UV radiation from the Ori
          OB1b  association heats and charges the grains, as required for
          spinning dust.

          Title: Scalar-Tensor Gravitation and Cosmic Acceleration
          Authors: Sanil Unnikrishnan, T.R.Seshadri
          Comments: 9 pages, 2 figures, Submitted to Physics Letters B
          In  this  paper  we consider a model in which the gravitational
          ``constant''  $G$  is  determined by a tachyon-like field whose
          Lagrangian is of the form $\mathcal{L}_{\phi} = -V(\phi)\sqrt{1
          -  \partial_{\mu}\phi\partial^{\mu}\phi}$  and the potential is
          of  the  form  $  V(\phi)  =  \lambda \phi ^{-4}$. We study the
          cosmological consequence of this theory in the matter dominated
          era  and  show  that this leads to a transition from an initial
          decelerated  expansion to an accelerated expansion phase at the
          present epoch.

          Title:  An  Alternative Interpretation for the Moduli Fields of
          the Cosmology Associated to Type IIB Supergravity with Fluxes
          Authors:    Tonatiuh    Matos,    Jose-Ruben    Luevano,   Hugo
          Garcia-Compean
          Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure
          We start with a particular cosmological model derived from type
          IIB  supergravity theory with fluxes, where usually the dilaton
          is  interpreted  as  a  Quintessence field. Instead of that, in
          this  letter we interpret the dilaton as the dark matter of the
          universe.  With this alternative interpretation we find that in
          this  supergravity  model  the  dilaton  dominates the universe
          before  recombination.  We  also  show  that  the model gives a
          similar  evolution  and  structure  formation  of  the universe
          compared  with  the  $\Lambda$CDM model in the linear regime of
          fluctuations  of  the structure formation. Some free parameters
          of   the  theory  are  fixed  using  the  present  cosmological
          observations.   In   the  non-linear  regimen  there  are  some
          differences  between  the type IIB supergravity theory with the
          traditional  CDM paradigm. The supergravity theory predicts the
          formation  of  galaxies  earlier  than  the CDM and there is no
          density  cusp  in the center of galaxies. These differences can
          distinguish  both  models and can give a distinctive feature to
          the  phenomenology  of  the  cosmology  coming from superstring
          theory with fluxes.

          Title: The BATSE-Swift luminosity and redshift distributions of
          short-duration GRBs
          Authors: Dafne Guetta, Tsvi Piran
          We  compare  the luminosity function and rate inferred from the
          BATSE  short hard bursts (SHBs) peak flux distribution with the
          redshift  and  luminosity  distributions  of  SHBs  observed by
          Swift/HETE   II.   While   the  Swift/HETE  II  SHB  sample  is
          incompatible   with   SHB  population  that  follows  the  star
          formation rate, it is compatible with a SHB rate that reflect a
          distribution  of  delay  times after the SFR. This would be the
          case  if  SHBs are associated with binary neutron star mergers.
          The  available data allows, however, different interpretations.
          For  example,  a  population  whose  rate is independent of the
          redshift fits the data very well. The implied SHB rates that we
          find range from $\sim 8$ to $\sim
          30h_{70}^3$Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. This is a much higher rate than
          what  was previously estimated. A detailed (2 dimensional) look
          at the best fit models shows, however, some discrepancy between
          the four Swift/HETE II SHBs and the models based on BATSE SHBs.
          This  could  be  a  statistical fluke. It could also arise from
          wrong  estimates  of  the triggering criteria or from selection
          effects.  If  real  it  may  indicate  the existence of two SHB
          populations  with  different  luminosity functions and redshift
          distributions.

          Title:  Low Frequency Radio Observations of Galaxy Clusters Can
          Reveal Global Signatures in the Cosmological 21-cm Background
          Authors: Asantha Cooray
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          While  the  low  frequency spectrum of the radio sky is rich in
          features  associated  with  the  cosmic  21-cm  background from
          neutral  Hydrogen,  a  direct  measurement  of  this  frequency
          spectrum  is  challenging. We propose a technique to indirectly
          establish global signatures in the cosmic 21-cm radiation based
          on  differential  observations  towards  and away from a galaxy
          cluster  such  that  modifications  imposed  by inverse-Compton
          scattering  via  electrons  in galaxy clusters can be detected.
          While  the unscattered spectrum has features with amplitudes up
          to  40  mK in the brightness temperature relative to the cosmic
          microwave background, after scattering, the observable spectrum
          contains  decrements  and increments with amplitudes around 0.2
          to  1  mK  in addition to a uniform few mK decrement associated
          with  the  black-body  CMB. Low frequency radio interferometers
          that  are  now planned for 21-cm anisotropy measurements can be
          easily  utilized  for  the proposed measurement. The signatures
          towards clusters will also confirm the 21-cm signal is produced
          at a redshift higher than the cluster, in addition to providing
          an   easy,   and   a   necessary,  cross-check  on  fluctuation
          measurements.

          Title: Halo Spacetime
          Authors: Mark D. Roberts
          Comments: 8 pages
          Subject to the four assupmtions:
          1)a  galactic  halo  can  be  modeled  by  a static spherically
          symmetric spacetime,
          2)in  the  limit  of  no  rotation  halo spacetime is Minkowski
          spacetime  and  that  the  speed  of  rotation is a permissible
          parameter   to   expand  in,  3)the  constraint  on  the  first
          derivatives  of  the metric needed in order to produce constant
          rotation  curves  can  be applied, 4)the perfect fluid Einstein
          equations;    it    is    shown    that    the    density    is
          $\rho=-2v^2/r^2+O(v^4)$,  where  $v=v_c/c$  is  the velocity of
          rotation  of  the  galaxy.  The  negative  density  is taken to
          indicate  that  one of the above four assumptions is wrong, the
          last  is  the most likely, implying that there is no such thing
          as dark matter.

          Title:  Three-Body  Kick  to  a Bright Quasar out of Its Galaxy
          During a Merger
          Authors: Loren Hoffman, Abraham Loeb (Harvard U.)
          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Nature
          The  quasar HE0450-2958 was recently discovered to reside ~7kpc
          away  from  a  galaxy  that  was  likely  disturbed by a recent
          merger.  The  lack  of  a  massive spheroid of stars around the
          quasar  raised  the unlikely suggestion that it may have formed
          in  a  dark galaxy. Here we explain this discovery as a natural
          consequence  of  a  dynamical kick imparted to the quasar as it
          interacted  with  a  binary  black  hole system during a galaxy
          merger  event.  The  typical stalling radius (~1pc) for a ~10^9
          solar  mass binary provides a kick of order the escape velocity
          of  the stellar spheroid, bringing the quasar out to around the
          observed radius before it turns around. This is consistent with
          the  observed  low relative velocity between the quasar and the
          merger-remnant  galaxy.  The  gas  carried  with the black hole
          throughout  the three-body interaction fuels the quasar for the
          duration of its journey, ~2x10^7 years. Gravitational radiation
          recoil could not have produced the required kick.

          Workshop
          In  order  to  study  the  possibility of acoustic detection of
          ultra-high  energy neutrinos in water, our group is planning to
          deploy  and  operate  an  array  of  acoustic sensors using the
          ANTARES Neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore,
          acoustic  sensor  hardware  has  to  be developed which is both
          capable  of  operation under the hostile conditions of the deep
          sea  and  at  the  same  time  provides  the  high  sensitivity
          necessary  to  detect  the weak pressure signals resulting from
          the  neutrino's  interaction  in  water.  In  this  paper,  two
          different  approaches  to  building  such  sensors,  as well as
          performance   studies  in  the  laboratory  and  in  situ,  are
          presented.

          Title:  First  optical images of circumstellar dust surrounding
          the debris disk candidate HD 32297
          Authors: P. Kalas
          Comments: 5 pages; Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters
          Near-infrared  imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope recently
          revealed  a circumstellar dust disk around the A star HD 32297.
          Dust  scattered  light  is detected as far as 400 AU radius and
          the  linear  morphology  is  consistent with a disk ~10 degrees
          away  from  an  edge-on  orientation. Here we present the first
          optical  images  that  show the dust scattered light morphology
          from  560 to 1680 AU radius. The position angle of the putative
          disk  midplane  diverges  by  31  degrees and the color of dust
          scattering  is  most  likely blue. We associate HD 32297 with a
          wall  of interstellar gas and the enigmatic region south of the
          Taurus molecular cloud. We propose that the extreme asymmetries
          and  blue disk color originate from a collision with a clump of
          interstellar  material as HD 32297 moves southward, and discuss
          evidence consistent with an age of 30 Myr or younger.

          Title:  Possible  evidence  for  the ejection of a supermassive
          black hole from an ongoing merger of galaxies
          Authors:  Martin  G.  Haehnelt  (IoA), Melvyn B. Davies (Lund),
          Martin J. Rees (IoA)
          Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX, no figures; MNRAS in press
          Attempts  of  Magain  et al (2005) to detect the host galaxy of
          the  bright  QSO  HE0450--2958  have  not  been  successful. We
          suggest  that  the supermassive black hole powering the QSO was
          ejected from the observed ULIRG at the same redshift and at 1.5
          arcsec distance. Ejection could have either be caused by recoil
          due  to gravitational wave emission from a coalescing binary of
          supermassive  black  holes  or  the  gravitational slingshot of
          three or more supermassive black holes in the ongoing merger of
          galaxies  which  triggered the starburst activity in the ULIRG.
          We  discuss implications for the possible hierarchical build-up
          of  supermassive  black  holes from intermediate and/or stellar
          mass   black   holes,  and  for  the  detection  of  coalescing
          supermassive binary black holes by LISA.

          Title:  Rotational  Broadening of Atomic Spectral Features from
          Neutron Stars
          Authors: P. Chang, S. Morsink, L. Bildsten, I. Wasserman
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, to appear in ApJ Letters
          The  discovery of the first gravitationally redshifted spectral
          line from a neutron star (NS) by Cottam, Paerels and Mendez has
          triggered  theoretical  studies  of  the physics of atomic line
          formation  in  NS  atmospheres.  Chang,  Bildsten and Wasserman
          showed  that  the hydrogenic Fe H$\alpha$ line formed above the
          photosphere  of  a  bursting  NS is intrinsically broad. We now
          include  rotational  broadening  within  general relativity and
          compare  the  resulting  profile to that observed during Type I
          bursts  from  EXO  0748-676.  We  show  that the fine structure
          splitting  of the line precludes a meaningful constraint on the
          radius.  Our  fitting of the data show that the line forming Fe
          column    is    ${\rm    log}_{10}    (N_{\rm   Fe,   n=2}/{\rm
          cm^{-2}})=17.9_{-0.42}^{+0.27}$ and gravitational redshift $1+z
          =1.345_{-0.008}^{+0.005}$ with 95% confidence. We calculate the
          detectability  of  this  spectral  feature for a large range of
          spins  and  inclinations  assuming that the emission comes from
          the  entire  surface.  We find that at 300 (600) Hz only 10-20%
          (5-10%)  of  NSs  would  have spectral features as deep as that
          seen in EXO 0748-676.

          Title:  Exposing  the Nuclear Burning Ashes of Radius Expansion
          Type I X-ray Bursts
          Authors:  Nevin  N.  Weinberg  (Caltech,  KITP),  Lars Bildsten
          (KITP, UCSB), Hendrik Schatz (MSU, JINA)
          Comments: 15 pages, 15 figures (emulateapj), accepted to ApJ
          We  solve  for  the  evolution  of  the  vertical extent of the
          convective  region of a neutron star atmosphere during a Type I
          X-ray  burst. The convective region is well-mixed with ashes of
          nuclear  burning and its extent determines the rise time of the
          burst  light  curve.  Using a full nuclear reaction network, we
          show  that the maximum vertical extent of the convective region
          during   photospheric  radius  expansion  (RE)  bursts  can  be
          sufficiently  great that: (1) some ashes of burning are ejected
          by  the radiation driven wind during the RE phase and, (2) some
          ashes  of  burning  are  exposed  at  the  neutron star surface
          following the RE phase. We find that ashes with mass number A ~
          30  -  60  are mixed in with the ejected material. We calculate
          the  expected  column  density  of ejected and surface ashes in
          hydrogen-like states and determine the equivalent widths of the
          resulting  photoionization edges from both the wind and neutron
          star  surface.  We  find  that  these can exceed 100 eV and are
          potentially  detectable.  A  detection  would probe the nuclear
          burning processes and might enable a measurement of the neutron
          star  gravitational  redshift.  In  addition,  we  find that in
          bursts with pure helium burning layers, protons from (alpha, p)
          reactions  cause  a  rapid onset of the 12C(p, gamma)13N(alpha,
          p)16O  reaction  sequence. The sequence bypasses the relatively
          slow  12C(alpha, gamma)16O reaction and leads to a sudden surge
          in  energy production that is directly observable as a rapid (~
          ms) increase in flux during burst rise.

          Title:  Fluctuations  along Velocity Coordinate: Statistics and
          Effects of Absorption
          Authors: A. Lazarian, D. Pogosyan
          Comments: 31 page, 1 figure
          We  discuss  statistics of Doppler-broadened spectral lines, in
          particular,     the     statistics     of    fluctuations    in
          Position-Position-Velocity data cub along the velocity axis. We
          show  that absorption substantially changes the long wavelength
          statistics of fluctuations compared to the optically thin case.
          At  the  same time, short-wavelength asymptotic is not affected
          by  absorption and remains power-law. We consider both the case
          of  high  spatial  resolution  and  the  case  of  poor spatial
          resolution  and  discuss  the retrieval of power-law indexes of
          velocity and density spectra. This provides a new technique for
          studies of turbulence from observations. A big advantage of the
          technique  is  that studies of turbulence can accomplished even
          when spatial resolution of the turbulent volume is poor.

          Using   the   Florida   Multi-object   Imaging   Near-IR  grism
          Observational  Spectrometer  (FLAMINGOS), we have conducted the
          FLAMINGOS  Extragalactic Survey (FLAMEX), a deep imaging survey
          covering  7.1  square degrees within the 18.6 sq. deg NOAO Deep
          Wide-Field  Survey  (NDWFS)  regions. FLAMEX is the first deep,
          wide-area  near-infrared  survey  to image in both the J and Ks
          filters,  and  is  larger  than  any  previous  NIR  surveys of
          comparable  depth.  The  intent  of FLAMEX is to facilitate the
          study  of  galaxy  and  galaxy  cluster  evolution  at 1<z<2 by
          providing  rest-frame optical photometry for the massive galaxy
          population  at  this  epoch. This effort is designed to yield a
          public  data  set  that  complements  and augments the suite of
          existing surveys in the NDWFS fields. We present an overview of
          FLAMEX  and  initial  results  based  upon ~150,000 Ks-selected

          We  present data obtained with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC)
          aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer) for a sample of 74
          young  (t  <  30 Myr old) Sun-like (0.7 < M(star)/M(Sun) < 1.5)
          stars.  These  are  a sub-set of the observations that comprise
          the  Spitzer  Legacy science program entitled the Formation and
          Evolution  of Planetary Systems (FEPS). Using IRAC we study the
          fraction  of  young  stars that exhibit 3.6-8.0 micron infrared
          emission   in   excess   of  that  expected  from  the  stellar
          photosphere,  as  a  function  of  age  from 3-30 Myr. The most
          straightforward  interpretation  of such excess emission is the
          presence  of hot (300-1000K) dust in the inner regions (< 3 AU)
          of  a circumstellar disk. Five out of the 74 young stars show a
          strong  infrared  excess,  four of which have estimated ages of
          3-10  Myr.  While  we  detect  excesses  from 5 optically thick
          disks,  and  photospheric  emission  from  the remainder of our
          sample,  we  do  not  detect any excess emission from optically
          thin  disks  at  these wavelengths. We compare our results with
          accretion  disk fractions detected in previous studies, and use
          the  ensemble  results  to  place additional constraints on the
          dissipation timescales for optically-thick, primordial disks.

          We  use  HST/ACS  imaging of 100 early-type galaxies in the ACS
          Virgo  Cluster Survey to investigate the nature of diffuse star
          clusters  (DSCs).  Compared  to  globular clusters (GCs), these
          star clusters have moderately low luminosities (M_V > -8) and a
          broad  distribution  of  sizes  (3 < r_h < 30 pc), but they are
          principally   characterized   by   their   low   mean   surface
          brightnesses  which  can  be more than three magnitudes fainter
          than  a typical GC (mu_g > 20 mag arcsec^-2). The median colors
          of diffuse star cluster systems are red, 1.1 < g-z < 1.6, which
          is  redder  than  metal-rich GCs and often as red as the galaxy
          itself.  Most  DSC systems thus have mean ages older than 5 Gyr
          or  else  have  super-solar  metallicities.  We  find  that  12
          galaxies  in our sample contain a significant excess of diffuse
          star cluster candidates -- nine are lenticulars (S0s), and five
          visibly  contain dust. We also find a substantial population of
          DSCs  in  the halo of the giant elliptical M49, associated with
          the  companion  galaxy  VCC 1199. Most DSC systems appear to be
          both aligned with the galaxy light and associated with galactic
          disks,  but  at  the  same  time  many  lenticulars do not host
          substantial  DSC  populations.  Diffuse  star  clusters  in our
          sample  share  similar  characteristics  to those identified in
          other  nearby  lenticular,  spiral,  and dwarf galaxies, and we
          suggest  that  DSCs  preferentially form, survive, and coevolve
          with  galactic  disks.  Their properties are broadly consistent
          with  those  of merged star cluster complexes, and we note that
          despite   being   3   -   5   magnitudes  brighter  than  DSCs,
          ultra-compact  dwarfs  have  similar  surface brightnesses. The
          closest Galactic analogs to the DSCs are the old open clusters.
          We  suggest that if a diffuse star cluster population did exist
          in  the  disk  of  the Milky Way, it would be very difficult to
          find. (Abridged)

          Title:   The   baseline   intracluster   entropy  profile  from
          gravitational structure formation
          Authors: G. Mark Voit, Scott T. Kay, Greg L. Bryan
          Comments: Accepted to MNRAS, 8 pages, 9 figures
          The  radial  entropy  profile  of  the  hot  gas in clusters of
          galaxies  tends  to follow a power law in radius outside of the
          cluster  core. Here we present a simple formula giving both the
          normalization  and  slope for the power-law entropy profiles of
          clusters   that   form  in  the  absence  of  non-gravitational
          processes such as radiative cooling and subsequent feedback. It
          is  based  on  seventy-one  clusters  drawn  from four separate
          cosmological    simulations,    two   using   smoothed-particle
          hydrodynamics  (SPH)  and  two  using  adaptive-mesh refinement
          (AMR),  and  can be used as a baseline for assessing the impact
          of  non-gravitational  processes  on  the  intracluster  medium
          outside  of cluster cores. All the simulations produce clusters
          with  self-similar  structure in which the normalization of the
          entropy  profile  scales linearly with cluster temperature, and
          these profiles are in excellent agreement outside of 0.2 r_200.
          Because  the observed entropy profiles of clusters do not scale
          linearly    with   temperature,   our   models   confirm   that
          non-gravitational   processes   are   necessary  to  break  the
          self-similarity  seen  in  the  simulations.  However, the core
          entropy  levels  found by the two codes used here significantly
          differ,  with  the  AMR  code  producing  nearly  twice as much
          entropy at the centre of a cluster.

          publication in MNRAS
          We  compare  the  gas  distribution, kinematics and the current
          star  formation  in  a  sample of 10 very faint (-13.37 < M_B <
          -9.55)  dwarf  galaxies.  For  5  of  these galaxies we present
          fresh, high sensitivity, GMRT HI 21cm observations. For all our
          galaxies  we  construct  maps  of  the  HI  column density at a
          constant  linear resolution of ~300 pc; this forms an excellent
          data  set  to  check  for  the  presence  of a threshold column
          density  for  star  formation.  We find that while current star
          formation (as traced by Halpha emission) is confined to regions
          with  relatively  large  (N_HI  >  (0.4  -1.7)  X 10^{21} atoms
          cm^{-2})  HI  column  density,  the  morphology  of  the Halpha
          emission  is in general not correlated with that of the high HI
          column  density gas. Thus, while high column density gas may be
          necessary  for  star  formation, in this sample at least, it is
          not  sufficient  to  ensure  that  star  formation does in fact
          occur.  We examine the line profiles of the HI emission, but do
          not  find  a  simple relation between regions with complex line
          profiles  and  those  with on-going star formation. Finally, we
          examine the very fine scale (~20-100 pc) distribution of the HI
          gas,  and  find  that  at  these scales the emission exhibits a
          variety  of  shell  like,  clumpy and filamentary features. The
          Halpha  emission  is  sometimes associated with high density HI
          clumps,  sometimes  the  Halpha  emission  lies  inside  a high
          density shell, and sometimes there is no correspondence between
          the  Halpha  emission  and  the  HI  clumps.  In  summary,  the
          interplay  between  star  formation  and  gas  density in these
          galaxy  does  not  seem to show the simple large scale patterns
          observed in brighter galaxies (abridged).

          Title: The Local Rate and the Progenitor Lifetime of Short-Hard
          Gamma-Ray Bursts: Synthesis and Predictions for LIGO
          Authors: Ehud Nakar, Avishay Gal-Yam, Derek B. Fox
          The  properties  of the short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) with
          known  host-galaxies  suggest  that  these events result from a
          long-lived progenitor system. The most popular progenitor model
          of  SHBs invokes the merger of either double neutron star (DNS)
          binaries  or  neutron  star-black  hole  (NS-BH)  systems. Such
          events  produce  strong  gravitational waves (GWs) at frequency
          range   that  is  accessible  to  current  and  next-generation
          ground-based  GW  observatories.  In  this  work we combine the
          census of SHB observations with refined theoretical analysis to
          critically  evaluate  the  compact  binary progenitor model. We
          then explore the implications for GW detection of these events.
          Beginning  from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic
          time,  we  consider  what  intrinsic  luminosity  and  lifetime
          distributions  can  reproduce  both the known SHB redshifts and
          luminosities, and the peak flux distribution of the large BATSE
          SHB  sample.  We  find  that (1) Short progenitor lifetimes, <3
          Gyr,  are ruled out, and lifetimes of about 6 Gyr favored. This
          result  is  difficult to reconcile with the observed properties
          of  the  DNS  population  in  our  galaxy. We show that for DNS
          systems to remain viable SHB progenitors, a large population of
          old  undetectable  NS  binaries must be postulated. (2) We find
          that  the  local  rate  of SHBs is at least 10 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 and
          likely as high as 10^5 Gpc^-3 yr-1, significantly above earlier
          estimates.  (3)  We find that assuming that SHBs do result from
          compact   binaries,  either  through  the  old  DNS  population
          mentioned   above   or   from   NS-BH  mergers,  our  resulting
          predictions  for the LIGO event rate are extremely encouraging:
          several   detections   per  year  may  be  expected  at  design
          sensitivity,   and   the   first   coincident   observation  of
          electromagnetic  and  gravitational  radiation  from an SHB may
          well be made with current facilities.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          The  1<z<2 redshift window hosts the peak of the star formation
          and metal production rates. Studies of the metal content of the
          star  forming  galaxies  at these epochs are however sparse. We
          report  VLT-ISAAC  near-infrared  spectroscopy  for a sample of
          five  [OII]-selected, M_B,AB<-21.5, z~1.4 galaxies, by which we
          measured  Hbeta and [OIII]5007 emission line fluxes from J-band
          spectra, and Halpha line fluxes plus upper limits for [NII]6584
          fluxes   from   H-band   spectra.   The   z~1.4   galaxies  are
          characterized   by  the  high  [OIII]/[OII]  line  ratios,  low
          extinction  and  low  metallicity  that  are  typical  of lower
          luminosity  CADIS  galaxies  at 0.4<z<0.7, and of more luminous
          Lyman  Break  Galaxies at z~3, but not seen in CFRS galaxies at
          0.4<z<0.9.  This  type of spectrum (e.g., high [OIII]/[OII]) is
          seen  in  progressively  more luminous galaxies as the redshift
          increases.  These  spectra  are caused by a combination of high
          ionisation  parameter  q  and  lower  [O/H].  Pegase2  chemical
          evolution  models are used to relate the observed metallicities
          and  luminosities  of z~1.4 galaxies to galaxy samples at lower
          and  higher redshift. Not surpringsingly, we see a relationship
          between redshift and inferred chemical age. We suppose that the
          metal-enriched  reservoirs  of  star  forming  gas  that we are
          probing  at intermediate redshifts are being mostly consumed to
          build  up  both  the  disk  and  the bulge components of spiral
          galaxies.  Finally,  our analysis of the metallicity-luminosity
          relation  at 0<z<1.5 suggests that the period of rapid chemical
          evolution may take place progressively in lower mass systems as
          the   universe  ages.  These  results  are  consistent  with  a
          ``downsizing''  type  picture  in  the  sense  that  particular
          signatures  (e.g.,  high [OIII]/[OII] or low [O/H]) are seen in
          progressively   more   luminous  (massive)  systems  at  higher
          redshifts.

          Title: The Initial Mass Function as given by the fragmentation

          Journal-ref: Astronomische Nachrichten (2005), 326,754
          The  dichotomy  between  a  universal mass function (IMF) and a
          variable   IMF  which  depends  on  local  physical  parameters
          characterises  observational and theoretical stellar astronomy.
          In this contribution the available distributions of probability
          are briefly reviewed. The physical nature of two of them, gamma
          variate  and lognormal, is then explained once the framework of
          the  fragmentation  is introduced. Interpolating techniques are
          then  applied  to the sample of the first 10 pc and to the open
          cluster  NGC6649: in both cases lognormal distribution produces
          the  best  fit.  The  three  power  law  function has also been
          investigated   and   visual  comparison  with  an  artificially
          generated  sample  of 100000 stars suggests that the variations
          in  the  spectral  index  are simply due to the small number of
          stars available in the observational sample. In order to derive
          the  sample  of masses, a new formula that allows us to express
          the  mass as a function of the absolute magnitude and (B-V) for
          MAIN V, GIANTS III and SUPERGIANTS I is derived.

          clouds

          Observations", Leuven, Belgium, September 12-16, 2005
          The  most  geoeffective  solar  drivers are magnetic clouds - a
          subclass of coronal mass ejections (CME's) distinguished by the
          smooth rotation of the magnetic field inside the structure. The
          portion of CME's that are magnetic clouds is maximum at sunspot
          minimum  and  mimimum  at  sunspot  maximum.  This  portion  is
          determined  by  the  amount  of  helicity carried away by CME's
          which  in  turn  depends  on the amount of helicity transferred
          from  the  solar  interior  to  the surface, and on the surface
          differential  rotation.  The  latter can increase or reduce, or
          even  reverse  the  twist of emerging magnetic flux tubes, thus
          increasing  or  reducing the helicity in the corona, or leading
          to   the   violation   of   the   hemispheric   helicity  rule,
          respectively.  We  investigate  the  CME's  associated with the
          major  geomagnetic  storms  in the last solar cycle whose solar
          sources  have  been  identified,  and find that in 10 out of 12
          cases  of  violation  of  the  hemispheric  helicity rule or of
          highly geoeffective CME's with no magnetic field rotation, they
          originate  from  regions  with  "anti-solar"  type  of  surface
          differential rotation.

          We review the main properties, demographics and applications of
          binary  and  millisecond  radio pulsars. Our knowledge of these
          exciting  objects has greatly increased in recent years, mainly
          due  to  successful surveys which have brought the known pulsar
          population   to   over  1700.  There  are  now  80  binary  and
          millisecond pulsars associated with the disk of our Galaxy, and
          a  further 103 pulsars in 24 of the Galactic globular clusters.
          Recent  highlights  have  been  the discovery of the first ever
          double  pulsar  system  and  a  recent flurry of discoveries in
          globular clusters, in particular Terzan 5.

          Title: Can brane dark energy model be probed observationally by
          distant supernovae?
          Authors: Marek Szydlowski, Wlodzimierz Godlowski
          Comments: 14 pages 7 figures
          The  recent  astronomical measurements of distant supernovae as
          well  as  other  observations  indicate  that  our  universe is
          presently  accelerating.  There are different proposals for the
          explanation  of  this  acceleration.  Most  of  these proposals
          require  the  existence of exotic matter with negative pressure
          violating the strong energy condition. On the other hand, there
          have  appeared  many  models which offer dramatically different
          mechanism  for  the  current acceleration, in which dark energy
          emerges  from  the  gravity  sector rather than from the matter
          sector.  In this paper, we compare the concordance $\Lambda$CDM
          model with the braneworld models of dark energy by using Akaike
          and  Bayesian  informative critera. We show that, although this
          model  has  extra  parameters (the fundamental constants of the
          bulk  space)  resulting  in  an  improved fit to the SNIa data,
          these new parameters are actually not important for description
          of   present  acceleration  epoch.  With  the  example  of  the
          Sahni--Shtanov    braneworld    model    \cite{Shtanov03},   we
          demonstrate  that,  although  this  model has better fit to the
          SNIa data than $\Lambda$CDM model, the information criterion of
          model selection prefers the $\Lambda$CDM model. This is because
          the informative criteria of model selection compensate for this
          advantage  by penalizing models having more free parameters. We
          conclude  that  only new future observational data are powerful
          enough  to  give  advantage to dark-energy models of braneworld
          origin, i.e., a very high-significance detection is required to
          justify the presence of new parameters.

          Title:  Weak  redshift  discretisation  in  the  Local Group of

          We  discuss  the  distribution of radial velocities of galaxies
          belonging  to  the  Local  Group.  Two  independent  samples of
          galaxies  as  well  as  several  methods  of reduction from the
          heliocentric   to  the  galactocentric  radial  velocities  are
          explored. We applied the power spectrum analysis using the Hann
          function  as  a  weighting  method, together with the jackknife
          error  estimation.  We  performed  a  detailed analysis of this
          approach.  The  distribution  of  galaxy  redshifts seems to be
          non-random.  An  excess  of  galaxies with radial velocities of
          $\sim 24 {km} \cdot {s}^{-1}$ and $\sim 36 {km} \cdot {s}^{-1}$
          is  detected,  but  the  effect is statistically weak. Only one
          peak  for  radial  velocities  of $\sim 24 {km} \cdot {s}^{-1}$
          seems to be confirmed at the confidence level of 95%.

          We  present  7  mm and 3.5 cm wavelength continuum observations
          toward  the  Herbig  AeBe star HD169142 performed with the Very
          Large  Array  (VLA)  with an angular resolution of ~1". We find
          that this object exhibits strong (~4.4 mJy), unresolved (~1") 7
          mm  continuum  emission,  being  one  of the brightest isolated
          Herbig   AeBe   stars  ever  detected  with  the  VLA  at  this
          wavelength. No emission is detected at 3.5 cm continuum, with a
          3  sigma upper limit of ~0.08 mJy. From these values, we obtain
          a  spectral  index  of  ~2.5  in  the 3.5 cm to 7 mm wavelength
          range, indicating that the observed flux density at 7mm is most
          likely  dominated  by  thermal  dust  emission  coming  from  a
          circumstellar  disc. We use available photometric data from the
          literature  to  model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
          this  object  from  radio  to near-ultraviolet frequencies. The
          observed  SED  can  be  understood  in  terms  of an irradiated
          accretion  disc  with  low  mass  accretion rate, 10^{-8} solar
          masses  per year, surrounding a star with an age of ~10 Myr. We
          infer  that  the mass of the disc is ~0.04 solar masses, and is
          populated by dust grains that have grown to a maximum size of 1
          mm everywhere, consistent with the lack of silicate emission at
          10  microns. These features, as well as indications of settling
          in the wall at the dust destruction radius, led us to speculate
          the disc of HD169142 is in an advanced stage of dust evolution,
          particularly in its inner regions.

          In this paper another class of Dark Matter candidate particles:
          the  pseudoscalar  and  scalar  light  bosonic  candidates,  is
          discussed.  Particular  care  is  devoted  to  the study of the
          processes  for  their  detection (which only involves electrons
          and  photons/X-rays)  in  a  suitable  underground experimental
          set-up.  For this purpose the needed calculations are developed
          and  various related aspects and phenomenologies are discussed.
          In particular, it is shown that - in addition to the WIMP cases
          already  discussed  elsewhere - there is also possibility for a
          bosonic  candidate  to  account  for  the  6.3 sigma C.L. model
          independent   evidence  for  the  presence  of  a  particle  DM
          component  in  the  galactic halo observed by DAMA/NaI. Allowed
          regions in these scenarios are presented also paying particular
          care on the cosmological interest of the bosonic candidate.

          Title:  Central  energy  equipartition  in multi-mass models of
          globular clusters
          Authors: P. Miocchi (Universita' di Roma "La Sapienza", Dip. di
          Fisica, Rome, Italy)
          Comments:  LaTeX  2e,  9  pages  with  7  figures. Accepted for
          publication in MNRAS
          In   the  construction  of  multi-mass  King-Michie  models  of
          globular clusters, an approximated central energy equipartition
          between stars of different masses is usually imposed by scaling
          the  velocity  parameter  of each mass class inversely with the
          stellar  mass, as if the distribution function were isothermal.
          In  this  paper,  this 'isothermal approximation' (IA) has been
          checked and its consequences on the model parameters studied by
          a comparison with models including central energy equipartition
          correctly.  It  is found that, under the IA, the 'temperatures'
          of  a  pair of components can differ to a non-negligible amount
          for  low concentration distributions. It is also found that, in
          general,  this  approximation  leads to a significantly reduced
          mass  segregation in comparison with that given under the exact
          energy   equipartition  at  the  centre.  As  a  representative
          example,   an  isotropic  3-component  model  fitting  a  given
          projected   surface   brightness   and  line-of-sight  velocity
          dispersion profiles is discussed. In this example, the IA gives
          a    cluster   envelope   much   more   concentrated   (central
          dimensionless    potential   W=3.3)   than   under   the   true
          equipartition  (W=0.059),  as well as a higher logarithmic mass
          function  slope. As a consequence, the inferred total mass (and
          then the global mass-to-light ratio) results a factor 1.4 times
          lower  than  the  correct value and the amount of mass in heavy
          dark remnants is 3.3 times smaller. Under energy equipartition,
          the  fate  of  stars  having a mass below a certain limit is to
          escape  from the system. This limit is derived as a function of
          the mass and W of the giants and turn-off stars component.

          Title:  Astrometric  Light-Travel  Time signature of sources in
          nonlinear motion
          Authors: Guillem Anglada, Jordi Torra
          Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures
          Context:Very  precise  planned  space  astrometric missions and
          recent  improvements on imaging capabilities require a detailed
          review of the assumptions of classical astrometric modeling.
          Aims:We  show that Light-Travel Time must be taken into account
          to  model  the  kinematics of astronomical objects in nonlinear
          motion, even at stellar distances.
          Methods:A closed expression to include Light-Travel Time in the
          actual  astrometric  models  with nonlinear motion is provided.
          Using   a   perturbative   approach   the   expression  of  the
          Light-Travel  Time signature is derived. We propose a practical
          form  of the astrometric modelling to be applied in astrometric
          data reduction of sources at stellar distances($d>1 pc$).
          Results  :We  show  that  the  Light-Travel  Time  signature is
          relevant  at  $\muas$  accuracy (or even at $mas$) depending on
          the  time  span of the astrometric measurements. We explain how
          information  about  the  radial  motion  of  a  source  can  be
          obtained. Some estimative numbers are provided for known nearby
          binary systems
          Conclusions  :In the light of the obtained results, it is clear
          that  this  effect  must be taken into account to interpret any
          kind   of  precise  astrometric  measurements.  The  effect  is
          particularly  interesting  in  measurements  performed  by  the
          planned   astrometric   space  missions  (GAIA,  SIM,  JASMINE,
          TPF/DARWIN).  Finally  an  objective  criterion  is provided to
          quickly  evaluate  whether  the  Light-Travel  Time modeling is
          required for a given source or system.

          Title:  Influence of gravity waves on the internal rotation and
          Li abundance of solar-type stars
          Authors: Corinne Charbonnel, Suzanne Talon
          Comments:  Published  in Science, Vol.309, p.2189, 30 September
          2005. pdf only
          The  Sun's  rotation  profile  and  lithium  content  have been
          difficult  to  understand in the context of conventional models
          of  stellar  evolution. Classical hydrodynamical models predict
          that  the  solar interior must rotate highly differentially, in
          disagreement with observations. It has recently been shown that
          internal  waves  produced  by  convection  in  solar-type stars
          produce  an  asymmetric,  shear  layer  oscillation, similar to
          Earth's  quasi-biennial  oscillation,  that  leads to efficient
          angular  momentum redistribution from the core to the envelope.
          We  presents  results  of  a model that successfully reproduces
          both  the rotation profile and the surface abundance of lithium
          in solar-type stars of various ages.

          The   low   background,   good  spatial  resolution  and  great
          sensitivity  of  the  EPIC-pn  camera on XMM-Newton give useful
          limits  for  the  detection of extended sources even during the

          we  attempt  to illustrate the potential of the XMM-Newton slew
          survey as a tool for analysing flux-limited samples of clusters
          of  galaxies  and  other  sources  of  spatially extended X-ray
          emission.

          The  Global  mm-VLBI  Array  is at present the most sensitive 3
          mm-VLBI   interferometer  and  provides  images  of  up  to  40
          micro-arcsecond resolution. Using this array, we have monitored
          the rotation of the innermost jet in the quasar NRAO 150, which
          shows an angular speed of ~ 7 deg./yr. Future 3 mm arrays could
          include  additional  stations  like ALMA, GBT, LMT, CARMA, SRT,
          Yebes,  Nobeyama  and  Noto,  which would allow to push VLBI at
          this   wavelength  to  sensitivity  and  image  quality  levels
          comparable  to those of present VLBI at centimeter wavelengths.
          This  would  improve our knowledge of the accretion systems and
          the  magneto-hydrodynamics  of  the  innermost  jets in AGN and
          microquasars.

          velocity: possible links with Be and B[e] stars

          Comments: 11 pages, 13 figures, Stars with the B[e] phenomenon,
          M. Kraus and A. Miroshnichenko, ASP Conference Series, in press
          Using  single  star  models  including the effects of shellular
          rotation with and without magnetic fields, we show that massive
          stars at solar metallicity with initial masses lower than about
          20-25  M$_\odot$  and with an initial rotation above $\sim 350$
          km  s$^{-1}$  likely  reach  the critical velocity during their
          Main-Sequence  phase.  This results from the efficient outwards
          transport  of  angular  momentum by the meridional circulation.
          This could be a scenario for explaining the Be stars. After the
          Main-Sequence  phase,  single star in this mass range can again
          reach  the  critical limit when they are on a blue loop after a
          red supergiant phase \citep{HL98}. This might be a scenario for
          the  formation  of B[e] stars, however as discussed by Langer &
          Heger  (1998),  this  scenario would predict a short B[e] phase
          (only  some 10$^4$ years) with correspondingly small amounts of
          mass lost.

          We  present the spectral and temporal analysis of the 2004/2005
          outburst  of  the  transient  X-ray pulsar V0332+53 as observed
          with  Integral. After the discovery of the third cyclotron line
          in  phase averaged spectra (Kreykenbohm et al 2005, Pottschmidt
          et   al  2005),  detailed  pulse  phase  spectroscopy  revealed
          remarkably  little  variability  of the cyclotron lines through
          the  4.4s  X-ray  pulse  (Pottschmidt  et  al 2005). During the
          decline  of  the  outburst,  the  flux  was  observed  to decay
          exponentially  until  2005  Feb 10 and linearly thereafter. The
          spectrum  was  found  to  become  harder  with  time, while the
          folding energy remained constant. The energy of the fundamental
          cyclotron  line  increased  with  time from 26.5kev in the RXTE
          observation  up  to 29.5kev in the last Integral one indicating
          that the emission region is moving closer to the surface of the
          neutron  star.  For  a  detailed  analysis,  see  Mowlavi et al

          of classical GRBs, whereas the peak energy is lower by a factor
          of  4  for  the  XRRs/XRFs.  We  study  the  optical  and X-Ray
          afterglow  properties  of  the  XRRs/XRFs;  in  particular  XRR
          011030. We find that the X-ray and optical flux distribution of
          the  XRRs/XRFs  sample,  observed 40 ks from burst trigger, are
          consistent  with those of classical GRBs. We find also that the
          XRRs/XRFs  lightcurves  seems to be similar to the GRB ones. In
          addition,  they  never  show  a  rising slope at early time. We
          compare  this  result  with  the  afterglow  predictions of two
          models : the high redshift scenario, and the off-axis scenario.
          In  this last framework, we consider jets with a homogeneous, a
          -2   power-law   shaped   and  a  Gaussian  luminosity  angular
          distribution.  We  find  that  the  high  redshift scenario can
          explain  some events but not the total sample of XRRs/XRFs. The
          off-axis model may be consistent with our foundings only when a
          power-law   shaped   jet  is  considered.  However,  given  the
          uncertainties  on  the  selection  effects  in  our sample, the
          Gaussian  jet  viewed  at  small  angles from the Gaussian core
          cannot  be  ruled  out.  On the contrary, our analysis strongly
          disfavored a homogeneous jet seen off-axis.

          Title: X-ray populations in galaxies
          Authors: G. Fabbiano
          Comments:  This  is  a  review  talk,to  be  published  in  the
          proceedings  of  the  IAU  Symposium  230,  Populations of high
          energy  sources  in  galaxies, held in Dublin (Ireland), August
          15-19, 2005
          Today's  sensistive, high resolution Chandra X-ray observations
          allow  the  study  of  many  populations  of X-ray sources. The
          traditional  astronomical  tools  of  photometric  diagrams and
          luminosity  functions are now applied to these populations, and
          provide the means for classifying the X-ray sources and probing
          their  evolution.  While overall stellar mass drives the amount
          of  X-ray  binaries  in  old  stellar population, the amount of
          sources  in  star-forming  galaxies  is  related  to  the  star
          formation  rate.  Shart-lived,  luminous,  high  mass  binaries
          (HNXBs) dominate these young populations.

          Title: Collective Neutrino Flavor Transformation In Supernovae
          Authors:   Huaiyu   Duan   (UCSD),  George  M.  Fuller  (UCSD),
          Yong-Zhong Qian (UMN)
          Comments: 16 pages, 9 figures
          We   examine   the  coherent  active-active  channel  nonlinear
          neutrino  flavor  evolution  in  the post-core-bounce supernova
          environment. We improve on the previous spin precession analogy
          to  neutrino  oscillation,  and propose the concept of neutrino
          flavor isospin, which treats neutrinos and anti-neutrinos on an
          equal  footing.  We  point  out  a  key conserved quantity, the
          "total  effective energy". This conservation condition suggests
          a  simple explanation for previous numerical results. We employ
          a  co-rotating  frame  in  the  spin precession picture to gain
          physical  insights into the collective behaviors of this system
          when  neutrino-neutrino  forward  scattering dominates the weak
          potentials which govern flavor conversion. We also use the spin
          precession analogy to analyze previously-derived limits for the
          behavior  of supernova neutrinos, e.g., the Background Dominant
          Solution, and we speculate on how such solutions could arise in
          realistic supernova environments.

          Title: Investigating Galaxy Evolution with Chandra
          Authors: G. Fabbiano
          Comments:  To  be  included  in  the  proceedings of the 'X-ray
          universe  2005  meeting'  held  in  San  Lorenzo de El Escorial
          (Spain), 26-30 Sep 2005
          Chandra  observations show the importance of the X-ray band for
          studying the evolution of galaxies. Binary X-ray sources are an
          easily  detectable  tracer  of  the stellar population. Chandra
          studies  of  these  populations are giving us insights into the
          nature  and  formation of these binaries, and provide the basis
          for   diagnostics   of   galaxy  evolution.  With  Chandra  and
          XMM-Newton  we  can  explore relatively poorly known aspects of
          the black hole population of the universe: ultra-luminous X-ray
          sources,  that may be connected with the 'missing' intermediate
          mass  black  holes  predicted  by hierarchical galaxy and black
          hole  formation  scenarios;  and quiescent supermassive nuclear
          black  holes and their surroundings, as a way to understand the
          full  range  of  the  AGN  phenomenon.  Finally, the X-ray band
          provides  the  only  way  to  explore  hot plasmas in galaxies;
          recent  observations  are  revealing  the  importance  of these
          plasmas as vehicles of both chemical enrichment and energy.

          Comments: 4 pages, 3 ps figures
          Nearby  sources  of cosmic rays up to a ZeV(=10^21 eV) could be
          observed  with  a  multi-messenger approach including secondary
          gamma-rays  and  neutrinos.  If cosmic rays above ~10^18 eV are
          produced  in  magnetized  environments such as galaxy clusters,
          the  flux  of secondary gamma-rays below ~1 TeV can be enhanced
          up  to  several  orders  of magnitudes compared to unmagnetized
          sources. A particular source of enhancement are synchrotron and
          cascade  photons  from  e^+e^-  pairs  produced by protons from
          sources with relatively steep injection spectra proportional to
          E^-2.6.  Such  sources  should  be  visible at the same time in
          ultra-high   energy   cosmic   ray  experiments  and  gamma-ray
          telescopes.

          Comments:  2  pages,  2  figures,  ULMSF Workshop, accepted for
          publication in Astron. Nachrichten
          We  present  results  of  an optical and near-infrared (IR) 1.8
          deg^2  survey  in  the  Pleiades  open  cluster  to  search for
          substellar  objects.  From  optical I-band images from the CFHT
          and J-band images from the 3.5 m CAHA Telescope, we identify 18
          faint  and  very red L brown dwarf candidates, with I> 20.9 and
          I-J>  3.2. The follow-up observations of nine objects in the H-
          and  Ks-bands  confirm  that eight belong to the IR sequence of
          the  cluster  and  the  proper  motion  measurements  of  seven
          candidates   confirm   that   they   are  Pleiades  members.  A
          preliminary estimation of the substellar mass spectrum dN/dM in
          the  form of a power law M^-alpha provides alpha=0.57+-0.14. We
          extrapolate  this  function  to  estimate  the  number  of very
          low-mass  brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects that could be
          present  in  the  cluster  down  to 1 M_Jup. Sensitive searches
          combining  far  red  and  near infrared observations may unveal
          these objects in a near future.

          Title:  Size  and Properties of the NLR in the Seyfert-2 Galaxy

          Komossa  (MPE Garching), Martin Haas (Univ. Bochum), Rolf Chini
          (Univ. Bochum)
          Comments: 14 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          We  study  the narrow-line region (NLR) of the Seyfert-2 galaxy
          NGC 1386 by means of long-slit spectroscopy obtained with FORS1
          at  the  VLT.  We  use  the  galaxy  itself for subtracting the
          stellar  template,  applying  reddening  corrections to fit the
          stellar  template to the spectra of the NLR. The continuum gets
          steadily  redder  towards the nucleus. The spatial distribution
          of the reddening derived from the Balmer decrement differs from
          the  continuum reddening, indicating dust within the NLR with a
          varying column density along the line of sight. Using spatially
          resolved  spectral  diagnostics,  we  find a transition between
          central  line ratios falling into the AGN regime and outer ones
          in  the  HII-region  regime,  occuring at a radius of ~6 arcsec
          (310  pc)  in  all  three  diagnostic diagrams. Applying CLOUDY
          photoionisation  models,  we show that the observed distinction
          between  HII-like  and AGN-like ratios in NGC 1386 represents a
          true difference in ionisation source and cannot be explained by
          variations of physical parameters such as ionisation parameter,
          electron  density  or  metallicity.  We  interpret it as a real
          border  between  the  NLR,  i.e.  the  central AGN-photoionised
          region   and   surrounding   HII  regions.  We  derive  surface
          brightness,  electron  density,  and  ionisation parameter as a
          function  of  distance  from  the  nucleus.  Both  the electron
          density  and  the ionisation parameter decrease with radius. We
          discuss   the   consequences  of  these  observations  for  the
          interpretation  of  the empirical NLR size-luminosity relation.
          In  the  outer  part  of  the NLR, we find evidence for shocks,
          resulting  in  a  secondary  peak  of  the electron-density and
          ionisation-parameter  distribution  north  of  the  nucleus. We
          compare the NLR velocity curve with the stellar one and discuss
          the differences.

          Title: [OIII] profile substructure in radio-quiet quasars
          Authors:  Christian  Leipski  (Univ.  Bochum),  Nicola  Bennert
          (Univ. Bochum)
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Interactions  between the radio jet and the optical emission of
          the  narrow-line  region  (NLR)  are a well known phenomenon in
          Seyfert  galaxies.  Here,  we  present  the  study  of possible
          jet-NLR interactions in five radio-quiet PG quasars with double
          or triple radio structure. High spatial and spectral resolution
          observations   were   carried   out   in  the  Hbeta-[OIII]5007
          wavelength  range.  In  all cases, there is evidence for [OIII]
          profile    substructure   (shoulders,   subpeaks,   blueshifted
          ''broad''  components)  with  different clarity. To measure the
          velocity,  line  width, intensity, and location of these [OIII]
          components,   several   Gaussians   were   fitted.  Often,  the
          substructures  are  more  pronounced  close to the radio lobes,
          suggestive  of  jet-NLR  interactions. Our observations support
          the unification scheme in which radio-quiet quasars are assumed
          to be the luminous cousins of Seyfert galaxies.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in PASP
          We  present  optical  spectra  of  a  flare  on Barnard's star.
          Several  photospheric  as  well  as  chromospheric species were
          enhanced  by the flare heating. An analysis of the Balmer lines
          shows  that their shapes are best explained by Stark broadening
          rather   than  chromospheric  mass  motions.  We  estimate  the
          temperature of the flaring region in the lower atmosphere to be
          >8000  K and the electron density to be ~10^14 cm^{-3}, similar
          to  values  observed in other dM flares. Because Barnard's star
          is  considered  to  be  one of our oldest neighbors, a flare of
          this magnitude is probably quite rare.

          Comments:   27   pages,  7  figures,  2  tables;  Accepted  for
          publication in AJ
          In  order  to  examine  the  relative  importance  of  powerful
          starbursts and Compton-thick AGNs in NGC 6240, we have obtained
          mid-infrared  images  and  low-resolution spectra of the galaxy
          with   sub-arcsecond   spatial   resolution   using   the  Keck
          Telescopes.  Despite  the  high spatial resolution (~200 pc) of
          our  data, no signature of the hidden AGNs has been detected in
          the  mid-infrared. The southern nucleus, which we show provides
          80-90%  of  the  total  8-25 um luminosity of the system, has a
          mid-infrared  spectrum  and a mid-/far-infrared spectral energy
          distribution  consistent  with  starbursts.  At  the same time,
          however,  it  is  also  possible  to attribute up to 60% of the
          bolometric   luminosity   to  an  AGN,  consistent  with  X-ray
          observations,  if  the AGN is heavily obscured and emits mostly
          in   the   far-infrared.  This  ambiguity  arises  because  the
          intrinsic   variation   of  properties  among  a  given  galaxy
          population (e.g., starbursts) introduces at least a factor of a
          few   uncertainty  even  into  the  most  robust  AGN-starburst
          diagnostics.  We  conclude that with present observations it is
          not possible to determine the dominant power source in galaxies
          when  AGN  and  starburst luminosities are within a factor of a
          few of each other.

          http URL
          The  spectral energy distribution of the dark cloud LDN1622, as
          measured  by  Finkbeiner using WMAP data, drops above 30GHz and
          is   suggestive   of  a  Boltzmann  cutoff  in  grain  rotation
          frequencies, characteristic of spinning dust emission.
          LDN1622 is conspicuous in the 31 GHz image we obtained with the
          Cosmic  Background  Imager, which is the first cm-wave resolved
          image  of a dark cloud. The 31GHz emission follows the emission
          traced by the four IRAS bands. The normalised cross-correlation
          of  the 31 GHz image with the IRAS images is higher by 6.6sigma
          for  the 12um and 25um bands than for the 60um and 100um bands:
          C(12+25) = 0.76+/-0.02 and C(60+100) = 0.64+/-0.01.
          The  mid-IR  -- cm-wave correlation in LDN 1622 is evidence for
          very small grain (VSG) or continuum emission at 26-36GHz from a
          hot  molecular phase. In dark clouds and their photon-dominated
          regions  (PDRs)  the  12um  and  25um emission is attributed to
          stochastic  heating  of  the  VSGs. The mid-IR and cm-wave dust
          emissions  arise in a limb-brightened shell coincident with the
          PDR  of  LDN1622,  where the incident UV radiation from the Ori
          OB1b  association heats and charges the grains, as required for
          spinning dust.

          Title: Scalar-Tensor Gravitation and Cosmic Acceleration
          Authors: Sanil Unnikrishnan, T.R.Seshadri
          Comments: 9 pages, 2 figures, Submitted to Physics Letters B
          In  this  paper  we consider a model in which the gravitational
          ``constant''  $G$  is  determined by a tachyon-like field whose
          Lagrangian is of the form $\mathcal{L}_{\phi} = -V(\phi)\sqrt{1
          -  \partial_{\mu}\phi\partial^{\mu}\phi}$  and the potential is
          of  the  form  $  V(\phi)  =  \lambda \phi ^{-4}$. We study the
          cosmological consequence of this theory in the matter dominated
          era  and  show  that this leads to a transition from an initial
          decelerated  expansion to an accelerated expansion phase at the
          present epoch.

          is  interpreted  as  a  Quintessence field. Instead of that, in
          this  letter we interpret the dilaton as the dark matter of the
          universe.  With this alternative interpretation we find that in
          this  supergravity  model  the  dilaton  dominates the universe
          before  recombination.  We  also  show  that  the model gives a
          similar  evolution  and  structure  formation  of  the universe
          compared  with  the  $\Lambda$CDM model in the linear regime of
          fluctuations  of  the structure formation. Some free parameters
          of   the  theory  are  fixed  using  the  present  cosmological
          observations.   In   the  non-linear  regimen  there  are  some
          differences  between  the type IIB supergravity theory with the
          traditional  CDM paradigm. The supergravity theory predicts the
          formation  of  galaxies  earlier  than  the CDM and there is no
          density  cusp  in the center of galaxies. These differences can
          distinguish  both  models and can give a distinctive feature to
          the  phenomenology  of  the  cosmology  coming from superstring
          theory with fluxes.

          Title: The BATSE-Swift luminosity and redshift distributions of
          short-duration GRBs
          Authors: Dafne Guetta, Tsvi Piran
          We  compare  the luminosity function and rate inferred from the
          BATSE  short hard bursts (SHBs) peak flux distribution with the
          redshift  and  luminosity  distributions  of  SHBs  observed by
          Swift/HETE   II.   While   the  Swift/HETE  II  SHB  sample  is
          incompatible   with   SHB  population  that  follows  the  star
          formation rate, it is compatible with a SHB rate that reflect a
          distribution  of  delay  times after the SFR. This would be the
          case  if  SHBs are associated with binary neutron star mergers.
          The  available data allows, however, different interpretations.
          For  example,  a  population  whose  rate is independent of the
          redshift fits the data very well. The implied SHB rates that we
          find range from $\sim 8$ to $\sim
          30h_{70}^3$Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. This is a much higher rate than
          what  was previously estimated. A detailed (2 dimensional) look
          at the best fit models shows, however, some discrepancy between
          the four Swift/HETE II SHBs and the models based on BATSE SHBs.
          This  could  be  a  statistical fluke. It could also arise from
          wrong  estimates  of  the triggering criteria or from selection
          effects.  If  real  it  may  indicate  the existence of two SHB
          populations  with  different  luminosity functions and redshift
          distributions.

          Title:  Three-Body  Kick  to  a Bright Quasar out of Its Galaxy
          During a Merger
          Authors: Loren Hoffman, Abraham Loeb (Harvard U.)
          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Nature
          The  quasar HE0450-2958 was recently discovered to reside ~7kpc
          away  from  a  galaxy  that  was  likely  disturbed by a recent
          merger.  The  lack  of  a  massive spheroid of stars around the
          quasar  raised  the unlikely suggestion that it may have formed
          in  a  dark galaxy. Here we explain this discovery as a natural
          consequence  of  a  dynamical kick imparted to the quasar as it
          interacted  with  a  binary  black  hole system during a galaxy
          merger  event.  The  typical stalling radius (~1pc) for a ~10^9
          solar  mass binary provides a kick of order the escape velocity
          of  the stellar spheroid, bringing the quasar out to around the
          observed radius before it turns around. This is consistent with
          the  observed  low relative velocity between the quasar and the
          merger-remnant  galaxy.  The  gas  carried  with the black hole
          throughout  the three-body interaction fuels the quasar for the
          duration of its journey, ~2x10^7 years. Gravitational radiation
          recoil could not have produced the required kick.

          black hole from an ongoing merger of galaxies
          Authors:  Martin  G.  Haehnelt  (IoA), Melvyn B. Davies (Lund),
          Martin J. Rees (IoA)
          Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX, no figures; MNRAS in press
          Attempts  of  Magain  et al (2005) to detect the host galaxy of
          the  bright  QSO  HE0450--2958  have  not  been  successful. We
          suggest  that  the supermassive black hole powering the QSO was
          ejected from the observed ULIRG at the same redshift and at 1.5
          arcsec distance. Ejection could have either be caused by recoil
          due  to gravitational wave emission from a coalescing binary of
          supermassive  black  holes  or  the  gravitational slingshot of
          three or more supermassive black holes in the ongoing merger of
          galaxies  which  triggered the starburst activity in the ULIRG.
          We  discuss implications for the possible hierarchical build-up
          of  supermassive  black  holes from intermediate and/or stellar
          mass   black   holes,  and  for  the  detection  of  coalescing
          supermassive binary black holes by LISA.

          Title:  Rotational  Broadening of Atomic Spectral Features from
          Neutron Stars
          Authors: P. Chang, S. Morsink, L. Bildsten, I. Wasserman
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, to appear in ApJ Letters
          The  discovery of the first gravitationally redshifted spectral
          line from a neutron star (NS) by Cottam, Paerels and Mendez has
          triggered  theoretical  studies  of  the physics of atomic line
          formation  in  NS  atmospheres.  Chang,  Bildsten and Wasserman
          showed  that  the hydrogenic Fe H$\alpha$ line formed above the
          photosphere  of  a  bursting  NS is intrinsically broad. We now
          include  rotational  broadening  within  general relativity and
          compare  the  resulting  profile to that observed during Type I
          bursts  from  EXO  0748-676.  We  show  that the fine structure
          splitting  of the line precludes a meaningful constraint on the
          radius.  Our  fitting of the data show that the line forming Fe
          column    is    ${\rm    log}_{10}    (N_{\rm   Fe,   n=2}/{\rm
          cm^{-2}})=17.9_{-0.42}^{+0.27}$ and gravitational redshift $1+z
          =1.345_{-0.008}^{+0.005}$ with 95% confidence. We calculate the
          detectability  of  this  spectral  feature for a large range of
          spins  and  inclinations  assuming that the emission comes from
          the  entire  surface.  We find that at 300 (600) Hz only 10-20%
          (5-10%)  of  NSs  would  have spectral features as deep as that
          seen in EXO 0748-676.

          Title:  Exposing  the Nuclear Burning Ashes of Radius Expansion
          Type I X-ray Bursts
          Authors:  Nevin  N.  Weinberg  (Caltech,  KITP),  Lars Bildsten
          (KITP, UCSB), Hendrik Schatz (MSU, JINA)
          Comments: 15 pages, 15 figures (emulateapj), accepted to ApJ
          We  solve  for  the  evolution  of  the  vertical extent of the
          convective  region of a neutron star atmosphere during a Type I
          X-ray  burst. The convective region is well-mixed with ashes of
          nuclear  burning and its extent determines the rise time of the
          burst  light  curve.  Using a full nuclear reaction network, we
          show  that the maximum vertical extent of the convective region
          during   photospheric  radius  expansion  (RE)  bursts  can  be
          sufficiently  great that: (1) some ashes of burning are ejected
          by  the radiation driven wind during the RE phase and, (2) some
          ashes  of  burning  are  exposed  at  the  neutron star surface
          following the RE phase. We find that ashes with mass number A ~
          30  -  60  are mixed in with the ejected material. We calculate
          the  expected  column  density  of ejected and surface ashes in
          hydrogen-like states and determine the equivalent widths of the
          resulting  photoionization edges from both the wind and neutron
          star  surface.  We  find  that  these can exceed 100 eV and are
          potentially  detectable.  A  detection  would probe the nuclear
          burning processes and might enable a measurement of the neutron
          star  gravitational  redshift.  In  addition,  we  find that in
          bursts with pure helium burning layers, protons from (alpha, p)
          reactions  cause  a  rapid onset of the 12C(p, gamma)13N(alpha,
          p)16O  reaction  sequence. The sequence bypasses the relatively
          slow  12C(alpha, gamma)16O reaction and leads to a sudden surge
          in  energy production that is directly observable as a rapid (~
          ms) increase in flux during burst rise.

          Title: The Local Rate and the Progenitor Lifetime of Short-Hard
          Gamma-Ray Bursts: Synthesis and Predictions for LIGO
          Authors: Ehud Nakar, Avishay Gal-Yam, Derek B. Fox
          The  properties  of the short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) with
          known  host-galaxies  suggest  that  these events result from a
          long-lived progenitor system. The most popular progenitor model
          of  SHBs invokes the merger of either double neutron star (DNS)
          binaries  or  neutron  star-black  hole  (NS-BH)  systems. Such
          events  produce  strong  gravitational waves (GWs) at frequency
          range   that  is  accessible  to  current  and  next-generation
          ground-based  GW  observatories.  In  this  work we combine the
          census of SHB observations with refined theoretical analysis to
          critically  evaluate  the  compact  binary progenitor model. We
          then explore the implications for GW detection of these events.
          Beginning  from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic
          time,  we  consider  what  intrinsic  luminosity  and  lifetime
          distributions  can  reproduce  both the known SHB redshifts and
          luminosities, and the peak flux distribution of the large BATSE
          SHB  sample.  We  find  that (1) Short progenitor lifetimes, <3
          Gyr,  are ruled out, and lifetimes of about 6 Gyr favored. This
          result  is  difficult to reconcile with the observed properties
          of  the  DNS  population  in  our  galaxy. We show that for DNS
          systems to remain viable SHB progenitors, a large population of
          old  undetectable  NS  binaries must be postulated. (2) We find
          that  the  local  rate  of SHBs is at least 10 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 and
          likely as high as 10^5 Gpc^-3 yr-1, significantly above earlier
          estimates.  (3)  We find that assuming that SHBs do result from
          compact   binaries,  either  through  the  old  DNS  population
          mentioned   above   or   from   NS-BH  mergers,  our  resulting
          predictions  for the LIGO event rate are extremely encouraging:
          several   detections   per  year  may  be  expected  at  design
          sensitivity,   and   the   first   coincident   observation  of
          electromagnetic  and  gravitational  radiation  from an SHB may
          well be made with current facilities.

          Title: Binary and Millisecond Pulsars

          Journal-ref: Living Rev. Relativity 8, (2005), 7
          We review the main properties, demographics and applications of
          binary  and  millisecond  radio pulsars. Our knowledge of these
          exciting  objects has greatly increased in recent years, mainly
          due  to  successful surveys which have brought the known pulsar
          population   to   over  1700.  There  are  now  80  binary  and
          millisecond pulsars associated with the disk of our Galaxy, and

          Title:  Astrometric  Light-Travel  Time signature of sources in
          nonlinear motion
          Authors: Guillem Anglada, Jordi Torra

          recent  improvements on imaging capabilities require a detailed

          Kreykenbohm, Shaw et al) submitted to A&A in September 2005
          We  present the spectral and temporal analysis of the 2004/2005
          outburst  of  the  transient  X-ray pulsar V0332+53 as observed
          with  Integral. After the discovery of the third cyclotron line
          in  phase averaged spectra (Kreykenbohm et al 2005, Pottschmidt
          et   al  2005),  detailed  pulse  phase  spectroscopy  revealed
          remarkably  little  variability  of the cyclotron lines through
          the  4.4s  X-ray  pulse  (Pottschmidt  et  al 2005). During the
          decline  of  the  outburst,  the  flux  was  observed  to decay
          exponentially  until  2005  Feb 10 and linearly thereafter. The
          spectrum  was  found  to  become  harder  with  time, while the
          folding energy remained constant. The energy of the fundamental
          cyclotron  line  increased  with  time from 26.5kev in the RXTE
          observation  up  to 29.5kev in the last Integral one indicating
          that the emission region is moving closer to the surface of the
          neutron  star.  For  a  detailed  analysis,  see  Mowlavi et al

          Title: Investigating Galaxy Evolution with Chandra
          Authors: G. Fabbiano
          Comments:  To  be  included  in  the  proceedings of the 'X-ray
          universe  2005  meeting'  held  in  San  Lorenzo de El Escorial
          (Spain), 26-30 Sep 2005
          Chandra  observations show the importance of the X-ray band for
          studying the evolution of galaxies. Binary X-ray sources are an
          easily  detectable  tracer  of  the stellar population. Chandra
          studies  of  these  populations are giving us insights into the
          nature  and  formation of these binaries, and provide the basis
          for   diagnostics   of   galaxy  evolution.  With  Chandra  and
          XMM-Newton  we  can  explore relatively poorly known aspects of
          the black hole population of the universe: ultra-luminous X-ray
          sources,  that may be connected with the 'missing' intermediate
          mass  black  holes  predicted  by hierarchical galaxy and black
          hole  formation  scenarios;  and quiescent supermassive nuclear
          black  holes and their surroundings, as a way to understand the
          full  range  of  the  AGN  phenomenon.  Finally, the X-ray band
          provides  the  only  way  to  explore  hot plasmas in galaxies;
          recent  observations  are  revealing  the  importance  of these
          plasmas as vehicles of both chemical enrichment and energy.

          Title: The BATSE-Swift luminosity and redshift distributions of
          short-duration GRBs
          Authors: Dafne Guetta, Tsvi Piran
          We  compare  the luminosity function and rate inferred from the
          BATSE  short hard bursts (SHBs) peak flux distribution with the
          redshift  and  luminosity  distributions  of  SHBs  observed by
          Swift/HETE   II.   While   the  Swift/HETE  II  SHB  sample  is
          incompatible   with   SHB  population  that  follows  the  star
          formation rate, it is compatible with a SHB rate that reflect a
          distribution  of  delay  times after the SFR. This would be the
          case  if  SHBs are associated with binary neutron star mergers.
          The  available data allows, however, different interpretations.
          For  example,  a  population  whose  rate is independent of the
          redshift fits the data very well. The implied SHB rates that we
          find range from $\sim 8$ to $\sim
          30h_{70}^3$Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. This is a much higher rate than
          what  was previously estimated. A detailed (2 dimensional) look
          at the best fit models shows, however, some discrepancy between
          the four Swift/HETE II SHBs and the models based on BATSE SHBs.
          This  could  be  a  statistical fluke. It could also arise from
          wrong  estimates  of  the triggering criteria or from selection
          effects.  If  real  it  may  indicate  the existence of two SHB
          populations  with  different  luminosity functions and redshift
          distributions.

          Title:  Three-Body  Kick  to  a Bright Quasar out of Its Galaxy
          During a Merger
          Authors: Loren Hoffman, Abraham Loeb (Harvard U.)
          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Nature
          The  quasar HE0450-2958 was recently discovered to reside ~7kpc
          away  from  a  galaxy  that  was  likely  disturbed by a recent
          merger.  The  lack  of  a  massive spheroid of stars around the
          quasar  raised  the unlikely suggestion that it may have formed
          in  a  dark galaxy. Here we explain this discovery as a natural
          consequence  of  a  dynamical kick imparted to the quasar as it
          interacted  with  a  binary  black  hole system during a galaxy
          merger  event.  The  typical stalling radius (~1pc) for a ~10^9
          solar  mass binary provides a kick of order the escape velocity
          of  the stellar spheroid, bringing the quasar out to around the
          observed radius before it turns around. This is consistent with
          the  observed  low relative velocity between the quasar and the
          merger-remnant  galaxy.  The  gas  carried  with the black hole
          throughout  the three-body interaction fuels the quasar for the
          duration of its journey, ~2x10^7 years. Gravitational radiation
          recoil could not have produced the required kick.

          Authors:  Martin  G.  Haehnelt  (IoA), Melvyn B. Davies (Lund),
          Martin J. Rees (IoA)
          Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX, no figures; MNRAS in press
          Attempts  of  Magain  et al (2005) to detect the host galaxy of
          the  bright  QSO  HE0450--2958  have  not  been  successful. We
          suggest  that  the supermassive black hole powering the QSO was
          ejected from the observed ULIRG at the same redshift and at 1.5
          arcsec distance. Ejection could have either be caused by recoil
          due  to gravitational wave emission from a coalescing binary of
          supermassive  black  holes  or  the  gravitational slingshot of
          three or more supermassive black holes in the ongoing merger of
          galaxies  which  triggered the starburst activity in the ULIRG.
          We  discuss implications for the possible hierarchical build-up
          of  supermassive  black  holes from intermediate and/or stellar
          mass   black   holes,  and  for  the  detection  of  coalescing
          supermassive binary black holes by LISA.

          Title:  Rotational  Broadening of Atomic Spectral Features from
          Neutron Stars
          Authors: P. Chang, S. Morsink, L. Bildsten, I. Wasserman
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, to appear in ApJ Letters
          The  discovery of the first gravitationally redshifted spectral
          line from a neutron star (NS) by Cottam, Paerels and Mendez has
          triggered  theoretical  studies  of  the physics of atomic line
          formation  in  NS  atmospheres.  Chang,  Bildsten and Wasserman
          showed  that  the hydrogenic Fe H$\alpha$ line formed above the
          photosphere  of  a  bursting  NS is intrinsically broad. We now
          include  rotational  broadening  within  general relativity and
          compare  the  resulting  profile to that observed during Type I
          bursts  from  EXO  0748-676.  We  show  that the fine structure
          splitting  of the line precludes a meaningful constraint on the
          radius.  Our  fitting of the data show that the line forming Fe
          column    is    ${\rm    log}_{10}    (N_{\rm   Fe,   n=2}/{\rm
          cm^{-2}})=17.9_{-0.42}^{+0.27}$ and gravitational redshift $1+z
          =1.345_{-0.008}^{+0.005}$ with 95% confidence. We calculate the
          detectability  of  this  spectral  feature for a large range of
          spins  and  inclinations  assuming that the emission comes from
          the  entire  surface.  We find that at 300 (600) Hz only 10-20%
          (5-10%)  of  NSs  would  have spectral features as deep as that
          seen in EXO 0748-676.

          Title:  Exposing  the Nuclear Burning Ashes of Radius Expansion
          Type I X-ray Bursts
          Authors:  Nevin  N.  Weinberg  (Caltech,  KITP),  Lars Bildsten
          (KITP, UCSB), Hendrik Schatz (MSU, JINA)
          Comments: 15 pages, 15 figures (emulateapj), accepted to ApJ
          We  solve  for  the  evolution  of  the  vertical extent of the
          convective  region of a neutron star atmosphere during a Type I
          X-ray  burst. The convective region is well-mixed with ashes of
          nuclear  burning and its extent determines the rise time of the
          burst  light  curve.  Using a full nuclear reaction network, we
          show  that the maximum vertical extent of the convective region
          during   photospheric  radius  expansion  (RE)  bursts  can  be
          sufficiently  great that: (1) some ashes of burning are ejected
          by  the radiation driven wind during the RE phase and, (2) some
          ashes  of  burning  are  exposed  at  the  neutron star surface
          following the RE phase. We find that ashes with mass number A ~
          30  -  60  are mixed in with the ejected material. We calculate
          the  expected  column  density  of ejected and surface ashes in
          hydrogen-like states and determine the equivalent widths of the
          resulting  photoionization edges from both the wind and neutron
          star  surface.  We  find  that  these can exceed 100 eV and are
          potentially  detectable.  A  detection  would probe the nuclear
          burning processes and might enable a measurement of the neutron
          star  gravitational  redshift.  In  addition,  we  find that in
          bursts with pure helium burning layers, protons from (alpha, p)
          reactions  cause  a  rapid onset of the 12C(p, gamma)13N(alpha,
          p)16O  reaction  sequence. The sequence bypasses the relatively
          slow  12C(alpha, gamma)16O reaction and leads to a sudden surge
          in  energy production that is directly observable as a rapid (~
          ms) increase in flux during burst rise.

          Title: The Local Rate and the Progenitor Lifetime of Short-Hard
          Gamma-Ray Bursts: Synthesis and Predictions for LIGO
          Authors: Ehud Nakar, Avishay Gal-Yam, Derek B. Fox
          The  properties  of the short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) with
          known  host-galaxies  suggest  that  these events result from a
          long-lived progenitor system. The most popular progenitor model
          of  SHBs invokes the merger of either double neutron star (DNS)
          binaries  or  neutron  star-black  hole  (NS-BH)  systems. Such
          events  produce  strong  gravitational waves (GWs) at frequency
          range   that  is  accessible  to  current  and  next-generation
          ground-based  GW  observatories.  In  this  work we combine the
          census of SHB observations with refined theoretical analysis to
          critically  evaluate  the  compact  binary progenitor model. We
          then explore the implications for GW detection of these events.
          Beginning  from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic
          time,  we  consider  what  intrinsic  luminosity  and  lifetime
          distributions  can  reproduce  both the known SHB redshifts and
          luminosities, and the peak flux distribution of the large BATSE
          SHB  sample.  We  find  that (1) Short progenitor lifetimes, <3
          Gyr,  are ruled out, and lifetimes of about 6 Gyr favored. This
          result  is  difficult to reconcile with the observed properties
          of  the  DNS  population  in  our  galaxy. We show that for DNS
          systems to remain viable SHB progenitors, a large population of
          old  undetectable  NS  binaries must be postulated. (2) We find
          that  the  local  rate  of SHBs is at least 10 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 and
          likely as high as 10^5 Gpc^-3 yr-1, significantly above earlier
          estimates.  (3)  We find that assuming that SHBs do result from
          compact   binaries,  either  through  the  old  DNS  population
          mentioned   above   or   from   NS-BH  mergers,  our  resulting
          predictions  for the LIGO event rate are extremely encouraging:
          several   detections   per  year  may  be  expected  at  design
          sensitivity,   and   the   first   coincident   observation  of
          electromagnetic  and  gravitational  radiation  from an SHB may
          well be made with current facilities.

          exponentially  until  2005  Feb 10 and linearly thereafter. The
          spectrum  was  found  to  become  harder  with  time, while the
          folding energy remained constant. The energy of the fundamental
          cyclotron  line  increased  with  time from 26.5kev in the RXTE
          observation  up  to 29.5kev in the last Integral one indicating
          that the emission region is moving closer to the surface of the
          neutron  star.  For  a  detailed  analysis,  see  Mowlavi et al

          Title: Investigating Galaxy Evolution with Chandra
          Authors: G. Fabbiano
          Comments:  To  be  included  in  the  proceedings of the 'X-ray
          universe  2005  meeting'  held  in  San  Lorenzo de El Escorial
          (Spain), 26-30 Sep 2005
          Chandra  observations show the importance of the X-ray band for
          studying the evolution of galaxies. Binary X-ray sources are an
          easily  detectable  tracer  of  the stellar population. Chandra
          studies  of  these  populations are giving us insights into the
          nature  and  formation of these binaries, and provide the basis
          for   diagnostics   of   galaxy  evolution.  With  Chandra  and
          XMM-Newton  we  can  explore relatively poorly known aspects of
          the black hole population of the universe: ultra-luminous X-ray
          sources,  that may be connected with the 'missing' intermediate
          mass  black  holes  predicted  by hierarchical galaxy and black
          hole  formation  scenarios;  and quiescent supermassive nuclear
          black  holes and their surroundings, as a way to understand the
          full  range  of  the  AGN  phenomenon.  Finally, the X-ray band
          provides  the  only  way  to  explore  hot plasmas in galaxies;
          recent  observations  are  revealing  the  importance  of these
          plasmas as vehicles of both chemical enrichment and energy.

          Title:  On the spin-up/spin-down transitions in accreting X-ray
          binaries
          Authors:  Rosalba  Perna  (Colorado/JILA),  Enrico  Bozzo (OAR,
          Rome), Luigi Stella (OAR, Rome)
          Comments:  37  pages, 11 figures, accepted to the Astrophysical
          Journal
          Accreting  X-Ray  Binaries  display a wide range of behaviours.
          Some  of  them  are  observed  to  spin  up steadily, others to
          alternate  between  spin-up  and  spin-down  states,  sometimes
          superimposed  on a longer trend of either spin up or spin down.
          Here we interpret this rich phenomenology within a new model of
          the  disk-magnetosphere  interaction.  Our  model, based on the
          simplest  version of a purely material torque, accounts for the
          fact  that,  when  a neutron star is in the propeller regime, a
          fraction of the ejected material does not receive enough energy
          to  completely  unbind,  and hence falls back into the disk. We
          show  that  the presence of this feedback mass component causes
          the  occurrence of multiple states available to the system, for
          a  given,  constant  value  of the mass accretion rate dot{M}_*
          from  the  companion  star.  If  the  angle chi of the magnetic
          dipole  axis  with  respect to the perpendicular to the disk is
          larger  than  a  critical value chi_crit, the system eventually
          settles  in  a  cycle  of  spin-up/spin-down  transitions for a
          constant  value  of  dot{M}_*  and  independent  of the initial
          conditions.  No  external  perturbations are required to induce
          the  torque reversals. The transition from spin up to spin down
          is  often  accompanied  by  a  large  drop  in  luminosity. The
          frequency  range  spanned  in  each cycle and the timescale for
          torque  reversals depend on dot{M}_*, the magnetic field of the
          star, the magnetic colatitude chi, and the degree of elasticity
          regulating  the  magnetosphere-disk  interaction.  The critical
          angle chi_crit ranges from \~25-30 deg for a completely elastic
          interaction  to ~40-45 deg for a totally anelastic one. For chi
          ~<  chi_crit,  cycles  are no longer possible and the long-term
          evolution  of  the  system  is  a pure spin up. We specifically
          illustrate  our model in the cases of the X-ray binaries GX 1+4
          and 4U 1626-67.

          Timing  Explorer  (RXTE)  in  2004  December.  We report on the
          detection  of three cyclotron resonance features at 27, 51, and
          74  keV  in  the  phase-averaged data, corresponding to a polar
          magnetic  field  of  2.7 x 10^12 G. After 4U0115+63, this makes
          V0332+53  the  second accreting neutron star in which more than
          two  cyclotron lines have been detected; this has now also been
          confirmed   by   INTEGRAL.   Pulse-phase  spectroscopy  reveals

          Title:  Millihertz  Quasi-Periodic Oscillations from Marginally
          Stable Nuclear Burning on an Accreting Neutron Star
          Authors: Alexander Heger (1,2), Andrew Cumming (3), Stanford E.
          Woosley (2) ((1) LANL, (2) UCSC, (3) McGill)
          Comments: 10 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We investigate marginally stable nuclear burning on the surface
          of  accreting  neutron  stars  as  an  explanation  for the mHz
          quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed from three low mass
          X-ray  binaries.  At  the  boundary between unstable and stable
          burning, the temperature dependence of the nuclear heating rate
          and  cooling  rate  almost cancel. The result is an oscillatory
          mode  of  burning,  with  an  oscillation  period  close to the
          geometric  mean of the thermal and accretion timescales for the
          burning  layer.  We  describe  a  simple  one-zone  model which
          illustrates  this  basic  physics,  and  then  present detailed
          multizone  hydrodynamical calculations of nuclear burning close
          to  the  stability  boundary  using the KEPLER code. Our models
          naturally explain the characteristic 2 minute period of the mHz
          QPOs,  and  why  they  are  seen only in a very narrow range of
          X-ray  luminosities. The oscillation period is sensitive to the
          accreted  hydrogen fraction and the surface gravity, suggesting
          a new way to probe these parameters. A major puzzle is that the
          accretion   rate  at  which  the  oscillations  appear  in  the
          theoretical  models  is  an  order of magnitude larger than the
          rate  implied  by  the  X-ray  luminosity when the mHz QPOs are
          seen. We discuss the implications for our general understanding
          of  nuclear burning on accreting neutron stars. One possibility
          is  that  the accreted material covers only part of the neutron
          star surface at luminosities Lx > ~1E37 erg/s.

          Title: A High-Mass Protobinary System in the Hot Core W3(H2O)
          Authors:  Huei-Ru  Chen,  William  J.  Welch,  David J. Wilner,

          Comments:  38  pages,  9 figures, accepted by The Astrophysical
          Journal
          We have observed a high-mass protobinary system in the hot core
          W3(H2O)  with the BIMA Array. Our continuum maps at wavelengths
          of   1.4mm   and   2.8mm  both  achieve  sub-arcsecond  angular
          resolutions  and  show  a double-peaked morphology. The angular
          separation  of  the  two  sources  is  1.19"  corresponding  to
          2.43X10^3  AU  at  the  source  distance  of 2.04 kpc. The flux
          densities of the two sources at 1.4mm and 2.8mm have a spectral
          index  of  3,  translating to an opacity law of kappa ~ nu. The
          small  spectral  indices suggest that grain growth has begun in
          the hot core. We have also observed 5 K components of the CH3CN
          (12-11)  transitions. A radial velocity difference of 2.81 km/s
          is  found  towards  the two continuum peaks. Interpreting these
          two sources as binary components in orbit about one another, we
          find  a  minimum  mass  of  22  Msun  for the system. Radiative
          transfer  models  are constructed to explain both the continuum
          and  methyl cyanide line observations of each source. Power-law
          distributions  of  both  density  and  temperature are derived.
          Density distributions close to the free-fall value, r^-1.5, are
          found for both components, suggesting continuing accretion. The
          derived  luminosities  suggest  the two sources have equivalent
          zero-age  main  sequence  (ZAMS)  spectral  type B0.5 - B0. The
          nebular  masses  derived  from  the  continuum observations are
          about  5  Msun for source A and 4 Msun for source C. A velocity
          gradient  previously  detected  may  be explained by unresolved
          binary rotation with a small velocity difference.

          Title: Shear Viscosity and Oscillations of Neutron Star Crusts

          We  calculate  the  electron  shear  viscosity  (determined  by
          Coulomb electron collisions) for a dense matter in a wide range
          of  parameters  typical  for white dwarf cores and neutron star
          crusts. In the density range from ~10^3 g cm^-3 to 10^7-10^10 g
          cm^-3  we  consider  the  matter  composed  of  widely abundant
          astrophysical  elements,  from  H  to Fe. For higher densities,
          10^10-10^14   g  cm^-3,  we  employ  the  ground-state  nuclear
          composition,  taking into account finite sizes of atomic nuclei
          and  the  distribution  of  proton  charge  over  the  nucleus.
          Numerical  values  of  the  viscosity  are  approximated  by an
          analytic  expression  convenient  for  applications.  Using the
          approximation     of     plane-parallel    layer    we    study
          eigenfrequencies,  eigenmodes  and  viscous  damping  times  of
          oscillations  of  high  multipolarity, l~500-1000, localized in
          the  outer  crust  of  a  neutron  star. For instance, at l~500
          oscillations have frequencies f >= 40 kHz and are localized not
          deeper than ~300 m from the surface. When the crust temperature
          decreases  from 10^9 K to 10^7 K, the dissipation time of these
          oscillations  (with  a few radial nodes) decreases from ~1 year
          to 10-15 days.

          We  carried  out  a  deep  subarcsecond  BRI imaging of the two
          middle-aged  pulsars  to  establish  their  properties  in  the
          optical  range.  Both  pulsars are detected at >10 sigma level.
          Geminga  is  for the first time reliably detected in the I band
          with  a  magnitude  of 25.10+/-0.14. We also reanalyze archival
          ESO/NTT  and  HST  broadband  data and find that some published
          fluxes  for  Geminga were estimated inaccurately. The resulting
          dereddened  broadband  spectra  of  both pulsars are remarkably
          similar  to  each  other  and  show  significant flux increases
          towards  the  far-UV and near-IR, and a wide flux excess in V-I
          bands.  This suggests a multicomponent structure of the optical
          emission.  The  nonthermal  power  law  component of the pulsar
          magnetospheric origin dominates in the most part of the optical
          range.  For  PSR  B0656+14  it  is compatible with a low energy
          extension  of  the  power  law  tail  seen  in hard X-rays. For
          Geminga  the respective extension overshoots by a factor of 100
          the  nonthermal  optical  flux, which has a less steep spectral
          slope than in X-rays. This implies a spectral break at a photon
          energy  of  about  1 keV. The flux increases towards the far-UV
          are  compatible  with contributions of the Rayleigh-Jeans parts
          of  the blackbody components from whole surfaces of the neutron
          stars  dominating in soft X-rays. The V-I excess, which is most
          significant   for  PSR  B0656+14,  suggests  a  third  spectral
          component of still unidentified origin. Faint, a few arcseconds
          in  size  nebulae  extended  perpendicular to the proper motion
          directions  of the pulsars, are seen around both objects in our
          deepest  I band images. They can be optical counterparts of the
          bow-shock  head  of  Geminga  and  of the tentative pulsar wind
          nebula of PSR B0656+14 observed in X-rays.

          accepted
          We  report the discovery of a 16th magnitude star, HE0437-5439,
          with   a   heliocentric   radial  velocity  of  +723+-3km/s.  A
          quantitative   spectral  analysis  of  high-resolution  optical
          spectra  obtained  with the VLT and the UVES spectrograph shows
          that   HE0437-5439   is   a  main  sequence  B-type  star  with
          Teff=20350K,  log g=3.77, solar within a factor of a few helium
          abundance  and metal content, rotating at v sin i=54km/s. Using
          appropriate  evolutionary tracks we derive a mass of 8 Msun and
          a  corresponding  distance  of  61 kpc. Its galactic rest frame
          velocity  is  at least 563km/s, almost twice the local Galactic
          escape  velocity,  indicating  that  the star is unbound to the
          Galaxy.  Numerical  kinematical  experiments are carried out to
          constrain  its  place of birth. It has been suggested that such
          hyper-velocity stars can be formed by the tidal disruption of a
          binary through interaction with the super-massive black hole at
          the  Galactic  center  (GC). HE0437-5439 needs about 100Myrs to
          travel from the GC to its presentposition, much longer than its
          main  sequence  lifetime of 25Myrs. This can only be reconciled
          if  HE0437-5439  is  a  blue  straggler star. In this case, the
          predicted  proper  motion  is  so  small  that  it  can only be
          measured  by  future  space  missions.  Since  the star is much
          closer  to  the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, 18kpc) than to the
          GC,  it  can reach its position from the center of the LMC. The
          proper  motion predicted in this case is about 2mas/y (relative
          to  the  LMC),  large enough to be measurable with conventional
          techniques from the ground. The LMC origin could also be tested
          by a high-precision abundance analysis.

          Title: US 708 - An unbound hyper-velocity subluminous O star

          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          We  report  the discovery of an unbound hyper-velocity star, US
          708, in the Milky Way halo, with a heliocentric radial velocity
          of  +708+-15km/s. A quantitative NLTE model atmosphere analysis
          of  optical  spectra obtained with LRIS at the Keck I telescope
          shows  that  US 708 is an extremely helium-rich (N(He)/N(H)=10)
          subluminous  O  type  star  with  Teff=44500K,  log g=5.23 at a
          distance of 19kpc. Its Galactic rest frame velocity is at least
          751km/s,  much  higher  than the local Galactic escape velocity
          indicating  that the star is unbound to the Galaxy. It has been
          suggested  that  such hyper-velocity stars can be formed by the
          tidal  disruption  of  a  binary  through  interaction with the
          super-massive  black  hole  (SMBH) at the Galactic centre (GC).
          Numerical   kinematical   experiments   are   carried   out  to
          reconstruct  the path from the GC.U S 708 needs about 32Myrs to
          travel  from  the  GC  to  its  present position, less than its
          evolutionary  lifetime.  Its predicted proper motion mue(alpha)
          cos(delta)=-2.3mas/y   and   mue(delta)=-2.4mas/y   should   be
          measurable  by future space missions. We conjecture that US 708
          is  formed  by the merger of two helium white dwarfs in a close
          binary  induced  by the interaction with the SMBH in the GC and
          then escaped.

          reviewed.  Particular  attention  is paid to resonances between
          dynamic tides and free oscillation modes and to the role of the
          apsidal-motion rate in probing the internal structure of binary
          components.  The  discussed effects are generally applicable to
          stars  across the entire Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, including
          the binary OB-stars discussed at this meeting.

          In   this   work   we   present   a  system  for  the  automatic
          classification  of  the light curves of eclipsing binaries. This
          system is based on a classification scheme that aims to separate
          eclipsing   binary   sistems   according  to  their  geometrical
          configuration   in   a   modified  version  of  the  traditional
          classification  scheme.  The  classification  is  performed by a
          Bayesian   ensemble   of   neural  networks  trained  with  {\em
          Hipparcos}   data   of   seven  different  categories  including
          eccentric  binary systems and two types of pulsating light curve
          morphologies.

          Title: Common envelope evolution through planetary nebula eyes
          Authors: Orsola De Marco, Maxwell Moe
          Comments:  4  pages,  one figure, proceedings of the 2005 Gdansk
          meeting PN as astronomical tools, in press
          The common envelope interaction is responsible for evolved close
          binaries.  Among  them  are  a  minority  of  central  stars  of
          planetary  nebula  (PN).  Recent observational results, however,
          point  to most PN actually being in binary systems. We therefore
          ask  the  question  if  it  is  feasible  that most, or even all
          Galactic  PN  derive  from  a  common  envelope interaction. Our
          recent  calculation  finds that if all single and binary primary
          stars  with mass between ~1-8 Mo eject a PN, there would be many
          more  PN  in  the  galaxy  than observed. On the other hand, the
          predicted number of post-common envelope PN is more in agreement
          with  the  total  number  of  PN  in  the  Galaxy. This is a new
          indication  that  binary  interactions play a functional role in
          the  creation of PN and an encouragement to intensify efforts to
          detect binary companions.

          Title: The pulsar wind nebula of the Geminga pulsar
          Authors: G.G. Pavlov, D. Sanwal, V.E. Zavlin
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 color figures; submitted to ApJ Letters
          The  superb  spatial  resolution  of  Chandra  has allowed us to
          detect  and  resolve a 20''-long tail behind the Geminga pulsar,
          with  a luminosity (1.3+/- 0.2)\times 10^{29} ergs s^{-1} in the
          0.45  -  8  keV band, for an assumed distance of 200 pc. We also
          detected  an  arc-like  structure  ahead  of the pulsar extended
          perpendicular  to the tail, with a factor of 4 lower luminosity.
          We  see no clear evidence of the 2'-long outer tails reported by
          Caraveo  et  al.  from  an  XMM-Newton  observation. The tail we
          detected  could  be  either a pulsar jet, possibly confined by a
          toroidal  magnetic  field  of  \sim  100  \muG,  or  it  can  be
          associated   with  the  shocked  relativistic  wind  behind  the
          supersonically moving pulsar confined by the ram pressure of the
          oncoming interstellar medium.

          Title:  The  Dynamical  Evolution  of  Black  Hole-Neutron Star
          Binaries in General Relativity: Simulations of Tidal Disruption

          We  calculate  the  first dynamical evolutions of merging black
          hole-neutron  star  binaries  that construct the combined black
          hole-neutron   star   spacetime   in   a  general  relativistic
          framework.  We  treat  the  metric  in  the  conformal flatness
          approximation,   and   assume  that  the  black  hole  mass  is
          sufficiently large compared to that of the neutron star so that
          the  black  hole  remains  fixed  in  space. Using a spheroidal
          spectral methods solver, we solve the resulting field equations
          for  a  neutron  star  orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole. The
          matter  is  evolved  using a relativistic, Lagrangian, smoothed
          particle  hydrodynamics (SPH) treatment. We take as our initial
          data  recent  quasiequilibrium  models for synchronized neutron
          star   polytropes  generated  as  solutions  of  the  conformal
          thin-sandwich   (CTS)   decomposition  of  the  Einstein  field
          equations.  We  are able to construct from these models relaxed
          SPH  configurations whose profiles show good agreement with CTS
          solutions.  Our  adiabatic  evolution  calculations for neutron
          stars  with  low  compactness  show that mass transfer, when it
          begins  while  the  neutron  star  orbit  is  still outside the
          innermost  stable  circular  orbit,  is  more  unstable than is
          typically  predicted  by  analytical formalisms. This dynamical
          mass  loss  is found to be the driving force in determining the
          subsequent  evolution of the binary orbit and the neutron star,
          which  typically  disrupts  completely  within  a  few  orbital
          periods.  The  majority  of the mass transferred onto the black
          hole is accreted promptly; a significant fraction (~30%) of the
          mass  is  shed  outward  as  well,  some  of  which will become
          gravitationally unbound and ejected completely from the system.
          The  remaining portion forms an accretion disk around the black
          hole,  and  could  provide the energy source for short-duration
          gamma ray bursts.

          for March 2006 issue of Publ. Ast. Soc. Pacific
          We  present  the  software  tool  FITDisk, a precompiled-binary
          Windows  GUI  version  of  our  smoothed particle hydrodynamics
          cataclysmic  variable accretion disk research code. Cataclysmic
          variables  are  binary  star systems in which a compact stellar
          remnant, typically a white dwarf star, is stripping mass from a
          lower-main-sequence companion star by way of an accretion disk.
          Typically  the  disk  is the brightest component of the system,
          because the plasma is heated dramatically as it spirals down in
          the  gravitational  well  of  the primary white dwarf star. The
          shortest-period    systems   can   display   disk   "superhump"
          oscillations   driven  by  the  rotating  tidal  field  of  the
          secondary  star.  FITDisk models these accretion disk phenomena
          using  a fully three-dimensional hydrodynamics calculation, and
          data  can  be visualized as they are computed or stored to hard
          drive  for later playback at a fast frame rate. Simulations are
          visualized  using  OpenGL graphics and the viewing angle can be
          changed interactively. Pseudo light curves of simulated systems
          can  be  plotted  along  with  the associated Fourier amplitude
          spectrum.   FITDisk   is   available   for   free  download  at

          Title:  Eddington-limited  X-ray Bursts as Distance Indicators.

          Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, accepted by ApJ
          We analyzed 123 thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts observed by
          the  Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer from the low-mass X-ray binary
          4U  1636-536.  All  but two of the 40 radius-exansion bursts in
          this sample reached peak fluxes which were normally distributed
          about  a  mean of 6.4e-8 ergs/cm^2/s, with a standard deviation
          of 7.6%. The remaining two radius-expansion bursts reached peak
          fluxes a factor of 1.69+/-0.13 lower than this mean value; as a
          consequence,  the  overall  variation  in  the peak flux of the
          radius-expansion  bursts  was a factor of ~2. This variation is
          comparable to the range of the Eddington limit between material
          with solar H-fraction (X=0.7) and pure He. Such a variation may
          arise  if,  for the bright radius-expansion bursts, most of the
          accreted  H  is  eliminated either by steady hot CNO burning or
          expelled  in a radiatively-driven wind. However, steady burning
          cannot  exhaust  the  accreted H for solar composition material
          within  the  typical  ~2  hr  burst recurrence time, nor can it
          result   in   sufficient   elemental  stratification  to  allow
          selective  ejection of the H only. An additional stratification
          mechanism  appears  to  be  required  to  separate the accreted
          elements  and thus allow preferential ejection of the hydrogen.
          We  found  no  evidence for a gap in the peak flux distribution
          between  the  radius-expansion and non-radius expansion bursts,
          previously observed in smaller samples. Assuming that the faint
          radius-expansion  bursts reached the Eddington limit for H-rich
          material (X~0.7), and the brighter bursts the limit for pure He
          (X=0), we estimate the distance to 4U 1636-536 (for a canonical
          neutron  star  with  M_NS=1.4M_sun, R_NS=10 km) to be 6.0+/-0.5
          kpc, or for M_NS=2M_sun at most 7.1 kpc. (Abstract abridged)

          Title:  QPO  as  the Rosetta Stone for understanding black hole
          accretion

          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
          Journal-ref: Astronomische Nachrichten / AN 326, No. 9 (2005)
          Quasi  periodic  oscillations (QPO) seen in the X-ray fluxes of
          individual neutron stars and black hole sources are one of most
          intriguing phenomena in today's astrophysics. The QPO nature is
          visibly  determined by super-strong Einstein's gravity. I argue
          here  that  it also profoundly depends on the MRI turbulence in
          accretion  flows.  Understanding  the QPO physics may therefore
          guide accretion theory out of its present state of confusion.

          The  low mass X-ray binary system 4U 1812-12 was monitored with
          the  INTEGRAL  observatory  in  the  period  2003-2004 and with
          BeppoSAX  on April 20, 2000. We report here on the spectral and
          temporal  analysis  of  both persistent and burst emission. The
          full  data  set confirms the persistent nature of this burster,
          and  reveals  the  presence  of  emission  up  to  200 keV. The
          persistent  spectrum  is  well  described  by  a comptonization
          (CompTT)  model plus a soft blackbody component. The source was
          observed  in  a hard spectral state with a 1-200 keV luminosity
          of  2*10^(36)  ergs/s  and  L/LEdd~1%  and  no  meaningful flux
          variation  has  been revealed, as also confirmed by a 2004 RXTE
          observation.  We  have  also  detected  4 bursts showing double
          peaked profiles and blackbody spectra with temperatures ranging
          from 1.9 to 3.1 keV.

          Title:  Evolution  of Massive Blackhole Triples I -- Equal-mass
          binary-single systems
          Authors: Masaki Iwasawa, Yoko Funato, Junichiro Makino
          Comments: 20 pages, 12 figures
          We  present  the  result  of  $N$-body simulations of dynamical
          evolution  of triple massive blackhole (BH) systems in galactic
          nuclei.  We found that in most cases two of the three BHs merge
          through gravitational wave (GW) radiation in the timescale much
          shorter  than the Hubble time, before ejecting one BH through a
          slingshot.  In  order  for a binary BH to merge before ejecting
          out  the third one, it has to become highly eccentric since the
          gravitational  wave  timescale  would  be  much longer than the
          Hubble time unless the eccentricity is very high. We found that
          two  mechanisms  drive  the increase of the eccentricity of the
          binary.   One   is  the  strong  binary-single  BH  interaction
          resulting in the thermalization of the eccentricity. The second
          is  the  Kozai  mechanism which drives the cyclic change of the
          inclination  and  eccentricity  of the inner binary of a stable
          hierarchical  triple  system.  Our  result implies that many of
          supermassive blackholes are binaries.

          Title:    Models    of   Ultraluminous   X-Ray   Sources   with

          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We   have  computed  models  for  ultraluminous  X-ray  sources
          ("ULXs")  consisting  of  a black-hole accretor of intermediate
          mass  ("IMBH"; e.g., ~1000 Msun) and a captured donor star. For
          each of four different sets of initial donor masses and orbital
          separations, we computed 30,000 binary evolution models using a
          full  Henyey  stellar  evolution code. To our knowledge this is
          the  first  time that a population of X-ray binaries this large
          has been carried out with other than approximation methods, and
          it  serves  to  demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to
          large-scale  population  studies  of mass-transfer binaries. In
          the  present  study,  we find that in order to have a plausible
          efficiency  for  producing active ULX systems with IMBHs having
          luminosities   >   10^{40}   ergs/sec,   there  are  two  basic
          requirements  for  the capture of companion/donor stars. First,
          the  donor stars should be massive, i.e., > 8 Msun. Second, the
          initial  orbital  separations, after circularization, should be
          close,  i.e., < 6-30 times the radius of the donor star when on
          the  main  sequence. Even under these optimistic conditions, we
          show  that  the  production  rate  of IMBH-ULX systems may fall
          short of the observed values by factors of 10-100.

          The  Southern  Galactic  Plane Survey (SGPS) is a 1.4 GHz radio
          polarization  and  HI  survey  in  a  large  part  of the inner
          Galactic   plane   at   a   resolution   of  about  an  arcmin.
          Depolarization and Faraday rotation of polarized radiation from
          diffuse    Galactic    synchrotron   emission,   pulsars,   and
          extragalactic  sources  can  be used to infer information about
          the  strength  and  structure  of  the Galactic magnetic field.
          Here,  we discuss science results of the polarization data from
          the  SGPS.  We  show  from  statistical  analysis  of  rotation
          measures  of  polarized extragalactic sources that fluctuations
          in  the  magneto-ionized medium of the spiral arms are probably
          mainly  caused  by  HII  regions,  while  the  rotation measure
          fluctuations  in  the  interarm regions may be connected to the
          interstellar  turbulent cascade. Furthermore, the variations of
          rotation measure with Galactic longitude enable modeling of the
          large-scale component of the Galactic magnetic field, including
          determination  of  the  number  and  location of magnetic field
          reversals.  Finally,  the  SGPS  is  an  excellent way to study
          subparsec-scale   structure  in  the  ionized  ISM  by  way  of
          depolarization studies in HII regions.

          X-ray  binaries.  The  massive X-ray binary 4U 2206+54 does not
          fit  in  any  of these groups, and deserves a detailed study to
          understand  how  the transfer of matter and the accretion on to
          the  compact  object  take  place.  To this end we study an IUE
          spectrum  of  the  donor  and  obtain  a wind terminal velocity
          (v_inf) of ~350 km/s, which is abnormally slow for its spectral
          type.  We  also  analyse  here  more  than 9 years of available
          RXTE/ASM  data. We study the long-term X-ray variability of the
          source  and  find  it  to  be  similar  to that observed in the
          wind-fed  supergiant system Vela X-1, reinforcing the idea that
          4U  2206+54  is  also a wind-fed system. We find a quasi-period
          decreasing  from  ~270 to ~130 d, noticed in previous works but
          never  studied  in  detail.  We  discuss possible scenarios and
          conclude   that  long-term  quasi-periodic  variations  in  the
          mass-loss  rate  of  the  primary  are  probably  driving  such
          variability  in  the measured X-ray flux. We obtain an improved
          orbital  period  of  9.5591  d  with  maximum X-ray flux at MJD
          51856.6.  Our  study  of  the  orbital X-ray variability in the
          context  of  wind  accretion  suggests  a moderate eccentricity
          around  0.15.  Moreover,  the  low  value  of  v_inf solves the
          long-standing  problem  of the relatively high X-ray luminosity
          for  the  unevolved  nature of the donor, BD +53 2790, which is
          probably  an  O9.5 V star. We note that changes in v_inf and/or
          the  mass-loss  rate  of  the  primary alone cannot explain the
          diferent  patterns  displayed by the orbital X-ray variability.
          We  finally  emphasize  that 4U 2206+54, together with LS 5039,
          could  be  part of a new population of wind-fed HMXBs with main
          sequence  donors,  the  natural progenitors of supergiant X-ray
          binaries. (Abridged)

          We  report  on observations of the X-ray pulsar IGR J16320-4751
          (a.k.a. AX J1631.9-4752) performed simultaneously with INTEGRAL
          and  XMM-Newton. We refine the source position and identify the
          most  likely  infrared  counterpart.  Our simultaneous coverage
          allows  us to confirm the presence of X-ray pulsations at ~1300
          s,  that  we  detect  above  20 keV with INTEGRAL for the first
          time. The pulse fraction is consistent with being constant with
          energy,  which is compatible with a model of polar accretion by
          a  pulsar.  We study the spectral properties of IGR J16320-4751
          during  two  major  periods  occurring  during the simultaneous
          coverage  with  both satellites, namely a flare and a non-flare
          period. We detect the presence of a narrow 6.4 keV iron line in
          both  periods.  The  presence  of  such a feature is typical of
          supergiant  wind  accretors  such  as  Vela X-1 or GX 301-2. We
          inspect the spectral variations with respect to the pulse phase
          during  the non-flare period, and show that the pulse is solely
          due  to  variations of the X-ray flux emitted by the source and
          not to variations of the spectral parameters.
          Our  results  are  therefore compatible with the source being a
          pulsar  in  a  High  Mass X-ray Binary. We detect a soft excess
          appearing  in  the spectra as a blackbody with a temperature of
          ~0.07  keV.  We discuss the origin of the X-ray emission in IGR
          J16320-4751:  while  the  hard  X-rays are likely the result of
          Compton  emission produced in the close vicinity of the pulsar,
          based  on  energy  argument  we suggest that the soft excess is
          likely the emission by a collisionally energised cloud in which
          the compact object is embedded.

          Comments:  16  pages,  3  figures,  proceedings of the Pecs PhD
          Conference on "Astrophysics of Variable Stars"
          Binary  systems  have  long  been  recognized  as the source of
          powerful astrophysical diagnostics. Among the many applications
          of  binary  stars,  they  have  been  used as probes of stellar
          structure  and evolution (both of single and binary stars) in a
          broad  range  of  masses,  evolutionary  stages,  and  chemical
          compositions,  and as indicators of distance and time. With the
          numerous   ongoing   photometric  surveys  and  upcoming  space
          astrometry  and  photometry  missions,  the  future of binaries
          looks    bright.   The   various   aspects   of   binaries   as
          astrophysically  useful  laboratories  are  reviewed here, with
          emphasis   on   the   currently   open  problems  and  research
          opportunities.

          Authors: Georges Meynet, Raphael Hirschi, Sylvia Ekstrom, Andre

          Comments:  12  pages,  11  figures, in Stellar Evolution at Low
          Metallicity:  Mass Loss, Explosions, Cosmology, Lamers, Langer,
          Nugis, Annuk (eds.), ASP Conf. Ser
          At  very  low metallicity, the effects of differential rotation
          have  a more important impact on the evolution of stars than at
          high  metallicity. Rotational mixing leads to the production of
          great  quantities  of helium and of primary $^{14}$N by massive
          stars. Rotation induces important mass loss and allows stars to
          locally   strongly   enrich  the  interstellar  medium  in  CNO
          elements. Stars formed from interstellar clouds enriched by the
          winds  of  fast  rotating  massive  stars would present surface
          abundances  similar  to  those  of  C-rich extremely metal-poor
          stars.  C-rich  stars can also be formed by mass accretion in a
          binary  system  where  the  primary  would  be  a fast rotating
          intermediate  mass  star  in the early-AGB phase. Fast rotation
          may  also  lead to the formation of collapsars even at very low
          metallicity  and  make  the  most  massive stars avoid the pair
          instability.

          Physics
          The  most precise measurements are done at present by timing of
          radiopulsars  in  binary  systems  with  two neutron stars. The
          timing  measurements  of  the Taylor-Hulse pulsar give the most
          precise  results on testing of general relativity (GR), finding
          implicit  proof  of  existence  of gravitational waves. We show
          that   the   existing   measurements,  used  for  checking  the
          variability  of the fundamental constants, give the upper limit
          for   the   variation  of  the  gravitational  constant  ${\dot
          G}/{G}=(4.3\pm   4.9)\cdot   10^{-12}$   year{$^{-1}$}.  Timing
          measurements  of  the  binary  pulsar  J0737-3039  undoubtfully
          should give more precise results in the nearest future.

          Comments: 12 pages, 8 figures, accpeted for publication in AJ
          We  report photometric and spectroscopic observations of the SU
          UMa-type  dwarf  novae,  KS  Ursae  Majoris,  during  its  2003
          February   superoutburst.   Modulations   with   a   period  of
          $0.07017\pm0.00021$  day, which is 3.3% larger than the orbital
          period,  have  been  found  during the superoutburst and may be
          positive  superhumps.  A  maximum  trough-to-peak  amplitude of
          around 0.3 magnitude is determined for this superhump.
          The  spectra  show  broad,  absorption-line profiles. The lines
          display  blue  and  red  troughs  which alternate in depth. The
          radial  velocity  curve of the absorption wings of H$\beta$ has
          an  amplitude  of  $40\pm11$  km s$^{-1}$ and a phase offset of
          $0.12\pm0.03$.  The  $\gamma$ velocity of the binary is $3\pm9$
          km  s$^{-1}$  and varies on an order of 50 km s$^{-1}$ from day
          to  day. From another clear evidence for a precessing eccentric
          disk,   we  obtain  a  solution  to  an  eccentric  outer  disk
          consistent  with  theoretical  works,  which  demonstrates  the
          validity  of the relation between superhumps and tidal effects.
          The  inner  part  of the disk is also eccentric as evidenced by
          asymmetric  and  symmetric  wings  in the lines. Therefore, the
          whole  disk is eccentric and the variation of $\gamma$ velocity
          and   the   evolutionary  asymmetric  line  profiles  could  be
          criterions for an precessing eccentric accretion disk.

          Title: X-ray source populations in galaxies
          Authors: G. Fabbiano
          Comments: 40 pages. This is a review submitted to Annual Review
          of  Astronomy  &  Astrophysics Comments are welcome and will be
          considered in a revised version
          Today's sensitive, high-resolution X-ray observations allow the
          study  of populations of X-ray sources, in the luminosity range
          of  Galactic  X-ray  binaries,  in galaxies as distant as 20-30
          Mpc. The traditional astronomical tools of photometric diagrams
          and  luminosity functions are now applied to these populations,
          providing  a  direct  probe  of the evolved binary component of
          different   stellar   populations.   The  study  of  the  X-ray
          populations of E and S0 galaxies has revamped the debate on the
          formation  and evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and
          on  the  role  of  globular  clusters in these processes. While
          overall stellar mass drives the amount of X-ray binaries in old
          stellar  populations,  the  amount  of  sources in star forming
          galaxies  is  related  to the star formation rate. Short-lived,
          luminous,  high-mass  binaries  (HMXBs)  dominate  these  young
          populations. The most luminous sources in these systems are the
          debated  ULXs,  which  have been suggested to be ~100-1000 Msol
          black  holes,  but  could  alternatively  include  a  number of
          binaries  with stellar mass black holes. Very soft sources have
          also  been  discovered  in  many  galaxies  and their nature is
          currently  being  debated.  Observations of the deep X-ray sky,
          and  comparison  with  deep  optical surveys, are providing the
          first evidence of the X-ray evolution of galaxies.

          Title:  The  role  of differential rotation in the evolution of
          the r-mode instability
          Authors: Paulo M. Sá, Brigitte Tomé
          Comments:  4  pages,  2  figures,  in  Proceedings  of  the 5th
          International  Workshop  "New Worlds in Astroparticle Physics",
          Faro, Portugal, 8-10 January 2005
          We  discuss  the role of differential rotation in the evolution
          of   the   l=2   r-mode  instability  of  a  newly  born,  hot,
          rapidly-rotating  neutron  star. It is shown that the amplitude
          of  the  r-mode  saturates  in  a  natural  way at a value that
          depends  on the amount of differential rotation at the time the
          instability   becomes   active.   It   is   also   shown  that,
          independently of the saturation amplitude of the mode, the star
          spins  down  to  a  rotation  rate  that  is  comparable to the
          inferred   initial   rotation  rates  of  the  fastest  pulsars
          associated with supernova remnants.

          Title: The faintest accretors
          Authors: Andrew King, Rudy Wijnands
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS Letter
          Recent  X-ray  observations have detected a class of very faint
          X-ray   transients  in  the  Galaxy  which  probably  reveal  a
          previously  unrecognised  type of accretion on to neutron stars
          or  black  holes.  We  show  that  these  systems  cannot  have
          descended  from binaries with stellar-mass components of normal
          composition.   Accretion  of  hydrogen-depleted  matter  on  to
          stellar-mass  black  holes  can account for individual systems,
          but requires that these transients should be observed to repeat
          within  a  few  years,  and  does  not explain why the class is
          distinctly faint.
          Two  other explanations appear to be quite natural. One invokes
          accretion  by  neutron  stars  or stellar-mass black holes from
          companions  which were already brown dwarfs or planets when the
          systems formed, i.e. which did not descend from low-mass stars.
          The  other  possibility is that these systems are the endpoints
          of  primordial (zero-metallicity) binaries in which the primary
          was  extremely massive, and collapsed to a black hole of mass >
          1000  solar masses. The (primordial) companion must by now have
          reached  an  extremely  low  mass  (<  0.01  solar mass) and be
          transferring  mass  at  a very low rate to the black hole. This
          picture  avoids  the  main  difficulty  encountered  by  models
          invoking    intermediate-mass    black    hole   formation   at
          non-primordial  metallicities,  and is a natural consequence of
          some current ideas about Population III star formation.

          Accelerators

          Comments:  Invited  paper  at the Symposium "The X-Ray Universe
          2005" held in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain Sept.2005
          Combining  resolved  spectroscopy with deep imaging, XMM-Newton
          is   providing   new  insights  on  the  particle  acceleration
          processes  long  known  to  be at work in the magnetospheres of
          isolated  neutron  stars.  According  to a standard theoretical
          interpretation,  in neutron stars' magnetospheres particles are
          accelerated  along  the  B  field lines and, depending on their
          charge, they can either move outward, to propagate in space, or
          be  funnelled  back,  towards the star surface. While particles
          impinging  on  the  neutron star surface should heat it at well
          defined spots, outgoing ones could radiate extended features in
          the  neutron star surroundings. By detecting hot spots, seen to
          come  in  and  out  of  sight  as  the star rotates, as well as
          extended  features  trailing  neutron stars as they move in the
          interstellar  medium,  XMM-Newton provides the first end-to-end
          test to the particle acceleration process.

          Title:  Dissipative  Effects in the Worldline Approach to Black
          Hole Dynamics
          Authors: Walter D. Goldberger (Yale), Ira Z. Rothstein (CMU)
          Comments: 19 pages 2 figures
          We   derive   a   long   wavelength  effective  point  particle
          description  of  four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. In
          this  effective  theory, absorptive effects are incorporated by
          introducing  degrees of freedom localized on the worldline that
          mimic  the interaction between the horizon and bulk fields. The
          correlation  functions of composite operators in this worldline
          theory  can  be obtained by standard matching calculations. For
          example,  we  obtain  the  low  frequency two-point function of
          multipole  worldline  operators  by  relating  them to the long
          wavelength  graviton  black  hole absorptive cross section. The
          effective theory is then used to predict the leading effects of
          absorption   in  several  astrophysically  motivated  examples,
          including  the  dynamics  of non-relativistic black hole binary
          inspirals  and the motion of a small black hole in an arbitrary
          background  geometry.  Our  results can be written compactly in
          terms  of  absorption cross sections, and can be easily applied
          to the dissipative dynamics of any compact object, e.g. neutron
          stars. The relation of our methodology to that developed in the
          context of the AdS/CFT correspondence is discussed.

          We present the discovery of the optical afterglow of GRB 050505
          and  an  optical  absorption  spectrum obtained with the Keck I
          10-m   telescope.   The   spectrum  exhibits  three  redshifted
          absorption  systems  with  the highest, at z=4.2748, arising in
          the  GRB host galaxy. The host absorption system is marked by a
          damped  Ly-alpha  (DLA)  feature with a neutral hydrogen column
          density  of  logN(HI)=22.05+/-0.10,  higher  than  that  of any
          QSO-DLA  detected  to date, but similar to several other recent
          measurements   from   GRB   spectra.  In  addition,  we  detect
          absorption  lines  from  both  low- and high-ionization species
          from  which  we  deduce  a  metallicity, Z~0.06 Z_solar, with a
          depletion  pattern  that  is  roughly  similar  to  that of the
          Galactic  warm halo, warm disk, or disk+halo. More importantly,
          we  detect  strong  absorption  from  SiII*  indicating a dense
          environment, n_H>10^2 cm^-3, in the vicinity of the burst, with
          a  size  of  about 4 pc. In addition, the CIV absorption system
          spans  a  velocity  range  of  about  1000  km/s,  which is not
          detected in any other absorption feature. We show that the most
          likely   interpretation   for   this  wide  velocity  range  is
          absorption  in  the  wind  from  the  progenitor  star. In this
          context,  the  lack  of corresponding SiIV absorption indicates
          that the progenitor had a mass of <25 M_solar and a metallicity
          <0.1  Z_solar,  and  therefore  required  a binary companion to
          eject  its  hydrogen  envelope  prior  to  the  GRB  explosion.
          Finally,  by extending the GRB-DLA sample to z~4.3 we show that
          these  objects  appear to follow a similar metallicity-redshift
          relation   as  in  QSO-DLAs,  but  with  systematically  higher
          metallicities.  It  remains  to  be  seen whether this trend is
          simply  due to the higher neutral hydrogen columns in GRB-DLAs,
          or  if  it  is  a  manifestation  of  different  star formation
          properties in GRB-DLAs. [abridged]

          Comments: 19 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  report  the  discovery  of  PSR  J1906+0746, a young 144-ms
          pulsar   in   a  highly  relativistic  3.98-hr  orbit  with  an
          eccentricity   of   0.085   and   expected  gravitational  wave
          coalescence  time  of  300 Myr. The new pulsar was found during
          precursor  survey  observations  with  the Arecibo 1.4-GHz feed
          array   system  and  retrospectively  detected  in  the  Parkes
          Multibeam  plane  pulsar  survey  data.  From  radio  follow-up
          observations  with  Arecibo,  Jodrell  Bank,  Green  Bank,  and
          Parkes, we have measured the spin-down and binary parameters of
          the  pulsar and its basic spectral and polarization properties.
          We  also present evidence for pulse profile evolution, which is
          likely due to geodetic precession, a relativistic effect caused
          by  the  misalignment  of  the  pulsar  spin  and total angular
          momentum  vectors. Our measurements show that PSR J1906+0746 is
          a  young  object with a characteristic age of 112 kyr. From the
          measured rate of orbital periastron advance 7.57+/-0.03 deg/yr,
          we  infer  a total system mass of 2.61+/-0.02 Msun. While these
          parameters  suggest that the PSR J1906+0746 binary system might
          be  a  younger  version  of the double pulsar system, intensive
          searches  for  radio pulses from the companion have so far been
          unsuccessful.  It  is therefore not known whether the companion
          is another neutron star or a massive white dwarf. Regardless of
          the nature of the companion, a simple calculation suggests that
          the  Galactic  birth rate of binaries similar to PSR J1906+0746
          is  60/Myr.  This  implies  that  PSR  J1906+0746  will  make a
          significant  contribution  to the computed cosmic inspiral rate
          of compact binary systems.

          we  study  the long-term evolution of the accretion disk around
          the  neutron  star in Be/X-ray binaries. We confirm the earlier
          result by Hayasaki & Okazaki (2004) that the disk evolves via a
          two-stage  process,  which  consists  of the initial developing
          stage  and  the  later developed stage. The peak mass-accretion
          rate  is  distributed  around  apastron after the disk is fully
          developed.  This  indicates  that  the  modulation  of the mass
          accretion  rate  is essentially caused by an inward propagation
          of  the one-armed spiral wave. The X-ray luminosity peak around
          the  apastron  could  provide  circumstatial  evidence  for  an
          persistent disk around the neutron star in Be/X-ray binaries.

          We  compare the accretion flow onto the neutron star induced by
          Roche lobe overflow with that by the overflow from the Be disk,
          in  a zero eccentricity, short period binary with the same mass
          transfer  rate,  performing three-dimensional Smoothed Particle
          Hydrodynamics  simulations. We find that a persistent accretion
          disk  is  formed  around  the  neutron  star in both cases. The
          circularization  radius  of  the material transferred via Roche
          lobe  overflow  is  larger than that of the material transfered
          from the Be disk. Thus, the growth of the accretion disk in the
          former  case  becomes  significantly  slower than in the latter
          case.  In both cases, the mass accretion rate is very small and
          varies  little with orbital phase, which is consistent with the
          observed  X-ray  behaviour  of  Be/X-ray binaries with circular
          orbits (e.g. XTE J1543-568).

          Title:  Ultraluminous  X-ray  Sources  Powered  by  Radiatively
          Efficient  Two-Phased  Super-Eddington  Accretion  onto Stellar
          Mass Black holes
          Authors: Aristotle Socrates, Shane W. Davis
          Comments: 11 pages
          The  radiation  spectra  of many of the brightest ultraluminous
          X-ray  sources  (ULXs)  are  dominated  by  a  hard  power  law
          component,  likely powered by a hot, optically thin corona that
          Comptonizes  soft  seed  photons emitted from a cool, optically
          thick  black  hole  accretion  disk. Before its dissipation and
          subsequent conversion into coronal photon power, the randomized
          gravitational  binding  energy  responsible  for  powering  ULX
          phenomena  must separate from the mass of its origin by a means
          other  than,  and  quicker  than,  electron scattering-mediated
          radiative  diffusion. Therefore, the release of accretion power
          in  ULXs is not necessarily subject to Eddington-limited photon
          trapping,  as long as it occurs in a corona. Motivated by these
          basic  considerations,  we  present  a model of ULXs powered by
          geometrically  thin accretion onto stellar mass black holes. We
          argue that the radiative efficiency of the flow remains high if
          the  corona is magnetized or optically thin and the majority of
          the  accretion  power  escapes  in the form of radiation rather
          than  an  outflow. Within the context of the current black hole
          X-ray  binary  paradigm,  our  ULX  model  may  be viewed as an
          extension  of the very high state observed in Galactic sources.

          Title:  A  closer  look  at  the X-ray transient XTE J1908+094:
          identification of two new near-infrared candidate counterparts
          Authors:  Sylvain  Chaty  (AIME),  Roberto  P.  Mignani (AIME),
          Gianluca Israel (AIME)
          Comments: accepted for publication in MNRAS, 5 pages, 3 figures
          We  had  reported  in  Chaty,  Mignani,  Israel  (2002)  on the
          near-infrared (NIR) identification of a possible counterpart to
          the  black  hole  candidate  XTE  J1908+094  obtained  with the
          ESO/NTT.  Here, we present new, follow-up, CFHT adaptive optics
          observations  of  the  XTE  J1908+094 field, which resolved the
          previously  proposed  counterpart  in  two objects separated by
          about  0.8". Assuming that both objects are potential candidate
          counterparts,  we  derive  that the binary system is a low-mass
          system   with  a  companion  star  which  could  be  either  an
          intermediate/late  type  (A-K) main sequence star at a distance
          of  3-10  kpc,  or  a  late-type ($>$K) main sequence star at a
          distance  of 1-3 kpc. However, we show that the brighter of the
          two  objects  (J ~ 20.1, H ~ 18.7, K' ~ 17.8) is more likely to
          be  the  real  counterpart of the X-ray source. Its position is
          more  compatible with our astrometric solution, and colours and
          magnitudes  of  the  other  object  are not consistent with the
          lower  limit  of  3  kpc  derived  independently  from the peak
          bolometric  flux  of  XTE  J1908+094.  Further multi-wavelength
          observations  of  both  candidate  counterparts  are crucial in
          order to solve the pending identification.

          Annales Universitatis Turkuensis, C. Flynn, ed
          (Abridged)  In  this  celebratory contribution, we present some
          new  data  from  standard  star  cluster  modelling  containing
          primordial  binaries  and  triples,  as  well as results from a
          binary  black  hole simulation with two massive members. In the
          star  cluster  case,  the  process  of  mass loss from evolving
          stars,   together   with  general  mass  segregation,  promotes
          favourable   interactions   involving   compact  subsystems  of
          binaries   and   triples  in  the  central  region.  Three-body
          interactions  often  lead  to  energetic ejections, with one or
          more  of  the  components  attaining  relatively large terminal
          velocities  which can be observed in principle. The second type
          of  stellar  system to be discussed is based on the scenario of
          two  approaching galactic cores with density cusps, each having
          a  massive  black hole. After the subsystems become well mixed,
          the  two massive components soon form a hard binary which gains
          energy  by  ejecting other members. Such a massive binary has a
          large  cross  section  and  can  be very effective in depleting
          bound  stars  from  the  core. Again high-velocity escapers are
          produced,  with  their terminal speeds related to the shrinking
          binary size which eventually leads to coalescence.

          Title: A possible mechanism for QPOs modulation in neutron star

          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
          Journal-ref: Astronomische Nachrichten 326 (2005), 845-848
          It   was  pointed  out  by  Paczynski  (1987)  that  the  X-ray
          luminosity  of accreting neutron stars is very sensitive to the
          physical   properties  of  the  accretion  flow  close  to  the
          innermost   stable  circular  orbit.  The  X-ray  radiation  is
          dominated by that emitted in the boundary layer, where accreted
          matter  hits  a  star  surface.  The  X-ray  luminosity  of the
          boundary  layer is proportional to the local accretion rate. In
          this note, we estimate local accretion rate variations from the
          disk  that undergoes non-stationary axisymmetric perturbations.
          The perturbations are given by the poloidal-velocity potential.
          We  obtain  a  simple  formula describing the modulation of the
          accretion  rate for the particular case of global vertical disk
          oscillations  that  have been recently studied by Abramowicz et
          al. (2005).

          Letters (accepted; publish Dec 19, 2005)
          Two  short  (<2  s)  g-ray  bursts  (GRBs)  have  recently been
          localized  and  fading  afterglow  counterparts  detected.  The
          combination of these two results left unclear the nature of the
          host  galaxies  of  the  bursts, because one was a star-forming
          dwarf,  while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. Here
          we  report the X-ray localization of a short burst (GRB 050724)
          with  unusual  g-ray  and X-ray properties. The X-ray afterglow
          lies  off  the  centre of an elliptical galaxy at a redshift of
          z=0.258,   coincident   with   the   position   determined   by
          ground-based  optical  and radio observations. The low level of
          star   formation  typical  for  elliptical  galaxies  makes  it
          unlikely  that  the burst originated n a supernova explosion. A
          supernova origin was also ruled out for GRB 050709, even though
          that  burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation.
          The  isotropic  energy  for  the  short bursts is 2-3 orders of
          magnitude  lower  han  that  for  the  long bursts. Our results
          therefore  suggest  that an alternative source of bursts -- the
          of binary systems of neutron stars or a neutron star-black hole
          pair -- are the progenitors of short bursts.

          utilzing  a new gauge condition which allows the black holes to

          The `radio sky' is relatively unexplored for transient signals,
          although  the potential of radio-transient searches is high, as
          demonstrated  recently by the discovery of a previously unknown
          type  of source which varies on timescales of minutes to hours.
          Here  we  report  a  new  large-scale  search for radio sources
          varying  on  much  shorter  timescales.  This  has  revealed 11
          objects   characterized  by  single,  dispersed  bursts  having
          durations  between  2  and  30  ms.  The average time intervals
          between  bursts  range  from  4  minutes to 3 hours, with radio
          emission  typically  detectable  for  <  1  s  per day. From an
          analysis  of  the  burst  arrival  times,  we  have  identified
          periodicities in the range 0.4 - 7 s for ten of the 11 sources,
          suggesting  a  rotating  neutron star origin. Despite the small
          number  of  sources  presently detected, their ephemeral nature
          implies a total Galactic population which significantly exceeds
          that  of  the  regularly pulsing radio pulsars. Five of the ten
          sources  have  periods greater than 4 s, and period derivatives
          have  been measured for three of the sources, with one having a
          very  high  inferred  magnetic field of 5e13 G, suggesting that
          this  new  population  is  related to other classes of isolated
          neutron stars observed at X-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths.

          We  discuss  our  recent  discovery of the giant radio emission
          from  the  Crab  pulsar at its high frequency components (HFCs)
          phases  and  show  the  polarization  characteristic  of  these
          pulses.  This  leads  us  to  a  suggestion  that  there  is no
          difference  in  the  emission mechanism of the main pulse (MP),
          interpulse   (IP)   and   HFCs.  We  briefly  review  the  size
          distributions of the Crab giant radio pulses (GRPs) and discuss
          general  characteristics  of the GRP phenomenon in the Crab and
          other pulsars.

          We   report  the  discovery  of  propeller-driven  outflows  in
          axisymmetric  magnetohydrodynamic simulations of disk accretion
          to rapidly rotating magnetized stars. Matter outflows in a wide
          cone and is centrifugally ejected from the inner regions of the
          disk.  Closer  to  the  axis  there  is  a  strong, collimated,
          magnetically  dominated  outflow of energy and angular momentum
          carried  by  the  open  magnetic field lines from the star. The
          ``efficiency'' of the propeller may be very high in the respect
          that  most  of  the  incoming  disk matter is expelled from the
          system  in  winds.  The  star  spins-down  rapidly  due  to the
          magnetic  interaction  with the disk through closed field lines
          and with corona through open field lines. Diffusive and viscous
          interaction  between  magnetosphere and the disk are important:
          no  outflows  were  observed  for  very  small  values  of  the
          diffusivity   and   viscosity.  These  simulation  results  are
          applicable  to  the  early  stages  of evolution of classical T
          Tauri stars and to different stages of evolution of cataclysmic
          variables  and  neutron stars in binary systems. As an example,
          we  have  shown  that  young  rapidly rotating magnetized CTTSs
          spin-down  to  their  present  slow  rotation in less than 10^6
          years.

          Title:  To  probe  into pulsar's interior through gravitational
          waves
          Authors: R. X. Xu (PKU)
          Comments: 15 pages, 2 figures, and i table
          The  gravitational  radiation  from  pulsar-like  compact stars
          depends on the state of dense matter at supranuclear densities,
          i.e.,  the  nature of pulsar (e.g., either normal neutron stars
          or  quark stars). The solid quark star model is focused for the
          nature  of pulsar-like objects. Possible gravitational emission
          from  quark  stars (either fluid or solid) during the birth and
          later lifetime are discussed. Several observational features to
          distinguish  various models for pulsar-like stars are proposed.
          It is addressed that the gravitational wave behaviors should be
          mass-dependent.  Based on the data from the second LIGO science
          run, the upper limits of $R\cdot \theta^{1/5}$ and thus $M\cdot
          \theta^{3/5}$  ($M$:  mass,  $R$:  radius, and $\theta$: wobble
          angle) are provided for millisecond pulsars.

          The  aligned  pulsars  whose  rotation axes and magnetic dipole
          axes  are  parallel  should  be  positively  charged. The total
          charge   of   pulsars   is  calculated  after  considering  the
          electromagnetic  field  in  and  out  the star under a specific
          condition.   The  statistical  relation  between  the  pulsar's
          rotation  energy  loss  rate (or the period derivative) and the
          period  may  hint that the millisecond radio pulsars with small
          periods could be low-mass bare strange stars.

          Following  the  suggestion of Zuckerman et al. (2001, ApJ, 562,
          L87),  we  consider the evidence that 51 Eri (spectral type F0)
          and  GJ  3305  (M0),  historically classified as unrelated main
          sequence  stars  in  the solar neighborhood, are instead a wide
          physical binary system and members of the young beta Pic moving
          group  (BPMG).  The  BPMG is the nearest (d < 50 pc) of several
          groups  of  young  stars  with  ages  around  10  Myr  that are
          kinematically   convergent  with  the  Oph-Sco-Cen  Association
          (OSCA), the nearest OB star association. Combining SAAO optical
          photometry,      Hobby-Eberly     Telescope     high-resolution
          spectroscopy, Chandra X-ray data, and UCAC2 catalog kinematics,
          we  confirm  with  high  confidence  that  the system is indeed
          extremely  young.  GJ 3305 itself exhibits very strong magnetic
          activity  but  has rapidly depleted most of its lithium. The 51
          Eri/GJ 3305 system is the westernmost known member of the OSCA,
          lying  110 pc from the main subgroups. The system is similar to
          the  BPMG  wide  binary HD 172555/CD -64d1208 and the HD 104237
          quintet,  suggesting  that dynamically fragile multiple systems
          can  survive  the  turbulent  environments of their natal giant
          molecular  cloud  complexes,  while  still  being imparted high
          dispersion  velocities.  Nearby young systems such as these are
          excellent  targets for evolved circumstellar disk and planetary
          studies,  having  stellar  ages  comparable to that of the late
          phases of planet formation.

          Title:  Nonthermal  Production  and  Perturbation  Evolution of
          Sterile Neutrino Dark
          Authors: Kevork Abazajian (LANL)
          Sterile  neutrinos,  fermions  with no standard model couplings
          [SU(2)  singlets],  are  predicted  by  most  extensions of the
          standard  model,  and  may  be  the dark matter. I describe the
          production  and  linear  perturbation  evolution  in  the early
          universe  of this dark matter candidate. I calculate production
          of  sterile neutrino dark matter including effects of Freidmann
          dynamics  dictated  by the quark-hadron transition and particle
          population, the alteration of finite temperature effective mass
          of active neutrinos due to the presence of thermal leptons, and
          heating  of  the  coupled  species  due to the disappearance of
          degrees  of  freedom  in  the  plasma.  These effects leave the
          sterile  neutrinos  with a non-trivial momentum distribution. I
          also  calculate  the  evolution  of  sterile  neutrino  density
          perturbations  in  the early universe through the linear regime
          and  provide  a fitting function form for the transfer function
          describing the suppression of small scale fluctuations for this
          warm  dark  matter candidate. The results presented here differ
          dramatically   both   qualitatively   and  quantitatively  from
          previous  work  due  to the inclusion here of relevant physical
          effects.

          Title: Galactic Globular Clusters with Luminous X-Ray Binaries
          Authors: Joel N. Bregman
          Comments:  20  pages,  8 figures; accepted in The Astrophysical
          Journal
          Luminous  X-ray  binaries  (>1E34  erg/s, LMXBs) have a neutron
          star  or  black hole primary, and in globular clusters, most of
          these close binaries are expected to be have evolved from wider
          binaries  through  dynamical  interactions with other stars. We
          sought  to  find  a  predictor  of  this formation rate that is
          representative  of  the initial properties of globular clusters
          rather  than  of  the  highly  evolved  core quantities. Models
          indicate  the  half-light  quantities  best reflect the initial
          conditions,  so  we  examine  whether  the associated dynamical
          interaction  rate,  proportional  to L^1.5 r^-2.5, is useful in
          understanding  the  presence  of luminous LMXBs in the Galactic
          globular  cluster system. We find that while LMXB clusters with
          large  values  of  L^1.5  r^-2.5 preferentially host LMXBs, the
          systems  must  also have half-mass relaxation times below about
          1E9  yr.  This  relaxation  time effect probably occurs because
          several   relaxation   times  are  required  to  modify  binary
          separations,  a  timescale  that  must  be shorter than cluster
          ages.  The  frequency of finding an LMXB cluster is enhanced if
          the  cluster  is  metal-rich  and  if  it is close to the bulge
          region.  The  dependence  upon  metallicity  is most likely due
          either  to  differing  initial  mass functions at the high mass
          end,  or  because  bulge systems evolve more rapidly from tidal
          interactions  with  the  bulge.  This  approach  can be used to
          investigate  globular  cluster  systems  in  external galaxies,
          where core properties are unresolved.

          The  Crab  nebula and its pulsar have been observed for about 3
          hours  with  the high-speed photo-polarimeter OPTIMA in January
          2002  at  the  Calar  Alto  3.5m  telescope.  The  Crab  pulsar
          intensity  and  polarization  are  determined  at all phases of
          rotation with higher statistical accuracy than ever. Therefore,
          we  were  able  to  separate  the  so-called  'off-pulse' phase
          emission  (with an intensity of about 1.2% compared to the main
          peak,  assumed  to  be  present  at all phases) from the pulsed
          emission   and  show  the  'net'  polarization  of  the  pulsed
          structures.   Recent  theoretical  results  indicate  that  the
          measured  optical polarization of the Crab pulsar is similar to
          expectations  from  a  two-pole  caustic  emission  model  or a
          striped pulsar wind model.

          Comments: 15 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  show  that the X-ray source W31 in the core of the globular
          cluster  47  Tucanae  is  physically associated with the bright
          blue  straggler  BSS-7.  The  two  sources  are astrometrically
          matched   to   0.061  arcseconds,  with  a  chance  coincidence
          probability  of  less  than 1 per cent. We then analyse optical
          time-series photometry obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope
          (HST)  and  find that BSS-7 displays a 1.56 day periodic signal
          in  the I band. We also construct a broad-band (far-ultraviolet
          through far-red) spectral energy distribution for BSS-7 and fit
          this  with  single  and  binary  models.  The binary model is a
          better fit to the data, and we derive the corresponding stellar
          parameters.
          All of our findings suggest that the BSS-7 system consists of a
          blue     straggler     primary     with     an    X-ray-active,
          upper-main-sequence  companion.  The formation of such a system
          must  have  involved at least three stars, so the simplest blue
          straggler  formation scenarios -- primordial binary coalescence
          or a single 2-body collision -- cannot account for it. However,
          our  results are consistent with recent N-body models, in which
          blue  stragglers  often  form  via multiple encounters that can
          involve both single and binary stars.

          Only  seven  radio-quiet isolated neutron stars (INSs) emitting
          thermal X rays are known, a sample that has yet to definitively
          address  such  fundamental  issues  as the equation of state of
          degenerate  neutron  matter.  We describe a selection algorithm
          based on a cross-correlation of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS)
          and  the  Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that identifies X-ray
          error  circles  devoid of plausible optical counterparts to the
          SDSS  g~22  magnitudes  limit.  We  quantitatively characterize
          these  error  circles as optically blank; they may host INSs or
          other  similarly  exotic  X-ray  sources such as radio-quiet BL
          Lacs,  obscured  AGN,  etc. Our search is an order of magnitude
          more  selective than previous searches for optically blank RASS
          error  circles,  and  excludes  the 99.9% of error circles that
          contain  more  common  X-ray-emitting  subclasses.  We  find 11
          candidates, nine of which are new. While our search is designed
          to  find  the best INS candidates and not to produce a complete
          list  of  INSs in the RASS, it is reassuring that our number of
          candidates  is  consistent with predictions from INS population
          models.   Further   X-ray  observations  will  obtain  pinpoint
          positions  and  determine  whether  these  sources are entirely
          optically  blank  at  g~22,  supporting  the presence of likely
          isolated  neutron stars and perhaps enabling detailed follow-up
          studies of neutron star physics.

          scalar  field  is  studied.  The  setup  is  rather general and
          includes  the  Randall-Sundrum and dilatonic braneworlds models
          as  particular  cases. We discuss the cosmological evolution of
          the  system  and  conclude  that,  in  a  two brane system, the
          negative  tension brane is generally expected to evolve towards
          a   null   warp-factor  state.  This  implies,  for  late  time
          cosmology,  that both branes end up interacting weakly. We also
          analyze  the  observational constraints imposed by solar-system
          and  binary-pulsar  tests on the braneworld configuration. This
          is  done  by  considering  the small deviations produced by the
          branes  on  the 4-D gravitational interaction between bodies in
          the  same  brane.  Using  these  constraints  we  show that the
          geometry  around  the  braneworld  is strongly warped, and that
          both branes must be far apart.

          Title:  A  two-dimensional electrodynamical outer gap model for
          gamma-ray pulsars: Gamma-ray spectrum
          Authors: J.Takata, S.Shibata, K.Hirotani, H.-K.Chang

          MNRAS
          A  two-dimensional  electrodynamical  model  is  used  to study
          particle  acceleration  in the outer magnetosphere of a pulsar.
          The  charge  depletion from the Goldreich-Julian charge density
          causes  a  large electric field along the magnetic field lines.
          The  charge particles are accelerated by the electric field and
          emit  $\gamma$-rays  via  the  curvature  process.  Some of the
          emitted  $\gamma$-rays may collide with $X$-ray photons to make
          new  pairs,  which are accelerated again on the different field
          lines in the gap and proceed similar processes. We simulate the
          pair  creation  cascade  in the meridional plane using the pair
          creation  mean-free  path,  in  which the $X$-ray photon number
          density  is  proportional to inverse square of radial distance.
          With  the  space charge density determined by the pair creation
          simulation, we solve the electric structure of the outer gap in
          the meridional plane and calculate the curvature spectrum.
          Because the two-dimensional model can link both gap width along
          the  magnetic  field  line  and  trans-field thickness with the
          spectral  cut-off  energy  and  flux,  we can diagnose both the
          current  through  the  gap  and  inclination  angle between the
          rotational  and  magnetic axes. We apply the theory to the Vela
          pulsar. By comparing the results with the $EGRET$ data, we rule
          out any cases that have a large particle injection at the outer
          boundary.   We   also   suggest   the   inclination   angle  of
          $\alpha_{inc}\geq65^{\circ}$.  The  present  model predicts the
          outer  gap  starting  from  near  the  conventional null charge
          surface for the Vela pulsar.

          Title: Resonance Overlap is Responsible for Ejecting Planets in
          Binary Systems
          Authors: Lawrence R. Mudryk, Yanqin Wu
          Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophyical Journal.
          Consists of 8 pages, 6 figures
          A  planet  orbiting  around  a  star  in a binary system can be
          ejected  if  it  lies  too far from its host star. We find that
          instability  boundaries first obtained in numerical studies can
          be   explained   by   overlap   between  sub-resonances  within
          mean-motion resonances (mostly of the j:1 type). Strong secular
          forcing from the companion displaces the centroids of different
          sub-resonances,  producing  large regions of resonance overlap.
          Planets  lying  within  these  overlapping  regions  experience
          chaotic  diffusion, which in most cases leads to their eventual
          ejection.  The  overlap region extends to shorter-period orbits
          as  either  the  companion's mass or its eccentricity increase.
          Our   analytical   calculations   reproduce   the   instability
          boundaries   observed   in  numerical  studies  and  yield  the
          following  two  additional  results.  Firstly,  the instability
          boundary  as  a  function  of eccentricity is jagged; thus, the
          widest  stable  orbit  could  be reduced from previously quoted
          values  by as much as 20%. Secondly, very high order resonances
          (e.g.,  50:3)  do  not  significantly  modify  the  instability
          boundary  despite  the  fact  that  these  weak  resonances can
          produce   slow   chaotic  diffusion  which  may  be  missed  by
          finite-duration   numerical   integrations.   We  present  some
          numerical   evidence  for  the  first  result.  More  extensive
          experiments  are  called  for to confirm these conclusions. For
          the  special  case  of circular binaries, we find that the Hill
          criterion  (based  on  the  critical Jacobi integral) yields an
          instability  boundary  that is very similar to that obtained by
          resonance overlap arguments, making the former both a necessary
          and a sufficient condition for planet instability.

          Title:  Magnetar  giant  flares  and afterglows as relativistic
          magnetized explosions
          Authors: Maxim Lyutikov (UBC, University of Rochester)
          Comments: 23 pages, 3 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          (Abridged)  We  propose  that  giant  flares  on Soft Gamma-Ray
          Repeaters  produce  relativistic,  strongly  magnetized, weakly
          baryon  loaded  magnetic  clouds,  somewhat  analogous to solar
          coronal  mass  ejection  (CME)  events.  Flares  are  driven by
          unwinding of internal non-potential magnetic fields which leads
          to  slow  build-up  of  magnetic  energy outside of the neutron
          star.  For  large  magnetospheric  currents, corresponding to a
          large  twist  of external magnetic field, magnetosphere becomes
          dynamically  unstable  on \Alfven crossing times scale of inner
          magnetosphere,  $t_A  \sim  R_{NS}/c  \sim 30 \mu$sec. Released
          magnetic  energy results in formation of a strongly magnetized,
          pair-loaded,    quasi-spherically    expanding    flux    rope,
          topologically  connected  by magnetic field to the neutron star
          during the prompt flare emission. Magnetic stresses of the tied
          flux  rope  lead  to late collimation of the expansion, on time
          scales  longer  than  giant  flare  duration. Relativistic bulk
          motion  of  the  expanding magnetic cloud, directed at an angle
          $\theta  \sim  135^\circ$  to  the line of sight (away from the
          observer),  results  in  a strongly non-spherical forward shock
          with  observed  non-relativistic  apparent  expansion  and bulk
          motion velocities $\beta_{app} \sim \cot \theta/2 \sim 0.4 $ at
          times  of first radio observations approximately one week after
          the  burst.  Interaction  with  a shell of wind-shocked ISM and
          then   with   the   unshocked  ISM  leads  to  deceleration  to
          non-relativistic  velocities  approximately one month after the
          flare.

          Title: Roche Lobe Sizes in Deep-MOND Gravity
          Authors: HongSheng Zhao
          Comments:  4  pages,  2  figures,  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics
          Letter, in press
          MOdified   Newtonian   Dynamics  (MOND)  is  evolving  from  an
          empirical  to  a  decent  theory respecting fundamental physics
          after   Bekenstein   (2004)  showed  that  lensing  and  Hubble
          expansion  can be modeled rigourously in a Modified Relativity.
          However, many properties of MOND are obscured by its non-linear
          Poisson's  equation.  Here  we  study the effect of tides for a
          binary  stellar  system  or  a  baryonic  satellite-host galaxy
          system.  We  show that the Roche lobe is more squashed than the
          Newtonian  case  due  to  the  anisotropic  dilation  effect in
          deep-MOND.  We  prove  analytically  that the Roche lobe volume
          scales  linearly  with  the  "true" baryonic mass ratio in both
          Newtonian   and   deep-MOND   regimes,   insensitive   to   the
          modification to the inertia mass. Hence accurate Roche radii of
          satellites  can  break  the  degeneracy of MOND and dark matter
          theory.  Globular  clusters  and  dwarf  galaxies of comparable
          luminosities  and  distances  show  a  factor of ten scatter in
          limiting   radii;   this   is   difficult  to  explain  in  any
          "mass-tracing-light" universe.

          however  those  cases  ;  The possible hints of new mechanisms,
          especially   the  valence  diquark  breaking,  are  considered.

          Akeno  classical EAS array coincides with the spectrum measured
          recently  by  the  Hires  Stereo  experiment,  we  point  out a
          possible  overestimation  of  the  primary  energy  in inclined

          Newtonian   and   deep-MOND   regimes,   insensitive   to   the
          modification to the inertia mass. Hence accurate Roche radii of
          satellites  can  break  the  degeneracy of MOND and dark matter
          theory.  Globular  clusters  and  dwarf  galaxies of comparable
          luminosities  and  distances  show  a  factor of ten scatter in
          limiting   radii;   this   is   difficult  to  explain  in  any
          "mass-tracing-light" universe.

          Title:  Hadronic  Cosmic  Ray  Interactions Near the LHC Energy
          Region and in the UHE Domain of Giant EAS
          Authors: J.-N. Capdevielle (APC)
          Comments:  Invited  talk  at  11th  International Conference on
          Elastic   and   Diffractive  Scattering:  Towards  High  Energy
          Frontiers: The 20th Anniversary of the Blois Workshops, Chateau
          de Blois, Blois, France, 15-20 May 2005
          The  fluctuations  of  $\gamma$  ray  families  simulated  with
          CORSIKA  in the energy region 3$\times10^{15}-10^{17}$eV on the
          basis  of  standard $Ln s$ collider physics exhibits alignments
          of  secondaries  in  the  stratosphere and at ground level. The
          remarkable  event  registrated on the Concorde doesn't fit well
          however  those  cases  ;  The possible hints of new mechanisms,
          especially   the  valence  diquark  breaking,  are  considered.
          Observing  that  the  extrapolation  of the original cosmic ray
          primary spectrum derived from the size spectrum measured in the
          Akeno  classical EAS array coincides with the spectrum measured
          recently  by  the  Hires  Stereo  experiment,  we  point  out a
          possible  overestimation  of  the  primary  energy  in inclined
          showers of the surface arrays like AGASA.

          Title:   Statistics   of  Pressure  Fluctuations  in  Decaying,

          Authors: Chirag Kalelkar

          Subj-class:  Statistical  Mechanics;  Fluid  Dynamics;  Chaotic
          Dynamics
          We   present   results   from   a  systematic  direct-numerical
          simulation  study  of  pressure  fluctuations  in  an unforced,
          incompressible,  homogeneous,  and isotropic, three-dimensional
          turbulent  fluid.  At  cascade  completion,  isosurfaces of low
          pressure  are  found  to  be  organised  as  slender filaments,
          whereas  the  predominant  isostructures  appear sheet-like. We
          exhibit  several  new  results,  including plots of probability
          distributions   of   the   spatial   pressure-difference,   the
          pressure-gradient    norm,   and   the   eigenvalues   of   the
          pressure-hessian tensor. Plots of the temporal evolution of the
          mean  pressure-gradient  norm,  and the mean eigenvalues of the
          pressure-hessian   tensor  are  also  exhibited.  We  find  the
          statistically  preferred  orientations between the eigenvectors
          of  the  pressure-hessian  tensor,  the  pressure-gradient, the
          eigenvectors  of the strain-rate tensor, the vorticity, and the
          velocity.  Statistical  properties of the non-local part of the
          pressure-hessian tensor are also exhibited, for the first time.
          We  present  numerical  tests  (in  the  viscous  case) of some
          conjectures  of  Ohkitani [Phys. Fluids A {\bf 5}, 2570 (1993)]

          Title:   Post-Minkowski   action   for  point-particles  and  a

          Authors: John L. Friedman (UWM), Koji Uryu (SISSA)
          Comments: 32 pages, 7 figures
          Two  Fokker  actions  and corresponding equations of motion are
          obtained for two point particles in a post-Minkowski framework,
          in   which   the  field  of  each  particle  is  given  by  the
          half-retarded   +  half-advanced  solution  to  the  linearized
          Einstein   equations.   The  first  action  is  parametrization
          invariant,   the   second  a  generalization  of  the  affinely
          parametrized  quadratic  action  for  a  relativistic particle.
          Expressions  for  a  conserved  4-momentum and angular momentum
          tensor  are obtained in terms of the particles' trajectories in
          this  post-Minkowski  approximation.  A  formal solution to the
          equations  of motion is found for a binary system with circular
          orbits.  For  a  bound  system of this kind, the post-Minkowski
          solution  is a toy model that omits nonlinear terms of relevant
          post-Newtonian  order;  and we also obtain a Fokker action that
          is  accurate  to  first  post-Newtonian order, by adding to the
          post-Minkowski  action  a  term  cubic  in the particle masses.
          Curiously, the conserved energy and angular momentum associated
          with  the  Fokker  action  are each finite and well-defined for
          this  bound  2-particle  system despite the fact that the total
          energy  and  angular  momentum  of the radiation field diverge.
          Corresponding  solutions  and conserved quantites are found for
          two  scalar charges (for electromagnetic charges we exhibit the
          solution   found   by   Schild).   For   a   broad   class   of
          parametrization-invariant  Fokker  actions and for the affinely
          parametrized   action,  binary  systems  with  circular  orbits
          satisfy  the relation $dE = \Omega dL$ (a form of the first law
          of  thermodynamics),  relating  the energy,angular velocity and
          angular momentum of nearby equilibrium configurations.

          Equilibria of binary neutron stars in close circular orbits are
          computed  numerically  in  a  waveless approximation to general
          relativity.  The full Einstein equation is solved on an initial
          hypersurface  to  obtain  an  asymptotically  flat  form of the
          4-metric  and  an  extrinsic  curvature  whose  time derivative
          vanishes  in a comoving frame. Two independent numerical codes,
          one  based  on  a  finite  difference  method,  the  other on a
          spectral  method,  are  developed,  and solution sequences that
          model inspiraling binary neutron stars during the final several
          orbits  are  successfully  computed.  The binding energy of the
          system  near  its  final orbit deviates from earlier results of
          third   post-Newtonian   and   of  spatially  conformally  flat
          calculations.  The  new solutions may serve as initial data for
          merger simulations and as members of quasiequilibrium sequences
          to  generate  gravitational  wave  templates,  and  may improve
          estimates of the gravitational-wave cutoff frequency set by the
          last inspiral orbit.

          Title: Constraining the Radii of Neutron Stars with Terrestrial
          Nuclear Laboratory Data
          Authors: Bao-An Li, Andrew W. Steiner
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures; submitted to PRL
          Neutron  star radii are primarily determined by the pressure of
          isospin asymmetric matter which is proportional to the slope of
          the  nuclear  symmetry energy. Available terrestrial laboratory
          data  on  the  isospin  diffusion  in  heavy-ion  reactions  at
          intermediate  energies  and studies of the size of neutron skin
          in  Pb-208  constrain  the  slope of the symmetry energy. Using
          this  constraint, we show that the radius (radiation radius) of
          a  1.4  solar mass neutron star is between 11.5 (14.4) and 13.6
          (16.3)  km.  The  available laboratory data also indicates that
          the direct URCA process will occur in neutron stars with masses
          larger than about 1.39 solar masses.

          Equilibria of binary neutron stars in close circular orbits are
          computed  numerically  in  a  waveless approximation to general
          relativity.  The full Einstein equation is solved on an initial
          hypersurface  to  obtain  an  asymptotically  flat  form of the
          4-metric  and  an  extrinsic  curvature  whose  time derivative
          vanishes  in a comoving frame. Two independent numerical codes,
          one  based  on  a  finite  difference  method,  the  other on a
          spectral  method,  are  developed,  and solution sequences that
          model inspiraling binary neutron stars during the final several
          orbits  are  successfully  computed.  The binding energy of the
          system  near  its  final orbit deviates from earlier results of
          third   post-Newtonian   and   of  spatially  conformally  flat
          calculations.  The  new solutions may serve as initial data for
          merger simulations and as members of quasiequilibrium sequences
          to  generate  gravitational  wave  templates,  and  may improve
          estimates of the gravitational-wave cutoff frequency set by the
          last inspiral orbit.

          Title: Constraining the Radii of Neutron Stars with Terrestrial
          Nuclear Laboratory Data
          Authors: Bao-An Li, Andrew W. Steiner
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures; submitted to PRL
          Neutron  star radii are primarily determined by the pressure of
          isospin asymmetric matter which is proportional to the slope of
          the  nuclear  symmetry energy. Available terrestrial laboratory
          data  on  the  isospin  diffusion  in  heavy-ion  reactions  at
          intermediate  energies  and studies of the size of neutron skin
          in  Pb-208  constrain  the  slope of the symmetry energy. Using
          this  constraint, we show that the radius (radiation radius) of
          a  1.4  solar mass neutron star is between 11.5 (14.4) and 13.6
          (16.3)  km.  The  available laboratory data also indicates that
          the direct URCA process will occur in neutron stars with masses
          larger than about 1.39 solar masses.

          Title:  Time  Variability in the X-ray Nebula Powered by Pulsar
          B1509-58
          Authors: T. DeLaney, B. M. Gaensler, J. Arons, M. J. Pivovaroff
          Comments: accepted to ApJ, 14 pages, 8 figures
          We  use  new  and  archival Chandra and ROSAT data to study the
          time  variability  of  the  X-ray emission from the pulsar wind
          nebula  (PWN) powered by PSR B1509-58 on timescales of one week
          to  twelve years. There is variability in the size, number, and
          brightness of compact knots appearing within 20" of the pulsar,
          with  at  least one knot showing a possible outflow velocity of
          ~0.6c  (assuming  a  distance  to  the  source of 5.2 kpc). The
          transient  nature  of  these  knots  may indicate that they are
          produced  by  turbulence in the flows surrounding the pulsar. A
          previously  identified  prominent  jet  extending  12 pc to the
          southeast  of  the pulsar increased in brightness by 30% over 9
          years;  apparent outflow of material along this jet is observed
          with a velocity of ~0.5c. However, outflow alone cannot account
          for   the   changes  in  the  jet  on  such  short  timescales.
          Magnetohydrodynamic  sausage or kink instabilities are feasible
          explanations  for  the jet variability with timescale of ~1.3-2
          years.  An  arc structure, located 30"-45" north of the pulsar,
          shows  transverse  structural  variations  and  appears to have
          moved  inward  with  a velocity of ~0.03c over three years. The
          overall structure and brightness of the diffuse PWN exterior to
          this  arc  and excluding the jet has remained the same over the
          twelve  year  span.  The  photon indices of the diffuse PWN and
          possibly   the  jet  steepen  with  increasing  radius,  likely
          indicating synchrotron cooling at X-ray energies.

          Title:  Explosions  of  O-Ne-Mg  Cores, the Crab Supernova, and
          Subluminous Type II-P Supernovae
          Authors:  F.S.  Kitaura,  H.-Th. Janka, W. Hillebrandt (MPI for
          Astrophysics, Garching)
          Comments:   5  pages,  5  figures;  submitted  to  Astronomy  &
          Astrophysics, Letters
          We  present  results  of  simulations  of  stellar collapse and
          explosions  in  spherical  symmetry for progenitor stars in the
          8-10  solar  mass  range  with an O-Ne-Mg core. The simulations
          were  continued  until  nearly one second after core bounce and
          were  performed with the Prometheus/Vertex code with a variable
          Eddington factor solver for the neutrino transport, including a
          state-of-the-art  treatment  of  neutrino-matter  interactions.
          Particular  effort  was  made  to implement nuclear burning and
          electron  capture  rates  with  sufficient accuracy to ensure a
          smooth  continuation,  without  transients, from the progenitor
          evolution   to  core  collapse.  Using  two  different  nuclear
          equations  of  state  (EoSs),  a soft version of the Lattimer &
          Swesty  EoS  and  the significantly stiffer Wolff & Hillebrandt
          EoS,  we  found  no  prompt  explosions,  but  instead  delayed
          explosions, powered by neutrino heating and the neutrino-driven
          baryonic  wind  which  sets  in  about 200 ms after bounce. The
          models eject little nickel (< 0.015 solar masses), explode with
          an  energy of about or slightly more than 10**50 erg, and leave
          behind neutron stars (NSs) with a baryonic mass near 1.36 solar
          masses.  Different from previous models of such explosions, the
          ejecta during the first second have a proton-to-baryon ratio of
          Ye > 0.46, which suggests a chemical composition that is not in
          conflict  with  galactic abundances. No low-entropy matter with
          Ye << 0.5 is ejected. This excludes such explosions as sites of
          a   low-entropy   r-process.   The  low  explosion  energy  and
          nucleosynthetic  implications  are compatible with the observed
          properties  of  the  Crab  supernova, and the small nickel mass
          supports   the   possibility   that  our  models  explain  some
          subluminous Type II-P supernovae.

          Title:   Stochastic   Background  from  Coalescences  of  NS-NS
          Binaries
          Authors: T. Regimbau, J.A de Freitas Pacheco
          Comments: 22 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          In  this  work,  numerical simulations were used to investigate
          the    gravitational    stochastic   background   produced   by
          coalescences  occurring up to $z \sim 5$ of double neutron star
          systems.  The  cosmic  coalescence  rate was derived from Monte
          Carlo methods using the probability distributions for forming a
          massive  binary and to occur a coalescence in a given redshift.
          A  truly  continuous  background  is produced by events located
          only   beyond  the  critical  redshift  $z_*  =  0.23$.  Events
          occurring  in  the redshift interval $0.027<z<0.23$ give origin
          to  a  "popcorn"  noise,  while  those arising closer than $z =
          0.027$   produce   a  shot  noise.  The  gravitational  density
          parameter $\Omega_{gw}$ for the continuous background reaches a
          maximum around 670 Hz with an amplitude of $1.1\times 10^{-9}$,
          while  the  "popcorn" noise has an amplitude about one order of
          magnitude  higher  and the maximum occurs around a frequency of
          1.2  kHz.  The  signal  is  below  the sensitivity of the first
          generation  of  detectors but could be detectable by the future
          generation  of  ground  based  interferometers. Correlating two
          coincident  advanced-LIGO detectors or two EGO interferometers,
          the expected S/N ratio are respectively 0.5 and 10.

          Title:  Nonlocality  effects  on  spin-one  pairing patterns in
          two-flavor color superconducting quark matter and compact stars
          applications
          Authors: D. N. Aguilera, D. B. Blaschke
          Comments: 19 pages, 8 figures
          We study the influence of nonlocal interactions in two spin one
          pairing  patterns  of  two-flavor quark matter: the anisotropic
          blue  color  paring besides the usual two color superconducting
          matter  (2SCb),  in  which red and green colors are paired, and
          the  color  spin locking phase (CSL). The effect of nonlocality
          on  the  gaps is rather large and the pairings exhibit a strong
          dependence on the form factor of the interaction, especially in
          the low density region. The application of these small spin-one
          condensates  for  compact stars is analyzed: the early onset of
          quark  matter  of  the  nonlocal  models  may help to stabilize
          hybrid  star  configurations.  While the anisotropic blue quark
          pairing does not survive a big asymmetry in the flavor space as
          imposed  by  the  charge  neutrality condition, the nonlocality
          makes the diquark pairing gaps in the CSL phase too small to be
          a   good  candidate  for  hybrid  star  cooling  phenomenology.
          Therefore,  if  nonlocal  effects  are taken into account, both
          phases  seem to be unlikely to occur in the interior of compact
          stars.

          Comments:  58  pages,  including  11  tables and 16 figures. To
          appear in 01 April 2006 issue of the Astrophysical Journal
          (Abridged)    We    present   spectroscopic   and   photometric
          observations of the eclipsing system V1061 Cyg (P = 2.35 days).
          We  show  that  it  is a hierarchical triple in which the third
          star   is  visible  in  the  spectra.  We  combine  the  radial
          velocities   for   the  three  stars,  times  of  eclipse,  and
          intermediate   astrometric  data  from  the  HIPPARCOS  mission
          (abscissa  residuals)  to  establish  the elements of the outer
          orbit  (P  =  15.8  yr)  and accurate values for the masses and
          radii  (1-2%  errors)  and  the  effective  temperatures of the
          binary  components.  Both  stars  are rotating rapidly and have
          their  rotation synchronized with the orbital motion. There are
          signs  of activity including strong X-ray emission and possibly
          spots.  Current  stellar  evolution  models agree well with the
          properties of the primary, but show a very large discrepancy in
          the radius of the secondary: the predicted values are about 10%
          smaller than observed (a 5-sigma effect). Also, the temperature
          is cooler than predicted by some 200 K. These discrepancies are
          quite  remarkable  given  that the star is only 7% less massive
          than  the  Sun, the calibration point of all stellar models. We
          identify  the chromospheric activity as the likely cause of the
          effect.  Inactive  stars agree very well with the models, while
          active  ones  such  as  V1061  Cyg Ab appear systematically too
          large and too cool. Theory provides an understanding of this in
          terms  of  the  strong magnetic fields commonly associated with
          stellar   activity,  which  tend  to  inhibit  convective  heat
          transport.

          Mechanics,  eds. E. Kokubo, H. Arakida, and T. Yamamoto. Tokyo,
          Japan, 2003
          Recent  observations  (Burnes2002,Veillet2002,Margot2002a) have
          revealed   an  unexpectedly  high  binary  fraction  among  the
          Trans-Neptunian  Objects  (TNOs) that populate the Kuiper Belt.
          The   TNO  binaries  are  strikingly  different  from  asteroid
          binaries  in four respects (Veillet2002): their frequency is an
          order  of  magnitude larger, the mass ratio of their components
          is  closer  to  unity,  and  their  orbits are wider and highly
          eccentric.  Two  explanations  have  been  proposed  for  their
          formation,   one  assuming  large  numbers  of  massive  bodies
          (Weidenschilling2002),  and one assuming large numbers of light
          bodies  (Goldreich2002).  We  argue  that  both assumptions are
          unwarranted,  and we show how TNO binaries can be produced from
          a  modest  number  of  intermediate-mass  bodies  of  the  type
          predicted  by  the  gravitational  instability  theory  for the
          formation  of  planetesimals (Goldreich and Ward1973). We start
          with  a  TNO  binary  population similar to the asteroid binary
          population,  but  subsequently  modified by three-body exchange
          reactions,  a  process that is far more efficient in the Kuiper
          belt,  because  of  the much smaller tidal perturbations by the
          Sun.   Our   mechanism  can  naturally  account  for  all  four
          characteristics  that  distinguish  TNO binaries from main-belt
          asteroid binaries.

          Title: Orbital phase spectroscopy of X-ray pulsars to study the
          stellar wind of the companion
          Authors: U.Mukherjee, B.Paul
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures. To be Published in Elsevier/ASR
          High  Mass X-ray Binary Pulsars (HMXBP), in which the companion
          star  is  a  source  of  supersonic  stellar  wind,  provide  a
          laboratory  to  probe  the velocity and density profile of such
          winds.  Here,  we have measured the variation of the absorption
          column  density  along  with other spectral parameters over the
          binary  orbit  for  two HMXBP in elliptical orbits, as observed
          with  the  Rossi  X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the BeppoSAX
          satellites.  A spherically symmetric wind profile was used as a
          model  to compare the observed column density variations. In 4U
          1538-52,  we  find  the  model  corroborating the observations;
          whereas in GX 301-2, the stellar wind appears to be very clumpy
          and  a  smooth  symmetric  wind model seems to be inadequate in
          explaining the variation in column density.

          Comments: 31 pages, 24 figures, 1 table, accepted by A&A
          We have carried out a study of the orthogonal polarisation mode
          behaviour  as  a  function  of  frequency  of 18 pulsars, using
          average  pulsar  data  from  the European Pulsar Network (EPN).
          Assuming  that  the  radiation  consists  of two 100% polarised
          completely  orthogonal  superposed  modes  we  separated  these
          modes,  resulting  in  average  pulse  profiles of each mode at
          multiple  frequencies  for each pulsar. Furthermore, we studied
          the  frequency  dependence  of  the relative intensity of these
          modes. We found in many pulsars that the average pulse profiles
          of  the  two  modes differ in their dependence on frequency. In
          particular,  we  found that pulse components that are dominated
          by  one  mode  tend  to  increase  in intensity with increasing
          frequency with respect to the rest of the profile.

          Submitted to ApJ
          "The   Duck"   is   a  complicated  non-thermal  radio  system,
          consisting   of   the  energetic  radio  pulsar  B1757-24,  its
          surrounding  pulsar  wind  nebula  G5.27-0.90  and the adjacent
          supernova  remnant  (SNR) G5.4-1.2. PSR B1757-24 was originally
          claimed to be a young (~15 000 yr) and extreme velocity (>~1500
          km/s) pulsar which had penetrated and emerged from the shell of
          the  associated  SNR  G5.4-1.2,  but recent upper limits on the
          pulsar's  motion  have  raised  serious  difficulties with this
          interpretation.   We   here  present  8.5  GHz  interferometric
          observations  of the nebula G5.27-0.90 over a 12-year baseline,
          doubling  the  time-span  of  previous measurements. These data
          correspondingly  allow  us to halve the previous upper limit on
          the   nebula's   westward  motion  to  14  milliarcseconds/year
          (5-sigma), allowing a substantive reevaluation of this puzzling
          object. We rule out the possibility that the slow motion of the
          pulsar  can  be explained in the context of a highly off-center
          supernova  explosion,  but  conclude  that an old (>~70 000 yr)
          pulsar  /  SNR  association, or a situation in which the pulsar
          and  SNR  are  physically  unrelated,  are  both  still  viable
          explanations.

          Title: Roche Lobes in the Second Post-Newtonian Approximation
          Authors: Sasa Ratkovic, Madappa Prakash, James M. Lattimer
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          Close  binary  systems of compact stars, due to the emission of
          gravitational  radiation,  may evolve into a phase in which the
          less  massive star transfers mass to its companion. We describe
          mass  transfer  by  using  the model of Roche lobe overflow, in
          which  mass  is  transferred  through  the first, or innermost,
          Lagrange  point.  Under  conditions in which gravity is strong,
          the  shapes  of  the equipotential surfaces and the Roche lobes
          are  modified  compared  to  the  Newtonian  case.  We  present
          calculations  of  the  Roche  lobe  utilizing  the second order
          post-Newtonian (2PN) approximation in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner
          gauge.  Heretofore,  calculations  of  the  Roche lobe geometry
          beyond  the  Newtonian  case have not been available. Beginning
          from  the  general  N-body  Lagrangian  derived  by  Damour and
          Schaffer,  we develop the Lagrangian for a test particle in the
          vicinity of two massive compact objects. As an exact result for
          the   transverse-traceless   part  of  the  Lagrangian  is  not
          available, we devise an approximation that is valid for regions
          close  to  the  less  massive star. We calculate the Roche lobe
          volumes, and provide a simple fitting formula for the effective
          Roche  lobe  radius  analogous  to  that for the Newtonian case
          furnished  by  Eggleton.  In contrast to the Newtonian case, in
          which  the  effective  Roche  radius depends only upon the mass
          ratio  $q=m_1/m_2$,  in  the  2PN case the effective Roche lobe
          radius also depends on the ratio $z=2 (m_1+m_2)/a$ of the total
          mass and the orbital separation.

          Title: The Role of the Equation of State in Binary Mergers
          Authors: Sasa Ratkovic, Madappa Prakash, James M.Lattimer
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          Binary  mergers  involving  black  holes and neutron stars have
          been   proposed   as  major  sources  of  gravitational  waves,
          r--process   nucleosynthesis,   and   gamma  ray  bursters.  In
          addition,  they  represent  an  important, and possibly unique,
          observable   that   could   distinguish   between   normal  and
          self--bound  neutron  stars.  These  two families of stars have
          distinctly  different mass--radius relationships resulting from
          their  equations  of  state  which can be revealed during their
          mergers  if  stable mass transfer ensues. We consider two cases
          of  gravitational-radiation induced binary mergers: (i) a black
          hole  and  a  normal  neutron star, and (ii) a black hole and a
          self-bound  strange  quark  matter  star.  We  extend  previous
          Newtonian    analyses   to   incorporate   the   pseudo-general
          relativistic Paczy\'nski-Wiita potential or a potential correct
          to second--order post-Newtonian order in
          Arnowitt--Deser--Misner   coordinates.   These  potentials  are
          employed  to study both the orbital evolution of the binary and
          the Roche lobe geometry that determines when and if stable mass
          transfer  between  the  components  is possible. The Roche lobe
          geometry  with  pseudo-general  relativistic  or post-Newtonian
          potentials  has  not  heretofore  been considered. Our analysis
          shows that differences in the evolution of normal neutron stars
          and  strange  quark  matter  stars are significant and could be
          detected  in  gravity waves. Both the amplitude and frequencies
          of  the  wave pattern are affected. In addition, details of the
          equation  of  state  for either normal neutron stars or strange
          quark stars may be learned. A single merger could reveal one or
          two   individual   points  of  the  mass-radius  relation,  and
          observations of several mergers could map a significant portion
          of this relation.

          Title:  Numerical  Simulations  of  the  Onset and Stability of

          Hydrodynamical  simulations of semi-detached, polytropic binary
          stars  are  presented  in  an  effort  to  study  the onset and
          stability   of   dynamical   mass   transfer  events.  Initial,
          synchronously rotating equilibrium models are constructed using
          a  self-consistent-field  technique  and  then  evolved with an
          Eulerian  hydrodynamics code in a fully self-consistent manner.
          We  describe  code  improvements  introduced  over the past few
          years  that  permit us to follow dynamical mass-transfer events
          through  more  than  30  orbits.  Mass-transfer  evolutions are
          presented   for   two   different   initial  configurations:  A
          dynamically   unstable   binary   with   initial   mass   ratio
          (donor/accretor) $q_0 = 1.3$ that leads to a complete merger in
          $\sim  10$  orbits; and a double-degenerate binary with initial
          mass ratio $q_0 = 0.5$ that, after some initial unstable growth
          of  mass  transfer, tends to separate as the mass-transfer rate
          levels off.

          Title: Polarization transfer in pulsar magnetosphere
          Authors: S. A. Petrova
          Comments: Accepted to MNRAS
          Propagation  of radio waves in the ultrarelativistic magnetized
          electron-positron plasma of pulsar magnetosphere is considered.
          Polarization  state  of  the original natural waves is found to
          vary  markedly  on  account  of  the  wave  mode  coupling  and
          cyclotron  absorption.  The  change is most pronounced when the
          regions  of mode coupling and cyclotron resonance approximately
          coincide. In cases when the wave mode coupling occurs above and
          below  the resonance region, the resultant polarization appears
          essentially  distinct.  The main result of the paper is that in
          the  former  case the polarization modes become non-orthogonal.
          The  analytical  treatment  of  the  equations  of polarization
          transfer  is  accompanied  by  the  numerical calculations. The
          observational  consequences of polarization evolution in pulsar
          plasma are discussed as well.

          Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures, accepted to A&A
          We  observed a new and poorly studied cataclysmic variable (CV)
          SDSS  J123813.73-033933.0  to  determine its classification and
          binary  parameters.  Simultaneous time-resolved photometric and
          spectroscopic  observations  were carried out to conduct period
          analysis  and  Doppler tomography mapping. From radial velocity
          measurements of the Ha line we determined its orbital period to
          be  0.05592+/-0.00035$  days  (80.53min). This period is longer
          than  the first estimate of 76 min by Szkody et al. (2003), but
          still  at  the  very edge of the period limit for hydrogen-rich
          CVs.  The  spectrum  shows  double-peaked Balmer emission lines
          flanked   by  strong  broad  Balmer  absorption,  indicating  a
          dominant  contribution  by the white dwarf primary star, and is
          similar  to  the  spectra  of short-period low-mass transfer WZ
          Sge-like  systems.  The  photometric  light curve shows complex
          variability.  The system undergoes cyclic brightening up to 0.4
          mags,  which  are  of  semi-periodic nature with periods of the
          order  of 8-12 hours. We also detect a 40.25 min variability of
          ~0.15   mag  corresponding  to  half  of  the  orbital  period.
          Amplitude  of  the latter increases with the cyclic brightening
          of  the  system. We discuss the variable accretion rate and its
          impact  on  the  hot  spot as the most probable reason for both
          observed  processes.  SDSS  J123813.73-033933.0  is preliminary
          classified  as  a  WZ Sge-like short period system with low and
          unstable accretion rate.

          Title: Gaps below strange star crusts
          Authors: Morten Stejner, Jes Madsen (University of Aarhus)
          Comments:  12  pages  incl.  14  figures. To appear in Physical
          Review D
          The  gap  caused  by  a strong electric field between the quark
          surface  and  nuclear  crust of a strange star is studied in an
          improved  model  including  gravity  and  pressure  as  well as
          electrostatic  forces.  The  transition  from  gap  to crust is
          followed  in detail. The properties of the gap are investigated
          for  a  wide  range  of  parameters  assuming both color-flavor
          locked  and  non  color-flavor  locked  strange star cores. The
          maximally allowed crust density is generally lower than that of
          neutron  drip.  Finite temperature is shown to increase the gap
          width,   but   the   effect  is  significant  only  at  extreme
          temperatures.  Analytical  approximations are derived and shown
          to provide useful fits to the numerical results.

          Title: The periods of the intermediate polar RX J0153.3+7446
          Authors: A.J. Norton, J.D. Tanner (The Open University)
          Comments: 4 pages, submitted to A&A Letters
          We  present  the first optical photometry of the counterpart to
          the  candidate intermediate polar RX J0153.3+7446. This reveals
          an  optical  pulse  period  of  2333s +/- 5s. Reanalysis of the
          previously  published  ROSAT  X-ray  data reveals that the true
          X-ray  pulse  period is probably 1974s +/- 30s, rather than the
          1414  s  previously  reported.  Given that the previously noted
          orbital period of the system is 3.94 h, we are able to identify
          the X-ray pulse period with the white dwarf spin period and the
          optical  pulse  period  with  the  rotation period of the white
          dwarf  in the binary reference frame, as commonly seen in other
          intermediate  polars.  We  thus confirm that RX J0153.3+7446 is
          indeed a typical intermediate polar.

          Title:  Phenomenological  and Cosmological Aspects of a Minimal
          GUT Scenario
          Authors:  Ilja  Dorsner, Pavel Fileviez Perez, Ricardo Gonzalez

          Comments: 20 pages, 3 eps figures
          Several  phenomenological and cosmological aspects of a minimal
          extension  of  the Georgi-Glashow model, where the Higgs sector
          is  composed  by  5_H, 15_H, and 24_H, are studied. It is shown
          that  the  constraints  coming  from  the  unification of gauge
          interactions   up   to  two-loop  level  predict  light  scalar
          leptoquarks. In this GUT scenario, the upper bound on the total
          proton  decay  lifetime  is  tau_p  <  1.4  x  10^36 years. The
          possibility  to  explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the
          universe  through the decays of SU(2)_L scalar triplets is also
          studied.  We find that a successful triplet seesaw leptogenesis
          implies  an upper bound on the scalar leptoquark mass, M_Phib <
          10^{6-7}  GeV. We conclude that this GUT scenario can be tested
          at  the  next generation of proton decay experiments and future
          colliders through the production of scalar leptoquarks.

          Using  RXTE  archival  observations  of  4U 1907+09 between MJD
          $\sim$51980 and $\sim$52340, we found the source, after a $\sim
          0$  spin-down  rate  episode,  to be spinning-down at a rate of
          $(-1.887\mp  0.042)\times  10^{-14}$  Hz s$^-1$ which is $\sim$
          0.60 times lower than the long term ($\sim 14$ years) spin-down
          rate (Baykal et al. 2001). Our pulse frequency measurements for
          the   first   time   resolved   significant   pulse   frequency
          fluctuations  since  the  discovery  of the source. We have not
          observed  any  significant  change  in  X-ray flux and spectral
          parameters  after  the spin-down rate of the source changed. We
          stated  that  the  apparent uncorrelation between the spin-down
          rate  and  the X-ray flux might be related to the fact that the
          source  accretes  not  only  via transient retrograde accretion
          disc  but  also  via the stellar wind of the companion, so that
          the  variation  of  the  accretion  rate from the disc does not
          cause significant variation in the observed X-ray flux. Lack of
          significant  change in spectral parameters was interpreted as a
          sign  of  the fact that the change in the spin-down rate of the
          source  is  not  related  to  a  significant  variation  in the
          accretion geometry.

          Title: Reduced Wolf-Rayet Line Luminosities at Low Metallicity
          Authors: Paul A Crowther, L J Hadfield (Sheffield)
          Comments: 14 pages, 12 figures, accepted for A&A
          New  NTT/EMMI  spectrophotometry  of  single WN2-5 stars in the
          Magellanic  Clouds  are  presented,  from  which HeII 4686 line
          luminosities  have been derived, and compared with observations
          of  other  Magellanic  Cloud  WR stars. SMC WN3-4 stars possess
          line  luminosities which are a factor of 4 times lower than LMC
          counterparts,  incorporating  several  binary  SMC WN3-4 stars.
          Similar  results  are  found  for  WN5-6 stars, despite reduced
          statistics,  incorporating  observations  of  single  LMC WN5-9
          stars.  CIV  5808 line luminosities of carbon sequence WR stars
          in  the  SMC  and  IC1613  (both WO subtypes) are a factor of 3
          lower  than LMC WC stars from Mt Stromlo/DBS spectrophotometry,
          although  similar results are also obtained for the sole LMC WO
          star.  We  demonstrate  how  reduced  line  luminosities at low
          metallicity  follow  naturally  if WR winds are Z-dependent, as
          recent  results  suggest.  We  apply  mass  loss-Z  scalings to
          atmospheric  non-LTE  models  of  Milky Way and LMC WR stars to
          predict  the wind signatures of WR stars in the metal-poor star
          forming  WR  galaxy  IZw18.  WN HeII 4686 line luminosities are
          7-20  times  lower  than  in  Z-rich  counterparts of identical
          bolometric luminosity, whilst WC CIV 5808 line luminosities are
          3-6  times  lower.  Significant He^+ Lyman continuum fluxes are
          predicted  for  Z-poor  early-type  WR stars. Consequently, our
          results  suggest  the need for larger population of WR stars in
          IZw18  than  is  presently  assumed, particularly for WN stars,
          potentially posing a severe challenge to evolutionary models at
          very  low  Z.  Finally, reduced wind strengths from WR stars at
          low  Z  impacts upon the immediate circumstellar environment of
          long  duration  GRB  afterglows,  particularly  since  the host
          galaxies of high-redshift GRBs tend to be Z-poor.

          We   present   mid-infrared   (2-12   micron)  spectra  of  the
          microquasar SS 433 obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory
          (spectroscopic  mode of ISOPHOT and ISOCAM). We compare them to
          the  spectra  of four Wolf-Rayet stars: WR78, WR134, WR136, and
          WR147  in  the same wavelength range. The mid-infrared spectrum
          of  SS  433  mainly shows HI and HeI emission lines and is very
          similar  to  the  spectrum of WR147, a WN8(h)+B0.5V binary. The
          2-12  micron  continuum  emission  of  SS  433  corresponds  to
          optically   thin   and   partially  optically  thick  free-free
          emission,  from  which  we  calculate a mass loss rate of 2-3 x
          10^{-4} Msun/yr if the wind is homogeneous and a third of these
          values  if  it  is  clumped.  This  is consistent with a strong
          stellar  wind from a WN star. However, following recent studies
          concluding  that  the  mass  donor  star  of  SS  433  is not a
          Wolf-Rayet  star,  we  propose  that this strong wind out flows
          from  a geometrically thick envelope of material that surrounds
          the  compact  object  like  a stellar atmosphere, imitating the
          Wolf-Rayet phenomenon. This wind could also wrap the mass donor
          star,  and  at larger distances (~ 40 AU), it might form a dust
          envelope from which the thermal emission, detected with ISOPHOT
          at  25  micron  and  60 micron, would originate. This wind also
          probably  feeds  the  material  that  is ejected in the orbital
          plane  of  the  binary  system  and  that  forms the equatorial
          outflow detected in radio at distances > 100 AU.

          In  cores of supernovae and crusts of neutron stars, nuclei can
          adopt  interesting  shapes,  such as rods or slabs, etc., which
          are  referred  to  as  nuclear  "pasta." Recently, we have been
          studying  the  pasta phases focusing on their dynamical aspects
          with  quantum  molecular  dynamic (QMD) approach. We review our
          findings  on  the  following topics: dynamical formation of the
          pasta  phases by cooling down the hot uniform nuclear matter; a
          phase   diagram   on  the  density  versus  temperature  plane;
          structural  transitions  between  the  pasta  phases induced by
          compression  and  their  mechanism.  Properties  of the nuclear
          interaction used in our works are also discussed.

          Title: First Resolved Images of the Mira AB Symbiotic Binary at
          Centimeter Wavelengths
          Authors:     Lynn     D.     Matthews,    Margarita    Karovska
          (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)
          Comments: accepted to ApJ Letters
          We   report   the  first  spatially  resolved  radio  continuum
          measurements  of  the Mira AB symbiotic binary system, based on
          observations  obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA). This is
          the  first  time  that  a  symbiotic  binary  has been resolved
          unambiguously   at  centimeter  wavelengths.  We  describe  the
          results  of  VLA  monitoring  of  both  stars  over a ten month
          period,  together with constraints on their individual spectral
          energy   distributions,   variability,   and   radio   emission
          mechanisms.  The  emission  from  Mira  A  is  consistent  with
          originating  from  a radio photosphere, while the emission from
          Mira  B  appears  best  explained as free-free emission from an
          ionized circumstellar region ~(1-10)x10**13 cm in radius.

          Title:   Discovery  of  extended  emission  around  the  pulsar
          B0355+54
          Authors: Tepedelenlioglu Emre, Ogelman Hakki
          Comments: 13 pages, 3 figures submitted to ApJ Letters
          PSR  B0355+54  is  one  of the handful of pulsars that has been
          observed  with both Chandra and XMM-Newton. The analysis of the
          archival  data has revealed the pulsar and a ~30 arcsec compact
          nebula  surrounding  it.  XMM-Newton  also has detected a trail
          which  extends  ~6  arcmin and similar to the compact nebula is
          also  counter-aligned with the proper motion of the pulsar. The
          spectrum  of both the pulsar and the extended emission are well
          described  by  an  absorbed  power-law model. The measured flux
          corresponds  to  an  efficiency  of  converting  the  spin-down
          luminosity  into  X-rays in the 2-10 keV band of ~0.01% and ~1%
          for  the  pulsar  and the extended emission, respectively. From
          the XMM-Newton data we have detected pulsations at the expected
          radio  period.  The  energetic  and  the extent of the extended
          emission  can  be explained by a Bow-shock formed by the motion
          of the pulsar through the interstellar medium.

          Title:  Prospects  of  LIGO  for  constraining  inclination  of
          merging  compact  binaries  associated with three-dimensionally
          localized short-hard GRBs
          Authors: Naoki Seto
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          We  propose  a  new  method  to  constrain the inclination of a
          coalescing  compact binary by detecting its gravitational waves
          associated  with a three-dimensionally localized (direction and
          distance)  short-hard  gamma-ray  burst. We take advantage of a
          synergy  of  these  two  observations,  and  our  method can be
          applied  with  a  single  interferometer  or  aligned  multiple
          interferometers  as  LIGO.  For  a  nearly  face-on  binary the
          inclination   angle   $I$  can  be  constrained  in  the  range
          1-SNR_{GW}^{-1}  <  cos  I  \le  1  with  an  accurate distance
          estimation.  This  method would help us to study the properties
          of  the  short-hard  bursts,  including  potentially collimated
          jet-like structures as indicated by recent observation.

          Title:  Self-similar  pressure  oscillations  in  neutron  star
          envelopes as probes of neutron star structure
          Authors:  A.  I.  Chugunov  (1),  ((1) Ioffe Physical-Technical
          Institute, St.-Petersburg, Russia)
          Comments: 7 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We   study   eigenmodes   of   acoustic  oscillations  of  high
          multipolarity  l  ~  100  - 1000 and high frequency (~100 kHz),
          localized   in   neutron  star  envelopes.  We  show  that  the
          oscillation  problem  is  self-similar.  Once  the  oscillation
          spectrum  is  calculated for a given equation of state (EOS) in
          the  envelope  and given stellar mass M and radius R, it can be
          rescaled  to  a  star with any M and R (but the same EOS in the
          envelope). For l>300 the modes can be subdivided into the outer
          and  inner  ones.  The  outer modes are mainly localized in the
          outer  envelope.  The inner modes are mostly localized near the
          neutron  drip point, being associated with the softening of the
          EOS  after  the  neutron drip. We calculate oscillation spectra
          for  the  EOSs  of  cold-catalyzed and accreted matter and show
          that  the spectra of the inner modes are essentially different.
          A detection and identification of high-frequency pressure modes
          would  allow one to infer M and R and determine also the EOS in
          the  envelope  (accreted  or ground-state) providing thus a new
          and  simple  method to explore the main parameters and internal
          structure of neutron stars.

          Counter-Rotating Protostellar Accretion Disk
          Authors: Anthony J. Remijan, J. M. Hollis
          Comments:  18 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We  report  high  spatial  resolution  VLA  observations of the
          low-mass   star-forming   region  IRAS  16293-2422  using  four
          molecular   probes:   ethyl  cyanide  (CH$_3$CH$_2$CN),  methyl
          formate  (CH$_3$OCHO),  formic  acid  (HCOOH),  and  the ground
          vibrational  state  of  silicon  monoxide  (SiO). Ethyl cyanide
          emiss  ion  has  a  spatial scale of $\sim20''$ and encompasses
          binary cores A and B as determined by continuum emission peaks.
          Surrounded by formic acid emission, methyl formate emission has
          a  spatial  scale  of  $\sim6''$and  is confined to core B. SiO
          emission shows two velocity components with spatial scales less
          than 2$''$ that map $\sim2''$ northeast of the A and B symmetry
          axis.  The redshifted SiO is $\sim2''$ northwest of blueshifted
          SiO   along   a   position   angle   of  $\sim135^o$  which  is
          approximately  parallel  to  the  A  and  B  symmetry  axis. We
          interpret  the  spatial  position offset in red and blueshifted
          SiO  emission  as  due  to rotation of a protostellar accretion
          disk  and  we  derive $\sim$1.4 M$_{\odot}$ interior to the SiO
          emission.  In  the  same  vicinity,  Mundy  et  al. (1986) also
          concluded   rotation   of  a  nearly  edge-on  disk  from  OVRO
          observations of much stronger and ubiquitous $^{13}$CO emission
          but  the  direction of rotation is opposite to the SiO emission
          findings.  Taken  together,  SiO  and  $^{13}$CO  data  suggest
          evidence  for  a counter-rotating disk. Moreover, archival BIMA
          array  $^{12}$CO  data show an inverse P Cygni profile with the
          strongest  absorption  in  close proximity to the SiO emission,
          indicating    unambiguous    material    infall    toward   the
          counter-rotating  protostellar  disk  at  a new source location
          within  the  IRAS  16293-2422  complex.  The  details  of these
          observations and our interpretations are discussed.

          Title:  Infrared  Spectroscopy  of  Symbiotic  Stars. IV. V2116
          Ophiuchi/GX 1+4, The Neutron Star Symbiotic
          Authors: Kenneth H. Hinkle, Francis C. Fekel, Richard R. Joyce,
          Peter R. Wood, Verne V. Smith, Thomas Lebzelter
          Comments:  In press to The Astrophysical Journal (10 April 2006
          issue). 23 pages
          We  have  computed, based on 17 infrared radial velocities, the
          first  set of orbital elements for the M giant in the symbiotic
          binary V2116 Ophiuchi. The giant's companion is a neutron star,
          the  bright  X-ray  source GX 1+4. We find an orbital period of
          1161  days  by  far  the longest of any known X-ray binary. The
          orbit  has  a  modest  eccentricity  of  0.10  with  an orbital
          circularization  time  of  less than 10^6 years. The large mass
          function of the orbit significantly restricts the mass of the M
          giant.  Adopting a neutron-star mass of 1.35M(Sun), the maximum
          mass  of  the M giant is 1.22M(Sun), making it the less massive
          star.   Derived   abundances   indicate   a  slightly  subsolar
          metallicity.  Carbon  and  nitrogen  are  in the expected ratio
          resulting from the red-giant first dredge-up phase. The lack of
          O-17  suggests that the M-giant has a mass less than 1.3M(Sun),
          consistent  with  our  maximum  mass.  The  red giant radius is
          103R(Sun),  much  smaller than the estimated Roche lobe radius.
          Thus,  the  mass  loss  of the red giant is via a stellar wind.
          Although  the  M giant companion to the neutron star has a mass
          similar  to  the late-type star in low-mass X-ray binaries, its
          near-solar  abundances  and  apparent  runaway velocity are not
          fully consistent with the properties of this class of stars.

          Title: The Multiple System HD 27638
          Authors:   Guillermo  Torres  (Harvard-Smithsonian  Center  for
          Astrophysics)
          Comments:  16  pages  in  2-column format, including tables and
          figures. To appear in The Astronomical Journal
          We   report   spectroscopic  observations  of  HD  27638B,  the
          secondary in a visual binary in which the physically associated
          primary (separation approximately 19 arcsec) is a B9V star. The
          secondary shows strong Li 6708 absorption suggesting youth, and
          has attracted attention in the past as a candidate post-T Tauri
          star  although  this  has  subsequently  been ruled out. It was
          previously  known  to  be  a  double-lined spectroscopic binary
          (F8+G6)  with  a  period  of  17.6  days,  and to show velocity
          residuals  indicating  a  more  distant massive third companion
          with a period of at least 8 years. Based on our radial velocity
          measurements  covering more than two cycles of the outer orbit,
          along  with  other  measurements,  we derive an accurate triple
          orbital  solution giving an outer period of 9.447 +/- 0.017 yr.
          The  third  object is more massive than either of the other two
          components of HD 27638B, but is not apparent in the spectra. We
          derive  absolute  visual  magnitudes and effective temperatures
          for  the  three  visible  stars  in HD 27638. Isochrone fitting
          based  on  those  properties gives an age of 200 +/- 50 Myr for
          the  system.  We  infer also an inclination angle of about 53.3
          degrees  for  the  inner  orbit  of  HD  27638B.  We  detect  a
          near-infrared  excess  in  HD  27638B which we attribute to the
          third  star  being  a close binary composed of late-type stars.
          This  explains  its large mass and lack of a visible signature.
          Modeling  of this excess allows us to infer not only the masses
          of  the  components  of  the  unseen  companion,  but  also the
          inclination  angle  of  the outer orbit (approximately 73 deg).
          The HD 27638 system is thus at least quintuple.

          Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJL
          In an investigative 16 hour L band observation using the MERLIN
          radio  interferometric  array, we have resolved both the pulsar
          PSR  B1951+32  and  structure  within  the  flat spectral radio
          continuum   region,  believed  to  be  the  synchrotron  nebula
          associated  with  the  interaction of the pulsar and its `host'
          supernova  remnant  CTB  80.  The  extended  structure  we see,
          significant  at  $\sim$  4.5  $\sigma$,  is  of dimensions 2.5"
          $\times$  0.75", and suggests a sharp bow shaped arc of shocked
          emission,  which  is correlated with similar structure observed
          in  lower  resolution  radio  maps and X-ray images. Using this
          MERLIN   data   as   a  new  astrometric  reference  for  other
          multiwavelength data we can place the pulsar at one edge of the
          HST  reported  optical  synchrotron  knot,  ruling out previous
          suggested  optical  counterparts,  and  allowing  an elementary
          analysis  of  the optical synchrotron emission which appears to
          trail  the  pulsar.  The  latter  is  possibly a consequence of
          pulsar  wind  replenishment,  and we suggest that the knot is a
          result  of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities. These being
          so,  it  suggests a dynamical nature to the optical knot, which
          will require high resolution optical observations to confirm.

          We  report  the  initial  results  of  a  VLT/NACO high spatial
          resolution  imaging survey for multiple systems among 58 M-type
          members of the nearby Upper Scorpius OB association. Nine pairs
          with  separations  below  100  have  been resolved. Their small
          angular separations and the similarity in the brightness of the
          components  (DMagK  <1  for  all  of them), indicate there is a
          reasonable  likelihood several of them are true binaries rather
          than  chance  projections.  Follow-up imaging observations with
          WHT/LIRIS  of  the  two  widest  binaries  confirm  that  their
          near-infrared  colours  are  consistent  with physical very low
          mass binaries. For one of these two binaries, WHT/LIRIS spectra
          of   each  component  were  obtained.  We  find  that  the  two
          components  have similar M6-M7 spectral types and signatures of
          low-gravity, as expected for a young brown dwarf binary in this
          association.   Our  preliminary  results  indicate  a  possible
          population of very low-mass binaries with semimajor axis in the
          range  100  AU  150 AU, which has not been seen in the Pleiades
          open  cluster.  If  these  candidates  are  confirmed  (one  is
          confirmed  by this work), these results would indicate that the
          binary  properties  of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs may
          depend on the environment where they form.

          to ApJ
          We  present  the  results  of X-ray observations of four bright
          transients   sources  detected  in  the  July  2004  XMM-Newton
          observations  of  the  central bulge of M31. Two X-ray sources,
          XMMU   J004315.5+412440   and   XMMU   J004144.7+411110,   were
          discovered  for  the  first  time.  Two  other  sources, CXOM31
          J004309.9+412332  and  CXOM31 J004241.8+411635, were previously
          detected  by  Chandra.  The  properties  of the sources suggest
          their  identification with accreting binary systems in M31. The
          X-ray   spectra   and   variability   of   two   sources,  XMMU
          J004144.7+411110  and  CXOM31  J004241.8+411635, are similar to
          that  of the Galactic black hole transients, making them a good
          black  hole  candidates. The X-ray source XMMU J004315.5+412440
          demonstrates  a  dramatic  decline  of the X-ray flux on a time
          scale  of  three  days,  and a remarkable flaring behavior on a
          short  time scales. The X-ray data on XMMU J004315.5+412440 and
          CXOM31  J004309.9+412332  suggest that they can be either black
          hole   or  neutron  star  systems.  Combining  the  results  of
          2000-2004  XMM observations of M31, we estimate a total rate of
          the  bright transient outbursts in the central region of M31 to
          be 6-12 per year, in agreement with previous studies.

          Title:  On  the  Collapsar  Model  of  Long  Gamma-Ray  Bursts:
          Constraints from Cosmic Metallicity Evolution
          Authors: N. Langer, C.A. Norman
          Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures; accepted as ApJ Letter
          We   explore   the   consequences   of  new  observational  and
          theoretical  evidence  that  long  gamma-ray  bursts prefer low
          metallicity     environments.     Using     recently    derived
          mass-metallicity  correlations  and the mass function from SDSS
          studies,  and  adopting an average cosmic metallicity evolution
          from  \citet{kewley2005}  and  \citet{savaglio2005}  we  derive
          expressions for the the relative number of massive stars formed
          below  a  given  fraction  of solar metallicity, $\epsilon$, as
          function  of  redshift. We demonstrate that about 1/10th of all
          stars  form  with  $\epsilon < 0.1$. Therefore, a picture where
          the  majority  of  GRBs  form  with  $\epsilon  <  0.1$  is not
          inconsistent  with  an empirical global SN/GRB ratio of 1/1000.
          It  implies  that  (1)  GRB's  peak  at  a significantly higher
          redshift  than  supernovae;  (2)  massive star evolution at low
          metallicity  may be qualitatively different and; (3) the larger
          the  low-metallicity  bias  of  GRBs  the  less  likely  binary
          evolution channels can be significant GRB producers.

          Title:  Multi-periodic  variations  in the last 104 years light
          curve of the symbiotic star BF Cyg
          Authors:   Elia   Leibowitz,   Liliana   Formiggini  (Tel  Aviv
          University-Israel)
          Comments: 9 pages 7 figures. Accepted by MNRAS
          We analyse a light curve of the symbiotic star BF Cyg, covering
          114  years  of  its  photometric  history. The star had a major
          outburst  around  the  year  1894.  Since then the mean optical
          brightness of the system is in steady decline, reaching only in
          the  last  few years its pre-outburst value. Superposed on this
          general  decline  are  some  6  less  intense  outbursts of 1-2
          magnitude  and  duration  of 2000-5000 days. We find a cycle of
          ~6376 days, or possibly twice this period, in the occurrence of
          these  outbursts.  We  suggest  that  the  origin of the system
          outbursts  is in some magnetic cycle in the outer layers of the
          giant  star  of the system, akin to the less intense ~8000 days
          magnetic cycle of our Sun. We further find, that in addition to
          its  well  known  binary period of 757.3 days, BF Cyg possesses
          also  another  photometric  period of 798.8 days. This could be
          the  rotation period of the giant star of the system. If it is,
          the  beat period of these two periodicities, 14580 days, is the
          rotation  period of a tidal wave on the surface of the giant. A
          4th  period  of 4436 days, the beat period of the 14580 and the
          6376 cycles is possibly also present in the LC. We predict that
          BF  Cyg  will  be  at  the peak of its next outburst around the
          month  of May in the year 2007. The newly discovered 798.8 days
          period  explains the disappearance of the orbital modulation at
          some  epochs in the light curve. The 757.3 oscillations will be
          damped again around the year 2013.

          Title:  Correlated X-ray spectral and timing variability of the
          Be/X-ray binary V0332+53/BQ Cam during a type II outburst
          Authors:  P. Reig (FORTH/U. of Crete), S. Martinez-Nunez (GACE,
          U. of Valencia), V. Reglero (GACE, U. of Valencia)
          Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures, accepted by A&A
          We  have  used  INTEGRAL  & RXTE data to investigate the timing
          properties  of  the  source  in  correlation  with its spectral
          states  as  defined by different positions in the colour-colour
          diagram.   The  source  shows  two  distinct  branches  in  the
          colour-colour diagram that resemble those of the Z sources. The
          hard  branch (similar to the horizontal branch of Z sources) is
          characterised  by  a  low-amplitude  change  of the hard colour
          compared  to  the change in the soft colour. In the soft branch
          (analogue to the normal branch) the amplitude of variability of
          the  hard  colour  is about three times larger than that of the
          soft  colour.  As  the count rate decreases the source moves up
          gradually  through  the  soft to the hard branch. The aperiodic
          variability   (excluding   the   pulse   noise)   consists   of
          band-limited  noise  (represented  by  three  broad  Lorentzian
          components)  and  two QPOs at 0.05 Hz and 0.22 Hz. The strength
          of  the  lower frequency QPO increases as the source approaches
          the  hard  branch  (similar  to  HBOs in Z sources). The higher
          frequency  QPO  reaches maximum significance when the source is
          in  the middle of the branch (like NBOs). We have performed the
          first  measurements  of  phase  lags  in the band limited noise
          below  8  Hz  in  an accreting X-ray pulsar and found that soft
          lags  dominate  at  high frequencies. Above the pulse frequency
          (0.23 Hz), the amplitude of the lag increases as the X-ray flux
          increases.  The  Z  topology  appears  to be a signature of the
          neutron  star  binaries  as  it  is  present  in  all  types of
          neutron-star  binaries  (Z,  atoll  and,  as  we  show here, in
          accreting  pulsars  as  well).  However,  the motion along this
          track,  the  time  scales through the different branches of the
          diagram  and the aperiodic variability associated with portions
          of the Z track differ for each subclass of neutron-star binary.

          Title: Spectroscopic companions of very young brown dwarfs
          Authors: Joergens Viki (Leiden Observatory)
          Comments: Proceeding of ESO workshop 'Multiple Stars across the
          HRD' (Garching 2005). 6 pages, 4 figures
          I   review  here  the  results  of  the  first  RV  survey  for
          spectroscopic  companions  to very young brown dwarfs (BDs) and
          (very)  low-mass stars in the ChaI star-forming cloud with UVES
          at  the  VLT.  This survey studies the binary fraction in an as
          yet  unexplored  domain  not  only  in  terms of primary masses
          (substellar  regime)  and ages (a few Myr) but also in terms of
          companion  masses  (sensitive  down  to  planetary  masses) and
          separations  (< 1 AU). The UVES spectra obtained so far hint at
          spectroscopic  companions of a few Jupiter masses around one BD
          and  around one low-mass star (M4.5) with orbital periods of at
          least   several   months.  Furthermore,  the  data  indicate  a
          multiplicity  fraction  consistent  with  field BDs and stellar
          binaries for periods < 100 days.

          Title: Low State, Phase-Resolved IR Spectroscopy of VV Puppis
          Authors: Steve B. Howell, Thomas E. Harrison, Ryan K. Campbell,
          France A. Cordova, Paula Szkody
          Comments: Accepted in Astronomical Journal 5 figures
          We  present  phase-resolved  low  resolution  $JHK$  and higher
          resolution  $K$-band  spectroscopy  of  the  polar  VV Pup. All
          observations  were  obtained when VV Pup was in a low accretion
          state  having  a  K  magnitude  near  15.  The  low  resolution
          observations  reveal  cyclotron emission in the $J$ band during
          some  phases, consistent with an origin near the active 30.5 MG
          pole  on the white dwarf. The secondary in VV Pup appears to be
          a  normal M7V star and we find that the $H$ and $K$ band fluxes
          are  entirely due to this star at all orbital phases during the
          low   accretion  state.  We  use  our  higher  resolution  Keck
          spectroscopy  to  produce  the  first  $K$-band radial velocity
          curve  for VV Pup. Our orbital solution yields $K_2$=414$\pm27$
          km    sec$^{-1}$    and    leads    to    mass   estimates   of
          M$_1$=0.73$\pm$0.05    M$_{\odot}$    and   M$_2$=0.10$\pm$0.02
          M$_{\odot}$.  We  find that the mass accretion rates during the
          normal  low states of the polars VV Pup, EF Eri, and EQ Cet are
          near 10$^{-13}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The fact that \.M is not
          zero  in  low  state polars indicates active secondary stars in
          these  binary  systems,  including  the  sub-stellar donor star
          present in EF Eri.

          Title:  Green  Bank  Telescope  Studies  of  Giant  Pulses from
          Millisecond Pulsars
          Authors:  H. S. Knight, M. Bailes, R. N. Manchester, S. M. Ord,
          B. A. Jacoby
          Comments: 26 pages, 4 figures, accepted to ApJ
          We   have  conducted  a  search  for  giant  pulses  from  four
          millisecond  pulsars  using  the  100m  Green  Bank  Telescope.
          Coherently  dedispersed  time-series  from  PSR J0218+4232 were
          found  to contain giant pulses of very short intrinsic duration
          whose  energies  follow  power-law statistics. The giant pulses
          are  in phase with the two minima of the radio integrated pulse
          profile  but  are  phase  aligned  with  the peaks of the X-ray
          profile.  Historically, individual pulses more than 10-20 times
          the  mean pulse energy have been deemed to be ``giant pulses''.
          As  only 4 of the 155 pulses had energies greater than 10 times
          the   mean   pulse-energy,  we  argue  the  emission  mechanism
          responsible for giant pulses should instead be defined through:
          (a) intrinsic timescales of microsecond or nanosecond duration;
          (b)  power-law energy statistics; and (c) emission occurring in
          narrow  phase-windows  coincident  with  the  phase  windows of
          non-thermal  X-ray  emission.  Four  short-duration pulses with
          giant-pulse   characteristics   were  also  observed  from  PSR
          B1957+20.   As  the  inferred  magnetic  fields  at  the  light
          cylinders of the millisecond pulsars that emit giant pulses are
          all very high, this parameter has previously been considered to
          be  an  indicator  of  giant  pulse  emissivity.  However,  the
          frequency   of   giant  pulse  emission  from  PSR~B1957+20  is
          significantly  lower  than  for  other millisecond pulsars that
          have  similar  magnetic  fields  at their light cylinders. This
          suggests that the inferred magnetic field at the light cylinder
          is a poor indicator of the rate of emission of giant pulses.

          Christopher  Mihos, John J. Feldmeier, Robin Ciardullo, Cameron

          Comments: 4 pages, 3 color figures. Submitted to ApJ Letters
          Hypervelocity  stars  have  been  recently  discovered  in  the
          outskirts  of  galaxies,  such as the unbound star in the Milky
          Way  halo, or the three anomalously fast intracluster planetary
          nebulae  (ICPNe)  in  the  Virgo  Cluster.  These may have been
          ejected by close 3-body interactions with a binary supermassive
          black  hole  (SMBBH),  where  a  star  which  passes within the
          semimajor  axis of the SMBBH can receive enough energy to eject
          it  from  the  system.  Stars  ejected  by  SMBBHs  may  form a
          significant  sub-population  with very different kinematics and
          mean  metallicity  than the bulk of the intracluster stars. The
          number,  kinematics,  and  orientation of the ejected stars may
          constrain  the mass ratio, semimajor axis, and even the orbital
          plane of the SMBBH. We investigate the evolution of the ejected
          debris  from a SMBBH within a clumpy and time-dependent cluster
          potential using a high resolution, self-consistent cosmological
          N-body  simulation  of  a  galaxy  cluster.  We  show  that the
          predicted  number  and  kinematic  signature  of the fast Virgo
          ICPNe  is  consistent  with 3-body scattering by a SMBBH with a
          mass ratio $10:1$ at the center of M87.

          Journal, April 2006 (vol. 641). 27 pages, 17 figures
          The  L1551 molecular cloud contains two small clusters of Class
          0  and I protostars, as well as a halo of more evolved Class II
          and  III YSOs, indicating a current and at least one past burst
          of  star  formation. We present here new, sensitive maps of 850
          and  450 um dust emission covering most of the L1551 cloud, new
          CO  J=2-1 data of the molecular cloud, and a new, deep, optical
          image  of  [SII] emission. No new Class 0/I YSOs were detected.
          Compact   sub-millimetre   emitters  are  concentrated  in  two
          sub-clusters:  IRS5  and  L1551NE, and the HL~Tauri group. Both
          stellar   groups   show   significant   extended  emission  and
          outflow/jet  activity.  A jet, terminating at HH 265 and with a
          very weak associated molecular outflow, may originate from LkHa
          358,  or  from  a  binary companion to another member of the HL
          Tauri  group.  Several  Herbig  Haro  objects  associated  with
          IRS5/NE  were  clearly  detected  in  the sub-mm, as were faint
          ridges  of  emission tracing outflow cavity walls. We confirm a
          large-scale  molecular  outflow originating from NE parallel to
          that  from IRS5, and suggest that the "hollow shell" morphology
          is  more likely due to two interacting outflows. We confirm the
          presence  of  a  prestellar  core  (L1551-MC)  of  mass  2-3 Mo
          north-west  of IRS5. The next generation cluster may be forming
          in  this  core. The L1551 cloud appears cometary in morphology,
          and  appears to be illuminated and eroded from the direction of
          Orion,   perhaps  explaining  the  multiple  episodes  of  star
          formation in this cloud. The full paper (including figures) can

          GRB  050911, discovered by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope, was
          not  seen  4.6 hr later by the Swift X-ray Telescope, making it
          one  of  the very few X-ray non-detections of a Gamma-Ray Burst
          (GRB) afterglow at early times. The gamma-ray light-curve shows
          at  least  three  peaks, the first two of which (~T_0 - 0.8 and
          T_0  +  0.2  s, where T_0 is the trigger time) were short, each
          lasting  0.5  s.  This  was  followed by later emission 10-20 s
          post-burst.  The  upper  limit on the unabsorbed X-ray flux was
          1.7  x  10^-14  erg cm^-2 s^-1 (integrating 46 ks of data taken
          between  11  and  18 September), indicating that the decay must
          have  been  rapid.  All  but one of the long bursts detected by
          Swift  were above this limit at ~4.6 hr, whereas the afterglows
          of   short   bursts  became  undetectable  more  rapidly.  Deep
          observations  with Gemini also revealed no optical afterglow 12
          hr  after  the  burst,  down  to  r=24.0  (5-sigma  limit).  We
          speculate  that  GRB  050911  may  have  been  formed through a
          compact object (black hole-neutron star) merger, with the later
          outbursts  due to a longer disc lifetime linked to a large mass
          ratio between the merging objects. Alternatively, the burst may
          have  occured  in a low density environment, leading to a weak,
          or  non-existent,  forward  shock  -  the so-called 'naked GRB'
          model.

          We  present  the  discovery of the first X-ray counterpart to a
          Rotating  RAdio  Transient (RRAT) source. RRAT J1819--1458 is a
          relatively highly magnetized (B $\sim 5\times10^{13}$ G) member
          of  a  new  class  of unusual pulsar-like objects discovered by
          their  bursting  activity at radio wavelengths. The position of
          RRAT  J1819--1458  was  serendipitously  observed  by  the {\sl
          Chandra}  ACIS-I  camera  in 2005 May. At that position we have
          discovered  a  pointlike source, CXOU J181934.1--145804, with a
          soft  spectrum  well  fit  by an absorbed blackbody with $N_H =
          7^{+7}_{-4}  \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and temperature $kT=0.12
          \pm  0.04$  keV,  having  an  unabsorbed  flux of $\sim2 \times
          10^{-12}$  ergs  cm$^{-2}$  s$^{-1}$  between 0.5 and 8 keV. No
          optical  or infrared (IR) counterparts are visible within $1''$
          of  our  X-ray  position.  The positional coincidence, spectral
          properties,  and  lack  of  an  optical/IR  counterpart make it
          highly likely that CXOU J181934.1--145804 is a neutron star and
          is  the  same  object as RRAT J1819--1458. The source showed no
          variability on any timescale from the pulse period of 4.26~s up
          to  the  five-day  window covered by the observations, although
          our  limits  (especially  for  pulsations) are not particularly
          constraining.  The  X-ray properties of CXOU J181934.1--145804,
          while  not yet measured to high precision, are similar to those
          of  comparably-aged  radio  pulsars  and  are  consistent  with
          thermal emission from a cooling neutron star.

          In  our  continuing  optical spectroscopic campaign to identify
          the  longer-wavelength  counterparts  of  newly-discovered hard
          X-ray  sources  detected  by INTEGRAL, we observed the putative
          optical  counterparts  of  seven  southern sources at the South
          African  Astronomical  Observatory and at the European Southern
          Observatory.  For  two of these objects, optical photometry was
          also acquired. These observations firmly established the nature
          of  four  of them: we found that IGR J10404-4625 (=LEDA 93974),
          4U  1344-60  and  IGR  J16482-3036  are  Active Galactic Nuclei
          (AGNs) at redshifts z = 0.0237, 0.013 and 0.0313, respectively,
          and  that  2RXP  J130159.6-635806 is a Galactic High-Mass X-ray
          Binary  (HMXB).  We  also give possible optical identifications
          for   three   further  objects,  namely  IGR  J11215-5952,  IGR
          J11305-6256  and  IGR  J16207-5129,  which  are consistent with
          being Galactic HMXBs. Physical parameters for these objects are
          also  evaluated  by  collecting  and  discussing  the available
          multiwavelength  information. The detection of four definite or
          likely  HMXBs  out  of  seven  objects  in  our  sample further
          stresses  INTEGRAL's crucial contribution in hunting this class
          of  object. Also, the determination of the extragalactic nature
          of  a  substantial  fraction  of  the  INTEGRAL  survey sources
          underlines  the  importance  of hard X-ray observations for the
          study of background AGNs located beyond the `Zone of Avoidance'
          of the Galactic Plane.

          Title:  Shapiro Effect as a Possible Cause of the Low-Frequency
          Pulsar Timing Noise in Globular Clusters
          Authors: T.I.Larchenkova (1), S.M.Kopeikin (2) (1 - Astro Space
          Center,   Lebedev  Physical  Institute,  Moscow,  Russia;  2  -
          University of Missouri-Columbia, USA)
          Comments: 23 pages, 6 figures
          Journal-ref: Astronomy Letters, 2006, v.32, N.1, p.18-28
          A   prolonged   timing  of  millisecond  pulsars  has  revealed
          low-frequency  uncorrelated  noise, presumably of astrophysical
          origin,  in  the pulse arrival time (PAT) residuals for some of
          them.  In  most  cases,  pulsars  in  globular  clusters show a
          low-frequency  modulation  of  their  rotational phase and spin
          rate.  The  relativistic time delay of the pulsar signal in the
          curved  space  time of randomly distributed and moving globular
          cluster  stars  (the Shapiro effect) is suggested as a possible
          cause of this modulation.
          Given  the  smallness  of the aberration corrections that arise
          from  the  nonstationarity  of  the  gravitational field of the
          randomly  distributed  ensemble of stars under consideration, a
          formula  is  derived  for  the Shapiro effect for a pulsar in a
          globular  cluster. The derived formula is used to calculate the
          autocorrelation function of the low-frequency pulsar noise, the
          slope of its power spectrum, and the behavior of the $\sigma_z$
          statistic  that  characterizes  the spectral properties of this
          noise  in the form of a time function. The Shapiro effect under
          discussion  is  shown  to  manifest  itself  for  large  impact
          parameters  as  a  low-frequency  noise of the pulsar spin rate
          with  a  spectral  index  of  n=-1.8 that depends weakly on the
          specific  model  distribution of stars in the globular cluster.
          For small impact parameters, the spectral index of the noise is
          n=-1.5.

          Comments: 40 pages, ApJ, in press
          We  present  the  results  of  time-resolved spectroscopy of 13
          O-type stars in the Cas OB6 stellar association. We conducted a
          survey  for  radial  velocity  variability  in search of binary
          systems,  which  are  expected  to  be  plentiful  in  young OB
          associations.   Here   we  report  the  discovery  of  two  new
          single-lined  binaries, and we present new orbital elements for
          three double-lined binaries (including one in the multiple star
          system  HD  17505).  One  of  the  double-lined  systems is the
          eclipsing  binary  system  DN Cas, and we present a preliminary
          light  curve  analysis  that  yields  the  system  inclination,
          masses,  and  radii. We compare the spectra of the single stars
          and  the  individual  components of the binary stars with model
          synthetic   spectra   to   estimate   the   stellar   effective
          temperatures,  gravities,  and projected rotational velocities.
          We  also  make  fits  of  the  spectral energy distributions to
          derive  E(B-V),  R=A_V/E(B-V), and angular diameter. A distance
          of  1.9  kpc yields radii that are consistent with evolutionary
          models.  We  find  that 7 of 14 systems with spectroscopic data
          are   probable   binaries,  consistent  with  the  high  binary
          frequency  found  for  other  massive  stars  in  clusters  and
          associations.

          Title: Effective mass of free neutrons in neutron star crust
          Authors: Nicolas Chamel
          Comments: 18 pages, 6 figures
          The inner layers of a neutron star crust, composed of a Coulomb
          lattice  of  neutron rich nuclear clusters immersed in a sea of
          ``free'' superfluid neutrons, are closely analogous to periodic
          condensed  matter  systems  such  as  electronic,  photonic  or
          phononic crystals. Applying methods from solid state physics to
          the  neutron star context, we study the transport properties of
          those  ``free''  neutrons for the outermost layers of the inner
          crust,  near  the  drip  point  $\rho_{\rm  drip}  \sim 4\times
          10^{11}$  g.cm$^{-3}$. In particular, we evaluate the effective
          neutron   mass  resulting  from  Bragg  scattering  by  a  band
          structure  calculation.  Comparison  is  made  with the case of
          electrons in solids. The observational consequences are briefly
          discussed.

          Title: Effects of Gravitational Lensing and Companion Motion on
          the Binary Pulsar Timing
          Authors: Roman R. Rafikov (CITA), Dong Lai (Cornell)
          Comments: 10 pages, 1 figure, submitted to Phys. Rev. D
          The  measurement  of  the  Shapiro  time delay in binary pulsar
          systems  with highly inclined orbit can be affected both by the
          motion  of the pulsar's companion because of the finite time it
          takes  a  photon  to cross the binary, and by the gravitational
          light  bending if the orbit is sufficiently edge-on relative to
          the  line of sight. Here we calculate the effect of retardation
          due  to the companion's motion on various time delays in pulsar
          binaries,  including  the  Shaipro delay, the geometric lensing
          delay,  and  the lens-induced delays associated with the pulsar
          rotation.  Our  results  can  be  applied  to systems so highly
          inclined  that  near  conjunction  gravitational lensing of the
          pulsar  radiation  by  the  companion  becomes  important  (the
          recently   discovered   double  pulsar  system  J0737-3039  may
          exemplify  such  a system). To the leading order, the effect of
          retardation  is  to shift all the delay curves backward in time
          around  the  orbit conjunction, without affecting the shape and
          amplitude  of the curves. The time shift is of order the photon
          orbit  crossing time, and ranges from a second to a few minutes
          for  the  observed  binary pulsar systems. In the double pulsar
          system  J0737-3039, the motion of the companion may also affect
          the   interpretation  of  the  recent  correlated  interstellar
          scintillation  measurements. Finally, we show that lensing sets
          an  upper  limit  on  the  magnitude of the frame-dragging time
          delay  caused  by  the  companion's  spin, and makes this delay
          unobservable in stellar-mass binary pulsar systems.

          We  show  that modeling of these phenomena can constrain models
          of  the  dense  cold  matter  at the cores of neutron stars. We
          demonstrate  that,  even  for  a  broad and asymmetric spectral
          line,  the  stellar  radius-to-mass  ratio  can  be inferred to
          better than 5%. We also fit our theoretical models to the burst
          oscillation  data  of  the low mass X-ray binary XTE J1814-338,
          and  find  that  the  90% confidence lower limit of the neutron

          Title: The formation of brown dwarfs
          Authors: A. P. Whitworth (Cardiff), S. P. Goodwin (Sheffield)
          Comments:  7  pages, 1 figure. To appear in Astron.Nachrichten.
          Includes an.cls file
          We  review  four  mechanisms  for  forming  brown  dwarfs:  (i)
          turbulent  fragmentation  (producing  very  low-mass prestellar
          cores);   (ii)  gravitational  instabilities  in  discs;  (iii)
          dynamical  ejection  of  stellar  embryos  from their placental
          cores;  and  (iv)  photo-erosion  of  pre-existing cores in HII
          regions.  We  argue (a) that these are simply the mechanisms of
          low-mass  star  formation,  and  (b) that they are not mutually
          exclusive.  If,  as seems possible, all four mechanisms operate
          in   nature,   their  relative  importance  may  eventually  be
          constrained by their ability to reproduce the binary statistics
          of  brown  dwarfs,  but  this  will require fully 3-D radiative
          magneto-hydrodynamic simulations.

          in the Visible with Lucky Imaging
          Authors: N.M. Law, S.T. Hodgkin, C.D. Mackay (IOA, Cambridge)
          Comments: 9 pages, 11 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  survey  a sample of 32 M5-M8 stars with distance < 40pc for
          companions  with  separations between 0.1 arcsec and 1.5 arcsec
          and  with  Delta  m_i  <5.  We  find five new VLM binaries with
          separations  between  0.15  arcsec  and 1.1 arcsec, including a
          candidate brown dwarf companion. The raw binary fraction is 16%
          +8/-4%  and  the distance bias corrected fraction is 7% +7/-3%,
          for  companions  within  the  surveyed  range.  No systems with
          contrast  ratio  Delta m_i>1 were found, even though our survey
          is  sensitive  to  up  to  Delta m=5 (well into the brown dwarf
          regime).   The  distribution  of  orbital  radii  is  in  broad
          agreement  with  previous  results, with most systems at 1-5AU,
          but  one  detected binary is very wide at 46.8+/-5.0AU. We also
          serendipitously  imaged  for the first time a companion to Ross
          530,  a  metal-poor  single-lined spectroscopic binary. We used
          the  new  Lucky  Imaging  system  LuckyCam  on  the 2.5m Nordic

          Title: The Origins of the Substellar Companion to GQ Lup
          Authors: J.H. Debes, S. Sigurdsson
          Comments: 6 pages, submitted to A&A
          The recently discovered substellar companion to GQ Lup possibly
          represents a direct test of current planet formation theories.
          We  examine  the possible formation scenarios for the companion
          to  GQ  Lup  assuming  it  is  a  $\sim$2  M$_{Jup}$ object. We
          determine that GQ Lup B most likely was scattered into a large,
          eccentric  orbit  by  an interaction with another planet in the
          inner system.
          If  this  is  the case, several directly observable predictions
          can  be  made,  including  the  presence  of  a  more  massive,
          secondary  companion that could be detected through astrometry,
          radial   velocity   measurements,  or  scuplting  in  GQ  Lup's
          circumstellar  disk.  This scenario requires a highly eccentric
          orbit for the companion already detected. These predictions can
          be  tested  within the next decade or so. Additionally, we look
          at  scenarios  of  formation if the companion is a brown dwarf.
          One  possible  formation  scenario  may  involve an interaction
          between  a  brown dwarf binary and GQ Lup. We look for evidence
          of  any  brown  dwarfs  that  have been ejected from the GQ Lup
          system by searching the 2MASS all-sky survey.

          Title:  Gas  Giant  Protoplanets  Formed by Disk Instability in
          Binary Star Systems
          Authors: A. P. Boss
          Comments: 52 pages, 28 figures
          Journal-ref:  Astrophysical  Journal,  vol.  641, 20 April 2006
          issue
          We present a suite of three dimensional radiative gravitational
          hydrodynamics  models suggesting that binary stars may be quite
          capable  of  forming  planetary systems similar to our own. The
          new  models  with  binary companions do not employ any explicit
          artificial  viscosity,  and  also  include the third (vertical)
          dimension   in  the  hydrodynamic  calculations,  allowing  for
          transient phases of convective cooling. The calculations of the
          evolution  of initially marginally gravitationally stable disks
          show  that the presence of a binary star companion may actually
          help to trigger the formation of dense clumps that could become
          giant  planets.  We  also  show  that  in models without binary
          companions,  which  begin  their  evolution  as gravitationally
          stable  disks, the disks evolve to form dense rings, which then
          break-up  into  self-gravitating  clumps.  These  latter models
          suggest  that  the  evolution of any self-gravitating disk with
          sufficient  mass to form gas giant planets is likely to lead to
          a  period of disk instability, even in the absence of a trigger
          such as a binary star companion.

          Ophiuchi (2004)
          Authors: Tae W. Kang, Alon Retter, Alex Liu, Mercedes Richards
          Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures, 2 .sty files, AJ accepted
          We   present  the  results  of  37  nights  of  CCD  unfiltered
          photometry of nova V2574 Oph (2004) from 2004 and 2005. We find
          two  periods  of 0.14164 d (~3.40 h) and 0.14773 d (~3.55 h) in
          the  2005  data.  The  2004  data show variability on a similar
          timescale,  but  no  coherent periodicity was found. We suggest
          that  the  longer  periodicity  is  the  orbital  period of the
          underlying binary system and that the shorter period represents
          a  negative  superhump.  The  3.40 h period is about 4% shorter
          than   the  orbital  period  and  obeys  the  relation  between
          superhump  period  deficit  and binary period. The detection of
          superhumps  in the light curve is evidence of the presence of a
          precessing  accretion  disk in this binary system shortly after
          the nova outburst. From the maximum magnitude - rate of decline
          relation,  we  estimate  the  decay  rate  t_2 = 17+/-4 d and a
          maximum absolute visual magnitude of M_Vmax = -7.7+/-1.7 mag.

          publication in ApJ 2006
          X-ray  absorption  spectroscopy provides a potentially powerful
          tool  in  determining the metal abundances in various phases of
          the  interstellar  medium (ISM). We present a case study of the
          sight  line toward 4U 1820-303 (Galactic coordinates l, b=2.79,
          -7.91  and  distance  =  7.6  kpc),  based  on  Chandra Grating
          observations.  The detection of OI, OII, OIII, OVII, OVIII, and
          NeIX  Kalpha  absorption  lines allows us to measure the atomic
          column  densities  of the neutral, warm ionized, and hot phases
          of  the  ISM  through  much  of the Galactic disk. By comparing
          these  measurements  with  the 21 cm hydrogen emission and with
          the  pulsar  dispersion  measure  along the same sight line, we
          estimate  the  mean  oxygen abundances in the neutral and total
          ionized  phases  as 0.3(0.2, 0.6) and 2.2(1.1, 3.5) in units of
          Anders  &  Grevesse (1989) solar value. This significant oxygen
          abundance  difference  is  apparently a result of molecule/dust
          grain  destruction  and  recent  metal  enrichment  in the warm
          ionized  and  hot phases. We also measure the column density of
          neon  from its absorption edge and obtain the Ne/O ratio of the
          neutral   plus   warm  ionized  gas  as  2.1(1.3,  3.5)  solar.
          Accounting  for  the expected oxygen contained in molecules and
          dust  grains  would  reduce the Ne/O ratio by a factor of ~1.5.
          From  a  joint-analysis  of the OVII, OVIII, and NeIX lines, we
          obtain  the  Ne/O  abundance ratio of the hot phase as 1.4(0.9,
          2.1)  solar,  which  is  not sensitive to the exact temperature
          distribution  assumed  in  the  absorption line modeling. These
          comparable  ISM Ne/O ratios for the hot and cooler gas are thus
          considerably  less than the value (2.85+-0.07; 1sigma) recently
          inferred  from  corona  emission  of  solar-like stars (Drake &
          Testa 2005). (abridged)

          Combination   of  high-precision  photometry  and  spectroscopy
          allows  the  detailed  study of the upper main sequence in open
          clusters. We are carrying out a comprehensive study of a number
          of  clusters  containing  Be  stars  in  order  to evaluate the
          likelihood  that  a significant number of Be stars form through
          mass  exchange  in  a  binary. Our first results show that most
          young  open  clusters  contain blue stragglers. In spite of the
          small  number  of  clusters  so  far  analysed, some trends are
          beginning  to emerge. In younger open clusters, such as NGC 869
          and  NGC 663, there are many blue stragglers, most of which are
          not  Be stars. In older clusters, such as IC 4725, the fraction
          of  Be  stars  among  blue stragglers is very high. Two Be blue
          stragglers  are  moderately  strong  X-ray sources, one of them
          being  a  confirmed X-ray binary. Such objects must have formed
          through  binary  evolution. We discuss the contribution of mass
          transfer  in  a  close  binary  to  the  formation of both blue
          stragglers and Be stars

          Title:  No  Universality  for Electron's Power-Law Index (p) in
          Gamma-Ray Bursts and Other Relativistic Sources
          Authors:  R.-F.  Shen, P. Kumar, E. L. Robinson (U. of Texas at
          Ausin)
          Comments: 18 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          The  Gamma-Ray  Burst  (GRB)  prompt emission is believed to be
          from  highly relativistic electrons accelerated in relativistic
          shocks.  From  the  GRB  high-energy power-law spectral indices
          \beta  observed  by  the  Burst and Transient Source Experiment
          (BATSE)  Large  Area Detectors (LAD), we determine the spectral
          index,  $p$,  of  the  electrons' energy distribution. Both the
          theoretical  calculations  and  numerical  simulations  of  the
          particle  acceleration in relativistic shocks show that $p$ has
          a  universal  value  \approx 2.2-2.3. We show that the observed
          distribution  of  $p$  during  GRBs  is  not  consistent with a
          delta-function distribution or an universal $p$ value, with the
          width  of  the  distribution  >= 0.55. The distributions of $p$
          during   X-ray   afterglows   are   also  investigated.  But  a
          "universality"  of  $p$ in X-ray afterglows cannot be ruled out
          because  of  the  limited sample size. The $p$ distributions in
          blazars  and  pulsar  wind nebulae are also broad, inconsistent
          with a delta-function distribution.

          Title:  AO  Velorum:  a  young  quadruple  system  with  a ZAMS
          eclipsing BpSi primary
          Authors: J.F. Gonzalez, S. Hubrig, N. Nesvacil, P. North
          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Using  recent  spectroscopic  observations,  we  show  that the
          triple  system AO Vel with an eclipsing BpSi primary is in fact
          a  remarkable  quadruple  system  formed  by  two  double-lined
          spectroscopic  binaries  with components close to the ZAMS. All
          available  data  have  been reanalyzed to derive proper orbital
          parameters  for  both  binary systems and to calculate absolute
          parameters  of the eclipsing system. For the first time, direct
          determination of the radius and the mass have been obtained for
          a  BpSi  star.  The  study  of  the physical parameters of this
          unique system is especially important since it can be used as a
          test   of   evolutionary   models   for  very  young  stars  of
          intermediate mass.

          Title: Stable quark matter in cosmic rays?
          Authors: Jes Madsen (University of Aarhus)
          Comments:  16  pages,  29th  Johns  Hopkins Workshop on current
          problems in particle theory: Strong Matter in the Heavens
          Stable lumps of quark matter may be present in cosmic rays at a
          flux  level, which can be detected by high precision cosmic ray
          experiments   sensitive   to   anomalous   "nuclei"  with  high
          mass-to-charge  ratio.  The  properties  of these lumps, called
          strangelets,  are  described,  and  so  is  the  production and
          propagation  of  strangelets  in  cosmic  rays. Two experiments
          underway  which  are  sensitive  to  a  strangelet  flux in the
          predicted range are briefly described. Finally it is summarized
          how strangelets circumvent the acceleration problem encountered
          by  conventional  candidates  for ultra-high energy cosmic rays
          and  move  the  Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff to energies well
          above the observed maximum energies.

          Comments:  9  page  and  1 figure, Proceedings of The 2005 Lake
          Hanas International Pulsar Symposium, or at this http URL
          Members of the family of pulsar-like stars are distinguished by
          their  different  manifestations observed, i.e., radio pulsars,
          accretion-driven  X-ray  pulsars, X-ray bursts, anomalous X-ray
          pulsars/soft  gamma-ray  repeaters, compact center objects, and
          dim  thermal neutron stars. Though one may conventionally think
          that  these stars are normal neutron stars, it is still an open
          issue  whether  they are actually neutron stars or quark stars,
          as no convincing work, either theoretical from first principles
          or  observational,  has  confirmed Baade-Zwicky's original idea
          that   supernovae  produce  neutron  stars.  After  introducing
          briefly  the  history  of  pulsars  and quark stars, the author
          summarizes   the  recent  achievements  in  his  pulsar  group,
          including   quark  matter  phenomenology  at  low  temperature,
          starquakes  of  solid  pulsars,  low-mass  quark stars, and the
          pulsar magnetospheric activities.

          Title:  Temperature  distribution  in  magnetized  neutron star
          crusts. II. The effect of a strong toroidal component
          Authors: U. Geppert, M. Kueker, Dany Page
          Comments: 9 pages, 10 figures in jpg-format
          We continue the study of the effects of a strong magnetic field
          on  the  temperature  distribution in the crust of a magnetized
          neutron  star  (NS)  and  its  impact on the observable surface
          temperature.  Extending  the  approach  initiated in Geppert et
          al.(2004), we consider more complex and, hence, more realistic,
          magnetic  field  structures  but  still  restrict  ourselves to
          axisymmetric  configurations.  We  put  special emphasis on the
          heat  blanketing  effect of a toroidal field component. We show
          that  asymmetric  temperature  distributions  can  occur  and a
          crustal  field  consisting  of  dipolar  poloidal  and toroidal
          components  will  cause  one  polar  spot to be larger than the
          opposing  one.  These  two  warm regions can be separated by an
          extended  cold equatorial belt. We present an internal magnetic
          field  structure  which  can explain both the X-ray and optical
          spectra  of  the  isolated NS RXJ 1856-3754. We investigate the
          effects  of  the  resulting surface temperature profiles on the
          observable  lightcurve  which an isolated thermally emitting NS
          would  produce  for different field geometries. The lightcurves
          will  be  both qualitatively (deviations from sinusoidal shape)
          and   quantitatively  (larger  pulsed  fraction  for  the  same
          observational  geometry)  different  from those of a NS with an
          isothermal  crust.  This opens the possibility to determine the
          interna}  magnetic  field  strengths  and  structures in NSs by
          modeling  their  X-ray  lightcurves  and  spectra. The striking
          similarities  of  our  model  calculations  with  the  observed
          spectra  and  pulse profiles of isolated thermally emitting NSs
          is  an  indication  for  the existence of strong magnetic field
          components maintained by crustal currents.

          Astronomy & Astrophysics Main Journal
          We  present  the  first time resolved medium resolution optical
          spectroscopy  of  the recently identified peculiar Intermediate
          Polar  (IP)  1RXSJ154814.5-452845, which allows us to precisely
          determine  the  binary  orbital period (Porb=9.87+/-0.03hr) and
          the  white dwarf spin period Pspin=693.01+/-0.06s). This system
          is  then the third just outside the purported 6-10hr IP orbital
          period gap and the fifth of the small group of long period IPs,
          which  has  a  relatively high degree of asynchronism. From the
          presence  of  weak  red  absorption  features,  we identify the
          secondary  star  with a spectral type K2+/-2V, which appears to
          have  evolved on the nuclear timescale. From the orbital radial
          velocities  of  emission  and  the  red absorption lines a mass
          ratio  q=0.65+/-0.12 is found. The masses of the components are
          estimated  to  be  Mwd >= 0.5Msun and Msec=0.4-0.79Msun and the
          binary  inclination  25deg  <  i  <=58deg  . A distance between
          540-840pc  is  estimated.  At  this  distance,  the presence of
          peculiar   absorption  features  surrounding  Balmer  emissions
          cannot   be   due  to  the  contribution  of  the  white  dwarf
          photosphere and their spin modulation suggests an origin in the
          magnetically  confined  accretion flow. The white dwarf is also
          not  accreting  at a particularly high rate (Mdot<5x10**16g/s),
          for   its   orbital  period.  The  spin-to-orbit  period  ratio
          Pspin/Porb=0.02  and  the  low mass accretion rate suggest that
          this  system  is far from spin equilibrium. The magnetic moment
          of  the  accreting  white  dwarf  is  found  to be < 4.1x10**32
          Gcm**3, indicating a low magnetic field system.

          Title: On the binarity of Herbig Ae/Be stars

          (Leeds),   John  Porter  (Liverpool),  Monica  Pozzo  (Imperial
          College)
          Comments: MNRAS accepted, 18 pages
          We present high resolution spectro-astrometry of a sample of 28
          Herbig   Ae/Be  and  3  F-type  pre-main  sequence  stars.  The
          spectro-astrometry  is  shown from both empirical and simulated
          data  to  be  capable  of  detecting binary companions that are
          fainter  by  up  to 6 magnitudes at separations larger than 0.1
          arcsec.  The  nine  targets  that were previously known to be a
          binary  are  all detected. In addition, we report the discovery
          of  6 new binaries and present 5 further possible binaries. The
          resulting  binary  fraction  of 68+/-11 per cent is the largest
          reported  for  any  observed  sample  of  Herbig  Ae/Be  stars,
          presumably    because   of   the   exquisite   sensitivity   of
          spectro-astrometry  for detecting binary systems. The data hint
          that the binary frequency of the Herbig Be stars is larger than
          for   the   Herbig   Ae  stars.  The  appendix  presents  model
          simulations  to  assess  the capabilities of spectro-astrometry
          and  reinforces  the  empirical findings. Two objects, HD 87643
          and  Z  CMa, display evidence for asymmetric outflows. Finally,
          the  position  angles  of the binary systems have been compared
          with available orientations of the circumprimary disc and these
          appear to be co-planar. The alignment between the circumprimary
          discs  and  the  binary  systems  strongly  suggests  that  the
          formation  of  binaries with intermediate mass primaries is due
          to  fragmentation as the alternative, stellar capture, does not
          naturally  predict  aligned  discs. The aligment extends to the
          most  massive  B-type  stars  in  our  sample. This leads us to
          conclude  that  formation  mechanisms that do result in massive
          stars,  but  predict  random angles beween the binaries and the
          circumprimary disks, such as stellar collisions, are also ruled
          out for the same reason.

          We  performed  a  spectroscopic  search  for binaries among hot
          Horizontal  Branch stars in globular clusters. We present final
          results  for  a  sample of 51 stars in NGC6752, and preliminary
          results  for  the  first 15 stars analyzed in M80. The observed
          stars  are  distributed  along  all the HBs in the range 8000 <
          Teff  <  32000  K,  and  have been observed during four nights.
          Radial   velocity   variations  have  been  measured  with  the
          cross-correlation   technique.   We   carefully   analyzed  the
          statistical   and   systematic   errors   associated  with  the
          measurements  in order to evaluate the statistical significance
          of  the  observed  variations.  No close binary system has been
          detected,  neither  among  cooler stars nor among the sample of
          hot  EHB  stars  (18 stars with Teff > 22000 K in NGC6752). The
          data  corrected  for  instrumental  effects  indicate  that the
          radial velocity variations are always below the 3sigma level of
          ~15  km/s. These results are in sharp contrast with those found
          for  field  hot  subdwarfs,  and  open  new questions about the
          formation  of  EHB  stars in globular clusters, and possibly of
          the field subdwarfs.

          A  growing number of early Be stars discovered in X-ray surveys
          exhibit X-ray luminosities intermediate between those of normal
          stars  and those of most Be/X-ray binaries in quiescence. Their
          X-ray  spectra  are also much harder than those of shocked wind
          OB stars and can be best fitted by a thin thermal plasma with T
          ~ 10^8 K, added to a cooler and much fainter thermal component.
          An  iron  line  complex  including  a fluorescence component is
          detected  in  many  cases.  There  is  no evidence for coherent
          pulsations  in  any  of these systems but strong variability on
          time  scales  as  short  as  100  s  is usually observed. Large
          oscillations  with  quasi-periods  of  the order of one hour or
          more are detected in the X-ray light curves of several sources,
          but  have  so  far failed to prove to be strictly periodic. The
          optical  and  X-ray  properties of these new objects strikingly
          resemble  those  of  the  so  far  unique and enigmatic Be star
          Gamma-Cas  and define a new class of X-ray emitters. We discuss
          the  possible  origin of the X-ray emission in the light of the
          models  proposed  for Gamma-Cas, magnetic disc-star interaction
          or accretion onto a compact companion object -- neutron star or
          white dwarf.

          that  leads  to  the formation of the binary radio pulsars like
          PSR  J1713+0747.  We show that the mass transfer is most likely
          to  be  nonconservative,  due  to  unstable  disk accretion, to
          account  for  the mass of PSR J1713+0747, which is close to its
          initial  value.  We  assume that part of the lost material from
          the  binary  may form a circumbinary disk, and find that it can
          significantly influence the mass transfer processes. We briefly
          discuss  the  implications  of  the  circumbinary  disks on the
          evolution  of  low-mass  X-ray  binaries  and  the formation of
          low-mass binary pulsars.

          Title: Two-phase X-ray burst from GX 3+1 observed by INTEGRAL

          Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics
          We  present an analysis of an anomalously long X-ray burst from
          the low-mass X-ray binary system GX~3+1 observed by INTEGRAL on
          August  31,  2004.  The  burst is characterized by two distinct
          phases:  an  initial short spike of 6 s followed by an extended
          decay  phase  lasting  more  than  2000  s. Due to its uncommon
          duration  this burst appears as intermediate between the normal
          type  I  X-ray bursts and the long superbursts. We see emission
          up  to 30 keV energy during the first 5 s of the outburst where
          the  bolometric  burst peak luminosity approaches the Eddington
          limit.  Indications  of  a  radius expansion episode during the
          peak   phase   are   thus   not   overruled.   A  time-resolved
          two-component  spectral  analysis of the total emission reveals
          similar  results  as  a  black-body  modeling  of the net burst
          emission.  From  the  burst  light  curve and the derived burst
          parameters we conclude that we observed a type I X-ray burst of
          an  unusual  character. We discuss three alternative schemes to
          explain  this  peculiar  X-ray  burst: 1) unstable burning of a
          hydrogen/helium  layer  involving  an unusually large amount of
          hydrogen,  2) pure helium ignition at an unusually large depth,
          but  this  seems  unlikely  in the present case, and 3) limited
          carbon  burning  at  an  unusually  shallow  depth triggered by
          unstable helium ignition.

          Title: Birth and Evolution of Isolated Radio Pulsars

          McGill   University,   (2)   Harvard-Smithsonian   Center   for
          Astrophysics)
          Comments: 73 preprint pages, including 8 tables and 15 figures.
          ApJ submission revised following the referee's comments
          We  investigate  the  birth  and evolution of Galactic isolated
          radio  pulsars.  We  begin  by  estimating  their  birth  space
          velocity   distribution  from  proper  motion  measurements  of
          Brisken   et   al.  (2002,  2003).  We  find  no  evidence  for
          multimodality  of  the  distribution and favor one in which the
          absolute  one-dimensional velocity components are exponentially
          distributed  and  with  a  three-dimensional  mean  velocity of
          380^{+40}_{-60}   km   s^-1.  We  then  proceed  with  a  Monte
          Carlo-based   population   synthesis,   modelling   the   birth
          properties  of  the  pulsars,  their  time evolution, and their
          detection  in  the  Parkes  and Swinburne Multibeam surveys. We
          present  a  population  model that appears generally consistent
          with  the  observations.  Our  results suggest that pulsars are
          born   in   the  spiral  arms,  with  a  Galactocentric  radial
          distribution  that  is  well  described  by the functional form
          proposed by Yusifov & Kucuk (2004), in which the pulsar surface
          density   peaks  at  radius  ~3  kpc.  The  birth  spin  period
          distribution  extends  to several hundred milliseconds, with no
          evidence  of  multimodality.  Models  which  assume  the  radio
          luminosities  of  pulsars to be independent of the spin periods
          and  period  derivatives  are  inadequate,  as they lead to the
          detection of too many old simulated pulsars in our simulations.
          Dithered  radio luminosities proportional to the square root of
          the  spin-down luminosity accommodate the observations well and
          provide a natural mechanism for the pulsars to dim uniformly as
          they  approach  the death line, avoiding an observed pile-up on
          the  latter.  There is no evidence for significant torque decay
          (due to magnetic field decay or otherwise) over the lifetime of
          the  pulsars  as radio sources (~100 Myr). Finally, we estimate
          the pulsar birthrate and total number of pulsars in the Galaxy.

          Title: A Precessing Ring Model for Low-Frequency Quasi-periodic
          Oscillations
          Authors: Jeremy D. Schnittman (U Maryland), Jeroen Homan (MIT),
          Jon M. Miller (U Michigan)
          Comments: Accepted to ApJ, 22 pages, 7 figures
          We  develop a simple physical model to describe the most common
          type  of  low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen
          in  a  number  of  accreting black hole systems, as well as the
          shape  of  the  relativistically  broadened iron emission lines
          that  often appear simultaneously in such sources. The model is
          based on an inclined ring of hot gas that orbits the black hole
          along  geodesic  trajectories.  For  spinning black holes, this
          ring will precess around the spin axis of the black hole at the
          Lense-Thirring    (``frame-dragging'')   frequency.   Using   a
          relativistic  ray-tracing code, we calculate X-ray light curves
          and  observed  energy  spectra  as a function of the radius and
          tilt angle of the ring, the spin magnitude, and the inclination
          of the black hole. The model predicts higher-amplitude QPOs for
          systems  with high inclinations, as seen in a growing number of
          black  hole binary systems. We find that the Rossi X-ray Timing
          Explorer observations of low-frequency QPOs in GRS 1915+105 are
          consistent  with a ring of radius R ~ 10M orbiting a black hole
          with  spin  a/M  ~0.5  and  inclination  angle  of  i ~ 70 deg.
          Finally,  we  describe how future X-ray missions may be able to
          use  simultaneous  timing  and  spectroscopic  observations  to
          measure the black hole spin and probe the inner-most regions of
          the accretion disk.

          Comments: 4 pages, accepted for publication in A&A Letters
          V617  Sgr is a V Sagittae star - a group of binaries thought to
          be  the  galactic  counterparts of the Compact Binary Supersoft
          X-ray Sources - CBSS. To check this hypothesis, we measured the
          time  derivative  of  its  orbital  period. Observed timings of
          eclipse   minima   spanning  over  30,000  orbital  cycles  are
          presented.  We  found  that  the  orbital  period evolves quite
          rapidly:  P/Pdot  = 1.1 x 10^{6} years. This is consistent with
          the  idea  that  V617  Sgr is a wind driven accretion supersoft
          source. As the binary system evolves with a time-scale of about
          one  million  years,  which  is  extremely short for a low mass
          evolved  binary,  it  is  likely  that the system will soon end
          either  by having its secondary completely evaporated or by the
          primary exploding as a supernova of type Ia.

          At  lower frequencies we confirm the detection of an 18 Hz QPO,

          to  make  a robust confirmation of the presence of a 30 Hz QPO,
          despite  higher countrates. We discuss our results in the light
          of neutron star vibration models.

          Title: Massive Black Hole Binaries from Collisional Runaways
          Authors:  M.  Atakan Gürkan, John M. Fregeau, Frederic A. Rasio
          (Northwestern University)
          Comments: 4 pages with emulateapj. Submitted to ApJ Letters
          Recent  theoretical  work  has  solidified the viability of the
          collisional  runaway  scenario in young dense star clusters for
          the  formation  of  very  massive  stars  (VMSs),  which may be
          precursors to intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We present
          first results from a numerical study of the collisional runaway
          process  in dense star clusters containing primordial binaries.
          Stellar collisions during binary scattering encounters offer an
          alternate  channel  for runaway growth, somewhat independent of
          direct  collisions  between single stars. We find that clusters
          with  binary  fractions  >~10%  yield  two VMSs via collisional
          runaways,   presenting   the   exotic  possibility  of  forming
          IMBH--IMBH   binaries   in   star   clusters.  We  discuss  the
          implications  for  gravitational  wave  observations,  and  the
          impact on cluster structure.

          Comments:  11  pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS, higher
          resolution version at this http URL
          We report the discovery of a prominent nonthermal X-ray feature
          located  near  the  Galactic  center  that  we  identify  as an
          energetic  pulsar wind nebula. This feature, G359.95-0.04, lies
          1  lyr north of Sgr A* (in projection), is comet-like in shape,
          and  has  a  power  law  spectrum that steepens with increasing
          distance  from  the  putative pulsar. The distinct spectral and
          spatial  X-ray  characteristics  of  the feature are similar to
          those  belonging the rare class of ram-pressure confined pulsar
          wind  nebulae.  The luminosity of the nebula at the distance of
          \sgra,  consistent  with  the  inferred X-ray absorptions, is 1
          10^{34}  ergs s^{-1} in the 2--10 keV energy band. The cometary
          tail  extends  back to a region centered at the massive stellar
          complex  IRS  13  and  surrounded  by  enhanced  diffuse  X-ray
          emission,  which may represent an associated supernova remnant.
          Furthermore,  the  inverse  Compton  scattering  of  the strong
          ambient  radiation  by  the  nebula  consistently  explains the
          observed TeV emission from the Galactic center. We also briefly
          discuss   plausible   connections   of  G359.95-0.04  to  other
          high-energy  sources  in  the region, such as the young stellar
          complex IRS 13 and SNR Sgr A East.

          Title:  Magnetized  Supramassive  Neutron  Star Collapse: A New
          Model For X-Ray Flares In Early GRB Afterglows
          Authors: W. H. Gao
          Comments: 6 pages
          Energetic  X-ray  flares  have  been  well  detected  in a good
          fraction  of  {\em Swift} Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) afterglows tens
          to  hundreds  of  seconds  after  the  trigger  of  the  prompt
          $\gamma-$ray   emission   phase.   These   flares  are  usually
          attributed  to the late time activity of the central engine. We
          suggest  a  new central engine model to account for these X-ray
          flares.  In  this  model,  the GRB central engine is a rotating
          magnetized  supramassive neutron star (SMNS). When the SMNS has
          lost  its significant part of angular momentum, it collapses to
          a  black  hole  and  produces a Poynting-flux dominated outflow
          which give rise to the observed X-ray flares.

          We  study  the  hydrodynamical transition from an hadronic star
          into  a quark or a hybrid star. We discuss the possible mode of
          burning,  using  a  fully  relativistic formalism and realistic
          Equations  of  State  in which hyperons can be present. We also
          take  into  account  the possibility that quarks form a diquark
          condensate.  An estimate of the final temperature of the system
          is  provided.  We  find  that  the  conversion  process  always
          corresponds to a strong deflagration and never to a detonation.
          We  also  find  that although the front is unstable, convection
          not  always develops. In particular the system does not develop
          convection if hyperons are not present in the initial phase and
          if  the newly formed quark phase is made of ungapped (or weakly
          gapped) quarks. At the contrary, the process of conversion from
          ungapped  quark  matter  to  gapped  quarks  always  allows the
          formation  of a convective layer. We also discuss the formation
          of  a  mixed phase of hadrons and quarks, and we indicate which
          region  of the star can rapidly convert in the various possible
          scenarios.   Finally,   we   discuss   possible   astrophysical
          implications of our results.

          Title:  On  the relationship between radio and X-ray signatures
          of drifting subpulses
          Authors: Janusz Gil, George Melikidze, Bing Zhang
          A partially screened vacuum gap model of the inner acceleration
          region  in  pulsars  is  examined  with respect to the drifting
          subpulse  phenomenon  and the polar cap heating by \EB drifting
          sparks.  The  efficiency  of  the  X-ray luminosity from heated
          polar cap is derived as $L_x/\dot{E}\approx(\hat{P}_3/P)^{-2}$,
          which depends only on the observational tertiary subpulse drift
          periodicity $\hat{P}_3$. In PSR B0943$+$10 for which both $L_x$
          and $\hat{P}_3$ are known, this formula is perfectly satisfied.
          Based  on  several  cases  in  which $\hat{P}_3$ is known it is
          argued that $L_x/\dot{E}\sim 10^{-3}$. This intriguing property
          was   previously   attributed   to  the  pulsar  magnetospheric
          emission.  In  this  paper we suggest that this could also be a
          characteristic  property  of  thermal  emission from the heated
          polar cap.

          The  first  locations  of  short  gamma-ray  bursts  (GRBs)  in
          elliptical galaxies suggest they are produced by the mergers of
          double  neutron star (DNS) binaries in old stellar populations.
          Globular  clusters,  where  the  extreme  densities of very old
          stars  in  cluster  cores  create and exchange compact binaries
          efficiently,  are a natural environment to produce merging NSs.
          They  also  allow  some short GRBs to be offset from their host
          galaxies,  as opposed to DNS systems formed from massive binary
          stars which appear to remain in galactic disks. Starting with a
          simple  scaling  from  the  first  DNS  observed  in a galactic
          globular,  which will produce a short GRB in ~300My, we present
          numerical simulations which show that ~10-30% of short GRBs may
          be produced in globular clusters vs. the much more numerous DNS
          mergers   and   short   GRBs   predicted  for  galactic  disks.
          Reconciling  the  rates  suggests  the disk short GRBs are more
          beamed,  perhaps  by both the increased merger angular momentum
          from  the  DNS spin-orbit alignment (random for the DNS systems
          in globulars) and a larger magnetic field on the secondary NS.

          We  consider the early cooling evolution of strongly magnetized
          strange  stars  in  a  CFL  phase and develop a new pulsar kick
          mechanism  based  on  beaming  of  neutrino  emission along the
          magnetic   vortex  lines  and  parity  violation  of  the  weak
          interaction   neutrino-producing   Urca  process  in  a  strong
          magnetic  field.  We  show  that  for sufficiently high initial
          temperatures  T  ~  40  MeV and magnetic fields B ~ 10^{12} ...
          10^{17}  G, the energy release is about 10^{51} ... 10^{53} erg
          with  a magnetic field dependent time scale between 10^{-2} ...
          10^3 s. The wide range of observed neutron star kick velocities
          can  be  explained by the variety of magnetic fields in compact
          stars.

          Title:  Interacting  X-ray Binaries in Globular Clusters: 47Tuc
          vs. NGC 6397

          Interacting Binaries
          Journal-ref: AIP Conf. Proc., volume 797, pp. 13-22 (2005)
          Our  deep  Chandra exposures of 47Tuc and moderate exposures of
          NGC 6397 reveal a wealth of new phenomena for interacting X-ray
          binaries  (IXBs)  in  globular clusters. In this (late) Review,
          updated  since  the  conference, I summarize recent and ongoing
          analysis  of  the  millisecond  pulsars,  the  compact binaries
          containing   white   dwarfs   and   neutron   stars,   and  the
          chromospherically  active  binaries  in both globular clusters.
          Spectral  variability analysis enables new insights into source
          properties  and evolutionary history. These binary populations,
          now   so  ``easily''  visible,  are  large  enough  that  their
          properties  and  spatial  distributions  reveal  new  hints  of
          compact  object  formation  and  binary interactions with their
          parent  cluster. Neutron stars appear overabundant, relative to
          white  dwarfs,  in  47Tuc  vs.  NGC  6397.  The IXBs containing
          neutron  stars (i.e., MSPs and qLMXBs), as the most massive and
          ancient  compact binary sample, may trace the protocluster disk
          in  47Tuc,  whereas  compact  binaries  may  have  been ejected
          preferentially  along  the  cluster rotation equator during the
          recent core collapse in NGC 6397.

          Title: Isovector Channel Role of Relativistic Mean Field Models
          in the Neutrino Mean Free Path

          Journal-ref: Physical Review C 72, 065801 (2005)
          An  improvement  in  the  treatment of the isovector channel of
          relativistic  mean  field (RMF) models based on effective field
          theory  (E-RMF)  is  suggested,  by  adding an isovector scalar
          (delta)  meson and using a similar procedure to the one used by
          Horowitz and Piekarewicz to adjust the isovector-vector channel
          in  order to achieve a softer density dependent symmetry energy
          of  the  nuclear  matter  at high density. Their effects on the
          equation  of  state  (EOS)  at high density and on the neutrino
          mean free path (NMFP) in neutron stars are discussed.

          The effects of vector-isovector terms predicted by relativistic
          mean  field  models  based  on  effective  field  theory on the
          equation  of  state  and the neutrino mean free path in neutron
          stars  have been studied. Using a procedure similar to Ref. [1]
          in  treating  the  isovector sector, a parameter set (G2*) that
          predicts  a  much smaller proton fraction than the standard one
          (G2)  can  be  obtained.  We  found  that  the G2* has a softer
          equation  of  state  compared to the G2 at higher densities and
          the  disappearance  of  the  anomalous behavior of the neutrino
          mean  free  path  in neutron star does not depend on the proton
          fraction.

          Authors: S. Popov, H. Grigorian, D. Blaschke
          Comments: 10 pages, 9 figures, 1 table
          We  apply  the recently developed Log N - Log S test of compact
          star cooling theories for the first time to hybrid stars with a
          color superconducting quark matter core. While there is not yet
          a  microscopically  founded  superconducting quark matter phase
          which  would fulfill constraints from cooling phenomenology, we
          explore   the  hypothetical  2SC+X  phase  and  show  that  the
          magnitude  and density-dependence of the X-gap can be chosen to
          satisfy  a  set  of  tests:  temperature  -  age  (T  - t), the
          brightness  constraint,  Log  N  - Log S, and the mass spectrum
          constraint.  The  latter  test appears as a new conjecture from
          the present investigation.

          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures
          A  sterile  neutrino  with  mass of several keV can account for
          cosmological  dark  matter,  as  well  as  explain the observed
          velocities  of  pulsars.  We  show  that X-rays produced by the
          decays   of   these  relic  sterile  neutrinos  can  boost  the
          production  of  molecular  hydrogen,  which  can  speed  up the
          cooling  of  gas  and  the  early star formation, which can, in
          turn,  lead  to a reionization of the universe at a high enough
          redshift to be consistent with the WMAP results.

          We  study the charge screening effect in the hadron-quark mixed
          phase.  By including the charge screening effect, rearrangement
          of  charged  particles  occurs  and  some  part becomes locally
          charge-neutral. As a result the equation of state for the mixed
          phase  becomes close to that given by the Maxwell construction,
          which  means  that  the  Maxwell construction would effectively
          gain  the physical meaning again even in the system with two or
          more  chemical potentials. We also discuss the interplay of the
          surface tension and the Coulomb interaction. Both effects would
          restrict  the  region  of the mixed phase in the core of hybrid
          stars.

          We  study  the  bending  of  jets  in binary stellar systems. A
          compact  companion  accretes  mass  from  the  slow wind of the
          mass-losing  primary  star,  forms an accretion disk, and blows
          two  opposite  jets. These fast jets are bent by the slow wind.
          Disregarding  the orbital motion, we find the dependence of the
          bending  angle on the properties of the slow wind and the jets.
          Bending  of  jets  is  observed  in planetary nebulae which are
          thought  to be the descendants of interacting binary stars. For
          example,  in  some  of  these planetary nebulae the two bubbles
          (lobes)  which  are  inflated  by  the  two  opposite jets, are
          displaced  to the same side of the symmetry axis of the nebula.
          Similar  displacements  are  observed  in  bubble  pairs in the
          center  of some clusters and groups of galaxies. We compare the
          bending of jets in binary stellar systems with that in clusters
          of galaxies.

          Propagation   of   light   in   the   gravitational   field  of
          self-gravitating   spinning   bodies   moving   with  arbitrary
          velocities  is discussed. The gravitational field is assumed to
          be  "weak"  everywhere.  Equations of motion of a light ray are
          solved  in  the  first  post-Minkowskian  approximation that is
          linear  with  respect  to  the universal gravitational constant
          $G$.  We  do  not  restrict ourselves with the approximation of
          gravitational  lens  so that the solution of light geodesics is
          applicable  for  arbitrary  locations  of  source  of light and
          observer. This formalism is applied for studying corrections to
          the Shapiro time delay in binary pulsars caused by the rotation
          of  pulsar  and its companion. We also derive the correction to
          the  light  deflection  angle caused by rotation of gravitating
          bodies  in  the  solar system (Sun, planets) or a gravitational
          lens.  The gravitational shift of frequency due to the combined
          translational  and  rotational  motions of light-ray-deflecting
          bodies is analyzed as well. We give a general derivation of the
          formula  describing  the  relativistic rotation of the plane of
          polarization  of electromagnetic waves (Skrotskii effect). This
          formula  is  valid  for  arbitrary translational and rotational
          motion of gravitating bodies and greatly extends the results of
          previous  researchers. Finally, we discuss the Skrotskii effect
          for  gravitational waves emitted by localized sources such as a
          binary  system.  The  theoretical  results of this paper can be
          applied   for   studying   various   relativistic   effects  in
          microarcsecond  space  astrometry  and developing corresponding
          algorithms  for  data  processing in space astrometric missions
          such as FAME, SIM, and GAIA.

          Title: Physical Interpretations of Rotating Radio Transients
          Authors:  Bing  Zhang  (UNLV),  Janusz Gil (Zielona Gora Univ),
          Jaroslow Dyks (Nicolaus Copernicus Center)
          Comments: 3 pages, submitted to ApJL
          Nearly  a  dozen of Rotating RAdio Transients (RRATs) have been
          discovered   recently.   These   objects   share  similar  spin
          parameters with normal radio pulsars but distinguish themselves
          from  normal  pulsars  by  being quiescent most of the time and
          only   becoming  radio  bright  occasionally.  We  discuss  two
          possible  interpretations  to  the  phenomenon. The first model
          suggests  that  these  objects  are  pulsars slightly below the
          radio  emission  ``death line'', and become active occasionally
          when  the  conditions for pair production and coherent emission
          are  satisfied.  The  second  model  invokes  a  radio emission
          direction reversal in normal pulsars, as has been introduced to
          interpret   the   peculiar  mode  changing  phenomenon  in  PSR
          B1822-09.  In  this  picture, our line of sight misses the main
          radio  emission beam of RRATs but happens to sweep the emission
          beam  when  the radio emission direction is reversed. RRATs are
          therefore  the other half of the normal ``nulling'' pulsars. We
          suggest   that   X-ray   observations   can  provide  clues  to
          differentiate these two possibilities.

          We  report  on an {\it XMM-Newton} observation of the supernova
          remnant  (SNR) \object{DEM L241} in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
          In  the  soft  band  image,  the  emission  shows  an elongated
          structure, like a killifish, with a central compact source. The
          compact    source    is   point-like,   and   named   as   XMMU
          J053559.3$-$673509. The source spectrum is well reproduced with
          a  power-law  model  with  a  photon  index  of $\Gamma = 1.57$
          (1.51--1.62) and the intrinsic luminosity is $2.2\times 10^{35}
          \mathrm{ergs  s^{-1}}$  in  the  0.5--10.0  keV  band, with the
          assumed  distance of 50 kpc. The source has neither significant
          coherent pulsations in $2.0\times 10^{-3}$ Hz--8.0 Hz, nor time
          variabilities.  Its  luminosity  and  spectrum suggest that the
          source  might  be  a  pulsar wind nebula (PWN) in DEM L241. The
          spectral  feature classifies this source into rather bright and
          hard  PWN, which is similar to those in Kes 75 and B0540$-$693.
          The  elongated diffuse structure can be divided into a ``Head''
          and  ``Tail'',  and both have soft and line-rich spectra. Their
          spectra  are  well  reproduced by a plane-parallel shock plasma
          ({\it  vpshock})  model  with a temperature of 0.3--0.4 keV and
          over-abundance  in  O  and Ne and a relative under-abundance in
          Fe. Such an abundance pattern and the morphology imply that the
          emission is from the ejecta of the SNR, and that the progenitor
          of  DEM  L241  is a very massive star, more than 20 M\sun. This
          result  is also supported by the existence of the central point
          source  and  an  OB  star association, LH 88. The total thermal
          energy  and  plasma  mass  are  $\sim 4\times 10^{50}$ ergs and
          $\sim 200$ M\sun, respectively.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  report  on  two  ASCA  observations  of the high-mass X-ray
          binary   pulsar   OAO   1657-415.   A  short  observation  near
          mid-eclipse  caught the source in a low-intensity state, with a
          weak  continuum  and  iron  emission  dominated  by the 6.4-keV
          fluorescent  line. A later, longer observation found the source
          in  a  high-intensity  state and covered the uneclipsed through
          mid-eclipse   phases.   In   the   high-intensity   state,  the
          non-eclipse spectrum has an absorbed continuum component due to
          scattering  by  material near the pulsar and 80 per cent of the
          fluorescent  iron  emission comes from less than 19 lt-sec away
          from  the  pulsar.  We  find  a dust-scattered X-ray halo whose
          intensity  decays  through  the  eclipse.  We  use this halo to
          estimate the distance to the source as 7.1 +/- 1.3 kpc.

          We  analyzed  archival X-ray spectra of MXB 1728-34 obtained in
          1996-99  by the Proportional Counter Array on board of the RXTE
          satellite.  X-ray spectra were fitted to our extensive grids of
          model atmosphere spectra to determine the effective temperature
          T_eff on the neutron star surface, logarithm of surface gravity
          log(g),  and  the  gravitational  redshift z simultaneously. We
          have  chosen  fitting  by  numerical  model  spectra plus broad
          Gaussian  line,  modified  by  interstellar  absorption and the
          absorption    on    dust.   We   arbitrarily   assumed   either
          hydrogen-helium  chemical composition of a model atmosphere, or
          H-He-Fe  mixture  in  solar  proportion. The statistically best
          values  of  log(g),  and  z subsequently were used to determine
          mass  and  radius  of  the  neutron  star. We obtained the best
          values  of  the  parameters for the neutron star in X-ray burst
          source  MXB 1728-34: mass either M=0.40 or 0.63 M_sol (for H-He
          or  H-He-Fe  models,  respectively),  radius  R=4.6  or 5.3 km,
          log(g)=14.6  or  14.6  and the gravitational redshift z=0.14 or
          0.22.   All   the  above  parameters  have  very  wide  1-sigma
          confidence  limits.  Their values strongly support the equation
          of state for strange matter in MXB 1728-34.

          Pulsars   steadily   dissipate   their  rotational  energy  via
          relativistic  winds.  Confinement  of  these outflows generates
          luminous  pulsar  wind nebulae, seen across the electromagnetic
          spectrum  in  synchrotron  and inverse Compton emission, and in
          optical  emission lines when they shock the surrounding medium.
          These  sources  act as important probes of relativistic shocks,
          particle  acceleration  and  of interstellar gas. We review the
          many  recent advances in the study of pulsar wind nebulae, with
          particular focus on the evolutionary stages through which these
          objects progress as they expand into their surroundings, and on
          morphological  structures  within  these nebulae which directly
          trace  the  physical  processes  of  particle  acceleration and
          outflow. We conclude by considering some exciting new probes of
          pulsar  wind  nebulae,  including  the  study  of TeV gamma-ray
          emission  from  these sources, and observations of pulsar winds
          in close binary systems.

          Title:  Optical  Spectroscopy  of  X-Mega targets in the Carina

          We   report   the   discovery  of  a  new  O-type  double-lined
          spectroscopic  binary  with a short orbital period of 1.4 days.
          We find the primary component of this binary, FO 15, to have an
          approximate spectral type O5.5Vz, i.e. a Zero-Age-Main-Sequence
          star.  The  secondary  appears to be of spectral type O9.5V. We
          have  performed  a  numerical  model  fit  to  the  public ASAS
          photometry, which shows that FO 15 is also an eclipsing binary.
          We find an orbital inclination of ~ 80 deg. From a simultaneous
          light-curve and radial velocity solution we find the masses and
          radii  of  the two components to be 30 +/- 1 and 16 +/- 1 solar
          masses  and  7.5  +/-  0.5  and  5.3 +/- 0.5 solar radii. These
          radii,  and hence also the luminosities, are smaller than those
          of  normal  O-type  stars,  but  similar  to recently born ZAMS
          O-type stars. The absolute magnitudes derived from our analysis
          locate  FO 15 at the same distance as Eta Carinae. From Chandra
          and  XMM  X-ray  images  we  also find that there are two close
          X-ray  sources,  one  coincident  with  FO  15  and another one
          without  optical  counterpart. This latter seems to be a highly
          variable  source, presumably due to a pre-main-sequence stellar
          neighbour of FO 15.

          Title:  The flat synchrotron spectra of partially self-absorbed
          jets revisited
          Authors: Christian R. Kaiser (University of Southampton)
          Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          Flat  radio  spectra  with large brightness temperatures at the
          core  of  AGN and X-ray binaries are usually interpreted as the
          partially self-absorbed bases of jet flows emitting synchrotron
          radiation.  Here  we extend previous models of jets propagating
          at  large  angles  to  our  line  of sight to self-consistently
          include  the  effects  of  energy  losses  of  the relativistic
          electrons  due  to  the  synchrotron  process  itself  and  the
          adiabatic  expansion of the jet flow. We also take into account
          energy  gains  through  self-absorption.  Two model classes are
          presented.  The  ballistic  jet  flows,  with  the jet material
          travelling  along  straight  trajectories,  and adiabatic jets.
          Despite  the  energy  losses, both scenarios can result in flat
          emission   spectra,  however,  the  adiabatic  jets  require  a
          specific  geometry. No re-acceleration process along the jet is
          needed  for the electrons. We apply the models to observational
          data  of  the  X-ray binary Cygnus X-1. Both models can be made
          consistent  with  the observations. The resulting ballistic jet
          is  extremely  narrow  with a jet opening angle of only 5". Its
          energy  transport  rate  is small compared to the time-averaged
          jet  power and therefore suggests the presence of non-radiating
          protons  in  the  jet flow. The adiabatic jets require a strong
          departure  from energy equipartition between the magnetic field
          and  the  relativistic electrons. These models also imply a jet
          power  two  orders  of  magnitude  higher  than  the  Eddington
          limiting  luminosity  of a 10 solar mass black hole. The models
          put  strong  constraints  on the physical conditions in the jet
          flows on scales well below achievable resolution limits.

          Title: XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the ultra-compact
          binary RX J1914+24

          ((1) MSSL/UCL, (2) Univ Helsinki, (3) Tuorla Observatory)
          Comments: Accepted MNRAS Letters
          The nature of the X-ray source RX J1914+24 has been the subject
          of  much  debate.  It  shows  a  prominent period of 569 sec in
          X-rays  and the optical/infra-red: in most models this has been
          interpreted  as  the  binary  orbital  period.  We  present our
          analysis  of  new XMM-Newton and Chandra data. We find a longer
          term  trend in the XMM-Newton data and power at 556 and 585 sec
          in  5  sets  of data. It is not clear if they are produced as a
          result  of a beat between a longer intrinsic period and the 569
          sec  modulation  or  if  they are due to secular variations. We
          obtain  a  good  fit  to  the  XMM-Newton  spectrum  with a low
          temperature  thermal plasma model with an edge at 0.83keV. This
          model  implies  an  unabsorbed  bolometric  X-ray luminosity of
          1x10^{33} ergs/s (for a distance of 1kpc) - this is 2 orders of
          magnitude  lower  than  our  previous estimate (derived using a
          different  model).  If  the  distance  is  much  less,  as  the
          absorption derived from the X-ray fits suggest, then it is even
          lower at \~3x10^{31} ergs/s.

          We  present an X-ray tour of diffuse emission in the 30 Doradus
          star-forming  complex  in  the  Large  Magellanic  Cloud  using
          high-spatial-resolution  X-ray  images  and  spatially-resolved
          spectra  obtained  with  the  Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer
          aboard  the  Chandra  X-ray  Observatory.  The  dominant  X-ray
          feature  of  the  30 Doradus nebula is the intricate network of
          diffuse  emission  generated  by  interacting stellar winds and
          supernovae  working together to create vast superbubbles filled
          with  hot  plasma.  We  construct  maps  of  the region showing
          variations  in  plasma  temperature (T = 3--9 million degrees),
          absorption    (N_H    =    1--6   x   10^{21}   cm^{-2}),   and
          absorption-corrected  X-ray  surface brightness (S_X = 3--126 x
          10^{31} ergs s^{-1} pc^{-2}). Enhanced images reveal the pulsar
          wind  nebula  in  the composite supernova remnant N157B and the
          Chandra   data   show   spectral   evolution  from  non-thermal
          synchrotron  emission  in the N157B core to a thermal plasma in
          its  outer regions. In a companion paper we show that R136, the
          central  massive  star  cluster,  is  resolved at the arcsecond
          level  into  almost 100 X-ray sources. Through X-ray studies of
          30  Doradus  the  complete life cycle of such a massive stellar
          cluster can be revealed.

          Title:  From Canonical to Enhanced Extra Mixing in Low-Mass Red
          Giants: Tidally Locked Binaries

          Li  (1)  ((1) Dartmouth College, (2) The Ohio State University,

          Comments: 47 pages, 19 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          Stellar  models  which  incorporate  simple  diffusion or shear
          induced  mixing  are used to describe canonical extra mixing in
          low  mass red giants of low and solar metallicity. These models
          are  able  to  simultaneously  explain  the  observed Li and CN
          abundance  changes  along upper red giant branch (RGB) in field
          low-metallicity stars and match photometry, rotation and carbon
          isotopic  ratios  for  stars  in  the old open cluster M67. The
          shear mixing model requires that main sequence (MS) progenitors
          of  upper  RGB stars possessed rapidly rotating radiative cores
          and  that  specific  angular  momentum was conserved in each of
          their  mass  shells  during  their  evolution.  We surmise that
          solar-type  stars will not experience canonical extra mixing on
          the  RGB  because their more efficient MS spin-down resulted in
          solid-body rotation, as revealed by helioseismological data for
          the  Sun.  Thus, RGB stars in the old, high metallicity cluster
          NGC  6791  should  show  no evidence for mixing in their carbon
          isotopic ratios.
          We  develop  the  idea  that  canonical extra mixing in a giant
          component  of  a  binary system may be switched to its enhanced
          mode with much faster and somewhat deeper mixing as a result of
          the   giant's   tidal   spin-up.   This  scenario  can  explain
          photometric  and  composition peculiarities of RS CVn binaries.
          The  tidally enforced enhanced extra mixing might contribute to
          the  star-to-star  abundance  variations  of  O,  Na  and Al in
          globular clusters. This idea may be tested with observations of
          carbon isotopic ratios and CN abundances in RS CVn binaries.

          warped accretion discs
          Authors: Stephen B. Foulkes, Carole A. Haswell, James R. Murray
          Comments:  12 pages, 12 figures, paper accepted for publication
          by MNRAS
          We  present  three  dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics
          (SPH)  calculations  of  warped accretion discs in X-ray binary
          systems.  Geometrically  thin,  optically thick accretion discs
          are   illuminated   by   a   central   radiation  source.  This
          illumination  exerts  a  non-axisymmetric radiation pressure on
          the  surface of the disc resulting in a torque that acts on the
          disc  to  induce  a  twist  or warp. Initially planar discs are
          unstable  to  warping  driven  by  the  radiation torque and in
          general  the  warps  also  precess  in  a  retrograde direction
          relative  to  the  orbital  flow. We simulate a number of X-ray
          binary  systems which have different mass ratios using a number
          of  different  luminosities  for each. Radiation-driven warping
          occurs  for  all  systems  simulated. For mass ratios q ~ 0.1 a
          moderate  warp  occurs  in  the inner disc while the outer disc
          remains  in  the  orbital  plane  (c.f.  X  1916-053). For less
          extreme  mass  ratios  the entire disc tilts out of the orbital
          plane  (c.f.  Her  X-1).  For  discs that are tilted out of the
          orbital  plane  in which the outer edge material of the disc is
          precessing  in a prograde direction we obtain both positive and
          negative  superhumps  simultaneously  in  the dissipation light
          curve (c.f. V603 Aql).

          Title: Eclipsing binaries in extrasolar planet transit surveys:
          the case of SuperWASP
          Authors: B. Willems, U. Kolb, S. Justham
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Using  a  comprehensive  binary population synthesis scheme, we
          investigate the statistical properties of a sample of eclipsing
          binaries  that  is detectable by an idealised extrasolar planet
          transit  survey with specifications broadly similar to those of
          the  SuperWASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets) project. In this
          idealised survey the total number of detectable single stars in
          the  Galactic  disc  is of the order of 10^6-10^7, while, for a
          flat  initial  mass  ratio  distribution,  the  total number of
          detectable eclipsing binaries is of the order of 10^4-10^5. The
          majority  of  the population of detectable single stars is made
          up of main-sequence stars (60%), horizontal-branch stars (20%),
          and  giant-branch stars (10%). The largest contributions to the
          population  of detectable eclipsing binaries stem from detached
          double main-sequence star binaries (60%), detached giant-branch
          main-sequence     star    binaries    (20%),    and    detached
          horizontal-branch  main-sequence star binaries (10%). The ratio
          of  the  number  of  eclipsing binaries to the number of single
          stars  detectable  by  the idealised SuperWASP survey varies by
          less  than  a  factor of 2.5 across the sky, and decreases with
          increasing  Galactic latitude. It is found to be largest in the
          direction  of the Galactic longitude l=-7.5deg and the Galactic
          latitude b=-22.5deg. We also show that the fractions of systems
          in  different  subgroups of eclipsing binaries are sensitive to
          the  adopted  initial  mass ratio distribution, which is one of
          the  poorest constrained input parameters in present-day binary
          population  synthesis  calculations.  This  suggests  that once
          statistically  meaningful  results  from  transit  surveys  are
          available,  they  will  be  able  to  significantly improve the
          predictive power of population synthesis studies of interacting
          binaries and related objects. (abridged)

          Title:  Collapse  of  Neutron  Stars  to  Black Holes in Binary
          Systems: A Model for Short Gamma Ray Bursts
          Authors:  Charles D. Dermer (1), Armen Atoyan (2) ((1) NRL, (2)
          University of Montreal)
          Comments:  9  pages, submitted as a letter to the Astrophysical
          Journal
          The  accretion  of ~ 0.1 -- 1 M_o of material by a neutron star
          through  Roche  lobe  overflow  of  its  companion  or  through
          white-dwarf/neutron-star  coalescence  in  a  low  mass  binary
          system could be enough to exceed the critical mass of a neutron
          star  and  trigger its collapse to a black hole, leading to the
          production  of  a  short gamma-ray burst (SGRB). In this model,
          SGRBs  would  often  be  found  in  early-type  galaxies  or in
          globular cluster environments, though they could also be formed
          through  stellar-wind  accretion in high-mass binary systems of
          star-forming galaxies. Although the collapse event is likely to
          be  of  short  (<< 1 s) duration, afterglow complexity could be
          produced  by  neutron decoupling in the fireball and subsequent
          accretion  of the companion remnant, for example, the disrupted
          white-dwarf core.

          Title: Quantifying the Luminosity Evolution in Gamma-ray Bursts
          Authors: Daniel Kocevski, Edison Liang
          We  estimate  the  luminosity  evolution and formation rate for
          over  900 GRBs by using redshift and luminosity data calculated
          by  Band,  Norris,  $&$  Bonnell  (2004) via the lag-luminosity
          correlation.  By applying maximum likelihood techniques, we are
          able   to  infer  the  true  distribution  of  the  parent  GRB
          population's luminosity function and density distributions in a
          way  that accounts for detector selection effects. We find that
          after  accounting  for  data  truncation,  there still exists a
          significant  correlation  between  the  average  luminosity and
          redshift,  indicating  that  distant  GRBs  are on average more
          luminous  than  nearby  counterparts.  This  is consistent with
          previous  studies  showing  strong  source  evolution  and also
          recent  observations  of under luminous nearby GRBs. We find no
          evidence  for  beaming angle evolution in the current sample of
          GRBs  with  known  redshift,  suggesting  that this increase in
          luminosity can not be due to an evolution of the collimation of
          gamma-ray  emission.  The resulting luminosity function is well
          fit  with  a  single  power  law of index $L'^{-1.5}$, which is
          intermediate  between the values predicted by the power-law and
          Gaussian  structured  jet  models.  We  also  find that the GRB
          comoving  rate  density rises steeply with a broad peak between
          $1<z<2$  followed  by  a steady decline above $z> 3$. This rate
          density  qualitatively  matches  the  current  estimates of the
          cosmic star formation rate, favoring a short lived massive star
          progenitor  model, or a binary model with a short delay between
          the formation of the compact object and the eventual merger.

          We  present  the  first  mid-IR  long  baseline interferometric
          observations of the circumstellar matter around binary post-AGB
          stars.  Two  objects,  SX Cen and HD 52961, were observed using
          the  VLTI/MIDI  instrument  during  Science Demonstration Time.
          Both objects are known binaries for which a stable circumbinary
          disc  is  proposed  to explain the SED characteristics. This is
          corroborated  by  our  N-band  spectrum showing a crystallinity
          fraction  of  more  than  50  % for both objects, pointing to a
          stable   environment   where   dust   processing   can   occur.
          Surprisingly,  the  dust  surrounding SX Cen is not resolved in
          the interferometric observations providing an upper limit of 11
          mas  (or  18 AU at the distance of this object) on the diameter
          of  the dust emission. This confirms the very compact nature of
          its  circumstellar  environment.  The  dust  emission around HD
          52961  originates  from  a  very  small  but  resolved  region,
          estimated to be ~ 35 mas at 8 micron and ~ 55 mas at 13 micron.
          These  results  confirm  the  disc interpretation of the SED of
          both  stars.  In  HD  52961, the dust is not homogeneous in its
          chemical composition: the crystallinity is clearly concentrated
          in  the  hotter  inner  region. Whether this is a result of the
          formation  process  of the disc, or due to annealing during the
          long storage time in the disc is not clear.

          Comments: 30 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in AJ
          We  have used a proper combination of multiband high-resolution
          {\it  HST-WFPC2}  and  wide-field  ground based observations to
          image  the  galactic  globular  cluster  NGC  6266  (M62).  The
          extensive  photometric  data  set  allows  us  to determine the
          center  of  gravity  and  to construct the most extended radial
          profile  ever  published  for  this  cluster including, for the
          first  time, detailed star counts in the very inner region. The
          star  density  profile  is  well  reproduced by a standard King
          model with an extended core ($\sim 19''$) and a modest value of
          the  concentration  parameter  ($c=1.5$),  indicating  that the
          cluster has not-yet experienced core collapse.
          The  millisecond  pulsar  population  (whose members are all in
          binary systems) and the X-ray emitting population (more than 50
          sources  within  the cluster half mass radius) suggest that NGC
          6266  is in a dynamical phase particularly active in generating
          binaries  through  dynamical encounters. UV observations of the
          central  region  have been used to probe the population of blue
          straggler  stars,  whose  origin  might  be  also  affected  by
          dynamical  interactions.  The  comparison  with  other globular
          clusters  observed  with a similar strategy shows that the blue
          straggler  content  in  NGC  6266 is relatively low, suggesting
          that the formation channel that produces binary systems hosting
          neutron stars or white dwarfs is not effective in significantly
          increasing   the   blue   straggler  population.  Moreover,  an
          anticorrelation  between  millisecond  pulsar  content and blue
          straggler specific frequency in globular cluster seems emerging
          with increasing evidence.

          We  report on diffuse X-ray emission associated with the nearby
          solitary   millisecond  pulsar  PSR  J2124-3358  detected  with
          XMM-Newton and Chandra. The emission extends from the pulsar to
          the  northwest  by  ~0.5  arcmin.  The  spectrum of the nebular
          emission  can  be  modeled  with  a  power-law  of photon index
          $2.2\pm0.3$,   in  line  with  the  emission  originating  from
          accelerated   particles   in  the  post  shock  flow.  For  PSR
          J0437-4715,  PSR  J0030+0451 and PSR J1024-0719, which all have
          spin  parameters  comparable  to  that  of  PSR  J2124-3358, no
          diffuse  emission  is  detected  down  to  a  limiting  flux of
          $2-3\times10^{-15}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$.

          We   present   results  from  fully  nonlinear  simulations  of

          four  cases  with mass ratios q = M_2/M_1 = (1,0.96,0.85,0.54),

          these  modes  yields  insight on how the mass ratio in a binary
          impacts  the  degree of complexity of the emitted waveforms. In

          Title:    Supersymmetric   Thermalization   and   Quasi-Thermal
          Universe: Consequences for Gravitinos and Leptogenesis
          Authors: Rouzbeh Allahverdi, Anupam Mazumdar
          Comments: 53 pages
          Motivated  by  our  earlier paper \cite{am}, we discuss how the
          infamous  gravitino  problem  has  a  natural built in solution
          within  supersymmetry.  Supersymmetry  allows a large number of
          flat  directions  made up of {\it gauge invariant} combinations
          of  squarks  and  sleptons.  Out  of  many  at  least {\it one}
          generically  obtains  a  large  vacuum expectation value during
          inflation.  Gauge  bosons and Gauginos then obtain large masses
          by  virtue  of  the  Higgs  mechanism.  This  makes the rate of
          thermalization  after  the end of inflation very small and as a
          result  the  Universe  enters a {\it quasi-thermal phase} after
          the inflaton has completely decayed. A full thermal equilibrium
          is   generically  established  much  later  on  when  the  flat
          direction  expectation value has substantially decareased. This
          results  in low reheat temperatures, i.e., $T_{\rm R}\sim {\cal
          O}({\rm  TeV})$, which are compatible with the stringent bounds
          arising  from  the big bang nucleosynthesis. There are two very
          important   implications:  the  production  of  gravitinos  and
          generation  of a baryonic asymmetry via leptogenesis during the
          quasi-thermal  phase.  In  both the cases the abundances depend
          not only on an effective temperature of the quasi-thermal phase
          (which  could  be  higher, i.e., $T\gg T_{\rm R}$), but also on
          the  state  of  equilibrium  in the reheat plasma. We show that
          there  is  no  ``thermal  gravitino  problem''  at  all  within
          supersymmetry  and  we stress on a need of a new paradigm based
          on a ``quasi-thermal leptogenesis'', because in the bulk of the
          parameter  space  the  {\it  old}  thermal  leptogenesis cannot
          account for the observed baryon asymmetry.

          Systems: A Model for Short Gamma Ray Bursts
          Authors:  Charles D. Dermer (1), Armen Atoyan (2) ((1) NRL, (2)

          Comments:  9  pages, submitted as a letter to the Astrophysical
          Journal
          The  accretion  of ~ 0.1 -- 1 M_o of material by a neutron star
          through  Roche  lobe  overflow  of  its  companion  or  through
          white-dwarf/neutron-star  coalescence  in  a  low  mass  binary
          system could be enough to exceed the critical mass of a neutron
          star  and  trigger its collapse to a black hole, leading to the
          production  of  a  short gamma-ray burst (SGRB). In this model,
          SGRBs  would  often  be  found  in  early-type  galaxies  or in
          globular cluster environments, though they could also be formed
          through  stellar-wind  accretion in high-mass binary systems of
          star-forming galaxies. Although the collapse event is likely to
          be  of  short  (<< 1 s) duration, afterglow complexity could be
          produced  by  neutron decoupling in the fireball and subsequent
          accretion  of the companion remnant, for example, the disrupted
          white-dwarf core.

          Title: Quantifying the Luminosity Evolution in Gamma-ray Bursts
          Authors: Daniel Kocevski, Edison Liang
          We  estimate  the  luminosity  evolution and formation rate for
          over  900 GRBs by using redshift and luminosity data calculated
          by  Band,  Norris,  $&$  Bonnell  (2004) via the lag-luminosity
          correlation.  By applying maximum likelihood techniques, we are
          able   to  infer  the  true  distribution  of  the  parent  GRB
          population's luminosity function and density distributions in a
          way  that accounts for detector selection effects. We find that
          after  accounting  for  data  truncation,  there still exists a
          significant  correlation  between  the  average  luminosity and
          redshift,  indicating  that  distant  GRBs  are on average more
          luminous  than  nearby  counterparts.  This  is consistent with
          previous  studies  showing  strong  source  evolution  and also
          recent  observations  of under luminous nearby GRBs. We find no
          evidence  for  beaming angle evolution in the current sample of
          GRBs  with  known  redshift,  suggesting  that this increase in
          luminosity can not be due to an evolution of the collimation of
          gamma-ray  emission.  The resulting luminosity function is well
          fit  with  a  single  power  law of index $L'^{-1.5}$, which is
          intermediate  between the values predicted by the power-law and
          Gaussian  structured  jet  models.  We  also  find that the GRB
          comoving  rate  density rises steeply with a broad peak between
          $1<z<2$  followed  by  a steady decline above $z> 3$. This rate
          density  qualitatively  matches  the  current  estimates of the
          cosmic star formation rate, favoring a short lived massive star
          progenitor  model, or a binary model with a short delay between
          the formation of the compact object and the eventual merger.

          We  present  the  first  mid-IR  long  baseline interferometric
          observations of the circumstellar matter around binary post-AGB
          stars.  Two  objects,  SX Cen and HD 52961, were observed using
          the  VLTI/MIDI  instrument  during  Science Demonstration Time.
          Both objects are known binaries for which a stable circumbinary
          disc  is  proposed  to explain the SED characteristics. This is
          corroborated  by  our  N-band  spectrum showing a crystallinity
          fraction  of  more  than  50  % for both objects, pointing to a
          stable   environment   where   dust   processing   can   occur.
          Surprisingly,  the  dust  surrounding SX Cen is not resolved in
          the interferometric observations providing an upper limit of 11
          mas  (or  18 AU at the distance of this object) on the diameter
          of  the dust emission. This confirms the very compact nature of
          its  circumstellar  environment.  The  dust  emission around HD
          52961  originates  from  a  very  small  but  resolved  region,
          estimated to be ~ 35 mas at 8 micron and ~ 55 mas at 13 micron.
          These  results  confirm  the  disc interpretation of the SED of
          both  stars.  In  HD  52961, the dust is not homogeneous in its
          chemical composition: the crystallinity is clearly concentrated
          in  the  hotter  inner  region. Whether this is a result of the
          formation  process  of the disc, or due to annealing during the
          long storage time in the disc is not clear.

          Universe: Consequences for Gravitinos and Leptogenesis

          Comments: 53 pages
          Motivated  by  our  earlier paper \cite{am}, we discuss how the
          infamous  gravitino  problem  has  a  natural built in solution
          within  supersymmetry.  Supersymmetry  allows a large number of
          flat  directions  made up of {\it gauge invariant} combinations
          of  squarks  and  sleptons.  Out  of  many  at  least {\it one}
          generically  obtains  a  large  vacuum expectation value during
          inflation.  Gauge  bosons and Gauginos then obtain large masses
          by  virtue  of  the  Higgs  mechanism.  This  makes the rate of
          thermalization  after  the end of inflation very small and as a
          result  the  Universe  enters a {\it quasi-thermal phase} after
          the inflaton has completely decayed. A full thermal equilibrium
          is   generically  established  much  later  on  when  the  flat
          direction  expectation value has substantially decareased. This
          results  in low reheat temperatures, i.e., $T_{\rm R}\sim {\cal
          O}({\rm  TeV})$, which are compatible with the stringent bounds
          arising  from  the big bang nucleosynthesis. There are two very
          important   implications:  the  production  of  gravitinos  and
          generation  of a baryonic asymmetry via leptogenesis during the
          quasi-thermal  phase.  In  both the cases the abundances depend
          not only on an effective temperature of the quasi-thermal phase
          (which  could  be  higher, i.e., $T\gg T_{\rm R}$), but also on
          the  state  of  equilibrium  in the reheat plasma. We show that
          there  is  no  ``thermal  gravitino  problem''  at  all  within
          supersymmetry  and  we stress on a need of a new paradigm based
          on a ``quasi-thermal leptogenesis'', because in the bulk of the
          parameter  space  the  {\it  old}  thermal  leptogenesis cannot
          account for the observed baryon asymmetry.

          Title:  Dense  Stellar  Systems as Laboratories for Fundamental
          Physics
          Authors: Piet Hut (Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton)
          Comments:   review  paper,  presented  at  A  Life  With  Stars
          (Conference  in Honor of Ed van den Heuvel), Amsterdam, August,
          2005
          Galactic  nuclei  and  globular clusters act as laboratories in
          which  nature  experiments with normal stars, neutron stars and
          black  holes,  through  collisions and through the formation of
          bound states, in the form of binaries. The main difference with
          the  usual  Earth-based  laboratories is that we cannot control
          the  experiments.  Instead,  we  have  no  choice but to create
          virtual  laboratories  on  Earth,  in order to simulate all the
          relevant physics in large-scale computational experiments. This
          implies  a  realistic  treatment  of  stellar dynamics, stellar
          evolution, and stellar hydrodynamics.
          Each of these three fields has its own legacy codes, workhorses
          that  are  routinely used to simulate star clusters, stars, and
          stellar collisions, respectively. I outline the main steps that
          need  to  be taken in order to embed and where needed transform
          these  legacy  codes in order to produce a far more modular and
          robust environment for modeling dense stellar systems.
          The  time  is right to do so: within a few years computers will
          reach  the  required speed, in the Petaflops range, to follow a
          star  cluster with a million stars for ten billion years, while
          resolving  the  internal  binary  and multiple star motions. By
          that  time  simulation  software will be the main bottleneck in
          our  ability  to  analyze  dense  stellar systems. Only through
          full-scale  simulations  will we be able to critically test our
          understanding  of  the `microphysics' of stellar collisions and
          their aftermath, in a direct comparison with observations.

          Title:  XMM-Newton  observations  of PSr B1259-63 near the 2004
          periastron passage
          Authors: M.Chernyakova, A. Neronov, A. Lutovinov, J. Rodriguez,
          S. Johnston
          Comments: 9 pages, accepted to MNRAS
          PSR  B1259-63 is in a highly eccentric 3.4 year orbit with a Be
          star  and  crosses the Be star disc twice per orbit, just prior
          to  and  just  after  periastron.  Unpulsed  radio,  X-ray  and
          gamma-ray  emission  observed from the binary system is thought
          to  be  due to the collision of pulsar wind with the wind of Be
          star.   We   present   here   the  results  of  new  XMM-Newton
          observations of the PSR B1259-63 system during the beginning of
          2004  as  the  pulsar approached the disc of Be star.We combine
          these results with earlier unpublished X-ray data from BeppoSAX
          and  XMM-Newton  as  well as with ASCA data. The detailed X-ray
          lightcurve  of  the  system shows that the pulsar passes (twice
          per  orbit)  through  a well-defined gaussian-profile disk with
          the  half-opening  angle  (projected on the pulsar orbit plane)
          ~18.5  deg.  The intersection of the disk middle plane with the
          pulsar  orbital  plane is inclined at ~70 deg to the major axis
          of  the pulsar orbit. Comparing the X-ray lightcurve to the TeV
          lightcurve  of  the system we find that the increase of the TeV
          flux   some  10--100  days  after  the  periastron  passage  is
          unambiguously  related  to  the  disk passage. At the moment of
          entrance to the disk the X-ray photon index hardens from 1.8 up
          to  1.2  before  returning  to  the  steeper  value  1.5.  Such
          behaviour is not easily accounted for by the model in which the
          X-ray  emission is synchrotron emission from the shocked pulsar
          wind.  We  argue  that  the  observed  hardening  of  the X-ray
          spectrum  is  due  to  the  inverse  Compton  or bremsstrahlung
          emission  from  10-100  MeV electrons responsible for the radio
          synchrotron emission.

          Multi-frequency Timing of Pulsar B1937+21
          Authors:  R.  Ramachandran,  P.  Demorest,  D.  C.  Backer,  I.
          Cognard, A. Lommen
          Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal
          We  report  here on variable propagation effects in over twenty
          years of multi-frequency timing analysis of pulsar PSR B1937+21
          that determine small-scale properties of the intervening plasma
          as  it  drifts  through  the  sight  line.  The phase structure
          function  derived  from the dispersion measure variations is in
          remarkable  agreement  with  that  expected from the Kolmogorov
          spectrum,  with a power law index of $3.66\pm 0.04$, valid over
          an  inferred  scale  range  of  0.2--50  A.U. The observed flux
          variation time scale and the modulation index, along with their
          frequency  dependence,  are discrepant with the values expected
          from  a  Kolmogorov  spectrum  with  infinitismally small inner
          scale   cutoff,   suggesting   a  caustic-dominated  regime  of
          interstellar  optics. This implies an inner scale cutoff to the
          spectrum  of $\sim 1.3\times 10^9$ meters. Our timing solutions
          indicate  a transverse velocity of 9 km sec$^{-1}$ with respect
          to  the  solar  system  barycenter,  and  80 km sec$^{-1}$ with
          respect  to  the  pulsar's  LSR.  We  interpret  the  frequency
          dependent  variations of DM as a result of the apparent angular
          broadening  of  the  source,  which  is a sensitive function of
          frequency  ($\propto\nu^{-2.2}$).  The error introduced by this
          in  timing this pulsar is $\sim$2.2 $\mu$s at 1 GHz. The timing
          error   introduced   by  ``image  wandering''  from  the  slow,
          nominally refractive scintillation effects is about 125 nanosec
          at 1 GHz. The error accumulated due to positional error (due to
          image  wandering)  in  solar  system barycentric corrections is
          about 85 nanosec at 1 GHz.

          Title:  Generalized  Chaplygin gas model, supernovae and cosmic
          topology
          Authors: M.C. Bento, O. Bertolami, M.J. Rebouças, P.T. Silva
          Comments: Revtex 4, 8 pages, 10 figures, 1 table
          Physicists  describe  the  Universe  as  a  manifold,  which is
          characterized  by  its  geometry  and  its  topology. Thus, two
          fundamental  questions  regarding  the  nature  of the Universe
          concern  the geometry and topology of the 3--dimensional space.
          Geometry   is  a  local  feature  related  with  the  intrinsic
          curvature  of  the  3--space, which be tested by studies of the
          cosmic  microwave  background  radiation  (CMBR)  such  as  the
          Wilkinson  Microwave  Anisotropy  Probe  (WMAP).  Topology is a
          global property that characterizes its shape and size. Geometry
          constrains  but  does  not  fix  the  topology  of  the spatial
          sections.  In  a  locally  spatially  homogeneous and isotropic
          universe  the  topology  of  its  spatial  section dictates its
          geometry.  In  this  work we show that, besides determining the
          spatial  geometry, the knowledge of the spatial topology places
          a   constraint  on  the  $A_s$  parameter  of  the  generalized
          Chaplygin  gas  (GCG)  model for unification of dark energy and
          dark  matter.  By  using both the Poincar\'e dodecahedral space
          and   binary   octahedral   space  as  the  observable  spatial
          topologies, we reanalyze the current type Ia supenovae (SNe Ia)
          constraints  on  the GCG parameters. We show that the knowledge
          of  spatial topologies does provide some additional constraints
          on  the  GCG  $A_s$  parameter even though it does not lift the
          degeneracy of the $\alpha$ parameter.

          Title: Neutrino Condensation as Dark Energy
          Authors: Fei Wang, Wenyu Wang, Jin Min Yang
          Comments: 7 pages, 3 figs
          Motivated by the seeming coincidence of the neutrino mass scale
          and  the  dark  energy  scale, we propose to explain the cosmic
          dark  energy  by  neutrino condensation. Similar to the idea of
          top-quark   condensation,   we   assume   that  a  four-fermion
          interaction  for the third-family neutrino is induced from some
          unknown  new  dynamics which is strong enough to cause neutrino
          condensation.  In the low-energy effective theory the resultant
          composite  scalar  field with a very small vev of about 10^{-3}
          eV  is  interpreted as the dark energy field. The tiny neutrino
          masses  can  be generated from such a small vev without see-saw
          mechanism.

          Title: Modelling of isolated radio pulsars and magnetars on the
          fossil field hypothesis
          Authors: Lilia Ferrario, Dayal Wickramasinghe
          Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures
          We  explore  the hypothesis that the magnetic fields of neutron
          stars  are  of  fossil  origin.  For parametrised models of the
          distribution  of  magnetic flux on the Main Sequence and of the
          birth  spin  period  of  the  neutron  stars,  we calculate the
          expected  properties  of  isolated  radio pulsars in the Galaxy
          using  as our starting point the initial mass function and star
          formation rate as a function of galacto-centric radius. We then
          use  the  1374  MHz  Parkes Multi-Beam Survey of isolated radio
          pulsars  to constrain the parameters in our model and to deduce
          the  required  distribution  of  magnetic  fields  on  the main
          sequence.  We find agreement with observations for a model with
          a star formation rate that corresponds to a supernova rate of 2
          per century in the Galaxy from stars with masses in the range 8
          -  45  solar  masses  and predict 447,000 active pulsars in the
          Galaxy  with  luminosities  greater  than  0.19  mJy kpc^2. The
          progenitor  OB stars have a field distribution which peaks near
          46  Gauss with about 8 percent of stars having fields in excess
          of 1,000 Gauss. The higher field progenitors yield a population
          of  24  neutron  stars  with  fields  in excess of 10^14 Gauss,
          periods ranging from 5 to 12 seconds, and ages of up to 100,000
          years,  which  we  identify  as  the  dominant component of the
          magnetars.  We  also predict that high field neutron stars (log
          B>13.5)  originate  preferentially from higher mass progenitors
          and   have   a   mean  mass  of  1.6  solar  masses,  which  is
          significantly   above   the  mean  mass  of  1.4  solar  masses
          calculated for the overall population of radio pulsars.

          We  derive the surface energy between the normal and superfluid
          components  of  a  mixed  phase  of  a  system  composed of two
          particle  species  with different densities. The surface energy
          is  obtained  by  the integration of the free energy density in
          the  interface  between  the two phases. We show that the mixed
          phase  remains  as  the  favored  ground state over the gapless
          phase, even upon the consideration of the surface energy.

          The  unusual  flux  variations  of the pre-main-sequence binary
          star   KH  15D  have  been  attributed  to  occultations  by  a
          circumbinary  disk.  We  test  whether  or  not  this theory is
          compatible  with  newly available data, including recent radial
          velocity measurements, CCD photometry over the past decade, and
          photographic  photometry  over  the  past 50 years. We find the
          model to be successful, after two refinements: a more realistic
          motion  of  the  occulting feature, and a halo around each star
          that  probably represents scattering by the disk. The occulting
          feature  is  exceptionally sharp-edged, raising the possibility
          that  the  dust  in the disk has settled into a thin layer, and
          providing  a  tool  for  fine-scale  mapping  of  the immediate
          environment   of  a  T  Tauri  star.  However,  the  window  of
          opportunity  is  closing,  as the currently visible star may be
          hidden at all orbital phases by as early as 2008.

          Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          The  optical  counterpart  of  the transient, millisecond X-ray
          pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 was observed in four colours (BVRI) for
          five  weeks  during  the  2005  June-July outburst. The optical
          fluxes  declined  by ~2 magnitudes during the first 16 days and
          then   commenced   quasi-periodic   secondary  outbursts,  with
          time-scales  of several days, similar to those seen in 2000 and
          2002.  The  broadband  spectra  derived from these measurements
          were  generally  consistent  with emission from an X-ray heated
          accretion  disc.  During the first 16 days decline in intensity
          the  spectrum  became  redder.  We  suggest  that  the  primary
          outburst was initiated by a viscosity change driven instability
          in  the inner disc and note the contrast with another accreting
          millisecond  pulsar,  XTE  J0929-314,  for  which  the spectrum
          becomes   bluer  during  outburst.  Several  significant  short
          duration  changes  in  V-I were detected. One occurred at about
          HJD  2453546 in the early phase of the first secondary outburst
          and  may be due to a mass transfer instability. On the night of
          2005  June 5 (HJD 2453527) the I band flux was ~0.45 magnitudes
          brighter  than on the preceding or following nights whereas the
          BVR  bands  showed no obvious enhancement. A Type I X-ray burst
          was  detected  by  the  RXTE  spacecraft  during  this  I  band
          integration.  It seems unlikely that reprocessed radiation from
          the  burst  was sufficient to explain the observed increase. We
          suggest  that  a  major  part  of  the I band excess was due to
          synchrotron emission triggered by the X-ray burst.

          Title:  Magnetars  as  persistent  hard X-ray sources: INTEGRAL
          discovery of a hard tail in SGR 1900+14
          Authors: D. Gotz, S. Mereghetti, A. Tiengo, P. Esposito
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to A&A Letters
          Using  2.5  Ms  of  data  obtained by the INTEGRAL satellite in
          2003-2004,  we  discovered  persistent hard X-ray emission from
          the  soft  gamma-ray  repeater  SGR  1900+14.  Its  20-100  keV
          spectrum  is  well  described  by a steep power law with photon
          index  Gamma=3.1+/-0.5 and flux 1.5E-11 erg/cmsq/s. Contrary to
          SGR  1806-20,  the only other soft gamma-ray repeater for which
          persistent  emission above 20 keV was reported, SGR 1900+14 has
          been  detected  in  the  hard  X-ray  range  while  it was in a
          quiescent state (the last bursts from this source were observed
          in  2002).  By  comparing the broad band spectra (1-100 keV) of
          all  the magnetars detected by INTEGRAL (the two SGRs and three
          anomalous  X-ray  pulsars)  we  find  evidence  for a different
          spectral behaviour of these two classes of sources.

          V
          We  review  five  mechanisms  for  forming  brown  dwarfs:  (i)
          turbulent  fragmentation  of  molecular  clouds, producing very
          low-mass  prestellar  cores by shock compression; (ii) collapse
          and  fragmentation of more massive prestellar cores; (iii) disc
          fragmentation;  (iv) premature ejection of protostellar embryos
          from  their  natal cores; and (v) photo-erosion of pre-existing
          cores overrun by HII regions. These mechanisms are not mutually
          exclusive.   Their  relative  importance  probably  depends  on
          environment, and should be judged by their ability to reproduce
          the  brown-dwarf  IMF, the distribution and kinematics of newly
          formed brown dwarfs, the binary statistics of brown dwarfs, the
          ability  of  brown  dwarfs  to  retain  discs,  and hence their
          ability  to  sustain  accretion and outflows. This will require
          more   sophisticated  numerical  modelling  than  is  presently
          possible,  in  particular more realistic initial conditions and
          more  realistic  treatments  of  radiation  transport,  angular
          momentum  transport and magnetic fields. We discuss the minimum
          mass   for  brown  dwarfs,  and  how  brown  dwarfs  should  be
          distinguished from planets.

          Title:  Star  Clusters  with  Primordial Binaries: I. Dynamical
          Evolution of Isolated Models
          Authors: D.C. Heggie, M. Trenti, P. Hut
          Comments: 14 pages, 22 figures, MNRAS accepted
          In  order  to  interpret  the results of complex realistic star
          cluster   simulations,   which   rely   on   many   simplifying
          approximations  and  assumptions,  it is essential to study the
          behavior of even more idealized models, which can highlight the
          essential  physical  effects  and  are  amenable  to more exact
          methods.  With  this  aim,  we  present  the  results of N-body
          calculations  of  the  evolution of equal-mass models, starting
          with primordial binary fractions of 0 - 100 %, with values of N
          ranging  from  256  to 16384. This allows us to extrapolate the
          main  features  of  the  evolution  to  systems  comparable  in
          particle  number with globular clusters. In this range, we find
          that    the   steady-state   `deuterium   main   sequence'   is
          characterized by a ratio of the core radius to half-mass radius
          that follows qualitatively the analytical estimate by Vesperini
          &  Chernoff  (1994),  although the N dependence is steeper than
          expected.  Interestingly,  for  an  initial  binary  fraction f
          greater  than  10%,  the  binary heating in the core during the
          post   collapse   phase   almost   saturates  (becoming  nearly
          independent  of  f),  and so little variation in the structural
          properties   is   observed.   Thus,   although   we  observe  a
          significantly  lower  binary abundance in the core with respect
          to  the Fokker-Planck simulations by Gao et al. (1991), this is
          of  little dynamical consequence. At variance with the study of
          Gao  et al. (1991), we see no sign of gravothermal oscillations
          before  150 halfmass relaxation times. At later times, however,
          oscillations  become prominent. We demonstrate the gravothermal
          nature of these oscillations.

          Title:  Star  Clusters  with Primordial Binaries: II. Dynamical
          Evolution of Models in a Tidal Field
          Authors: M. Trenti, D.C. Heggie, P. Hut
          Comments: 13 pages, 17 figures, MNRAS submitted
          [abridged] We extend our analysis of the dynamical evolution of
          simple  star  cluster  models,  in  order to provide comparison
          standards  that  will  aid  in interpreting the results of more
          complex   realistic   simulations.   We  augment  our  previous
          primordial-binary simulations by introducing a tidal field, and
          starting  with King models of different central concentrations.
          We  present the results of N-body calculations of the evolution
          of equal-mass models, starting with primordial binary fractions
          of  0  - 100 %, and N values from 512 to 16384. We also attempt
          to  extrapolate  some  of  our  results to the larger number of
          particles  that  are  necessary  to model globular clusters. We
          characterize  the  steady-state `deuterium main sequence' phase
          in  which  primordial  binaries are depleted in the core in the
          process  of  `gravitationally  burning'.  In this phase we find
          that  the  ratio  of  the core to half-mass radius, r_c/r_h, is
          similar  to  that measured for isolated systems. In addition to
          the  generation of energy due to hardening and depletion of the
          primordial binary population, the overall evolution of the star
          clusters is driven by a competing process: the tidal disruption
          of  the  system.  We  find  that  the  depletion  of primordial
          binaries  before  tidal  dissolution  of the system is possible
          only  if  the  initial number is below 0.05 N, in the case of a
          King  model  with W_0=7 and N=4096 (which is one of our longest
          living  models).  We compare our findings, obtained by means of
          direct N-body simulations but scaled, where possible, to larger
          N,  with  similar  studies  carried out by means of Monte Carlo
          methods.

          Title:  Solar  and  stellar  system  tests  of the cosmological
          constant
          Authors: M. Sereno (Univ. Zurich), Ph. Jetzer (Univ. Zurich)
          Comments:  4  pages;  this is a preprint of an article accepted
          for publication in Physical Review D
          Some  tests  of  gravity  theories - periastron shift, geodetic
          precession,  change in mean motion and gravitational redshift -
          are  applied  in  solar  and  stellar  systems to constrain the
          cosmological  constant.  We  thus consider a length scale range
          from 10^8 to 10^{15} km. Best bounds from the solar system come
          from  perihelion advance and change in mean motion of Earth and
          Mars,  Lambda < 10^{-36} km^{-2}. Such a limit falls very short
          to estimates from observational cosmology analyses but a future
          experiment  performing  radio  ranging  observations  of  outer
          planets  could  improve  it by four orders of magnitude. Beyond
          the   solar   system,  together  with  future  measurements  of
          periastron   advance  in  wide  binary  pulsars,  gravitational
          redshift  of  white  dwarfs can provide bounds competitive with
          Mars data.

          Jet  models  for  the  high-energy  emission  of Galactic X-ray
          binary sources have regained significant interest with detailed
          spectral   and  timing  studies  of  the  X-ray  emission  from
          microquasars, the recent detection by the HESS collaboration of
          very-high-energy  gamma-rays  from the microquasar LS~5039, and
          the  earlier  suggestion  of jet models for ultraluminous X-ray
          sources  observed  in  many  nearby galaxies. Here we study the
          synchrotron  and  Compton signatures of time-dependent electron
          injection  and  acceleration,  adiabatic and radiative cooling,
          and   different   jet   geometries  in  the  jets  of  Galactic
          microquasars.    Synchrotron,   synchrotron-self-Compton,   and
          external-Compton radiation processes with soft photons provided
          by  the  companion  star and the accretion disk are treated. An
          analytical  solution  is  presented  to  the  electron  kinetic
          equation  for  general  power-law  geometries  of  the jets for
          Compton  scattering  in  the  Thomson regime. We pay particular
          attention to predictions concerning the rapid flux and spectral
          variability  signatures  expected  in  a  variety of scenarios,
          making   specific   predictions  concerning  possible  spectral
          hysteresis,  similar  to  what has been observed in several TeV
          blazars.  Such  predictions  should  be testable with dedicated
          monitoring    observations   of   Galactic   microquasars   and
          ultraluminous X-ray sources using Chandra and/or XMM-Newton.

          Title:  Multiplicity  and  Optical Excess Across the Substellar
          Boundary in Taurus
          Authors: A.L. Kraus, R.J. White, L.A. Hillenbrand (Caltech)
          Comments:  Accepted for publication in ApJ; 15 pages, 8 figures
          in emulateapj format
          We  present  the results of a high-resolution imaging survey of
          22 brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the nearby (~145 pc)
          young (~1-2 Myr) low-density star-forming region Taurus-Auriga.
          We  obtained  images  with the Advanced Camera for Surveys/High
          Resolution  Channel  on  HST through the F555W (V), F775W (i'),
          and  F850LP (z') filters. This survey confirmed the binarity of
          MHO-Tau-8   and  discovered  a  new  candidate  binary  system,
          V410-Xray3,  resulting  in  a  binary  fraction  of  9+/-5%  at
          separations  >4  AU. Both binary systems are tight (<10 AU) and
          they  possess  mass  ratios of 0.75 and 0.46, respectively. The
          binary  frequency  and separations are consistent with low-mass
          binary   properties  in  the  field,  but  the  mass  ratio  of
          V410-Xray3  is  among the lowest known. We find that the binary
          frequency is higher for very low mass stars and high-mass brown
          dwarfs  than  for  lower-mass  brown  dwarfs, implying either a
          decline  in frequency or a shift to smaller separations for the
          lowest mass binaries. Combining these results with multiplicity
          statistics  for  higher-mass  Taurus members suggests a gradual
          decline  in  binary frequency and separation toward low masses.
          The  implication is that the distinct binary properties of very
          low-mass   systems  are  set  during  formation  and  that  the
          formation  process  is  similar  to  the  process which creates
          higher-mass stellar binaries, but occurs on a smaller scale. We
          show  that  there  are no planets or very low-mass brown dwarfs
          with mass >3 M_J at projected separation >40 AU orbiting any of
          the  Taurus members in our sample. We identify several BDs with
          significant (>1 mag) V-band excesses. The excesses appear to be
          correlated  with  signatures of accretion, and if attributed to
          accretion  luminosity,  may  imply mass accretion rates several
          orders  of  magnitude  above  those  inferred from line-profile
          analyses. (abridged)

          Model  of  Galactic  Black  Hole Candidates and Active Galactic

          The  spectral,  timing, and jet formation properties of neutron
          stars  in  low  mass x-ray binary systems are influenced by the
          presence of central magnetic moments. Similar features shown by
          the galactic black hole candidates (GBHC) strongly suggest that
          their compact cores might be intrinsically magnetic as well. We
          show  that  the  existence  of  intrinsically  magnetic GBHC is
          consistent  with a new class of solutions of the Einstein field
          equations of General Relativity. These solutions are based on a
          strict  adherence to the Strong Principle of Equivalence (SPOE)
          requirement that the world lines of physical matter must remain
          timelike  in all regions of spacetime. The new solutions emerge
          when  the  structure  and  radiation transfer properties of the
          energy  momentum  tensor on the right hand side of the Einstein
          field equations are appropriately chosen to dynamically enforce
          this  SPOE  requirement of timelike world line completeness. In
          this  context,  we find that the Einstein field equations allow
          the  existence of highly red shifted, Magnetospheric, Eternally
          Collapsing  Objects  (MECO). MECO necessarily possess intrinsic
          magnetic  moments  and  they  do not have trapped surfaces that
          lead  to event horizons and curvature singularities. Their most
          striking  features  are  equipartition  magnetic  fields,  pair
          plasma  atmospheres  and extreme gravitational redshifts. Since
          MECO  lifetimes  are  orders of magnitude greater than a Hubble
          time,  they  provide  an  elegant  and  unified  framework  for
          understanding  a broad range of observations of GBHC and active
          galactic  nuclei.  We  examine  their  spectral, timing and jet
          formation  properties  and  discuss  characteristics that might
          lead to their confirmation.

          High  resolution  long-slit  spectra  obtained with the Phoenix
          spectrograph on Gemini South provide our most accurate probe of
          the  three  dimensional  structure of the Homunculus around eta
          Car.  The  new  near-infrared  spectra dramatically confirm the
          double-shell  structure  inferred  previously from thermal dust
          emission,  resolving  the  nebula  into a very thin outer shell
          seen in H2 21218, and a warmer, thicker inner layer seen in [Fe
          II]  16435. The thin H2 skin hints that the most important mass
          loss during the 19th century eruption had a very short duration
          of  less than 5 yr. H2 emission traces the majority of the mass
          in the nebula, and has an average density of order 10^6.5 cm-3.
          This  emission, in turn, yields our first definitive picture of
          the  exact  shape of the nebula, plus a distance of 2350pm50 pc
          and  an  inclination  angle  of 41deg (the polar axis is tilted
          49deg  from  the  plane of the sky). The distribution of the H2
          emission  provides the first measure of the latitude dependence
          of the speed, mass loss, and kinetic energy associated with eta
          Car's  19th  century  explosion. Almost 75 percent of the total
          mass  and  more  than  90  percent of the kinetic energy in the
          ejecta  were released at high latitudes. This rules out a model
          for  the bipolar shape wherein an otherwise spherical explosion
          was  pinched  at  the waist by a circumstellar torus. Also, the
          ejecta  could not have been deflected toward polar trajectories
          by  a  companion  star,  since  the kinetic energy of the polar
          ejecta  is  greater  than  the  binding  energy of the putative
          binary  system.  Instead, most of the mass appears to have been
          directed poleward by the explosion itself. [abridged]

          Title:  LISA  observations of massive black hole mergers: event
          rates and issues in waveform modelling
          Authors: Emanuele Berti
          Comments:  13 pages, 2 figures. To appear in the proceedings of
          10th  Annual  Gravitational  Wave Data Analysis Workshop (GWDAW
          10), Brownsville, Texas, 14-17 Dec 2005
          The  observability of gravitational waves from supermassive and
          intermediate-mass   black   holes   by   the  forecoming  Laser
          Interferometer  Space  Antenna  (LISA),  and the physics we can
          learn  from the observations, will depend on two basic factors:
          the event rates for massive black hole mergers occurring in the
          LISA  best sensitivity window, and our theoretical knowledge of
          the  gravitational waveforms. We first provide a concise review
          of  the  literature  on LISA event rates for massive black hole
          mergers, as predicted by different formation scenarios. Then we
          discuss  what  (in  our  view)  are  the  most urgent issues to
          address  in terms of waveform modelling. For massive black hole
          binary  inspiral  these  include spin precession, eccentricity,
          the  effect of high-order Post-Newtonian terms in the amplitude
          and  phase,  and  an accurate prediction of the transition from
          inspiral   to   plunge.  For  black  hole  ringdown,  numerical
          relativity   will  ultimately  be  required  to  determine  the
          relative   quasinormal  mode  excitation,  and  to  reduce  the
          dimensionality of the template space in matched filtering.

          We  solve  for  the  time-dependent  dynamics  of axisymmetric,
          general  relativistic  magnetohydrodynamic  winds from rotating
          neutron stars. The mass loss rate is obtained self-consistently
          as a solution to the MHD equations, subject to a finite thermal
          pressure  at the stellar surface. We consider both monopole and
          dipole  magnetic  field geometries and we explore the parameter
          regime  extending  from low magnetization (low-sigma_o), almost
          thermally-driven  winds  to  high magnetization (high-sigma_o),
          relativistic  Poynting-flux  dominated outflows. We compute the
          angular momentum and rotational energy loss rates as a function
          of  sigma_o  and  compare  with  analytic expectations from the
          classical  theory  of  pulsars and magnetized stellar winds. In
          the   case  of  the  monopole,  our  high-sigma_o  calculations
          asymptotically  approach  the  analytic force-free limit. If we
          define the spindown rate in terms of the open magnetic flux, we
          similarly  reproduce  the  spindown rate from recent force-free
          calculations  of  the aligned dipole. However, even for sigma_o
          as  high  as ~20, we find that the location of the Y-type point
          (r_Y), which specifies the radius of the last closed field line
          in  the  equatorial  plane,  is  not  the  radius  of the light
          cylinder  R_L  =  c/omega  (R  =  cylindrical  radius),  as has
          previously  been  assumed  in  most  estimates  and  force-free
          calculations.   Instead,   although   the   Alfven   radius  at
          intermediate   latitudes  quickly  approaches  R_L  as  sigma_o
          exceeds unity, r_Y remains significantly less than R_L. Because
          r_Y  <  R_L,  our  calculated  spindown  rates  thus exceed the
          classic  ``vacuum  dipole'' rate. We discussthe implications of
          our   results   for  models  of  rotation-powered  pulsars  and
          magnetars,   both   in  their  observed  states  and  in  their
          hypothesized rapidly rotating initial state.

          Title: The rp-Process in Neutrino-driven Winds
          Authors: Shinya Wanajo (Univ. of Tokyo)
          Comments: 28 pages, 17 figures, submitted to ApJ
          Recent  hydrodynamic  simulations  of  core-collapse supernovae
          with  accurate  neutrino transport suggest that the bulk of the
          early  neutrino-heated  ejecta  is  proton  rich,  in which the
          production  of some interesting proton-rich nuclei is expected.
          As  suggested  in  recent  nucleosynthesis  studies,  the rapid
          proton-capture  (rp)  process  takes  place in such proton-rich
          environments  by  bypassing  the  waiting point nuclei with the
          beta-lives  of a few minutes via the faster capture of neutrons
          continuously  supplied from the neutrino absorption by protons.
          In  this  study, the nucleosynthesis calculations are performed
          with  the  wide  ranges  of  the  neutrino luminosities and the
          electron  fractions  (Ye),  using  the  semi-analytic models of
          proto-neutron star winds. The masses of proto-neutron stars are
          taken to be 1.4 Msun and 2.0 Msun, where the latter is regarded
          as  the test for somewhat high entropy winds (about a factor of
          two).  For  Ye  >  0.52,  the neutrino-induced rp-process takes
          place in many wind trajectories, and the p-nuclei up to A = 130
          are  synthesized  with  interesting  amounts.  However, 92Mo is
          somewhat  underproduced  compared  to  those  with similar mass
          numbers.  For  0.46  <  Y  <  0.49,  on the other hand, 92Mo is
          significantly  enhanced by the nuclear flows in the vicinity of
          the  abundant  90Zr  that  originates from the alpha-process at
          higher  temperature.  The  nucleosynthetic  yields are averaged
          over   the   ejected  masses  of  winds,  and  further  the  Ye
          distribution predicted by the recent hydrodynamic simulation of
          a  core-collapse  supernova. Comparison of the mass-Ye-averaged
          yields   to   the   solar   compositions   implies   that   the
          neutrino-driven  winds  can  be potentially the origin of light
          p-nuclei  up  to  A  =  110, including 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru that
          cannot be explained by other astrophysical sites.

          Title:  The  dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump
          systems
          Authors:  Simon  Goodchild  (1), Gordon Ogilvie (1,2) ((1) IoA,
          Cambridge, (2) DAMTP, Cambridge)
          Comments:  10  pages,  11  figures. Accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We   have   applied  an  eccentric  accretion  disc  theory  in
          simplified  form  to  the case of an accretion disc in a binary
          system,  where  the  disc  contains the 3:1 Lindblad resonance.
          This  is relevant to the case of superhumps in SU Ursae Majoris
          cataclysmic  variables  and  other systems, where it is thought
          that  this  resonance  leads  to  growth  of eccentricity and a
          modulation  in  the  light  curve  due  to the interaction of a
          precessing   eccentric  disc  with  tidal  stresses.  A  single
          differential   equation   is  formulated  which  describes  the
          propagation,   resonant   excitation  and  viscous  damping  of
          eccentricity. The theory is first worked out in the simple case
          of  a  narrow  ring  and  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  the
          eccentricity distribution is locally suppressed by the presence
          of  the  resonance,  creating  a dip in the eccentricity at the
          resonant  radius.  Application  of this theory to the superhump
          case  confirms  this  conclusion  and  produces a more accurate
          expression  for  the  precession rate of the disc than has been
          previously accomplished with simple dynamical estimates.

          Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We   present   the   results   of   Chandra  X-ray  Observatory
          observations  of  the  transient  anomalous  X-ray pulsar (AXP)
          candidate  AX  J1845.0-0258  in apparent quiescence. Within the
          source's  error  circle,  we  find  a point source and possible
          counterpart,  which  we  designate  CXOU  J184454.6-025653.  No
          coherent  pulsations  are detected, and no extended emission is
          seen.  The  source's  spectrum  is  equally well described by a
          blackbody  model of temperature kT~2.0 keV or a power law model
          with  photon  index Gamma~1.0. This is considerably harder than
          was  seen  for AX J1845.0-0258 during its period of brightening
          in  1993 (kT~0.6 keV) despite being at least ~13 times fainter.
          This  behavior  is  opposite  to  that  observed in the case of
          another  transient AXP, XTE J1810-197. We therefore explore the
          possibility  that CXOU J184454.6-025653 is an unrelated source,
          and  that  AX  J1845.0-0258 remains undetected since 1993, with
          flux  260-430  times  fainter  than  at that epoch. If so, this
          would represent an unprecedented range of variability in AXPs.

          Title: X-Ray Flares from Postmerger Millisecond Pulsars

          Comments: 10 pages, published in Science
          Journal-ref: Science, 311 (2006) 1127-1129
          Recent  observations support the suggestion that short-duration
          gamma-ray  bursts  are  produced  by  compact star mergers. The
          X-ray flares discovered in two short gamma-ray bursts last much
          longer  than  the previously proposed postmerger energy release
          time  scales.  Here  we  show  that  they  can  be  produced by
          differentially  rotating, millisecond pulsars after the mergers
          of  binary  neutron  stars.  The differential rotation leads to
          windup  of  interior poloidal magnetic fields and the resulting
          toroidal fields are strong enough to float up and break through
          the  stellar  surface.  Magnetic reconnection--driven explosive
          events  then  occur,  leading  to multiple X-ray flares minutes
          after the original gamma-ray burst.

          Comments: Accepted by ApJ, 23 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables
          In  order  to probe the activity of the inner disk flow and its
          effect  on  the  neutron star surface emissions, we carried out
          the  timing  analysis of the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
          observations  of  the  millisecond X-ray pulsar XTE J1807--294,
          focusing  on  its  correlated  behaviors  in X-ray intensities,
          hardness  ratios, pulse profiles and power density spectra. The
          source  was observed to have a serial of broad "puny" flares on
          a  timescale of hours to days on the top of a decaying outburst
          in  March 2003. In the flares, the spectra are softened and the
          pulse   profiles  become  more  sinusoidal.  The  frequency  of
          kilohertz  quasi-periodic  oscillation (kHz QPO) is found to be
          positively related to the X-ray count rate in the flares. These
          features  observed  in the flares could be due to the accreting
          flow  inhomogeneities.  It is noticed that the fractional pulse
          amplitude  increases  with  the flare intensities in a range of
          $\sim   2%-14%$,   comparable   to   those   observed   in  the
          thermonuclear  bursts  of  the  millisecond  X-ray  pulsar  XTE
          J1814--338,  whereas  it  remains  at  about 6.5% in the normal
          state. Such a significant variation of the pulse profile in the
          "puny" flares may reflect the changes of physical parameters in
          the  inner  disk  accretion  region. Furthermore, we noticed an
          overall  positive correlation between the kHz QPO frequency and
          the  fractional  pulse  amplitude,  which  could  be  the first
          evidence  representing  that  the neutron-star surface emission
          properties are very sensitive to the disk flow inhomogeneities.
          This  effect  should  be  cautiously  considered  in  the burst
          oscillation studies.

          Population III black hole binaries
          Authors: K. Kulczycki, T. Bulik, K. Belczynski, B. Rudak
          Comments: sumbitted to A&A
          We  analyze  the  properties  of VIRGO detector with the aim of
          studying  its  ability  to  search  for  coalescing  black hole
          binaries. We focus on the remnants of the Population III stars,
          which  currently  should be massive black holes ($\sim 100-1000
          M_\odot$),   some   of   them  bound  in  binary  systems.  The
          coalescence  of  such binaries due to emission of gravitational
          waves  may  be currently observable. We use a binary population
          synthesis to model the evolution of Population III binaries. We
          calculate  the  signal  to  noise ratios of gravitational waves
          emitted  by  the  system  in  each  of  the  coalescence phase:
          inspiral,  merger and ringdown, and provide simple formulae for
          the  signal  to  noise  ratio  as  a  function of masses of the
          binaries.  We  estimate  the  detection  rates  for  the  VIRGO
          interferometer and also compare them with the estimates for the
          current LIGO. We show that these expected rates are similar to,
          or   larger  than  the  expected  rates  from  coalescences  of
          Population I and II compact object binaries.

          Title:  Effect of hyperon-hyperon interaction on bulk viscosity
          and r-mode instability in neutron stars
          Authors:  Debarati  Chatterjee,  Debades  Bandyopadhyay,  (Saha

          Comments: 26 pages, 9 figures
          We   investigate   the   effect  of  hyperon  matter  including
          hyperon-hyperon  interaction  on  bulk  viscosity. Equations of
          state  are  constructed  within the framework of a relativistic
          field  theoretical  model  where  baryon-baryon  interaction is
          mediated   by   the  exchange  of  scalar  and  vector  mesons.
          Hyperon-hyperon  interaction  is also taken into account by the
          exchange  of  two strange mesons. This interaction results in a
          smaller  maximum  mass  neutron  star  compared  with  the case
          without  the interaction. The coefficient of bulk viscosity due
          to  the  non-leptonic  weak  process  is  determined  by  these
          equations of state. The interacting hyperon matter enhances the
          bulk  viscosity coefficient in a neutron star interior compared
          with  the  no  interaction case. The r-mode instability is more
          effectively suppressed in hyperon-hyperon interaction case than
          that without the interaction.

          The  stability  of  the  space  around Pluto--Charon system was
          studied.  This  system  has  the  largest mass parameter in our
          solarsystem.  In  the  year 2005 two small satellite were found

          the  stability  of the P-type orbits are investigated including
          the  two  new satellites, S/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2. We point out
          that   the  likelihood  of  the  two  satellite  were  captured
          gravitationally  is  very  small.  Additionally, the large mass
          parameter allow the satellites regard a model of a new class of
          exoplanets, which orbit around binary stellar.

          Title: Luminosity dependent study of the High Mass X-ray Binary
          Pulsar 4U~0114+65 with ASCA
          Authors: U. Mukherjee, B. Paul
          Comments: 14 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables. Accepted in Journal
          of Astrophysics and Astronomy
          Here we report the spectral characteristics of the high and low
          states  of  the pulsar 4U~0114+65 and examine the change in the
          parameters   of   the   spectral  model.  A  power  law  and  a
          photoelectric  absorption  by  material along the line of sight
          together  with  a  high  energy cut-off suffice to describe the
          continuum spectrum in both the states. A fluorescence iron line
          at  $\sim$6.4  keV is present in the high as well as in the low
          state,  though  it  is  less  intense in the latter. The photon
          index,  cut-off  energy and e-folding energy values hardly show
          any  discernible  change  over  the  states.  We  compare these
          spectral  characteristics  as  observed  with ASCA to that with
          other  satellites. We also compare the spectral characteristics
          of  4U~0114+650  with  other X-ray sources which show intensity
          variation at different time scales.

          We  have  investigated  the  Quasi  Periodic  Oscillation (QPO)
          properties   of   the  transient  accreting  X-ray  pulsar  XTE
          J1858+034   during  the  second  outburst  of  this  source  in
          April-May  2004.  We  have  used  observations  made  with  the
          Proportional  Counter  Array  (PCA)  of  the Rossi X-ray Timing
          Explorer  (RXTE)  during May 14-18 2004, in the declining phase
          of the outburst. We detected the presence of low frequency QPOs
          in  the  frequency  range  of  140--185 mHz in all the RXTE-PCA
          observations.  We  report  evolution of the QPO parameters with
          the  time,  X-ray  flux,  and  X-ray  photon  energy.  Though a
          correlation   between   the  QPO  centroid  frequency  and  the
          instantaneous  X-ray  flux  is not very clear from the data, we
          point out that the QPO frequency and the one day averaged X-ray
          flux  decreased  with  time  during these observations. We have
          obtained  a clear energy dependence of the RMS variation in the
          QPOs,  increasing  from  about 3% at 3 keV to 6% at 25 keV. The
          X-ray  pulse  profile is a single peaked sinusoidal, with pulse
          fraction  increasing  from  20%  at  3 keV to 45% at 30 keV. We
          found  that,  similar  to  the  previous  outburst,  the energy
          spectrum  is  well  fitted with a model consisting of a cut-off
          power law along with an iron emission line.

          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          We  present  surface  spot  maps of the K2V primary star in the
          pre-cataclysmic variable binary system, V471 Tau. The spot maps
          show  the  presence of large high latitude spots located at the
          sub-white  dwarf  longitude  region.  By  tracking the relative
          movement  of  spot groups over the course of four nights (eight
          rotation  cycles), we measure the surface differential rotation
          rate of the system.Our results reveal that the star is rotating
          rigidly  with  a surface shear rate, dOmega = 1.6 +/- 6 mrad/d.
          The  single  active  star  AB  Dor has a similar spectral type,
          rotation  period,  and activity level as the K star in V471 Tau
          but  displays  much  stronger  surface  shear (46 < dOmega < 58
          mrad/d).  Our  results  suggest  that tidal locking may inhibit
          differential  rotation;  this  reduced shear, however, does not
          affect the overall magnetic activity levels in active K dwarfs.

          Title:  Pulsar  Wind Nebulae and the Non-thermal X-Ray Emission
          of Millisecond Pulsars
          Authors: K. S. Cheng, Ronald E. Taam, W. Wang
          Comments: To be appeared in ApJ April 2006
          The   non-thermal,   non-pulsed   X-ray  emission  of  MSPs  is
          investigated.  As  in  young  pulsars, MSPs emit a relativistic
          wind,  which  interacting with the interstellar medium and/or a
          binary companion can significantly contribute to the non-pulsed
          emission  of  these  pulsars. An application and extension of a
          simple  model developed for young pulsars is applied to the old
          recycled  MSP  B1957+20.  It is found that the pulsar wind can,
          indeed,  contribute  to  both the resolved and unresolved X-ray
          emission.  For  other  MSP  in  the  Galactic  field  where the
          spectral  index  of  the non-pulsed component has been measured
          (i.e., PSR B1937+21, J0218+4232) the contribution of the pulsar
          wind  to  the non-pulsed X-ray luminosity is estimated. For the
          MSPs  in the core regions of globular clusters, the pulsar wind
          nebula  is  likely  affected  by its interaction with the dense
          stellar   environment,   possibly   leading   to  a  diminished
          contribution  to  the  total  X-ray emission. In this case, the
          existence  of  non-thermal  non-pulsed  X-ray  emission is more
          likely  for  binary rather than isolated MSPs with the emission
          arising  from  the  interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind
          with   a   binary   companion.  Our  study  suggests  that  the
          magnetization  parameter  in the pulsar wind nebulae of MSPs is
          significantly  larger  than  that of the Crab nebula by about a
          factor  of 10. The emission from MSPs moving at high velocities
          may  appear  spatially  extended  with  a tail-like morphology,
          which  may  contribute  to  the  faint filamentary X-ray source
          subpopulation in the Galaxy.

          We  report  the  results of an exploratory program to image the
          extended  circumstellar  envelopes  of  asymptotic giant branch
          (AGB)  stars  in  dust-scattered galactic light. The goal is to
          characterize  the morphology of the envelopes as a probe of the
          mass-loss  process. The observations consist of short exposures
          with  the  VLT  and  longer  exposures  with  1-2m  telescopes,
          augmented with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope.
          We  observed  12  AGB  stars  and  detected  the  circumstellar
          envelopes  in  7.  The  detected envelopes have mass loss rates
          more  than  about  5 10E-6 solar mass per year, and they can be
          seen  out to distances of about 1 kpc. The observations provide
          information on the mass loss history on time scales up to about
          10,000   years.  For  the  five  AGB  envelopes  in  which  the
          circumstellar  geometry  is  well determined by scattered light
          observations,  all  except  one  (OH348.2-19.7) show deviations
          from  spherical  symmetry.  Two  (IRC+10216 and IRC+10011) show
          roughly  spherical  envelopes  at  large radii but asymmetry or
          bipolarity  close  to  the  star;  one  (AFGL  2514)  shows  an
          extended,  elliptical  envelope,  and  one  (AFGL 3068) shows a
          spiral pattern. The non-spherical structures are all consistent
          with  the  effects of binary interactions. Our observations are
          in  accord  with  a  scenario in which binary companions play a
          role   in   shaping   planetary  nebulae,  and  show  that  the
          circumstellar  gas  is already partly shaped on the AGB, before
          evolution to the proto-planetary nebula phase.

          Title:  The  neutron  star  soft  X-ray transient 1H1905+000 in

          Comments:  10  pages,  5  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          In  this Paper we report on our analysis of a ~25 ksec. Chandra
          X-ray  observation  of  the  neutron  star soft X-ray transient
          (SXT)  1H1905+000  in  quiescence.  Furthermore, we discuss our
          findings  of  the  analysis of optical photometric observations
          which  we obtained using the Magellan telescope and photometric
          and spectroscopic observations which we obtained using the Very
          Large Telescope at Paranal. The X-ray counterpart of 1H1905+000
          was  not  detected  in  our  Chandra  data,  with a 95 per cent
          confidence  limit  to the source count rate of 1.2x10^-4 counts
          s^-1.  For different spectral models this yields an upper limit
          on  the luminosity of 1.8x10^31 erg s^-1 (for an upper limit on
          the distance of 10 kpc.) This luminosity limit makes 1H1905+000
          the  faintest  neutron star SXT in quiescence observed to date.
          The neutron star luminosity is so low that it is similar to the
          lowest  luminosities derived for black hole SXTs in quiescence.
          This  low  luminosity  for  a  neutron  star SXT challanges the
          hypothesis  presented in the literature that black hole SXTs in
          quiescence  have lower luminosities than neutron star SXTs as a
          result   of  the  presence  of  a  black  hole  event  horizon.
          Furthermore,  the limit on the neutron star luminosity obtained
          less  than  20  years after the outburst has ceased, constrains
          the  thermal  conductivity  of the neutron star crust. Finally,
          the  neutron  star  core  must  be so cold that unless the time
          averaged  mass  accretion  rate  is  lower  than 2x10^-12 M_sun
          yr^-1,  core  cooling  has  to  proceed  via  enhanced neutrino
          emission  processes.  We  derive a limit on the absolute I-band
          magnitude  of the quiescent counterpart of M_I>7.8 assuming the
          source  is  at 10 kpc. This is in line with 1H1905+000 being an
          ultra-compact  X-ray  binary, as has been proposed based on the
          low outburst V-band absolute magnitude.

          Title: Evolution of supermassive black holes
          Authors: Marta Volonteri
          Comments:  Extended  version  of the invited paper to appear in
          the  Proceedings  of  the Conference "Relativistic Astrophysics
          and Cosmology - Einstein's Legacy"
          Supermassive  black  holes  (SMBHs)  are  nowadays  believed to
          reside  in  most local galaxies, and the available data show an
          empirical  correlation  between  bulge  luminosity - or stellar
          velocity  dispersion - and black hole mass, suggesting a single
          mechanism  for  assembling black holes and forming spheroids in
          galaxy  halos.  The  evidence  is  therefore  in  favour  of  a
          co-evolution between galaxies, black holes and quasars. In cold
          dark  matter  cosmogonies,  small-mass subgalactic systems form
          first to merge later into larger and larger structures. In this
          paradigm  galaxy halos experience multiple mergers during their
          lifetime.  If  every  galaxy  with  a bulge hosts a SMBH in its
          center,  and  a  local  galaxy  has  been  made  up by multiple
          mergers,  then  a  black  hole binary is a natural evolutionary
          stage.  The evolution of the supermassive black hole population
          clearly  has  to  be  investigated taking into account both the
          cosmological framework and the dynamical evolution of SMBHs and
          their  hosts.  The  seeds of SMBHs have to be looked for in the
          early  Universe,  as  very  luminous quasars are detected up to
          redshift  higher  than  z=6. These black holes evolve then in a
          hierarchical  fashion,  following the merger hierarchy of their
          host  halos. Accretion of gas, traced by quasar activity, plays
          a fundamental role in determining the two parameters defining a
          black  hole:  mass and spin. A particularly intriguing epoch is
          the  initial  phase  of  SMBH growth. It is very challenging to
          meet the observational constraints at z=6 if BHs are not fed at
          very high rates in their infancy.

          Title:  Is  the  dark  matter interpretation of the EGRET gamma
          excess compatible with antiproton measurements?
          Authors: L. Bergstrom, J. Edsjo, M. Gustafsson, P. Salati
          Comments: 14 pages, 5 figures
          We investigate the internal consistency of the halo dark matter
          model  which has been proposed by de Boer et al. to explain the
          excess  of galactic gamma-ray observed by the EGRET experiment.
          Any  model  based  on dark matter annihilation into quark jets,
          such  as  the  supersymmetric model proposed by de Boer et al.,
          inevitably also predicts a primary flux of antiprotons from the
          same   jets.  Since  propagation  of  the  antiprotons  in  the
          unconventional,  disk-dominated  type  of halo model used by de
          Boer  et  al.  is strongly constrained by the measured ratio of
          boron  to  carbon  nuclei  in  cosmic  rays, we investigate the
          viability  of  the  model using the DarkSUSY package to compute
          the  gamma-ray  and antiproton fluxes. We are able to show that
          their model is excluded by a wide margin from the measured flux
          of  antiprotons.  %  We therefore find that a model of the type
          suggested  by  Moskalenko  et  al.,  where  the  intensities of
          protons  and  electrons  in  the cosmic rays vary with galactic
          position, is far more plausible.

          with  the  effects of binary interactions. Our observations are
          in  accord  with  a  scenario in which binary companions play a
          role   in   shaping   planetary  nebulae,  and  show  that  the
          circumstellar  gas  is already partly shaped on the AGB, before
          evolution to the proto-planetary nebula phase.

          Title:  The  neutron  star  soft  X-ray transient 1H1905+000 in
          quiescence

          MNRAS
          In  this Paper we report on our analysis of a ~25 ksec. Chandra
          X-ray  observation  of  the  neutron  star soft X-ray transient
          (SXT)  1H1905+000  in  quiescence.  Furthermore, we discuss our
          findings  of  the  analysis of optical photometric observations
          which  we obtained using the Magellan telescope and photometric
          and spectroscopic observations which we obtained using the Very
          Large Telescope at Paranal. The X-ray counterpart of 1H1905+000
          was  not  detected  in  our  Chandra  data,  with a 95 per cent
          confidence  limit  to the source count rate of 1.2x10^-4 counts
          s^-1.  For different spectral models this yields an upper limit
          on  the luminosity of 1.8x10^31 erg s^-1 (for an upper limit on
          the distance of 10 kpc.) This luminosity limit makes 1H1905+000
          the  faintest  neutron star SXT in quiescence observed to date.
          The neutron star luminosity is so low that it is similar to the
          lowest  luminosities derived for black hole SXTs in quiescence.
          This  low  luminosity  for  a  neutron  star SXT challanges the
          hypothesis  presented in the literature that black hole SXTs in
          quiescence  have lower luminosities than neutron star SXTs as a
          result   of  the  presence  of  a  black  hole  event  horizon.
          Furthermore,  the limit on the neutron star luminosity obtained
          less  than  20  years after the outburst has ceased, constrains
          the  thermal  conductivity  of the neutron star crust. Finally,
          the  neutron  star  core  must  be so cold that unless the time
          averaged  mass  accretion  rate  is  lower  than 2x10^-12 M_sun
          yr^-1,  core  cooling  has  to  proceed  via  enhanced neutrino
          emission  processes.  We  derive a limit on the absolute I-band
          magnitude  of the quiescent counterpart of M_I>7.8 assuming the
          source  is  at 10 kpc. This is in line with 1H1905+000 being an
          ultra-compact  X-ray  binary, as has been proposed based on the
          low outburst V-band absolute magnitude.

          Title: Evolution of supermassive black holes
          Authors: Marta Volonteri
          Comments:  Extended  version  of the invited paper to appear in
          the  Proceedings  of  the Conference "Relativistic Astrophysics
          and Cosmology - Einstein's Legacy"
          Supermassive  black  holes  (SMBHs)  are  nowadays  believed to
          reside  in  most local galaxies, and the available data show an
          empirical  correlation  between  bulge  luminosity - or stellar
          velocity  dispersion - and black hole mass, suggesting a single
          mechanism  for  assembling black holes and forming spheroids in
          galaxy  halos.  The  evidence  is  therefore  in  favour  of  a
          co-evolution between galaxies, black holes and quasars. In cold
          dark  matter  cosmogonies,  small-mass subgalactic systems form
          first to merge later into larger and larger structures. In this
          paradigm  galaxy halos experience multiple mergers during their
          lifetime.  If  every  galaxy  with  a bulge hosts a SMBH in its
          center,  and  a  local  galaxy  has  been  made  up by multiple
          mergers,  then  a  black  hole binary is a natural evolutionary
          stage.  The evolution of the supermassive black hole population
          clearly  has  to  be  investigated taking into account both the
          cosmological framework and the dynamical evolution of SMBHs and
          their  hosts.  The  seeds of SMBHs have to be looked for in the
          early  Universe,  as  very  luminous quasars are detected up to
          redshift  higher  than  z=6. These black holes evolve then in a
          hierarchical  fashion,  following the merger hierarchy of their
          host  halos. Accretion of gas, traced by quasar activity, plays
          a fundamental role in determining the two parameters defining a
          black  hole:  mass and spin. A particularly intriguing epoch is
          the  initial  phase  of  SMBH growth. It is very challenging to
          meet the observational constraints at z=6 if BHs are not fed at
          very high rates in their infancy.

          Title:  Is  the  dark  matter interpretation of the EGRET gamma
          excess compatible with antiproton measurements?
          Authors: L. Bergstrom, J. Edsjo, M. Gustafsson, P. Salati
          Comments: 14 pages, 5 figures
          We investigate the internal consistency of the halo dark matter
          model  which has been proposed by de Boer et al. to explain the
          excess  of galactic gamma-ray observed by the EGRET experiment.
          Any  model  based  on dark matter annihilation into quark jets,
          such  as  the  supersymmetric model proposed by de Boer et al.,
          inevitably also predicts a primary flux of antiprotons from the
          same   jets.  Since  propagation  of  the  antiprotons  in  the
          unconventional,  disk-dominated  type  of halo model used by de
          Boer  et  al.  is strongly constrained by the measured ratio of
          boron  to  carbon  nuclei  in  cosmic  rays, we investigate the
          viability  of  the  model using the DarkSUSY package to compute
          the  gamma-ray  and antiproton fluxes. We are able to show that
          their model is excluded by a wide margin from the measured flux
          of  antiprotons.  %  We therefore find that a model of the type
          suggested  by  Moskalenko  et  al.,  where  the  intensities of
          protons  and  electrons  in  the cosmic rays vary with galactic
          position, is far more plausible.

          Title:  Protoneutron  star  dynamos:  pulsars,  magnetars,  and
          radio-silent X-ray emitting neutron stars
          Authors: A.Bonanno, V.Urpin, G.Belvedere
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, to appear on A&A
          We  discuss  the mean-field dynamo action in protoneutron stars
          that are subject to instabilities during the early evolutionary
          phase.  The  mean  field  is  generated  in  the neutron-finger
          unstable  region  where  the  Rossby  number  is  $\sim  1$ and
          mean-field dynamo is efficient. Depending on the rotation rate,
          the  mean-field  dynamo  can  lead  to  the  formation of three
          different  types  of  pulsars.  If  the  initial  period of the
          protoneutron  star  is  short,  then  the generated large-scale
          field  is  very  strong ($> 3 \times 10^{13}$G) and exceeds the
          small-scale  field  at the neutron star surface. If rotation is
          moderate,  then  the  pulsars  are  formed  with  more  or less
          standard dipole fields ($< 3 \times 10^{13}$G) but with surface
          small-scale  magnetic fields stronger than the dipole field. If
          rotation  is  very  slow,  then  the mean-field dynamo does not
          operate,   and   the   neutron   star   has  no  global  field.
          Nevertheless,  strong  small-scale fields are generated in such
          pulsars,  and they can manifest themselves as objects with very
          low  spin-down  rate  but with a strong magnetic field inferred
          from the spectral features.

          Title: Profile morphology and polarization of young pulsars
          Authors: Simon Johnston, Joel M. Weisberg
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 16 pages
          We  present  polarization  profiles  at  1.4 and 3.1 GHz for 14
          young  pulsars  with  characteristic  ages  less  than  75 kyr.
          Careful calibration ensures that the absolute position angle of
          the  linearly polarized radiation at the pulsar is obtained. In
          combination  with  previously published data we draw three main
          conclusions  about  the  pulse  profiles  of young pulsars. (1)
          Pulse  profiles  are  simple  and  consist of either one or two
          prominent  components.  (2)  The linearly polarized fraction is
          nearly  always  in  excess of 70 per cent. (3) In profiles with
          two  components the trailing component nearly always dominates,
          only the trailing component shows circular polarization and the
          position  angle  swing  is  generally  flat  across the leading
          component and steep across the trailing component.
          Based   on   these   results   we   can   make   the  following
          generalisations  about the emission beams of young pulsars. (1)
          There  is  a single, relatively wide cone of emission from near
          the  last  open  field  lines.  (2)  Core emission is absent or
          rather weak. (3) The height of the emission is between 1 and 10
          per cent of the light cylinder radius.

          Title: Cold Dark Matter as Compact Composite Objects
          Authors: Ariel Zhitnitsky
          Dark  Matter  (DM)  being  the  vital ingredient in the cosmos,
          still  remains  a  mystery.  Standard  assumption  is  that the
          collisionless cold dark matter (CCDM) particles are represented
          by  some weakly interacting fundamental fields which can not be
          associated with any standard quarks or leptons. However, recent
          analyses  of structure on galactic and sub-galactic scales have
          suggested  discrepancies  and  stimulated  numerous alternative
          proposals   including,   e.g.   Self-Interacting  dark  matter,
          Self-Annihilating  dark  matter,  Decaying dark matter, to name
          just  a  few.  We  propose  the  alternative  to  the  standard
          assumption   about  the  nature  of  DM  particles  (which  are
          typically  assumed  to  be weakly interacting fundamental point
          -like  particles,  yet to be discovered). Our proposal is based
          on   the  idea  that  DM  particles  are  strongly  interacting
          composite  macroscopically  large  objects  which  made of well
          known  light quarks (or even antiquarks). The required weakness
          of  the  DM  particle  interactions  is  guaranteed  by a small
          geometrical factor of the composite objects with a large baryon
          charge  rather than by a weak coupling constant of a new field.
          We  argue  that  the  interaction  between  hadronic matter and
          composite dark objects does not spoil the desired properties of
          the  latter  as cold matter. We also argue that such a scenario
          does  not contradict to the current observational data. Rather,
          it  has  natural  explanations  of  many observed data, such as
          $\Omega_{DM}/  \Omega_{B}\sim  1$  or  $511  KeV$ line from the
          bulge of our galaxy. We also suggest that composite dark matter
          may  modify  the dynamics of structure formation in the central
          overdense  regions  of  galaxies.  We  also present a number of
          other  cosmological/astrophysical observations which indirectly
          support the novel concept of DM nature.

          Title: Simulated synchrotron emission from Pulsar Wind Nebulae
          Authors:  Luca  Del  Zanna,  Delia Volpi, Elena Amato, Niccolo'
          Bucciantini
          Comments: 14 pages, submitted to A&A
          A complete set of diagnostic tools aimed at producing synthetic
          synchrotron  emissivity,  polarization, and spectral index maps
          from  relativistic  MHD  simulations  is  presented. As a first
          application  we  consider  here  the  case of the emission from
          Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe). The proposed method is based on the
          addition, on top of the basic set of MHD equations, of an extra
          equation  describing the evolution of the maximum energy of the
          emitting  particles. This equation takes into account adiabatic
          and  synchrotron  losses along streamlines for the distribution
          of  emitting  particles  and its formulation is such that it is
          easily  implemented  in  any  numerical scheme for relativistic
          MHD.  Application  to  the  axisymmetric  simulations  of PWNe,
          analogous  to  those  described by Del Zanna et al. (2004, A&A,
          421,  1063),  allows  direct  comparison  between the numerical
          results  and  observations  of  the inner structure of the Crab
          Nebula, and similar objects, in the optical and X-ray bands. We
          are  able  to  match  most  of the observed features typical of
          PWNe,  like  the  equatorial  torus  and  the  polar jets, with
          velocities  in  the  correct  range,  as well as finer emission
          details, like arcs, rings and the bright knot, that turn out to
          arise mainly from Doppler boosting effects. Spectral properties
          appear  to be well reproduced too: detailed spectral index maps
          are  produced for the first time and show softening towards the
          PWN outer borders, whereas spectral breaks appear in integrated
          spectra.  The  emission details are found to strongly depend on
          both  the  average  wind magnetization (here approximately 2%),
          and on the magnetic field shape.

          Journal-ref: Astronomy Reports, 2006, vol. 50, No. 1, pp. 55-61
          The   paper   presents   an   analysis   of   dual-polarization
          observations  of  the Crab pulsar obtained on the 64-m Kalyazin
          radio  telescope at 600 MHz with a time resolution of 250 ns. A
          lower limit for the intensities of giant pulses is estimated by
          assuming  that  the pulsar radio emission in the main pulse and
          interpulse consists entirely of giant radio pulses; this yields
          estimates  of  100  Jy and 35 Jy for the peak flux densities of
          giant   pulses  arising  in  the  main  pulse  and  interpulse,
          respectively.  This  assumes  that the normal radio emission of
          the  pulse  occurs  in  the  precursor pulse. In this case, the
          longitudes of the giant radio pulses relative to the profile of
          the  normal radio emission turn out to be the same for the Crab
          pulsar  and  the millisecond pulsar B1937+21, namely, the giant
          pulses  arise at the trailing edge of the profile of the normal
          radio  emission.  Analysis of the distribution of the degree of
          circular  polarization  for the giant pulses suggests that they
          can  consist  of  a  random  mixture  of  nanopulses  with 100%
          circular   polarization  of  either  sign,  with,  on  average,
          hundreds of such nanopulses within a single giant pulse.

          A growing number of early Be stars exhibit unusually hard X-ray
          spectra  and luminosities intermediate between those typical of
          early type stars and those emitted by most Be/X-ray binaries in
          quiescence. We report on XMM-Newton and optical observations of
          two  such  Be stars, SAO 49725 and HD 161103. The nature of the
          hard-thermal  X-ray  emission  is discussed in the light of the
          models  proposed  for Gamma Cas, magnetic disc-star interaction
          or  accretion onto a compact companion object - neutron star or
          white  dwarf.  These  two  new  objects  added to similar cases
          discovered  in  XMM-Newton  surveys point at the emergence of a
          new class of Gamma Cas analogs.

          Title:   Gravitational   Recoil   during   Binary   Black  Hole
          Coalescence using the Effective One Body Approach
          Authors: Thibault Damour, Achamveedu Gopakumar
          Comments: 45 pages, 8 figures
          During  the  coalescence  of  binary black holes, gravitational
          waves carry linear momentum away from the source, which results
          in  the  recoil  of the center of mass. Using the Effective One
          Body approach, that includes nonperturbative resummed estimates
          for  the  damping  and conservative parts of the compact binary
          dynamics,  we  compute  the recoil during the late inspiral and
          the subsequent plunge of non-spinning black holes of comparable
          masses  moving  in  quasi-circular  orbits.  Further,  using  a
          prescription  that  smoothly  connects  the  plunge  phase to a
          perturbed  single  black  hole,  we  obtain an estimate for the
          total recoil associated with the binary black hole coalescence.
          We  show that the crucial physical feature which determines the
          magnitude of the terminal recoil is the presence of a ``burst''
          of  linear  momentum  flux emitted slightly before coalescence.
          When  using the most natural expression for the linear momentum
          flux  during  the plunge, we find that the maximum value of the
          terminal  recoil  is  $\sim  74$  km/s  and  occurs for $\eta =
          \frac{m_1  m_2}  {(m_1+ m_2)^2} \simeq 0.2$, {i.e.}, for a mass
          ratio $m_2/m_1 \simeq 0.38$. Away from this optimal mass ratio,
          the  recoil  velocity decreases approximately proportionally to
          the  scaling  function  $\tilde  f  (\eta)  =  \eta^2  (1  -  4
          \eta)^{1/2} (1.0912 - 1.04 \eta + 2.92 \eta^2) $. We comment on
          the  reasons  why  our estimate for the recoil is significantly
          smaller  than  previous  ones,  and  conclude that more work is
          needed  on  the  location  and  amplitude of the peak of linear
          momentum  flux  radiated  during  the  plunge  before  one  can
          analytically  estimate the maximum value of the recoil velocity
          in a reliable way.

          km/s  and  suggest  a  distance  of  9.2  kpc  for the SNR. The
          estimated  Sedov  age  for G65.1+0.6 is 4 - 14$\times10^{4}$yr.
          The   pulsar  (PSR)  J1957+2831  is  associated  with  the  SNR
          G65.1+0.6 due to their consistent distances and ages. The EGRET
          source  3EG  J1958+2909  and $\gamma$-ray source 2CG 065+00 are
          also  near  the  eastern  edge  of  the SNR but do not agree in
          position with the pulsar and are likely not associated with the
          SNR. The SNR's flux densities at 408 MHz (8.6$\pm$0.8 Jy), 1420
          MHz  (4.9$\pm$0.5  Jy)  and 2695 MHz (3.3$\pm$0.5 Jy) have been
          corrected  for  flux  densities from compact sources within the
          SNR.   The   integrated   flux  density  based  spectral  index
          (S$_{\nu}$$\propto$$\nu$$^{-\alpha}$)  between 1420 MHz and 408
          MHz  is  0.45$\pm$0.11  and  agrees  with the T-T plot spectral
          index  of  0.34  $\pm$0.20. The nearby SNR DA495 has a T-T plot
          spectral index of 0.50$\pm$0.01.

          Title: Observed Planetary Nebulae as Descendants of Interacting
          Binary Systems
          Authors: Noam Soker (Technion, Israel)
          Comments: Submitted To ApJ Lett
          We  examine  recent  studies on the formation rate of planetary
          nebulae  and  find  this  rate  to  be  about  one-third of the
          formation  rate  of  white dwarfs. This implies than only about
          one-third  of  all  planetary nebulae that evolve to form white
          dwarfs  are actually bright enough to be observed. This finding
          corresponds  with  the  claim that it is necessary for a binary
          companion  to interact with the asymptotic giant branch stellar
          progenitor  for  the  descendant planetary nebulae to be bright
          enough  to  be  detected.  The finding about the formation rate
          also  strengthens  De  Marco's  conjecture that the majority of
          observed  planetary  nebulae  harbor  binary  systems. In other
          words,  single  stars  almost  never  form  observed  planetary
          nebulae.

          Comments:  12  pages  (emulateapj),  submitted to ApJ, Fig.1 of
          high resolution available at this http URL
          We   present  Chandra  ACIS  observations  of  N157B,  a  young
          supernova  remnant  located  in  the  30 Doradus star-formation
          region  of  the  LMC.  This remnant contains the most energetic
          pulsar  known (PSR J0537-6910), which is surrounded by a bright
          nonthermal nebula that likely represents a toroidal pulsar wind
          terminal  shock  observed  edge-on.  We confirm the non-thermal
          nature of the comet-shaped X-ray emission feature and show that
          the spectral steepening of this feature away from the pulsar is
          quantitatively  consistent  with synchrotron cooling of shocked
          pulsar  wind  particles  flowing  downstream at a bulk velocity
          close  to  the  speed  of  light. Around the cometary nebula we
          unambiguously  detect  a  thermal component, which accounts for
          about 1/3 of the total 0.5 - 10 keV flux from the remnant. This
          thermal  component  is  distributed  among  various  clumps  of
          metal-enriched  plasma  embedded  in the low surface brightness
          X-ray-emitting  diffuse  gas.  The  relative  metal  enrichment
          pattern  suggests  that the mass of the supernova progenitor is
          >~  20M_sun.  A  comparison  of the X-ray data with HST optical
          images  suggests  that  the  explosion site is close to a dense
          cloud,  against  which  a  reflection  shock  is  launched. The
          interaction  between  this  reflection shock and the nebula has
          likely  produced  both  its  cometary shape and the surrounding
          thermal emission enhancement. SNR N157B is apparently expanding
          into  the  hot  low-density  interior  of  a nearby superbubble
          formed by the young OB association LH99, as revealed by Spitzer
          mid-infrared  images.  This  scenario  naturally  explains  the
          exceptionally  large  sizes  of both the thermal and nonthermal
          components  as  well  as the lack of an outer shell of the SNR.
          These results provide a rare glimpse into the SNR structure and
          evolution of a recent star-formation region.

          Title:  Analysing  the  atolls:  X-ray  spectral transitions of
          accreting neutron stars
          Authors: Jeanette Gladstone, Chris Done, Marek Gierlinski
          We  systematically  analyse  all the available X-ray spectra of
          disc  accreting  neutron stars (atolls and millisecond pulsars)
          from  the  RXTE  database.  We  show  that while these all show
          similar  spectral  evolution  as  a  function of mass accretion
          rate,   there  are  also  subtle  differences.  There  are  two
          different  types  of  hard/soft  transition,  those  where  the
          spectrum  softens  at all energies, leading to a diagonal track
          on  a  colour-colour  diagram,  and those where only the higher
          energy   spectrum   softens,   giving  a  vertical  track.  The
          luminosity  at  which  the transition occurs is correlated with
          this spectral behaviour, with the vertical transition at L/LEdd
          ~ 0.02 while the diagonal one is at ~ 0.1. Superimposed on this
          is  the well known hysteresis effect, but we show that classic,
          large  scale hysteresis occurs only in the outbursting sources,
          indicating that its origin is in the dramatic rate of change of
          mass  accretion  rate during the disc instability. We show that
          the   long   term  mass  accretion  rate  correlates  with  the
          transition  behaviour,  and  speculate  that this is due to the
          magnetic  field  being  able  to  emerge  from the neutron star
          surface for low average mass accretion rates. While this is not
          strong  enough  to collimate the flow except in the millisecond
          pulsars,  its  presence  may  affect  the  inner accretion flow
          through changing the jet properties.

          Title: Can single O stars produce non-thermal radio emission?
          Authors: S. Van Loo, M.C. Runacres, R. Blomme
          Comments: 10 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication by A&A
          We  present  a  model  for  the non-thermal radio emission from
          presumably  single  O  stars,  in terms of synchrotron emission
          from   relativistic   electrons  accelerated  in  wind-embedded
          shocks.  These  shocks are associated with an unstable, chaotic
          wind.  The  main  improvement with respect to earlier models is
          the  inclusion  of  the radial dependence of the shock velocity
          jump   and   compression  ratio,  based  on  1D  hydrodynamical
          simulations.   The  decrease  of  the  velocity  jump  and  the
          compression  ratio  as  a function of radius produces a rapidly
          decreasing  synchrotron  emissivity. This effectively prohibits
          the  models from reproducing the spectral shape of the observed
          non-thermal  radio emission. We investigate a number of "escape
          routes"  by  which  the  hydrodynamical  predictions  might  be
          reconciled  with  the radio observations. Although these escape
          routes  reproduce  the  observed  spectral shape, none of these
          escape   routes   are   physically  plausible.  In  particular,
          re-acceleration  by  feeding an electron distribution through a
          number   of   shocks,   is   in   contradiction   with  current
          hydrodynamical  simulations.  These  hydrodynamical simulations
          have their limitations, most notably the use of 1D. At present,
          it is not feasible to perform 2D simulations of the wind out to
          the  distances  required for synchrotron-emission models. Based
          on  the  current  hydrodynamic  models,  we  suspect  that  the
          observed  non-thermal  radio  emission  from  O stars cannot be
          explained   by   wind-embedded   shocks   associated  with  the
          instability  of  the  line-driving  mechanism.  The most likely
          alternative  mechanism  is  synchrotron emission from colliding
          winds. That would imply that all O stars with non-thermal radio
          emission should be members of binary or multiple systems.

          Title:  Merger  of  binary  neutron stars to a black hole: Disk
          mass, short gamma-ray bursts, and quasinormal mode ringing
          Authors: Masaru Shibata, Keisuke Taniguchi
          Comments:  28  pages,  21  figures, accepted for publication in
          Phys.Rev.D
          Three-dimensional  simulations for the merger of binary neutron
          stars  (BNSs)  are  performed  in the framework of full general
          relativity.  We pay particular attention to the black hole (BH)
          formation  case  and  to  the resulting mass of the surrounding
          disk  for  exploring  possibility  for formation of the central
          engine  of short-duration gamma-ray bursts. Hybrid equations of
          state  (EOSs)  are  adopted  mimicking realistic, stiff nuclear
          EOSs,  for which the maximum allowed gravitational mass of cold
          and  spherical  neutron  stars  (NSs),  M_sph,  is  larger than
          2M_sun.  For  the simulations, we focus on BNSs of the ADM mass
          M>2.6M_sun. For M>M_thr, the merger results in prompt formation
          of a BH irrespective of the mass ratio Q_M with 0.65<Q_M<1. The
          value  of  M_thr  is approximately written as 1.3-1.35M_sph for
          the  chosen  EOSs.  For  the  BH  formation case, we evolve the
          spacetime  using a BH excision technique and determine the mass
          of  a  quasistationary  disk  surrounding the BH. The disk mass
          steeply  increases  with  decreasing the value of Q_M for given
          ADM  mass  and  EOS. For M<M_thr, the outcome is a hypermassive
          neutron  star  (HMNS)  of  a  large  ellipticity.  If  the HMNS
          collapses   to   a  BH  after  the  longterm  angular  momentum
          transport, the disk mass may be >0.01M_sun. Gravitational waves
          (GWs)   are   computed  in  terms  of  a  gauge-invariant  wave
          extraction   technique.   In   the   formation   of  the  HMNS,
          quasiperiodic  GWs  of  frequency  (3-3.5kHz)  are emitted. The
          effective  amplitude of GWs can be >5x10^{-21} at a distance of
          50  Mpc.  For  the BH formation case, the BH excision technique
          enables  a longterm computation and extraction of ring-down GWs
          associated  with  a  BH  quasinormal mode. It is found that the
          frequency and amplitude are 6.5-7kHz and 10^{-22} at a distance
          of 50Mpc for M=2.7-2.9M_sun.

          Comments:   Submitted  to  ApJ  Letters;  version  with  higher
          resolution figures available at this http URL (900kb)
          Magnetospheres  of many astrophysical objects can be accurately
          described by the low-inertia (or "force-free") limit of MHD. We
          present  a  new  numerical  method for solution of equations of
          force-free  relativistic  MHD  based  on  the finite-difference
          time-domain  (FDTD)  approach  with a prescription for handling
          spontaneous  formation of current sheets. We use this method to
          study  the time-dependent evolution of pulsar magnetospheres in
          both  aligned  and oblique magnetic geometries. For the aligned
          rotator    we   confirm   the   general   properties   of   the
          time-independent solution of Contopoulos et al. (1999). For the
          oblique   rotator   we   present   the   3D  structure  of  the
          magnetosphere  and  compute,  for  the first time, the spindown
          power  of  pulsars as a function of inclination of the magnetic
          axis.  We  find  the pulsar spindown luminosity to be L = (mu^2
          Omega^4/c^3)  (1+  sin^2(alpha))  for  a  star  with the dipole
          moment   "mu",   rotation   frequency   "Omega",  and  magnetic
          inclination  angle  "alpha".  We  also  discuss  the effects of
          current sheet resistivity and reconnection on the structure and
          evolution of the magnetosphere.

          We  report  the results of high spectral and angular resolution
          infrared  observations  of  the  multiple system GL 569 A and B
          that were intended to measure the dynamical masses of the brown
          dwarf  binary  believed  to comprise GL 569 B. Our analysis did
          not  yield  this  result  but, instead, revealed two surprises.
          First,  at  age  ~100  Myr, the system is younger than had been
          reported  earlier.  Second,  our  spectroscopic and photometric
          results  provide  support for earlier indications that GL 569 B
          is  actually  a  hierarchical  brown dwarf triple rather than a
          binary. Our results suggest that the three components of GL 569
          B have roughly equal mass, ~0.04 Msun.

          Title:  The  Anisoplanatic  Point  Spread  Function in Adaptive
          Optics
          Authors: Matthew Britton
          Comments: 26 pages, 7 figures
          The  effects  of  anisoplanatism  on  the adaptive optics point
          spread  function  are  investigated.  A  model  is derived that
          combines  observations  of  the  guide  star  with  an analytic
          formulation  of  anisoplanatism to generate predictions for the
          adaptive  optics  point  spread function at arbitrary locations
          within the field of view. The analytic formulation captures the
          dependencies  of anisoplanatism on aperture diameter, observing
          wavelength,   angular   offset,  zenith  angle  and  turbulence
          profile.   The  predictions  of  this  model  are  compared  to
          narrowband  2.12  um  and  1.65 um images of a 21 arcsec binary
          (mV=7.3,  7.6) acquired with the Palomar Adaptive Optics System
          on  the Hale 5 meter telescope. Contemporaneous measurements of
          the  turbulence  profile  made  with  a DIMM/MASS unit are used
          together with images of the primary to predict the point spread
          function  of  the  binary companion. Predicted companion Strehl
          ratios are shown to match measurements to within a few percent,
          whereas    predictions   based   on   the   isoplanatic   angle
          approximation  are  highly  discrepant. The predicted companion
          point  spread functions are shown to agree with observations to
          10%.  These  predictions  are  used to measure the differential
          photometry  between  binary members to an accuracy of 1 part in
          10^{-3},  and  the  differential astrometry to an accuracy of 1
          mas.  Errors  in  the  differential  astrometry are shown to be
          dominated   by  differential  atmospheric  tilt  jitter.  These
          results  are  compared  to  other  techniques  that  have  been
          employed for photometry, astrometry, and high contrast imaging.

          nonextensive   effects   is   given.   As  it  happens  in  the
          nonrelativistic  limit, the molecular chaos hypothesis advanced
          by  Boltzmann  does  not  remain  valid,  and the second law of
          thermodynamics  combined  with a duality transformation implies
          that  the  q-parameter  lies  on the interval [0,2]. It is also
          proved  that  the  collisional equilibrium states (null entropy
          source  term)  are  described by the relativistic $q$-power law
          extension   of   the  exponential  Juttner  distribution  which
          reduces,  in  the  nonrelativistic domain, to the Tsallis power
          law  function.  As a simple illustration of the basic approach,
          we    derive    the   relativistic   nonextensive   equilibrium
          distribution  for  a  dilute charged gas under the action of an
          electromagnetic  field  $F^{{\mu\nu}}$.  Such results reduce to
          the  standard ones in the extensive limit, thereby showing that
          the  nonextensive entropic framework can be harmonized with the
          space-time ideas contained in the special relativity theory.

          Title:  Force  distribution  in a randomly perturbed lattice of

          We  study the statistics of the force felt by a particle in the
          class   of   spatially  correlated  distribution  of  identical
          point-like  particles,  interacting  via  a  $1/r^2$ pair force
          (i.e.  gravitational  or  Coulomb),  and  obtained  by randomly
          perturbing  an  infinite  perfect lattice. In the first part we
          specify the conditions under which the force on a particle is a
          well  defined  stochastic  quantity.  We  then  study the small
          displacements approximation, giving both the limitations of its
          validity,  and,  when  it is valid, an expression for the force
          variance.  In  the  second  part of the paper we extend to this
          class  of  particle  distributions  the  method  introduced  by
          Chandrasekhar  to  study the force probability density function
          in  the  homogeneous Poisson particle distribution. In this way
          we  can  derive  an  approximate expression for the probability
          distribution  of the force over the full range of perturbations
          of  the lattice, i.e., from very small (compared to the lattice
          spacing) to very large where the Poisson limit is recovered. We
          show  in  particular  the qualitative change in the large-force
          tail  of  the  force  distribution  between  these  two limits.
          Excellent accuracy of our analytic results is found on detailed
          comparison  with  results  from  numerical  simulations.  These
          results   provide   basic  statistical  information  about  the
          fluctuations   of   the  interactions  (i)  of  the  masses  in
          self-gravitating  systems like those encountered in the context
          of  cosmological N-body simulations, and (ii) of the charges in
          the ordered phase of the One Component Plasma.

          Title: An introduction to relativistic hydrodynamics
          Authors: Eric Gourgoulhon (LUTH, CNRS / Observatoire de Paris)
          Comments:  37  pages,  5  figures,  lecture given at the School
          "Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics" (Cargese, France, 9-13 May 2005)

          Subj-class:  General  Relativity  and  Quantum Cosmology; Fluid
          Dynamics
          This  lecture  provides  some  introduction  to  perfect  fluid
          dynamics  within  the  framework  of  general  relativity.  The
          presentation  is  based on the Carter-Lichnerowicz approach. It
          has the advantage over the more traditional approach of leading
          very  straightforwardly to important conservation laws, such as
          the  relativistic  generalizations  of  Bernoulli's  theorem or
          Kelvin's  circulation  theorem.  It  also permits to get easily
          first  integrals  of  motion  which are particularly useful for
          computing  equilibrium  configurations of relativistic stars in
          rotation  or  in binary systems. The presentation is relatively
          self-contained  and  does not require any a priori knowledge of
          general   relativity.   In   particular,  the  three  types  of
          derivatives   involved   in   relativistic   hydrodynamics  are
          introduced  in  detail:  this  concerns  the  Lie, exterior and
          covariant derivatives.

          Title: Implications of the metallicity dependence of Wolf-Rayet
          winds
          Authors: John J. Eldridge, Jorick S. Vink
          Comments:   8   pages,  9  figures,  accepted  by  Astronomy  &
          Astrophysics
          Aims:   Recent   theoretical   predictions  for  the  winds  of
          Wolf-Rayet stars indicate that their mass-loss rates scale with
          the initial stellar metallicity in the local Universe.We aim to
          investigate how this predicted dependence affects the models of
          Wolf-Rayet  stars  and  their  progeny  in  different  chemical
          environments.  Methods:  We compute models of stellar structure
          and  evolution  for  Wolf-Rayet  stars  for  different  initial
          metallicities,   and   investigate   how  the  scaling  of  the
          Wolf-Rayet  mass-loss  rates  affects  the  final  masses,  the
          lifetimes  of  the WN and WC subtypes, and how the ratio of the
          two   populations  vary  with  metallicity.  Results:  We  find
          significant  effects  of  metallicity dependent mass-loss rates
          for  Wolf-Rayet  stars.  For models that include the scaling of
          the  mass-loss  rate  with  initial  metallicity,  all WR stars
          become neutron stars rather than black holes at twice the solar
          metallicity;  at  lower $Z$, black holes have larger masses. We
          also   show   that   our  models  that  include  the  mass-loss
          metallicity  scaling closely reproduce the observed decrease of
          the   relative   population   of   WC  over  WN  stars  at  low
          metallicities.

          Title: Radio Images of 3C 58: Expansion and Motion of its Wisp
          Authors: M. F. Bietenholz
          Comments:   12   pages;   accepted   for   publication  in  the
          Astrophysical Journal
          New  1.4  GHz  VLA observations of the pulsar-powered supernova
          remnant 3C 58 have resulted in the highest-quality radio images
          of  this  object to date. The images show filamentary structure
          over  the  body  of  the  nebula. The present observations were
          combined  with  earlier  ones from 1984 and 1991 to investigate
          the   variability  of  the  radio  emission  on  a  variety  of
          time-scales.  No  significant  changes  are seen over a 110 day
          interval.  In  particular,  the  upper  limit  on  the apparent
          projected  velocity of the wisp is 0.05c. The expansion rate of
          the  radio  nebula was determined between 1984 and 2004, and is
          0.014+/-0.003%/year,  corresponding  to  a velocity of 630+/-70
          km/s  along the major axis. If 3C 58 is the remnant of SN 1181,
          it must have been strongly decelerated, which is unlikely given
          the   absence   of   emission   from   the   supernova   shell.
          Alternatively,  the  low  expansion speed and a number of other
          arguments  suggest that 3C 58 may be several thousand years old
          and not be the remnant of SN 1181.

          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          We  have  investigated  the  proof  of the $H$ theorem within a
          manifestly  covariant  approach by considering the relativistic
          statistical  theory developed in [Phy. Rev. E {\bf 66}, 056125,
          2002;  {\it  ibid.}  {\bf  72},  036108 2005]. In our analysis,
          however,   we   have  not  considered  the  so-called  deformed
          mathematics as did in the above reference. As it happens in the
          nonrelativistic   limit,  the  molecular  chaos  hypothesis  is
          slightly extended within the $\kappa$-formalism, and the second
          law  of thermodynamics implies that the $\kappa$ parameter lies
          on  the  interval  [-1,1].  It  is  shown  that the collisional
          equilibrium  states (null entropy source term) are described by
          a  $\kappa$ power law generalization of the exponential Juttner
          distribution,        e.g.,       $f(x,p)\propto       (\sqrt{1+
          \kappa^2\theta^2}+\kappa\theta)^{1/\kappa}\equiv\exp_\kappa\the
          ta$, with $\theta=\alpha(x)+\beta_\mu p^\mu$, where $\alpha(x)$
          is  a  scalar, $\beta_\mu$ is a four-vector, and $p^\mu$ is the
          four-momentum.   As   a   simple   example,  we  calculate  the
          relativistic  $\kappa$ power law for a dilute charged gas under
          the  action  of  an  electromagnetic  field  $F^{\mu\nu}$.  All
          standard  results  are readly recovered in the particular limit
          $\kappa\to 0$.

          Comments:  10  pages,  7  figures.  Accepted for publication in
          Phys. Rev. C
          Hydrodynamical  simulations  of  neutron star cores, based on a
          two  fluid  description in terms of a neutron-proton superfluid
          mixture,   require   the   knowledge   of  the  Andreev-Bashkin
          entrainment   matrix   which   relates   the  momentum  of  one
          constituent  to  the currents of both constituents. This matrix
          is  derived for arbitrary nuclear asymmetry at zero temperature
          and  in  the limits of small relative currents in the framework
          of  the  energy  density  functional  theory. The Skyrme energy
          density  functional is considered as a particular case. General
          analytic  formulae  for  the entrainment parameters and various
          corresponding effective masses are obtained. These formulae are
          applied  to  the  liquid core of a neutron star, composed of an
          homogeneous plasma of nucleons, electrons and possibly muons in
          beta equilibrium.

          Authors:  Andrea  Martocchia  (CESR, OAS), Giorgio Matt, Tomaso

          Two   XMM-Newton   observations   of   the   black-hole  binary
          GRS1915+105  were triggered in 2004 (April 17 and 21), during a
          long  "plateau"  state  of  the  source.  We  analyzed the data
          collected with EPIC-pn in Timing and Burst modes, respectively.
          No  thermal disc emission is required by the data; the spectrum
          is  well fitted by four components: a primary component (either
          a  simple power law or thermal Comptonization) absorbed by cold
          matter  with  abundances  different than those of standard ISM;
          reprocessing  from  an  ionized  disc;  emission and absorption
          lines;  and a soft X-ray excess around 1 keV. The latter is not
          confirmed  by  RGS  (which  were used in the second observation
          only);  if real, the excess could be due to reflection from the
          optically  thin,  photoionized  plasma of a disc wind, in which
          case  it  may  provide  a  way  to  disentangle  intrinsic from
          interstellar  absorption.  Indeed, the former is best traced by
          the higher abundances of heavier elements, while an independent
          estimate of the latter may be given by the value we get for the
          disc  wind component only, which roughly coincides with what is
          found for lower-Z species.

          structure and particle acceleration

          High Energy Particles and Radiation," Torun, June 20 - 24, 2005
          Journal-ref: AIP Conf. Proc. 801 (2005), 345-350
          We  discuss 3D simulations of relativistic collisionless shocks
          in  electron-positron  pair  plasmas using the particle-in-cell
          (PIC)  method.  The shock structure is mainly controlled by the
          shock's  magnetization  ("sigma" parameter). We demonstrate how
          the  structure  of  the shock varies as a function of sigma for
          perpendicular  shocks.  At  low  magnetizations  the  shock  is
          mediated  mainly  by  the  Weibel  instability  which generates
          transient magnetic fields that can exceed the initial field. At
          larger  magnetizations  the  shock  is  dominated  by  magnetic
          reflections.  We  demonstrate  where  the transition occurs and
          argue  that  it  is  impossible  to have very low magnetization
          collisionless  shocks  in  nature  (in  more  than  one spatial
          dimension).  We  further discuss the acceleration properties of
          these  shocks, and show that higher magnetization perpendicular
          shocks  do  not  efficiently accelerate nonthermal particles in
          3D.  Among  other  astrophysical  applications, this may pose a
          restriction  on  the  structure  and  composition  of gamma-ray
          bursts and pulsar wind outflows.

          Pulsar  spindown  forms  a reliable yet enigmatic prototype for
          the   energy  loss  processes  in  many  astrophysical  objects
          including  accretion  disks  and  back  holes. In this paper we
          review  the  physics of pulsar magnetospheres, concentrating on
          recent    developments    in   force-free   modeling   of   the
          magnetospheric  structure.  In  particular,  we  discuss  a new
          method  for  solving the equations of time-dependent force-free
          relativistic  MHD in application to pulsars. This method allows
          to dynamically study the formation of the magnetosphere and its
          response  to  perturbations, opening a qualitatively new window
          on  pulsar  phenomena.  Applications  of  the  method  to other
          magnetized rotators, such as magnetars and accretion disks, are
          also discussed.

          Comments: 9 pages, 11 figures, Accepted for publication in AJ
          The  young  planetary nebulae play an important role in stellar
          evolution  when  intermediate-  to low-mass stars (0.8 $\sim$ 8
          M$_\odot$) evolve from the proto-planetary nebulae phase to the
          planetary  nebulae  phase. Many young planetary nebulae display
          distinct  bipolar  structures  as  they  evolve  away  from the
          proto-planetary  nebulae  phase.  One  possible  cause of their
          bipolarity  could  be  due  to  a  binary  origin of its energy
          source.  Here we report our detailed investigation of the young
          planetary  nebula,  Hubble  12,  which  is  well-known  for its
          extended  hourglass-like  envelope.  We  present  evidence with
          time-series   photometric  observations  the  existence  of  an
          eclipsing  binary  at  the  center of Hubble 12. Low-resolution
          spectra  of  the  central  source  show,  on  the  other  hand,
          absorption features such as CN, G-band & Mg b${\arcsec}$, which
          can  be  suggestive  of  a  low-mass  nature  of  the secondary
          component.

          We  observed  with Chandra two peculiar galactic X-ray sources,
          4U  1700+24  and  4U  1954+319,  which  are suspected to have a
          M-type  giant  star  as optical counterpart, in order to get an
          high-precision  astrometric  position  for  both  of  them. The
          peculiarity  of  these  sources lies in the fact that these are
          the  only  two  cases  among  low-mass  X-ray binaries (LMXBs),
          besides  the  confirmed case of GX 1+4, for which the companion
          can possibly be a M-type giant. We found that in both cases the
          field  M-type  giant  star  is  indeed the counterpart of these
          X-ray  sources.  We also determined the distance to 4U 1954+319
          to  be  about  1.7  kpc.  This result suggests that a number of
          faint  (L_X  around 10^32-10^34 erg s-1) Galactic X-ray sources
          are  `symbiotic  X-ray  binaries',  that  is,  wide-orbit LMXBs
          composed  of  a  compact  object,  most  likely a neutron star,
          accreting from the wind of a M-type giant.

          Almost  all  young  stars  are  found in multiple systems. This
          suggests  that  protostellar  cores almost always fragment into
          multiple  objects.  The observed properties of multiple systems
          such  as  their separation distribution and mass ratios provide
          strong  constraints  on  star formation theories. We review the
          observed  properties of young and old multiple systems and find
          that  the  multiplicity  of stars changes. Such an evolution is
          probably  due  to  (a)  the  dynamical decay of small-N systems
          and/or  (b)  the  destruction  of multiple systems within dense
          clusters.   We  review  simulations  of  the  fragmentation  of
          rotating  and  turbulent  molecular  cores.  Such models almost
          always  produce  multiple  systems,  however  the properties of
          those  systems  do not match observations at all well. Magnetic
          fields appear to supress fragmentation, prehaps suggesting that
          they are not dynamically important in the formation of multiple
          systems.  We  finish  by discussing possible reasons why theory
          fails  to  match observation, and the future prospects for this
          field.

          Title: The Origins and Evolutionary Status of B Stars Found Far
          From the Galactic Plane II: Kinematics and Full Sample Analysis
          Authors: J. C. Martin
          Comments:  59  pages  including 14 Figures, 12 Tables; Accepted
          for publication in the Astronomical Journal
          This  paper  continues  the  analysis  of faint high latitude B
          stars from Martin (2004). Here we analyze the kinematics of the
          stars  and combine them with the abundance information from the
          first  paper  to  classify  each  one.  The  sample contains 31
          Population  I  runaways,  fifteen  old evolved stars (including
          five  BHB stars, three post-HB stars, a pulsating helium dwarf,
          and  six  stars  of ambiguous classification), one F-dwarf, and
          two  stars  which  do  not  easily  fit  in  one  of  the other
          categories.  No  star  in  the  sample  unambiguously shows the
          characteristics  of  a young massive star formed in situ in the
          halo.   The   two   unclassified  stars  are  probably  extreme
          Population  I runaways. The low binary frequency and rotational
          velocity  distribution  of the Population I runaways imply that
          most  were  ejected  from  dense  star clusters by DES (dynamic
          ejection  scenario).  However  we remain puzzled by the lack of
          runaway Be stars. We also confirm that PB 166 and HIP 41979 are
          both nearby solar-metallicity BHB stars.

          We   present   results   of   axisymmetic   magnetohydrodynamic
          simulations   of   the   interaction   of  a  rapidly-rotating,
          magnetized  star with an accretion disk. The disk is considered
          to  have  a finite viscosity and magnetic diffusivity. The main
          parameters  of  the  system are the star's angular velocity and
          magnetic  moment,  and  the  disk's  viscosity, diffusivity. We
          focus  on  the "propeller" regime where the inner radius of the
          disk  is  larger  than  the  corotation  radius.  Two  types of
          magnetohydrodynamic  flows  have  been  found  as  a  result of
          simulations:   "weak"   and  "strong"  propellers.  The  strong
          propeller  is  characterized  by  a  powerful  disk  wind and a
          collimated magnetically dominated outflow or jet from the star.
          The weak propeller have only weak outflows. We investigated the
          time-averaged  characteristics  of  the interaction between the
          main  elements of the system, the star, the disk, the wind from
          the  disk,  and  the jet. Rates of exchange of mass and angular
          momentum  between  the  elements of the system are derived as a
          function of the main parameters. The propeller mechanism may be
          responsible for the fast spinning-down of the classical T Tauri
          stars  in  the  initial  stages of their evolution, and for the
          spinning-down of accreting millisecond pulsars.

          Authors:  Andrea  Martocchia  (CESR, OAS), Giorgio Matt, Tomaso

          International  Conference,  held  in Paris, France, July 18-22,
          2005 (2006) 000
          Two   XMM-Newton   observations   of   the   black-hole  binary
          GRS1915+105  were triggered in 2004 (April 17 and 21), during a
          long  "plateau"  state  of  the  source.  We  analyzed the data
          collected with EPIC-pn in Timing and Burst modes, respectively.
          No  thermal disc emission is required by the data; the spectrum
          is  well fitted by four components: a primary component (either
          a  simple power law or thermal Comptonization) absorbed by cold
          matter  with  abundances  different than those of standard ISM;
          reprocessing  from  an  ionized  disc;  emission and absorption
          lines;  and a soft X-ray excess around 1 keV. The latter is not
          confirmed  by  RGS  (which  were used in the second observation
          only);  if real, the excess could be due to reflection from the
          optically  thin,  photoionized  plasma of a disc wind, in which
          case  it  may  provide  a  way  to  disentangle  intrinsic from
          interstellar  absorption.  Indeed, the former is best traced by
          the higher abundances of heavier elements, while an independent
          estimate of the latter may be given by the value we get for the
          disc  wind component only, which roughly coincides with what is
          found for lower-Z species.

          structure and particle acceleration

          Comments:  6  pages,  invited talk at "Astrophysical Sources of
          High Energy Particles and Radiation," Torun, June 20 - 24, 2005
          Journal-ref: AIP Conf. Proc. 801 (2005), 345-350
          We  discuss 3D simulations of relativistic collisionless shocks
          in  electron-positron  pair  plasmas using the particle-in-cell
          (PIC)  method.  The shock structure is mainly controlled by the
          shock's  magnetization  ("sigma" parameter). We demonstrate how
          the  structure  of  the shock varies as a function of sigma for
          perpendicular  shocks.  At  low  magnetizations  the  shock  is
          mediated  mainly  by  the  Weibel  instability  which generates
          transient magnetic fields that can exceed the initial field. At
          larger  magnetizations  the  shock  is  dominated  by  magnetic
          reflections.  We  demonstrate  where  the transition occurs and
          argue  that  it  is  impossible  to have very low magnetization
          collisionless  shocks  in  nature  (in  more  than  one spatial
          dimension).  We  further discuss the acceleration properties of
          these  shocks, and show that higher magnetization perpendicular
          shocks  do  not  efficiently accelerate nonthermal particles in
          3D.  Among  other  astrophysical  applications, this may pose a
          restriction  on  the  structure  and  composition  of gamma-ray
          bursts and pulsar wind outflows.

          Pulsar  spindown  forms  a reliable yet enigmatic prototype for
          the   energy  loss  processes  in  many  astrophysical  objects
          including  accretion  disks  and  back  holes. In this paper we
          review  the  physics of pulsar magnetospheres, concentrating on
          recent    developments    in   force-free   modeling   of   the
          magnetospheric  structure.  In  particular,  we  discuss  a new
          method  for  solving the equations of time-dependent force-free
          relativistic  MHD in application to pulsars. This method allows
          to dynamically study the formation of the magnetosphere and its
          response  to  perturbations, opening a qualitatively new window
          on  pulsar  phenomena.  Applications  of  the  method  to other
          magnetized rotators, such as magnetars and accretion disks, are
          also discussed.

          Comments: 9 pages, 11 figures, Accepted for publication in AJ
          The  young  planetary nebulae play an important role in stellar
          evolution  when  intermediate-  to low-mass stars (0.8 $\sim$ 8
          M$_\odot$) evolve from the proto-planetary nebulae phase to the
          planetary  nebulae  phase. Many young planetary nebulae display
          distinct  bipolar  structures  as  they  evolve  away  from the
          proto-planetary  nebulae  phase.  One  possible  cause of their
          bipolarity  could  be  due  to  a  binary  origin of its energy
          source.  Here we report our detailed investigation of the young
          planetary  nebula,  Hubble  12,  which  is  well-known  for its
          extended  hourglass-like  envelope.  We  present  evidence with
          time-series   photometric  observations  the  existence  of  an
          eclipsing  binary  at  the  center of Hubble 12. Low-resolution
          spectra  of  the  central  source  show,  on  the  other  hand,
          absorption features such as CN, G-band & Mg b${\arcsec}$, which
          can  be  suggestive  of  a  low-mass  nature  of  the secondary
          component.

          We  observed  with Chandra two peculiar galactic X-ray sources,
          4U  1700+24  and  4U  1954+319,  which  are suspected to have a
          M-type  giant  star  as optical counterpart, in order to get an
          high-precision  astrometric  position  for  both  of  them. The
          peculiarity  of  these  sources lies in the fact that these are
          the  only  two  cases  among  low-mass  X-ray binaries (LMXBs),
          besides  the  confirmed case of GX 1+4, for which the companion
          can possibly be a M-type giant. We found that in both cases the
          field  M-type  giant  star  is  indeed the counterpart of these
          X-ray  sources.  We also determined the distance to 4U 1954+319
          to  be  about  1.7  kpc.  This result suggests that a number of
          faint  (L_X  around 10^32-10^34 erg s-1) Galactic X-ray sources
          are  `symbiotic  X-ray  binaries',  that  is,  wide-orbit LMXBs
          composed  of  a  compact  object,  most  likely a neutron star,
          accreting from the wind of a M-type giant.

          The  recent  localization  of  some short-hard gamma ray bursts
          (GRBs)  in  galaxies  with  low  star  formation rates has lent
          support to the suggestion that these events result from compact
          object  binary  mergers.  We  discuss  how  new  simulations in
          general  relativity  are helping to identify the central engine
          of  short-hard GRBs. Motivated by our latest relativistic black
          hole-neutron star merger calculations, we discuss a scenario in
          which  these  events  may  trigger short-hard GRBs, and compare
          this  model  to  competing relativistic models involving binary
          neutron  star  mergers and the delayed collapse of hypermassive
          neutron stars. Distinguishing features of these models may help
          guide   future  GRB  and  gravitational  wave  observations  to
          identify the nature of the sources.

          An important and perhaps critical clue to the mechanism driving
          the explosion of massive stars as supernovae is provided by the
          accumulating  evidence for asymmetry in the explosion. Indirect
          evidence  comes  from  high  pulsar velocities, associations of
          supernovae  with long-soft gamma-ray bursts, and asymmetries in
          late-time emission-line profiles. Spectropolarimetry provides a
          direct   probe   of   young  supernova  geometry,  with  higher
          polarization  generally  indicating  a  greater  departure from
          spherical  symmetry. Large polarizations have been measured for
          'stripped-envelope'   (that  is,  type  Ic)  supernovae,  which
          confirms  their non-spherical morphology; but the explosions of
          massive   stars  with  intact  hydrogen  envelopes  (type  II-P
          supernovae)  have  shown  only  weak polarizations at the early
          times  observed.  Here we report multi-epoch spectropolarimetry
          of  a  classic  type  II-P  supernova  that  reveals the abrupt
          appearance  of  significant polarization when the inner core is
          first   exposed   in   the  thinning  ejecta  (~90  days  after
          explosion).  We infer a departure from spherical symmetry of at
          least  30  per cent for the inner ejecta. Combined with earlier
          results,  this suggests that a strongly non-spherical explosion
          may  be  a  generic  feature of core-collapse supernovae of all
          types, where the asphericity in type II-P supernovae is cloaked
          at early times by the massive, opaque, hydrogen envelope.

          Title: Statistics of the individual-pulse polarization based on
          propagation effects in pulsar magnetosphere
          Authors: S. A. Petrova
          Comments:  15  pages,  6  figures.  Accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          Pulsar  radio  emission  is modelled as a sum of two completely
          polarized non-orthogonal modes with the randomly varying Stokes
          parameters  and  intensity  ratio.  The modes are the result of
          polarization evolution of the original natural waves in the hot
          magnetized weakly inhomogeneous plasma of pulsar magnetosphere.
          In  the  course  of  wave mode coupling, the linearly polarized
          natural    waves    acquire    purely   orthogonal   elliptical
          polarizations.  Further  on,  as  the  waves  pass  through the
          cyclotron    resonance,   they   become   non-orthogonal.   The
          pulse-to-pulse   fluctuations   of   the   final   polarization
          characteristics  and  the  intensity  ratio  of  the  modes are
          attributed to the temporal fluctuations in the plasma flow.
          The  model  suggested allows to reproduce the basic features of
          the   one-dimensional  distributions  of  the  individual-pulse
          polarization  characteristics. Besides that, propagation origin
          of  pulsar  polarization  implies a certain correlation between
          the  mode  ellipticity  and  position  angle.  On a qualitative
          level,   for   different   sets  of  parameters,  the  expected
          correlations  appear compatible with the observed ones. Further
          theoretical studies are necessary to establish the quantitative
          correspondence of the model to the observational results and to
          develop  a  technique  of  diagnostics of pulsar plasma on this
          basis.

          Title:   Beta   decay  radiation  signature  from  neutron-rich
          gamma-ray bursts?
          Authors: Soebur Razzaque, Peter Meszaros
          Comments: 11 pages, 2 figures
          Core  collapse  of  massive  stars  and binary neutron stars or
          black  hole-neutron  star binary mergers are likely progenitors
          of  long  and  short  duration  gamma-ray  bursts respectively.
          Neutronized material in the former and neutron star material in
          the  latter  are  ejected  by  the  central  engine  implying a
          neutron-rich  jet outflow. A free neutron, however, beta decays
          to  a  proton, an electron (beta) and an anti-neutrino in about
          fifteen  minutes  in  its  rest  frame.  Sudden  creation  of a
          relativistic  electron  is accompanied by radiation with unique
          temporal   and  spectral  signature.  We  calculate  here  this
          radiation  signature  collectively  emitted  by  all beta decay
          electrons   from   neutron-rich   outflow.  Detection  of  this
          signature may thus provide strong evidence for not only neutron
          but also for proton content in the relativistic gamma-ray burst
          jets.

          Title:  The  effect  of  mass-segregation on gravitational wave
          sources near massive black holes
          Authors: Clovis Hopman, Tal Alexander (Weizmann)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJL
          Gravitational waves (GWs) from the inspiral of compact remnants
          (CRs)  into  massive  black  holes (MBHs) will be observable to
          cosmological   distances.   While   a  CR  spirals  in,  2-body
          scattering  by  field  stars  may cause it to fall into the MBH
          before  reaching  a  short  period  orbit  that  would  give an
          observable  signal.  As a result, only CRs very near (~0.01 pc)
          the  MBH  can  spiral  in successfully. In a multi-mass stellar
          population, the heaviest objects sink to the center, where they
          are  more  likely  to  slowly spiral into the MBH without being
          swallowed  prematurely.  We study how mass-segregation modifies
          the  stellar  distribution  and  the rate of GW events. We find
          that  the  inspiral  rate per galaxy for white dwarfs is 30 per
          Gyr,  for  neutron stars 6 per Gyr, and for stellar black holes
          (SBHs)  250  per  Gyr.  The  high rate for SBHs is due to their
          extremely  steep  density profile, n_{BH}(r)\propto r^{-2}. The
          GW detection rate will be dominated by SBHs.

          We   present   images   taken   with  the  GMOS  instrument  on
          Gemini-South,  in  excellent (<0.5 arcsec) seeing, of SN 2001ig
          in NGC 7424, ~1000 days after explosion. A point source seen at
          the  site  of the SN is shown to have colours inconsistent with
          being  an  H  II  region or a SN 1993J-like remnant, but can be
          matched  to  a  late-B through late-F supergiant with A_V<1. We
          believe this object is the massive binary companion responsible
          for  periodic  modulation  in  mass  loss  material  around the
          Wolf-Rayet  progenitor which gave rise to significant structure

          We  report  the  results  of a prototype photometric search for
          transiting  extrasolar planets using Subaru Suprime-Cam. Out of
          about  100,000  stars monitored around the Galactic plane (l=90
          degree,b=0  degree), we find that 7,700 (27,000) stars show the
          photometric  precision  below  1%  (3%) for 60 second exposures
          which  is  required to detect extrasolar planets by the transit
          method.  Thus  Suprime-Cam  has  the  photometric stability and
          accuracy  required  for a transiting planet survey. During this
          observing   run,   we   detected   three  transiting  planetary
          candidates  (i'-band  magnitude  around  18.5)  which exhibit a
          single full transit-like light curve with a fractional depth of
          <5%.  While  future photometric and/or spectroscopic follow-ups
          remain  to  be  done,  the  estimated  parameters for the three
          systems   are   consistent  with  planetary  companions  around
          main-sequence   stars.  We  also  found  two  eclipsing  binary
          candidates  and  eleven  variable  stars  exhibiting W UMa-like
          light curves.

          The  last  few years have seen the discovery of a number of new

          to  probe  neutron star properties. I discuss what we can learn

          hundreds of years
          Authors: G.Beskin, A.Biryukov, S.Karpov
          Comments: 14 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJL
          The  recent  massive  measurements  of  pulsar frequency second
          derivatives have shown that they are 100-1000 times larger than
          expected for standard pulsar slowdown low. Moreover, the second
          derivatives  as  well  as braking indices are even negative for
          about  half of pulsars. We explain these paradoxical results on
          the  basis  of  the  statistical  analysis  of  the  rotational
          parameters  $\nu$,  $\dot \nu$ and $\ddot \nu$ of the subset of
          295  pulsars taken mostly from the ATNF database. We have found
          strong  correlation  of  $\ddot  \nu$ and $\dot \nu$ either for
          $\ddot\nu  >  0$  (correlation  coefficient  $r\approx0.9$) and
          $\ddot\nu  <  0$  ($r\approx0.85$),  and of $\nu$ and $\dot\nu$
          ($r\approx0.7$).    We    interpret   these   dependencies   as
          evolutionary ones due to $\dot\nu$ being nearly proportional to
          characteristic   age   $\tau_{ch}$.   The  derived  statistical
          relations  as well as "anomalous" values of $\ddot\nu$ are well
          explained  in  the  framework  of  the  simple  model of cyclic
          evolution  of  the  rotational  frequency  of  the  pulsars. It
          combines the secular change of $\nu_{tr}(t)$, $\dot\nu_{tr}(t)$
          and   $\ddot\nu_{tr}(t)$   according  to  the  power  law  with
          $n\approx5$ and harmonic oscillations of 100--1000 years period
          with  an  amplitude  from  $10^{-3}$  Hz  for  young pulsars to
          $10^{-10}$  Hz  for  elder  ones.  The physical nature of these
          cyclic variations of the rotational frequency may be similar to
          the  well-known  red  timing  noise,  however, with much larger
          characteristic time scale.

          Title: TEMPO2, a new pulsar timing package. I: Overview
          Authors: G. Hobbs, R. Edwards, R. Manchester
          Comments: Accepted by MNRAS
          Contemporary   pulsar   timing   experiments   have  reached  a
          sensitivity   level   where  systematic  errors  introduced  by
          existing   analysis  procedures  are  limiting  the  achievable
          science.  We have developed tempo2, a new pulsar timing package
          that   contains   propagation   and   other   relevant  effects
          implemented  at  the  1ns  level of precision (a factor of ~100
          more  precise  than  previously  obtainable).  In contrast with
          earlier  timing  packages, tempo2 is compliant with the general
          relativistic framework of the IAU 1991 and 2000 resolutions and
          hence   uses  the  International  Celestial  Reference  System,
          Barycentric Coordinate Time and up-to-date precession, nutation
          and   polar  motion  models.  Tempo2  provides  a  generic  and
          extensible   set   of   tools   to  aid  in  the  analysis  and
          visualisation  of pulsar timing data. We provide an overview of
          the  timing  model,  its  accuracy  and differences relative to
          earlier  work.  We also present a new scheme for predictive use
          of  the timing model that removes existing processing artifacts
          by properly modelling the frequency dependence of pulse phase.

          (abridged) The review describes observations of SS433. The main
          difference  between  SS433  and  other  X-ray  binaries  is the
          supercritical   regime   for   the   gas   accretion  onto  the
          relativistic star (most likely a black hole), which has lead to
          the  formation  of collimated relativistic jets. The properties
          of  the  jets are determined by their interaction with the disk
          wind.  The  precession  of  the  disk  and jets, as well as the
          eclipsing  in the binary system, make SS433 a unique laboratory
          for  studies  of  mechanisms  for  the  microquasar phenomenon.
          Essentially  all  photometric  and  spectroscopic properties of
          SS433 are determined by the accretion disk and its orientation,
          but  the disk itself is not observed, being located beneath the
          photosphere  of the dense wind. Observational manifestations of
          the  wind  and of gas flows in the system are described. Little
          is  known  about the structure of the central regions where the
          hot bases of the jets are located. The available X-ray, UV, and
          optical  observations point towards the picture where the bases
          of  the  jets  are surrounded by cocoons of hot gas reradiating
          emission  from  the  inner  regions  of the jet channel. Direct
          investigations  of  this channel in the supercritical accretion
          disk  of  SS433  are  not  possible;  however, a similar object
          oriented  face-on  would  likely  be  an extremely bright X-ray
          source,  such as ultra-luminous X-ray sources observed in other
          galaxies.

          Title:  Mass Deficits, Stalling Radii, and the Merger Histories
          of Elliptical Galaxies
          Authors: David Merritt
          Comments: 11 pages, uses emulateapj.sty
          A  binary  supermassive  black  hole  leaves  an  imprint  on a
          galactic nucleus in the form of a "mass deficit," a decrease in
          the mass of the nucleus due to ejection of stars by the binary.
          The  magnitude  of  the mass deficit is in principle related to
          the  galaxy's  merger  history, but the relation has never been
          quantified.  Here, high-accuracy N-body simulations are used to
          calibrate   this  relation.  Mass  deficits  are  shown  to  be
          approximately  0.5M_{12},  with  M_{12}  the  total mass of the
          binary;  the  coefficient  in  this relation is found to depend
          only  weakly  on  the  binary  mass  ratio  or  on the galaxy's
          pre-existing  nuclear  density profile. Hence, after N mergers,
          the  mass  deficit  is  ~0.5 N M_h with M_h the final (current)
          black  hole  mass.  When  compared with observed mass deficits,
          this  result implies between 1 and 3 mergers for most galaxies,
          in   accord   with  hierarchical  structure  formation  models.
          Implications   for   binary   stalling  radii,  the  origin  of
          hyper-velocity  stars,  and  the distribution of dark matter at
          the centers of galaxies are discussed.

          Title: The redshift distribution of short gamma-ray bursts from
          dynamically formed neutron star binaries
          Authors:   Clovis  Hopman,  Dafne  Guetta,  Eli  Waxman,  Simon
          Portegies Zwart
          Comments: Submitted to ApJL
          Short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) may arise from gravitational
          wave  (GW) driven mergers of double neutron star (DNS) systems.
          DNSs  may  be  "primordial"  or  can form dynamically by binary
          exchange    interactions    in    globular    clusters   during
          core-collapse.  For primordial binaries, the time delay between
          formation  and  merger  is  expected  to be short, tau~0.1 Gyr,
          implying that the redshift distribution of merger events should
          follow  that  of  star-formation.  We  point  out here that for
          dynamically  formed DNSs, the time delay between star-formation
          and  merger  is  dominated  by  the cluster core-collapse time,
          rather than by the GW inspiral time, yielding delays comparable
          to  the  Hubble  time.  We  derive the redshift distribution of
          merger events of dynamically formed DNSs, and find it to differ
          significantly  from  that  typically  expected  for  primordial
          binaries.  The  observed  redshift  distribution of SHBs favors
          dynamical  formation,  although  a  primordial origin cannot be
          ruled  out  due  to possible detection biases. Future red-shift
          observations  of  SHBs  may allow to determine whether they are
          dominated by primordial or dynamically formed DNSs.

          Title: Orientation Angles of a Pulsar's Polarization Vector
          Authors: Mark M. McKinnon
          Comments: 14 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          A  statistical  model  of  the  polarization  of  pulsar  radio
          emission  is  used  to  derive  the  general  statistics  of  a
          polarization   vector's  orientation  angles.  The  theoretical
          distributions  are  compared  with orientation angle histograms
          computed  from  single-pulse,  polarization observations of PSR
          B2020+28.  The  favorable agreement between the theoretical and
          measured   distributions   lends   support  to  the  underlying
          assumptions  of  the  statistical model, and demonstrates, like
          recent  work  on other pulsars, that the handedness of circular
          polarization  is  associated  with the radiation's orthogonally
          polarized  modes.  Comprehensive  directional statistics of the
          vector's  orientation angles are also derived, and are shown to
          follow  the  Watson  bipolar  and  Fisher  distributions in its
          limiting forms.

          Title:  Constraining  the  MIT  Bag  Model of Quark Matter with
          Gravitational Wave Observations
          Authors:  Omar  Benhar,  Valeria  Ferrari,  Leonardo Gualtieri,
          Stefania Marassi
          Comments: Four pages, four figures
          Most  theoretical studies of strange stars are based on the MIT
          bag  model  of  quark  matter,  whose  main  parameter, the bag
          constant  B,  is  only loosely constrained by phenomenology. We
          discuss  the  possibility that detection of gravitational waves
          emitted  by  a compact star may provide information on both the
          nature  of the source and the value of B. Our results show that
          the   combined  knowledge  of  the  frequency  of  the  emitted
          gravitational  wave  and of the mass or the radiation radius of
          the source allows one to discriminate between strange stars and
          neutron stars and set stringent bounds on the bag constants.

          We  report on the discovery of hard spectral tails for energies
          above 10 keV in the total and pulsed spectra of anomalous X-ray
          pulsars  1RXS J1708-4009, 4U 0142+61 and 1E 2259+586 using RXTE
          PCA  (2-60  keV)  and HEXTE (15-250 keV) data and INTEGRAL IBIS
          ISGRI  (20-300  keV)  data. Improved spectral information on 1E
          1841-045  is  presented.  The pulsed and total spectra measured
          above  10  keV  have  power-law  shapes  and there is so far no
          significant  evidence  for  spectral breaks or bends up to ~150
          keV.  The  pulsed  spectra  are exceptionally hard with indices
          measured  for 4 AXPs approximately in the range -1.0 -- 1.0. We
          also  reanalyzed  archival  CGRO  COMPTEL (0.75-30 MeV) data to
          search  for  signatures from our set of AXPs. No detections can
          be  claimed,  but  the  obtained  upper-limits  in the MeV band
          indicate  that  for 1RXS J1708-4009, 4U 0142+61 and 1E 1841-045
          strong breaks must occur somewhere between 150 and 750 keV.

          Title: Is PSR B0943+10 a low-mass quark star?
          Authors: Y. L. Yue, X. H. Cui, R. X. Xu
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures
          Recent  X-ray  observation  has  shown that the drifting pulsar
          B0943+10   has   a   much  smaller  polar  cap  area  than  the
          conventional one of pulsars with mass of $\sim\msun$ and radius
          of $\sim10$ km. This leads to conflict with the original vacuum
          gap  model.  The  discrepancy would vanish if PSR B0943+10 is a
          low-mass quark star. It is found that vacuum gap potential drop
          could  be  two  orders  larger  when considering the effects of
          inclination  angle,  and  the  vacuum gap model would therefore
          still work well.

          Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A
          We  present  here  a  series  of  numerical  simulations of the
          development    of    Kelvin-Helmholtz    instability    in    a
          relativistically  hot  plasma.  The  physical parameters in the
          unperturbed  state  are  chosen  to  be representative of local
          conditions  encountered  in  Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe), with a
          main  magnetic  field  perpendicular  to  a mildly relativistic
          shear  layers.  By using a numerical code for Relativistic MHD,
          we  investigate  the  effect  of  an  additional magnetic field
          component  aligned  with  the shear velocity, and we follow the
          evolution  of  the  instability to the saturation and turbulent
          regimes. Based on the resulting flow structure, we then compute
          synchrotron   maps  in  order  to  evaluate  the  signature  of
          Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the emission and we investigate
          how  the  time  scale  and  the  amplitude  of  the synchrotron
          modulations  depend  on  shear  velocity  and  magnetic  field.
          Finally  we  compare  our  results  to  the  observed  variable
          features  in the Crab Nebula. We show that the Kelvin-Helmholtz
          instability  cannot  account  for the wisps variability, but it
          might   be  responsible  for  the  time  dependent  filamentary
          structure observed in the main torus.

          A geometric view of the possible outcomes of elastic collisions
          of  two massive bodies is developed that integrates laboratory,
          center  of  mass, and relative body frames in a single diagram.
          From  these  diagrams  all  the scattering properties of binary
          collisions   can   be   obtained.   The   particular   case  of
          gravitational scattering by a moving massive object corresponds
          to   the  slingshot  maneuver,  and  its  maximum  velocity  is
          obtained.

          Comments: 9 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables
          We  studied  the  turbulence spectrum of the local interstellar
          plasma  in the direction of PSR J0437-4715, on the basis of our
          observations  and  those reported earlier by others. We combine
          these  data  to form a structure function for the variations of
          phase  along  the line of sight to the pulsar. For observations
          that  did  not  report them, we infer modulation indices from a
          theoretical  model.  We find that all of the observations fit a
          power-law  spectrum  of turbulence with index n=3.46+/-0.20. We
          suggest    that   differences   among   reported   values   for
          scintillation  bandwidth  and  timescale  for this pulsar arise
          from  differences  in  observing  parameters.  We  suggest that
          refractive  effects  dominate  for  this  line  of  sight, with
          refraction  angle  about twice the diffraction angle at 330 MHz
          observing  frequency.  We  suggest  that the scattering of this
          pulsar lies in a layer of enhanced turbulence, about 10 pc from
          the   Sun.   We   propose  that  the  flux  variations  of  the
          extragalactic  source PKS 0405-385 arise in the same scattering
          layer.

          High  energy  gamma-ray astronomy has recently made significant
          progresss   through  ground-based  instruments  like  the  {\it
          H.E.S.S.}  array  of  imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.
          The  unprecedented  angular  resolution  and the large field of
          view  has  allowed  to spatially resolve for the first time the
          morphology  of  gamma-ray  sources in the TeV energy range. The
          experimental  technique  is  described and the types of sources
          detected  and  still  expected  are discussed. Selected results
          include  objects  as different as a Galactic binary Pulsar, the
          Galactic  Center  and  Supernova Remnants but they also concern
          the  diffuse  extragalactic  optical/infrared  radiation field.
          Finally,  a  scan  of  the  Galactic plane in TeV gamma rays is
          described  which  has  led  to  a significant number of new TeV
          sources,   many  of  which  are  still  unidentified  in  other
          wavelengths.  The  field  has  a  close  connection  with X-ray
          astronomy  which  allows  the study of the synchrotron emission
          from these very high energy sources.

          Progress in the last decade

          Astronomy and Astrophysics
          A  decade  ago,  there  was  very limited knowledge of magnetic
          fields  of  our  Galaxy. The local fields in the Solar vicinity
          were   known  to  be  directed  towards  a  Galactic  longitude
          $l\sim~90^{\circ}$   with   reversed   directions   at  smaller
          Galacto-radii. The regular field strength was found to be about
          2~$\mu$G.  The  filaments  near  the  Galactic  Center show the
          possible  poloidal fields there. There was no information about
          the magnetic fields in the Galactic halo. In last decade, there
          has  been  significant progress on measurements of the Galactic
          magnetic  fields. In the Galactic disk, from the RMs of a large
          number  of  newly observed pulsars, large-scale magnetic fields
          along  the  spiral  arms  have been delineated in a much larger
          region then ever before, with alternating directions in the arm
          and  interarm regions. The toroidal fields in the Galactic halo
          were  revealed  to have opposite directions below and above the
          Galactic  plane,  which is an indication of A0 dynamo operating
          in  the  halo. The strength of large-scale fields also has been
          found  from pulsar RM data to exponentially increase at smaller
          Galacto-radii.  Compared  to  the  steep Kolmogorov spectrum of
          magnetic  energy  at  small  scales,  the  large-scale magnetic
          fields show a shallow broken spatial magnetic energy spectrum.

          and re-brightening by precessing showering Jets

          Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures, Submitted for pubblication
          A   list   of   puzzles   are   unanswered  by  Fireball  (even
          milli-steradiant  beamed)  explosive GRB and Magnetar spherical
          one-shoot SGR models. The early GRB 980425 and the last longest
          GRB060218  are  the most emblematic GRBs out of the tune of any
          Fireball  cone  models. Too nearby, too soft, too underluminous
          and  too  long  events.  The  huge flare of SGR 1806-20 and its
          radio  rebrightening  disagree  with  Magnetar  model.  Only  a
          persistent,  thin  (even less than micro steradiant) precessing
          and   spinning   gamma  jet  evolution  explains  X-gamma  time
          structure  and  afterglow  bumps.  The late relic neutron star,
          X-ray  pulsar jet, its spinning and precessing lepton-gamma jet
          is  the  candidate  blazing  sources as anomalous X-ray Pulsars
          (AXRPs) and Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters (SGRs). Precessing jet are
          like  SS433 spiral jets. At SN power and in-axis they are GRBs.
          Late (weeks-months) GRB blazing jets are seldom orphan of their
          bright  SN-OT.  The last GRB060218 occurred within its SN2006aj
          smoothly  and  soft  (because  off-axis),  ruled  by  outer jet
          component  and  slow  by  large impact angle. We foresaw OT and
          radio bumps and re-brightening, in analogy to the third nearest
          GRB030329-SN2003  event.  Late  decayed  Jets are XRFs or brief
          GRBs  and mostly in galaxy or Local Group distances as SGRs and
          AXRPs.  Electron  pairs beams are showering and feeding gamma-X
          jet by Synchrotron (or Inverse Compton Scattering) far from the
          dense  SN  star  (or a Neutron Star magnetic fields): energetic
          and penetrating PeVs muon pairs bundle are the progenitors able
          to  escape  the  Supernova  shells  matter  and  photon opacity
          decaying  far  away  into  PeV  electron  pairs (and gamma) and
          neutrinos.  The  mysterious  GRBs  (and  SGRs) are not the most
          explosive event of the Universe, but just the most beamed ones.

          Title:   Submillimeter   corrections   to   gravity   and   the
          metastability of white dwarf and neutron stars
          Authors: Mofazzal Azam, M. Sami
          Comments: 5 pages, no figures
          The   string   inspired  higher  dimensional  theories  suggest
          modification  of  Newton's  law at submillimeter length scales.
          Inter-particle  distances  in white dwarf and neutron stars are
          $10^{-10}  cms$ and $10^{-13} cms$ respectively, and therefore,
          the effects of of short distance corrections to gravity deserve
          investigation.  We  show,  by  carrying out explicit analytical
          many-body  calculations  that,  in the presence of corrections,
          the  normal state of these compact stars become metastable. The
          actual  quantum  mechanical ground state of the stars turns out
          to  be  unstable.  However,  the  tunneling  probability to the
          unstable  ground  state  is  so small that the stars may remain
          trapped in the metastable state practically for ever.

          Title: Magnetic Field Structure from Synchrotron Polarization
          Authors: Rainer Beck (MPI fuer Radioastronomie, Bonn, Germany)

          Publications Series
          Total  magnetic  fields in spiral galaxies, as observed through
          their  total  synchrotron emission, are strongest (up to \simeq
          30\mu  G)  in the spiral arms. The degree of radio polarization
          is  low;  the  field  in  the  arms must be mostly turbulent or
          tangled. Polarized synchrotron emission shows that the resolved
          regular  fields are generally strongest in the interarm regions
          (up  to  \simeq  15\mu  G),  sometimes  forming 'magnetic arms'
          parallel  to the optical arms. The field structure is spiral in
          almost  every  galaxy,  even in flocculent and bright irregular
          types which lack spiral arms. The observed large-scale patterns
          of  Faraday  rotation in several massive spiral galaxies reveal
          coherent   regular  fields,  as  predicted  by  dynamo  models.
          However, in most galaxies observed so far no simple patterns of
          Faraday  rotation  could be found. Either many dynamo modes are
          superimposed  and cannot be resolved by present-day telescopes,
          or  most of the apparently regular field is in fact anisotropic
          random,   with   frequent   reversals,   due  to  shearing  and
          compressing  gas  flows.  In  galaxies  with  massive bars, the
          polarization  pattern  follows  the  gas  flow. However, around
          strong  shocks in bars, the compression of the regular field is
          much  lower  than  that of the gas; the regular field decouples
          from  the  cold  gas and is strong enough to affect the flow of
          the  diffuse  warm  gas.  --  The average strength of the total
          magnetic  field  in  the  Milky  Way is 6\mu G near the sun and
          increases  to  20-40\mu  G  in  the Galactic center region. The
          Galactic  field  is mostly parallel to the plane, except in the
          center  region.  Rotation  measure  data  from pulsars indicate
          several  field  reversals,  unlike  external galaxies, but some
          reversals could be due to distortions of the nearby field.

          Comments: Submitted to ApJ, 16 pages, 3 color figures
          We  report  recent  Chandra  observations  of  the  ULX  in the
          elliptical   galaxy   NGC3379  that  clearly  detect  two  flux
          variability  cycles.  Comparing  these  data  with  the Chandra
          observation  of  ~5yr  ago, we measure a flux modulation with a
          period   of  ~12.6hr.  Moreover,  we  find  that  the  emission
          undergoes  a correlated spectral modulation, becoming softer at
          low  flux. We argue that our results establish this source as a
          ULX binary in NGC3379. Given the old stellar population of this
          galaxy,  the  ULX  is  likely  to  be a soft transient, however
          historical  X-ray  sampling  suggests that the current on phase
          has  lasted  ~10yr.  We discuss our results in terms of ADC and
          wind-feedback  models.  We constrain the donor mass and orbital
          period  at  the  onset  of  mass  transfer within 1.15-1.4M and
          12.5-16hr,  respectively.  The  duration  of  the mass-transfer
          phase  so  far is probably ~1Gyr and the binary has been a soft
          X-ray  transient  throughout  this  time. These constraints are
          insensitive to the mass of the accretor.

          Title: Microlensing modulation by binaries
          Authors: Florian Dubath, Maria Alice Gasparini, Ruth Durrer
          We  compute  the effect of the lens quadrupole on microlensing.
          The  time  dependence  of  the  quadrupole can lead to specific
          modulations  of  the  amplification signal. We study especially
          binary   system   lenses  in  our  galaxy.  The  modulation  is
          observable if the rotation period of the system is smaller than
          the time over which the amplification is significant and if the
          impact parameter of the passing light ray is sufficiently close
          to the Einstein radius so that the amplification is very large.
          Observations   of   this   modulation   can   reveal  important
          information  on  the  quadrupole  and thus on the gravitational
          radiation emitted by the lens.

          Title: Momentum constraint relaxation
          Authors: Pedro Marronetti

          references  added.  More detailed description of the algorithms
          are provided. Final published version
          Journal-ref: Class. Quantum Grav. 23 (2006) 2681-2695
          Full  relativistic  simulations  in three dimensions invariably
          develop   runaway   modes   that  grow  exponentially  and  are
          accompanied  by  violations  of  the  Hamiltonian  and momentum
          constraints.   Recently,   we  introduced  a  numerical  method
          (Hamiltonian  relaxation)  that greatly reduces the Hamiltonian
          constraint  violation  and  helps  improve  the  quality of the
          numerical  model.  We  present  here a method that controls the
          violation  of  the  momentum constraint. The method is based on
          the  addition  of  a  longitudinal  component  to the traceless
          extrinsic  curvature  generated  by  a vector potential w_i, as
          outlined  by  York.  The components of w_i are relaxed to solve
          approximately the momentum constraint equations, pushing slowly
          the  evolution  toward the space of solutions of the constraint
          equations.  We  test  this  method  with  simulations of binary
          neutron  stars  in  circular  orbits  and show that effectively
          controls  the  growth of the aforementioned violations. We also
          show  that  a full numerical enforcement of the constraints, as
          opposed  to  the  gentle  correction of the momentum relaxation
          scheme,  results  in the development of instabilities that stop
          the runs shortly.

          Light  curves  of  the  long-period  Algols are known for their
          complex  shape  (asymmetry  in  the  eclipse,  light variations
          outside   eclipse,  changes  from  cycle-to-cycle),  and  their
          interpretation  is not possible in the standard model of binary
          stars. Complex structures present in these active Algol systems
          could  be  studied  with  the  eclipse-mapping method which was
          successfully   applied   to   the   new   7-color   photometric
          observations  in  the  Geneva system of W Cru, belonging to the
          isolated  group  of these active Algols. Several cycles of this
          long-period  (198.5 days) eclipsing binary have been covered by
          observations.  We have used a modified Rutten's approach to the
          eclipse-mapping.  The  optimization  of the system's parameters
          and  the  recovery  of  the  disk  intensity  distribution  are
          performed  using  a  genetic algorithm (GA). It is found that a
          hot  component  is  hidden  in  the  thick accretion disk which
          confirms previous findings. The mass of the component, M1 = 8.2
          Ms  indicates  that  it  is  a mid-B type star. The mass-losing
          component  is  filling  its  critical  lobe which means it is a
          G-type  supergiant  with  a  mass  M2  =  1.6  Ms.  The disk is
          geometrically  very  extended and its outer radius is about 80%
          of the primary's critical lobe. A reconstructed image reveals a
          rather  clumpy  and  nonuniform  brightness  distribution of an
          accretion  disk  rim  in  this almost edge-on seen system. This
          clumpyness   accounts   for   light   curve   distortions   and
          asymmetries, as well as for secular changes.

          Title:  Consistency  between  deep  crustal  heating of strange
          stars in superbursters and soft X-ray transients
          Authors: Morten Stejner, Jes Madsen (University of Aarhus)
          Comments: Submitted to A&A
          Both  superbursters and soft X-ray transients probe the process
          of deep crustal heating in compact stars. It was recently shown
          that  the  transfer  of  matter from crust to core in a strange
          star can heat the crust and ignite superbursts provided certain
          constraints  on  the strange quark matter equation of state are
          fulfilled.  We derive corresponding constraints on the equation
          of  state  for  soft  X-ray transients assuming their quiescent
          emission  is  powered  in the same way, and further discuss the
          time dependence of this heating mechanism in transient systems.
          We  approach  this  using  a simple parametrized model for deep
          crustal heating in strange stars assuming slow neutrino cooling
          in  the core and blackbody photon emission from the surface.The
          constraints  derived  for  hot  frequently accreting soft X-ray
          transients  are always consistent with those for superbursters.
          The  colder  sources are consistent for low values of the quark
          matter   binding   energy,   heat   conductivity  and  neutrino
          emissivity.  The heating mechanism is very time dependent which
          may  help  to  explain cold sources with long recurrence times.
          Thus  deep  crustal  heating  in  strange  stars  can provide a
          consistent   explanation   for  superbursters  and  soft  X-ray
          transients.

          Comments: Submitted to Nature on 20 March 2006
          Observations  and  models  of  SN  2006aj, while bringing fresh
          evidence of the connection between long Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs)
          and Supernovae (SNe), suggest that there is variety among these
          events.   The  previously  well  observed  cases  (GRB980425/SN
          1998bw,  GRB030329/SN  2003dh,  GRB031203/SN  2003lw)  could be
          explained as the prompt collapse to a black hole of the core of
          a  massive  star (M ~ 40 Msun) that had lost its outer hydrogen
          and  helium  envelopes.  All  these SNe exhibited strong oxygen
          lines,  thus  being  classified  as Type Ic, and their energies
          were  much  larger  than  those  of typical SNe. The case of SN
          2006aj/GRB060218  appears  different: the GRB was weak and soft
          (an  X-Ray  Flash,  XRF);  the  SN  is dimmer and has very weak
          oxygen  lines,  suggesting  a  "Type  Ic/d" classification. The
          explosion  energy  of SN 2006aj was smaller, as was the ejected
          mass. In our model, the progenitor star had a smaller mass than
          other  GRB/SNe  (M  ~  20 Msun), suggesting that a neutron star
          rather  than  a  black  hole was formed. If the nascent neutron
          star was strongly magnetized (a so-called magnetar) and rapidly
          spinning,  it may launch a weak GRB or an XRF. At a later phase
          of its life, the neutron star may give rise to short GRBs.

          Journal-ref: Astrophysical Journal, 2006, V. 637, P.1010-1015
          It  is  shown  that the drift waves near the light cylinder can
          cause  the modulation of the emission with periods of the order
          several  seconds.  These  periods explain the intervals between
          successive  pulses  observed  in  "magnetars" and radio pulsars
          with  long  periods.  The  model  under  consideration makes it
          possible  to  calculate  the  real rotation periods of the host
          neutron  stars.  They  are less than 1 sec for the investigated
          objects. The magnetic fields at the surface of the neutron star
          of  the  order  10^(11)-10^(13) G and equal to the usual fields

          March 2006
          We  have carried out a detailed abundance analysis for a sample
          of  16  carbon stars found among candidate extremely metal-poor
          (EMP)  stars  from  the  Hamburg/ESO  Survey.  We find that the
          Fe-metallicities  for  the  cooler  C-stars (Teff ~ 5100K) have
          been  underestimated  by  a  factor  of ~10 by the standard HES
          survey  tools.  The  results  presented  here  provided crucial
          supporting  data  used  by  Cohen  et  al  (2006) to derive the
          frequency of C-stars among EMP stars.
          C-enhancement in these EMP C-stars appears to be independent of
          Fe-metallicity  and  approximately  constant  at ~1/5 the solar
          C/H.  The  mostly  low  C12/C13  ratios  (~4)  and  the  high N
          abundances  in  many of these stars suggest that material which
          has been through proton burning via the CN cycle comprises most
          of  the  stellar  envelope.  C-enhancement  is  associated with
          strong  enrichment of heavy nuclei beyond the Fe-peak for 12 of
          the 16 stars. The remaining C-stars from the HES, which tend to
          be  the most Fe-metal poor, show no evidence for enhancement of
          the heavy elements. Very high enhancements of lead are detected
          in  some of the C-stars with highly enhanced Ba. (We show that)
          the  s-process  is responsible for the enhancement of the heavy
          elements for the majority of the C-stars in our sample.
          We  suggest  that both the s-process rich and Ba-normal C-stars
          result  from  phenomena associated with mass transfer in binary
          systems. This leads directly to the progression from C-stars to
          CH  stars and then to Ba stars as the Fe-metallicity increases.

          discussion  added  about  formation and evolution of Z(3)domain
          walls in the universe
          We   discuss   the   possibility   of   generation   of  baryon
          inhomogeneities  in  a  quark-gluon  plasma phase due to moving
          Z(3)  interfaces.  By modeling the dependence of effective mass
          of  the  quarks  on the Polyakov loop order parameter, we study
          the  reflection  of  quarks from collapsing Z(3) interfaces and
          estimate resulting baryon inhomogeneities in the context of the
          early  universe.  We  argue  that in the context of certain low
          energy  scale  inflationary  models,  it is possible that large
          Z(3) walls arise at the end of the reheating stage. Collapse of
          such  walls  could  lead to baryon inhomogeneities which may be
          separated  by  large distances near the QCD scale. Importantly,
          the  generation  of these inhomogeneities is insensitive to the
          order,  or  even  the  existence,  of  the  quark-hadron  phase
          transition.   We   also  briefly  discuss  the  possibility  of
          formation  of  quark  nuggets  in this model, as well as baryon
          inhomogeneity generation in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

          We  update  the  systematic studies of circular polarization in
          integrated pulse profiles by Han et al (1998). Data of circular
          polarization  profiles  are compiled. Sense reversals can occur
          in  core  or  cone components, or near the intersection between
          components.  The  correlation  between  the  sense  of circular
          polarization  and  the  sense  of  position angle variation for
          conal-double  pulsars  is confirmed with a much large database.
          Circular  polarization  of  some pulsars has clear changes with
          frequency.  Circular  polarization  of  millisecond  pulsars is
          marginally different from that of normal pulsars.

          Title:  CB17:  Inferring  the dynamical history of a prestellar
          core with chemo-dynamical models
          Authors: Ya. Pavlyuchenkov, D. Wiebe, R. Launhardt, Th. Henning
          Comments: ApJ, in press
          We  present  a  detailed  theoretical study of the isolated Bok
          globule  CB17  (L1389)  based  on spectral maps of CS, HCO$^+$,
          C$^{18}$O,    C$^{34}$S,    and    H$^{13}$CO$^+$    lines.   A
          phenomenological   model   of   prestellar  core  evolution,  a
          time-dependent   chemical   model,  and  a  radiative  transfer
          simulation  for molecular lines are combined to reconstruct the
          chemical and kinematical structure of this core. We developed a
          general  criterion  that  allows  to  quantify  the  difference
          between  observed  and  simulated  spectral maps. By minimizing
          this  difference, we find that very high and very low values of
          the  effective sticking probability $S$ are not appropriate for
          the  studied  prestellar  core. The most probable $S$ value for
          CB17  is  0.3--0.5. The spatial distribution of the intensities
          and  self-absorption  features  of  optically  thick  lines  is
          indicative   of   UV   irradiation  of  the  core.  By  fitting
          simultaneously  optically thin and optically thick transitions,
          we isolate the model that reproduces all the available spectral
          maps  to  a  reasonable accuracy. The line asymmetry pattern in
          CB17  is  reproduced  by a combination of infall, rotation, and
          turbulent  motions  with  velocities  $\sim0.05$  km  s$^{-1}$,
          $\sim0.1$ km s$^{-1}$, and $\sim0.1$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively.
          These   parameters   corresponds   to   energy  ratios  $E_{\rm
          rot}/E_{\rm     grav}\approx0.03$,     $E_{\rm    therm}/E_{\rm
          grav}\approx0.8$,  and  $E_{\rm  turb}/E_{\rm grav}\approx0.05$
          (the  rotation parameters are determined for $i=90^\circ$). The
          chemical  age  of the core is about 2 Myrs. In particular, this
          is  indicated  by the central depletion of CO, CS, and HCO$^+$.
          Based  on the angular momentum value, we argue that the core is
          going  to  fragment,  i.e.,  to  form a binary (multiple) star.

          the  star-forming  complex  L1551  in Taurus. All stars present
          significant  variability on the five-day time scale. Modulation
          of  the  light  curve on time scales comparable with the star's
          rotational  period  appeared  to  be present in the case of one
          weak-lined   T  Tauri  star.  Significant  spectral  variations
          between the 2000 and the 2004 observations were detected in the
          (unresolved)  classical  T  Tauri  binary  system XZ Tau: a hot
          plasma  component  which  was  present in the X-ray spectrum in
          2000  had  significantly  weakened  in  2004.  As  XZ Tau N was
          undergoing  a  strong  optical  outburst  in  2000,  which  had
          terminated   since   then,   we   speculate   on  the  possible
          relationship  between  episodic,  burst  accretion,  and  X-ray
          heating.  The transition object HL Tau underwent a strong flare
          with a complex temperature evolution, which is indicative of an
          event  confined  within  a  very  large magnetic structure (few
          stellar  radii), similar to the ones found in YSOs in the Orion
          Nebula Cluster.

          Title:   Curious   Variables   Experiment   (CURVE).   Variable
          properties of the dwarf nova SS UMi
          Authors:  A. Olech, K. Mularczyk, P. Kedzierski, K. Zloczewski,
          M. Wisniewski, K. Szaruga

          Astrophysics
          We  report  on  extensive photometry of the dwarf nova SS Ursae
          Minoris  throughout  nine months of 2004. In total, we recorded
          two  superoutbursts and 11 normal outbursts of the star. SS UMi
          has  been  known  to  show  frequent superoutbursts with a mean
          interval  of  84.7  days.  Our  data  suggest that the interval
          between  successive  superoutbursts  lengthened  to  197  days,
          indicating  that  SS UMi entered a period of untypical behavior
          manifested  by  a growth in the quiescent magnitude of the star
          and  a  series  of  frequent,  low-amplitude,  normal outbursts
          observed from July to September 2004.
          The   mean   superhump   period  derived  for  the  April  2004
          superoutburst  of  SS  UMi  is 0.070149(16) days (101.015 min).
          Combining   this   value   with   an   earlier  orbital  period
          determination,  we were able to derive the period excess, which
          is  equal  to  3.5 +/- 1.6%, and estimate the mass ratio of the
          binary system as equal to q=0.16 +/- 0.07.
          During the entire superoutburst, the period decreased at a rate
          of  $\dot  P/P_{\rm  sh}  = -6.3(1.4) \times 10^{-5}$. However,
          detailed  analysis  of  the timings of superhump maxima seem to
          suggest  a  more  complex period change, with a decrease in the
          period  during  the  first and last stages of the superoutburst
          but an increase in the middle interval.

          Title:  Effects of color superconductivity on the nucleation of
          quark matter in neutron stars
          Authors: I. Bombaci, G. Lugones, I. Vidana
          Comments:  Submitted  to A&A. 8 pages and 6 Figures. Structured
          abstract following A&A format
          We  study the nucleation of quark matter drops at the center of
          cold  deleptonized  neutron  stars.  This  is  relevant  in the
          determination  of  the critical mass $M_{cr}$ of hadronic stars
          above  which  it  is  possible  a  transition  to  a quark star
          (strange  or hybrid). We investigate the dependence of $M_{cr}$
          upon  the  parameters of the quark model (the Bag constant $B$,
          the  pairing  gap $\Delta$, and the surface tension $\sigma$ of
          the  quark-hadron interphase) and for different parametrization
          of  the hadronic equations of state. The dependence of $M_{cr}$
          on  $B$, $\Delta$ and $\sigma$ is mild if the parameters of the
          quark  model  correspond  to  hybrid  stars, and strong if they
          correspond  to strange stars. For a large part of the parameter
          space  corresponding to hybrid stars, the critical mass is very
          close  (but  smaller  than) the maximum mass of hadronic stars,
          and  therefore  compatible with a "mixed" population of compact
          stars  (pure  hadronic up to the critical mass and hybrid above
          the  critical  mass).  For  very large $B$ the critical mass is
          never smaller than the maximum mass of hadronic stars, implying
          that   quark   stars  cannot  form  through  the  here  studied
          mechanism.  The  energy released in the conversion is $3 \times
          10^{52}$ erg - $4 \times 10^{53}$ erg, i.e. sufficient to power
          a gamma ray burst.

          Title:  A  remark  on  ``On the Formation and Progenitor of PSR
          J0737-3039:  New Constraints on the Supernova Explosion Forming
          Pulsar B" by Willems et al., 
astro-ph/0602024
          Authors: Tsvi Piran, Nir J. Shaviv
          Shortly after the discovery of the binary system PSR J0737-3039
          we  predicted  that  it has a small proper motion and suggested
          that  this  implies  that  the  progenitor  mass of the younger
          pulsar  (B)  must be around 1.45M_sun. This is in contradiction
          to  standard  evolutionary  scenarios  that  suggest  a He-star
          progenitor  with  M  >2.1-2.3M_sun  and  in sharp contrast to a
          velocity  of ~100 km/s predicted by these models. It requires a
          new  previously  unseen  type  of  gravitational  collapse. Our
          (generally  ignored)  prediction  of  a low peculiar motion was
          confirmed later by pulsar timing observations that found v_\bot
          <  30  km/s.  Recently  Willems et al. put forward an elaborate
          simulation  suggesting that in spite of these observations, the
          most   likely  natal  kick  is  large  (50-170  km/s)  and  the
          corresponding  most likely progenitor mass is large as well. We
          refute  this  claim  and  show  that  Willems et al. implicitly
          assume the result that they obtain.

          Title:  The Orbital Period of the Ultraluminous X-ray Source in
          M82
          Authors: Philip Kaaret, Melanie G. Simet, Cornelia C. Lang
          Comments: 3 pages, appeared in Science
          Journal-ref:  Science  27  January 2006: Vol. 311. no. 5760, p.
          491
          The ultraluminous x-ray source (ULX) in the galaxy M82 has been
          identified  as a possible intermediate-mass black hole. We have
          found  that  the  x-ray  flux  from  M82  is  modulated  with a
          peak-to-peak amplitude corresponding to an isotropic luminosity
          of  2.4x10^40  erg/s  in M82 and a period of 62.0 +/- 2.5 days,
          which  we  interpret  as  the orbital period of the ULX binary.
          This  orbital period implies that the mass-donor star must be a
          giant  or  supergiant. Large mass-transfer rates, sufficient to
          fuel  the  ULX, are expected for a giant-phase mass donor in an
          x-ray  binary. The giant phase has a short lifetime, indicating
          that we see the ULX in M82 in a brief and unusual period of its
          evolution.

          Title: Discovery of an Optically Thick, Edge-on Disk around the
          Herbig Ae star PDS 144N

          We  have  discovered  an optically thick, edge-on circumstellar
          disk  around  a  Herbig  Ae  star in the binary system PDS 144,
          providing  the  first  intermediate-mass  analog  of HK Tau and
          similar T Tauris. This system consists of a V ~ 13 mag. primary
          and  a  fainter  companion,  with spectra of both stars showing
          evidence for circumstellar disks and accretion; both stars were
          classified  as  Herbig Aes by the Pico dos Dias survey. In Lick
          adaptive  optics  polarimetry,  we  resolved extended polarized
          light  scattered  from  dust around the northern star. Followup
          Keck  adaptive  optics  and mid-infrared observations show that
          this  star is entirely hidden by an optically thick disk at all
          wavelengths  from  1.2  to  11.7  microns.  The disk major axis
          subtends  ~  0.8"  on  the  sky, corresponding to ~ 800 AU at a
          distance of 1000 pc. Bright "wings" extend 0.3" above and below
          the disk ansae, due most likely to scattering from the edges of
          an  outflow  cavity in a circumstellar envelope. We discuss the
          morphology of the disk and the spectral energy distributions of
          the  two  PDS  144  stars, present preliminary disk models, and
          identify  a number of open questions regarding this fascinating
          system.

          Effects in the Perturbed Keplerian Motion
          Authors: László Á. Gergely, Zoltán Keresztes, Balázs Mikóczi
          Binary  systems  subject  to  generic  perturbations  evolve on
          quasiperiodic  orbits.  We  derive  the  most  generic class of
          perturbations   (including   both   the   Brumberg   force  and
          gravitational  radiation reaction to sufficiently high orders),
          which allow to evaluate secular effects via generalized complex
          true  and  eccentric  anomaly parameters, by use of the residue
          theorem. We illustrate the power of the method by computing the
          self-spin  contributions  to  the gravitational luminosity of a
          compact binary.

          Fragment Production
          Authors: S. G. Mashnik, K. K. Gudima, M. I. Baznat
          Comments: 30 pages, 19 figures
          This paper presents part of an internal LANL Progress Report on
          completion  of  the  "S"  and  "G"  versions  of  the  improved
          Cascade-Exciton Model (CEM03.01) and the Los Alamos Quark-Gluon
          String  Model  (LAQGSM.03.01)  codes. The "S" versions consider
          fragmentation   of   compound   nuclei   produced   after   the
          preequilibrium stage of reactions for excitation energies above
          2A  MeV using the Statistical Multifragmentation Model (SMM) by
          Botvina  et  al.  ("S"  stands for SMM), while the "G" versions
          describe  evaporation/fission  stages  of  reactions  using the
          fission-like  binary-decay  model GEMINI of Charity et al. ("G"
          stands  for  GEMINI)  instead  of  using  the  the  Generalized
          Evaporation  Model  GEM2  of  Furihata  incorporated  into  the
          standard  versions  of these codes. We present here an analysis
          of  the  recent  660  MeV  p + 129I and 3.65 GeV p + 112Sn JINR
          measurements,  of  the  new COSY data on 1.2 GeV p + (13 nuclei
          from Al to Th), of the 300 MeV and 1 GeV p + 56Fe data measured
          at  GSI  in  inverse  kinematics,  and of the new GSI data on 1
          GeV/nucleon  124Xe  and  136Xe  +  Pb. To better understand the
          mechanisms   of   fragment   production,   we  discuss  several
          calculated  but  not-yet-measured  kinematic characteristics of
          products  of  these  reactions, which are predicted to be quite
          different  by  SMM,  GEMINI,  and GEM2. We find these kinematic
          quantities  to  be  potentially useful in differentiating these
          reaction   mechanisms   if  they  can  be  measured  in  future
          experiments.

          The  first  observations  conducted as part of the Chandra ACIS
          survey  of M 33 (ChASeM33) sampled the eclipsing X-ray binary M
          33  X-7 over a large part of the 3.45 d orbital period and have
          resolved  eclipse  ingress  and  egress for the first time. The
          occurrence  of  the  X-ray  eclipse  allows  us to determine an
          improved  ephemeris  of  mid-eclipse  and  binary period as HJD
          (2453639.119+-0.005)  +- N x (3.453014+-0.000020) and constrain
          the  eclipse  half  angle  to  (26.5+-1.1)  degree.  There  are
          indications  for  a shortening of the orbital period. The X-ray
          spectrum is best described by a disk blackbody spectrum typical
          for  black  hole  X-ray  binaries in the Galaxy. We find a flat
          power  density  spectrum  and no significant regular pulsations
          were  found  in  the frequency range of 10^{-4} to 0.15 Hz. HST
          WFPC2  images  resolve  the  optical  counterpart, which can be
          identified  as  an  O6III  star with the help of extinction and
          colour  corrections derived from the X-ray absorption. Based on
          the  optical light curve, the mass of the compact object in the
          system most likely exceeds 9 M_sun. This mass, the shape of the
          X-ray  spectrum  and  the  short  term  X-ray  time variability
          identify  M  33 X-7 as the first eclipsing black hole high mass
          X-ray binary.

          Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, submitted to MNRAS
          We  report  the  discovery  of  an X-ray transient, observed in
          outburst  with  XMM-Newton on March 20, 2003, and with position
          18h12m27.8s,  -18  12  34  (J2000, approximate positional error
          2"). No known source is present at this position and the source
          was not detected during published ROSAT or ASCA observations of
          that  region.  However,  the  source  may  be  associated  with
          1H1812-182  detected  by HEAO 1, although the error bars on the
          HEAO  1  position are very large and the two sources could also
          be    unrelated.   Therefore,   we   name   the   source   XMMU
          J181227.8-181234.  Initially, the source was not detected using
          the  All-Sky  Monitor  (ASM)  on-board  the  Rossi X-ray Timing
          Explorer,  however, reprocessing of the ASM data shows that the
          source  was  in  fact  detected  and it was active for about 50
          days.  The  X-ray  spectrum of this transient is fitted equally
          well by an absorbed power-law (with a spectral index of 2.5) or
          multi-colour  disk  blackbody model (with kT ~ 2 keV), where we
          find   that  the  source  is  highly  absorbed.  We  detect  an
          unabsorbed  0.5-10  keV flux in the range (2-5)E-9 ergs cm^{-2}
          s^{-1},  which  at  a distance of 8 kpc corresponds to a 0.5-10
          keV  luminosity  of  (1-4)E37  ergs  s^{-1}. No pulsations were
          detected  by  timing analysis. A colour-colour diagram from ASM
          data of different accreting objects suggests that the transient
          is  a  high-mass X-ray binary, as is also suggested by the high
          absorption  compared  to  the average interstellar value in the
          direction  of the source. However, the power-law spectral index
          is  far  more  typical of a low-mass X-ray binary. Thus, we are
          unable to conclusively identify the nature of the transient. We
          also  report  on  three  sources  first  detected  by  the ASCA
          Galactic Plane Survey that are close to this transient.

          We  present  the results of optical identification of two X-ray

          Russian-Turkish   1.5-m  Telescope  (RTT150)  and  SWIFT  X-ray
          observations,  we  show  that  these  sources most probably are
          intermediate  polars,  i.e. binary systems with accreting white
          dwarfs   with   not  very  strong  magnetic  field  (<~10  MG).
          Periodical  oscillations of optical emission with periods 480 s
          and 570 s were found. We argue that these periods most probably
          correspond to the rotating periods of the white dwarfs in these
          systems.  Further optical observations scheduled at RTT150 will
          allow to study the parameters of these systems in more detail.

          initial stages of the outburst the hot object was characterized
          by the two-temperature spectrum (a warm stellar radiation and a
          strong  nebular  emission) with signatures of a mass-outflow at
          moderate   (100-200   km/s)  and  very  high  (1000-2000  km/s)
          velocities.  The  corresponding  structure  of  the  hot object

          material  encompassing  the accretor at the orbital plane and a
          fast  optically  thin  wind  over  the remainder of the star. A
          striking  similarity  of  [FeVII]6087  and  Raman 6825 profiles
          at/after the dilution of the disk suggested their origin within

          The   XMM-Newton  spectra  of  the  isolated  neutron  star  RX
          J0720.4-3125  obtained  over  4.5  years  can  be  described by
          sinusoidal  variations  in  the inferred blackbody temperature,
          the  size  of the emitting area and the depth of the absorption
          line with a period of 7.1 +/- 0.5 years, which we suggest to be
          the  precession  period  of  the  neutron star. Precession of a
          neutron  star  with  two hot spots of different temperature and
          size,  probably not located exactly in antipodal positions, may
          account for the variations in the X-ray spectra, changes in the
          pulsed  fraction,  shape  of  the light curve and the phase-lag
          between   soft   and   hard   energy  bands  observed  from  RX
          J0720.4-3125.  An  independent  sinusoidal fit to published and
          new  pulse  timing  residuals from a coherent analysis covering
          ~12  years  yields  a  consistent  period  of 7.7 +/- 0.6 years
          supporting the precession model.

          Title:   Jet-dominated   advective  systems:  radio  and  X-ray
          luminosity dependence on the accretion rate
          Authors:    Elmar    Koerding    (Southampton),    Rob   Fender
          (Southampton), Simone Migliari (UCSD)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  present  a  novel  method  to measure the accretion rate of
          radio emitting X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei
          (AGN) independently of the X-ray luminosity. The radio emission
          of  the  jet  is used as a tracer for the accretion rate and is
          normalised using sources of known accretion rates: island state
          neutron  stars and efficiently radiating black holes close to a
          state  transition.  We show that the radio power in black holes
          and neutron stars is comparable for a given mass accretion rate
          and  verify  empirically  the  assumed  analytic scaling of the
          radio  luminosity with accretion rate. As our accretion measure
          is  independent  of  the  X-ray luminosities, we can search for
          radiatively  inefficient  accretion in black holes by comparing
          the X-ray luminosities with the accretion rate in XRBs and AGN.
          While  the  X-ray  luminosity  of efficiently radiating objects
          scales  linearly with accretion rate, the scaling of hard state
          black  holes  is  quadratical,  in  agreement  with theoretical
          models.   We  show  that  the  turnover  from  the  inefficient
          quadratic  scaling  to  the  linear  scaling  has  to  occur at
          accretion  rates  of 1-10 % Eddington both in XRBs and AGN. The
          comparison of both accretion states supports the idea that in a
          black  hole  in the hard state some accretion power is advected
          into  the  black  hole  while  the  jet power exceeds the X-ray
          luminosity:   these   are   therefore  jet-dominated  advective
          systems.

          Title:  Magnetic  Field Decay and Period Evolution of Anomalous
          X-Ray Pulsars in the Context of Quark Stars
          Authors: Brian Niebergal, Rachid Ouyed, Denis Leahy
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures
          We  discuss  a  model  wherein soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs),
          anomalous  X-ray  pulsars  (AXPs),  and  radio  quiet  isolated
          neutron  stars  (RQINSs)  are  all  compact  objects exhibiting
          superconductivity,   namely   quark  stars.  In  particular  we
          calculate  the  magnetic  field  decay  due to the expulsion of
          spin-induced vortices from the star's
          superconducting-superfluid    interior,   and   the   resultant
          spin-down   rate.   We   find   that,  for  initial  parameters
          characteristic   of   AXPs/SGRs   ($10^{13}<B<10^{14}  \rm{G}$;
          $3<P<12  \rm{s}$),  the  magnetic  field  strengths and periods
          remain  unchanged  within a factor of two for timescales of the
          order  of  $5\times  10^{5}  - 5\times 10^{7} \rm{yrs}$ given a
          quark  star of radius $10 \rm{km}$. Within these timescales, we
          show  that  the  observed  period  clustering  in RQINSs can be
          explained by compactness, as well as calculate how the magnetic
          field  and  period  evolve  in  a  manner concurrent with RQINS
          observations.

          Title:  Quark  deconfinement in neutron star cores: The effects
          of spin-down
          Authors: Jan Staff, Rachid Ouyed, Prashanth Jaikumar
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ApJL
          We  study  the role of spin-down in driving quark deconfinement
          in  the  high  density core of isolated neutron stars. Assuming
          spin-down  to  be  solely  due  to  magnetic braking, we obtain
          typical  timescales  to  quark  deconfinement for neutron stars
          that  are  born with Keplerian frequencies. Employing different
          equations  of state (EOS), we determine the minimum and maximum
          neutron  star  masses  that  will  allow  for deconfinement via
          spin-down only. We find that the time to reach deconfinement is
          strongly  dependent on the magnetic field and that this time is
          least  for  EOS  that  support the largest minimum mass at zero
          spin, unless rotational effects on stellar structure are large.
          For a fiducial critical density of $5\rho_0$ for the transition
          to  the  quark  phase ($\rho_0=2.5\times10^{14}$g/cm$^3$ is the
          saturation  density  of  nuclear  matter), we find that neutron
          stars  lighter  than  $1.5M_{\odot}$  cannot reach a deconfined
          phase.  Depending  on  the  EOS,  neutron  stars  of  more than
          $1.5M_{\odot}$  can  enter  a  quark  phase  only  if  they are
          spinning  faster  than  about  3  milliseconds as observed now,
          whereas  larger spin periods imply that they are either already
          quark stars or will never become one.

          2006
          We present a unified explanation for the observed properties of
          the isolated neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 by obtaining, for the
          first    time,    a   self-consistent   model   that   accounts
          simultaneously  for  the  observed  X-ray  spectrum and optical
          excess,  the  pulsed  fraction,  the  observed spectral feature
          around  0.3  keV,  and  the  long--term  spectral evolution. By
          fitting the parameters of our realistic self--consistent models
          to  all archival XMM--Newton observations and available optical
          data,  we show that all observed properties are consistent with
          a  normal  neutron  star with a proper radius of about 12 km, a
          temperature at the magnetic pole of about 100 eV and a magnetic
          field  strength  of  2-3  x  10^{13}  G, with no need to invoke
          additional   emission  and  absorption  components  nor  exotic
          internal composition. The observed variability of the blackbody
          temperature,  strength  of  the  spectral  feature,  and pulsed
          fraction is in good agreement with the predictions of our model
          in  which  the  star  is  subject to free precession, producing
          changes  in  the  angle  between  the  magnetic  field  and the
          rotation axis of about 10--15 degrees in a few years.

          X-Ray Sources and Gamma-Ray Bursts
          Authors: J. I. Katz
          Comments: 22 pages
          I  consider  models  of  active  galactic  nuclei, stellar-mass
          accreting  black  holes  and microquasars based on a previously
          developed  (Katz  1997)  model of gamma-ray bursts. When energy
          fluxes  exceed a critical value ~ 10^{29} erg/cm^2s, as in GRB,
          a black body equilibrium pair plasma forms. At the lower fluxes
          found  in  AGN,  BHXS and microquasars power electrodynamically
          accelerates   a  small  number  of  very  energetic  particles,
          explaining  their  non-thermal  spectra  and  the  high  energy
          gamma-ray  emission  of  blazars. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays
          may   be   accelerated   by   massive  black  holes,  otherwise
          undetectable, with very low thermal luminosities. New-born fast
          high-field pulsars may be in the black-body equilibrium regime,
          resembling  SGR  in  permanent  outburst.  I  also consider the
          question of whether collisionless plasmas interpenetrate rather
          than  forming  hydrodynamic  shocks,  and  propose  this  as an
          alternative to internal shock models of gamma-ray bursts.

          Title:  The  Topology  and  Polarisation of Subbeams Associated
          with the `Drifting' Subpulse Emission of Pulsar B0943+10 -- IV.
          Q-to-B-Mode Recovery Dynamics
          Authors: Joanna M. Rankin, Svetlana A. Suleymanova
          Comments: 9 pages, 10 figures
          Pulsar  B0943+10  is  well  known  for  its  `B'  (burst) mode,
          characterized  by accurately drifting subpulses, in contrast to
          its  chaotic  `Q' (quiet) mode. Six new Arecibo observations at
          327  MHz with durations of 2+ hours each have shed considerable
          light  on  the  modal  dynamics of this pulsar. Of these, three
          were   found  to  be  exclusively  `B'  mode,  and  three  were
          discovered to exhibit transitions from the `Q' to the `B' mode.
          One  of  these  observations  has permitted us to determine the
          circulation  time  of  the subbeam carousel in the `Q' mode for
          the  first time, at some 36.4$\pm$0.9 stellar rotation periods.
          The  onset  of  the  `B'  mode  is  then  observed  to commence
          similarly  in  all  three observations. The initial circulation
          time  is about 36 periods and relaxes to nearly 38 periods in a
          roughly  exponential fashion with a characteristic time of some
          1.2  hours.  This is the longest characteristic time ever found
          in  a  mode-switching pulsar. Moreover, just after the `B'-mode
          onset the pulsar exhibits a symmetrical resolved-double profile
          form  with  a  somewhat  stronger  trailing component, but this
          second  component  slowly  dies  away  leaving the usual single
          `B'-mode  profile  with  the  longitude  of  the  magnetic axis
          falling  at  about its trailing half power point. Thus it would
          appear  that  Q-to-B-  and  B-to-Q-transitions  have  different
          characteristic times. Some speculations are given on the nature
          of this slow modal alternation.

          Comments:  24  pages,  9  figures,  accepted for publication on
          Astronomy & Astrophysics
          We further discuss the Unipolar Inductor Model (UIM) coupled to
          GW  emission (Dall'Osso et al. 2005) and compare it to observed
          properties  of  the two candidate ultrashort period binaries RX
          J0806+15  and  RX  J1914+24  . We consider the measured orbital
          periods,  period derivatives and inferred X-ray luminosities of
          these  two sources and find constraints on system parameters in
          order  for  the  model  to account for them. We find that these
          properties  point to the two sources being in different regimes
          of  the  UIM,  with  the  requirement  of  low  magnetic moment
          primaries  ($\sim  10^{30}  G  cm^3$) for both. Given this weak
          magnetization,  RX  J0806+15  has a sufficiently low luminosity
          that  it  can  be  interpreted  as having a primary spin almost
          synchronous  to  and  just  slightly  slower  than  the orbital
          motion.  Its measured orbital spin-up is only slightly affected
          by  spin-orbit  coupling  and  is mostly due to GW emission. RX
          J1914+24,  on  the  other hand, is too bright in X-rays and has
          too  slow  an  orbital spin-up for the same regime to apply. We
          suggest  that  this  binary  system  may  be  emitting GWs at a
          significantly   higher   rate  than  implied  by  its  measured
          $\dot{\omega}_o  = 6 \times 10^{-17} rad s^{-2}$. The latter is
          explained,  in  this  framework,  by  the  primary  spin  being
          slightly faster than the orbital motion ($\alpha <or= 1.1$). In
          this  case, the associated spin-orbit coupling transfers to the
          orbit  a significant amount of angular momentum, thus partially
          balancing  that  lost  to  GW emission. All expectations can be
          tested  in  the  near  future  to  confirm the viability of the
          model.

          We  present  and  discuss  the radio observations of 27 Type Ia
          supernovae  (SNe  Ia)  observed  over two decades with the Very
          Large  Array.  No  SN Ia has been detected so far in the radio,
          implying  a  very  low  density  for any possible circumstellar
          material  established  by the progenitor, or progenitor system,
          before  explosion.  We  derive 2-sigma upper limits to a steady
          mass-loss rate for individual SN systems as low as ~3 X 10^{-8}
          Msun  yr^{-1},  discriminating  strongly  against  white  dwarf
          accretion via a stellar wind from a massive binary companion in
          the  symbiotic  star,  an  example of the ``single degenerate''
          scenario.  However,  a  white dwarf accreting from a relatively
          low   mass   companion   via  a  sufficiently  high  efficiency
          (>60-80%),  Roche  lobe  overflow  is still consistent with our
          limits.  The  ``double degenerate'' merger scenario also cannot
          be excluded.

          We  report  an  extremely  rapid  mechanism  for magnetic field
          amplification  during  the  merger  of  a  binary  neutron star
          system.  This  has implications for the production of the short
          class  of  Gamma-Ray  Bursts, which recent observations suggest
          may  originate in such mergers. In detailed magnetohydrodynamic
          simulations of the merger process, the fields are amplified via
          Kelvin-Helmholtz  instabilities  beyond magnetar field strength
          and  may  therefore  represent the strongest magnetic fields in
          the Universe. The amplification occurs in the shear layer which
          forms  between  the neutron stars and on a time scale of only 1
          millisecond,  i.e.  long before the remnant can collapse into a
          black hole.

          Kilohertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) have been detected
          in  many  accreting  X-ray binaries. It has been suggested that
          the  highest  QPO frequencies observed in the modulation of the
          X-ray  flux reflect a non-linear resonance between two modes of
          accreting  disk  oscillation.  This  hypothesis implies certain
          very  general predictions, several of which have been borne out
          by  observations.  Some  of  these  follow  from  properties of
          non-linear  oscillators,  while  the  others  are  specific  to
          oscillations  of  fluid in strong gravity. A 3:2 resonant ratio
          of  frequencies  can be clearly recognized in the black-hole as
          well as in the neutron-star QPO data.

          Title:  X-ray  emission  from  the  double  neutron star binary
          B1534+12: Powered by the pulsar wind?
          Authors: O. Kargaltsev, G. G. Pavlov, G. P. Garmire
          Comments: 11 pages, 8 figures, accepted to ApJ
          We  report  the  detection  of  the  double neutron star binary
          (DNSB)   B1534+12   (=   J1537+1155)  with  the  Chandra  X-ray
          Observatory. This DNSB (orbital period 10.1 hr) consists of the
          millisecond  (recycled)  pulsar J1537+1155A (P_A=37.9 ms) and a
          neutron  star  not  detected in the radio. After the remarkable
          double  pulsar  binary  J0737-3039,  it  is the only other DNSB
          detected   in   X-rays.   We   measured  the  flux  of  (2.2\pm
          0.6)\times10^{-15}  ergs  s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the 0.3-6 keV band.
          The   small  number  of  collected  counts  allows  only  crude
          estimates  of spectral parameters. The power-law fit yields the
          photon  index  of  3.2\pm  0.5  and  the  unabsorbed 0.2-10 keV
          luminosity    L_X=6\times10^{29}    ergs   s^{-1}   =   3\times
          10^{-4}Edot_A,   where   Edot_A   is  the  spin-down  power  of
          J1537+1155A.  Alternatively,  the  spectrum  can be fitted by a
          blackbody model with T = 2.2 MK and the projected emitting area
          of ~ 5\times 10^3 m^2. The distribution of photon arrival times
          over  binary  orbital  phase  shows a deficit of X-ray emission
          around  apastron, which suggests that the emission is caused by
          interaction  of the relativistic wind from J1537+1155A with its
          neutron  star  companion.  We  also  reanalyzed the Chandra and
          XMM-Newton  observations of J0737-3039 and found that its X-ray
          spectrum  is similar to the spectrum of B1534+12, and its X-ray
          luminosity is about the same fraction of Edot_A, which suggests
          similar  X-ray emission mechanisms. However, the X-ray emission
          from  J0737-3039  does  not show orbital phase dependence. This
          difference  can  be  explained  by  the smaller eccentricity of
          J0737-3039  or  a  smaller  misalignment between the equatorial
          plane  of  the  millisecond pulsar and the orbital plane of the
          binary.

          Title: Surface Tension and the Cosmological Constant
          Authors: Joseph Samuel, Supurna Sinha
          Comments: Dedicated to Rafael Sorkin on his 60th birthday
          Subj-class: Soft Condensed Matter
          The  astronomically observed value of the cosmological constant
          is small but non-zero. This raises two questions together known
          as the cosmological constant problem a) why is lambda so nearly
          zero?  b)  why  is lambda not EXACTLY zero? Sorkin has proposed
          that  b)  can  be naturally explained as a one by square root N
          fluctuation by invoking discreteness of spacetime at the Planck
          scale  due  to  quantum gravity. In this paper we shed light on
          these   questions   by   developing   an  analogy  between  the
          cosmological constant and the surface tension of membranes. The
          ``cosmological constant problem'' has a natural analogue in the
          membrane  context:  the  vanishingly  small  surface tension of
          fluid  membranes  provides  an  example where question a) above
          arises  and  is answered. We go on to find a direct analogue of
          Sorkin's  proposal  for  answering  question b) in the membrane
          context,  where  the  discreteness of spacetime translates into
          the   molecular   structure  of  matter.  We  propose  analogue
          experiments to probe a small and fluctuating surface tension in
          fluid  membranes.  A  counterpart of dimensional reduction a la
          Kaluza-Klein  and  large  extra  dimensions also appears in the
          physics of fluid membranes.

          Title:  A  62 Day X-Ray Periodicity and an X-Ray Flare from the
          Ultraluminous X-Ray Source in M82
          Authors: Philip Kaaret, Melanie G. Simet, Cornelia C. Lang
          Comments: 15 pages, one color figure, to appear in ApJ
          In  240  days of X-ray monitoring of M82, we have discovered an
          X-ray  periodicity  at  $62.0 \pm 2.5$ days with a peak to peak
          amplitude  corresponding  to  an  isotropic  luminosity of $2.4
          \times  10^{40}  \rm  erg  s^{-1}$  in  M82  and an X-ray flare
          reaching  a  peak  luminosity  of  $9.8  \times 10^{40} \rm erg
          s^{-1}$.  The  periodicity  and flare likely originate from the
          ultraluminous   X-ray  source  (ULX)  in  M82  which  has  been
          identified  as  a  possible  intermediate  mass  black hole. We
          suggest  that  the  62~day  modulation is due to orbital motion
          within  an X-ray binary with a Roche-lobe overflowing companion
          star  which  would  imply  that  the  average  density  of  the
          companion  star is near $5 \times 10^{-5} \rm g cm^{-3}$ and is
          therefore  a  giant  or  supergiant.  Chandra observations just
          after the flare show an energy spectrum that is consistent with
          a  power-law  with  no  evidence of a thermal component or line
          emission. Radio observations made with the VLA during the flare
          allow us to rule out a blazar identification for the source and
          place  strong  constraints on relativistically beamed models of
          the  X-ray  emission.  The Chandra observations reveal a second
          X-ray  source  reached  a  flux of $4.4 \times 10^{-12} \rm erg
          cm^{-2}  s^{-1}$  in  the  0.3-7 keV band which is dramatically
          higher  than  any  flux  previously  seen  from this source and
          corresponds  to  an isotropic luminosity of $1.1 \times 10^{40}
          \rm  erg  s^{-1}$.  This source is a second ultraluminous X-ray
          source  in  M82 and may give rise to the QPOs detected from the
          central region of M82.

          Title:  Disk  Evolution in Young Binaries: from Observations to
          Theory
          Authors: J.-L. Monin, C. J. Clarke, L. Prato, C. McCabe
          Comments:  16  pages,  7  figures,  chapter  in  Protostars and
          Planets V
          The  formation  of  a  binary system surrounded by disks is the
          most  common  outcome  of stellar formation. Hence studying and
          understanding the formation and the evolution of binary systems
          and  associated  disks  is  a  cornerstone  of  star  formation
          science.  Moreover,  since the components within binary systems
          are  coeval and the sizes of their disks are fixed by the tidal
          truncation  of their companion, binary systems provide an ideal
          "laboratory"  in  which  to  study  disk  evolution  under well
          defined boundary conditions.
          In  this  paper,  we  review observations of several inner disk
          diagnostics  in  multiple  systems, including hydrogen emission
          lines  (indicative of ongoing accretion), $K-L$ and $K-N$ color
          excesses  (evidence  of  warm  inner  disks),  and polarization
          (indicative  of  the  relative orientations of the disks around
          each component). We examine to what degree these properties are
          correlated  within  binary  systems  and  how  this  degree  of
          correlation depends on parameters such as separation and binary
          mass ratio. These findings will be interpreted both in terms of
          models  that treat each disk as an isolated reservoir and those
          in  which  the disks are subject to re-supply from some form of
          circumbinary reservoir, the observational evidence for which we
          will  also  critically  review. The planet forming potential of
          multiple  star  systems  is  discussed in terms of the relative
          lifetimes  of  disks  around single stars, binary primaries and
          binary  secondaries.  Finally, we summarize several potentially
          revealing observational problems and future projects that could
          provide  further  insight  into  disk  evolution  in the coming
          decade

          Title: High density behaviour of nuclear symmetry energy
          Authors: D.N. Basu, Tapan Mukhopadhyay
          Comments: 9 pages including 3 figures
          Role of the isospin asymmetry in nuclei and neutron stars, with
          an  emphasis  on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry
          energy, is discussed. The symmetry energy is obtained using the
          isoscalar  as  well  as  isovector  components  of  the density
          dependent  M3Y  effective interaction. The constants of density
          dependence   of  the  effective  interaction  are  obtained  by
          reproducing   the   saturation   energy  per  nucleon  and  the
          saturation  density of spin and isospin symmetric cold infinite
          nuclear  matter. Implications for the density dependence of the
          symmetry  energy  in  case of a neutron star are discussed, and
          also  possible  constraints  on the density dependence obtained
          from finite nuclei are compared.

          We  report on the discovery of a supermassive binary black hole
          system   in   the  radio  galaxy  0402+379,  with  a  projected
          separation  between the two black holes of just 7.3 pc. This is
          the  closest  black hole pair yet found by more than two orders
          of   magnitude.   These   results   are   based   upon   recent
          multi-frequency observations using the Very Long Baseline Array
          (VLBA)  which  reveal  two  compact,  variable,  flat-spectrum,
          active  nuclei  within  the elliptical host galaxy of 0402+379.
          Multi-epoch observations from the VLBA also provide constraints
          on  the  total  mass  and  dynamics of the system. Low spectral
          resolution   spectroscopy   using  the  Hobby-Eberly  Telescope
          indicates  two velocity systems with a combined mass of the two
          black  holes of ~1.5 x 10^8 solar masses. The two nuclei appear
          stationary  while the jets emanating from the weaker of the two
          nuclei  appear  to  move out and terminate in bright hot spots.
          The discovery of this system has implications for the number of
          close binary black holes that might be sources of gravitational
          radiation.  Green  Bank  Telescope  observations  at  22 GHz to

          We   analyse   archival  Rossi  X-Ray  Timing  Explorer  (RXTE)
          proportional  counter  array  (PCA) data of thermonuclear X-ray
          bursts  from  the  2002  outburst  of the accreting millisecond
          pulsar  SAX  J1808.4-3658.  We present evidence of nonmonotonic
          variations  of  oscillation  frequency  during  burst rise, and
          correlations  among  the  time  evolution  of  the  oscillation
          frequency,  amplitude, and the inferred burning region area. We
          also  discuss  that  the  amplitude  and  burning  region  area
          evolutions are consistent with thermonuclear flame spreading on
          the  neutron  star  surface. Based on this discussion, we infer
          that  for  the  2002  Oct. 15 thermonuclear burst, the ignition
          likely  occured in the mid-latitudes, the burning region took ~
          0.2  s  to nearly encircle the equatorial region of the neutron
          star, and after that the lower amplitude oscillation originated
          from  the  remaining asymmetry of the burning front in the same
          hemisphere  where the burst ignited. Our observational findings
          and   theoretical  discussion  indicate  that  studies  of  the
          evolution of burst oscillation properties during burst rise can
          provide  a  powerful  tool  to  understand  thermonuclear flame
          spreading  on  neutron  star  surfaces  under  extreme physical

          The  number  of  pulsars  with  detected  emission at X-ray and
          gamma-ray  energies  has  been  steadily  growing, showing that
          beams  of  high-energy  particles  are  commonly accelerated in
          pulsar  magnetospheres,  even though the location and number of
          acceleration  sites  remain  unsettled.  Acceleration  near the
          magnetic  poles,  close  to  the polar cap surface or to higher
          altitudes  in  the  slot  gap  along the last open field lines,
          involves  an  electric  field  component  due to inertial-frame
          dragging.  Acceleration  can  also  take  place  in  the  outer
          magnetosphere  where  charge  depletion  due to global currents
          causes  a  large electric field along the magnetic field lines.
          All   models   require   a   detailed  knowledge  of  the  open
          magnetosphere   geometry   and  its  relativistic  distortions.
          Observational  trends  with  age,  spin-down power and magnetic
          field  as  well as population synthesis studies in the Galactic
          disc  and the nearby Gould Belt provide useful, however not yet

          altitudes  in  the  slot  gap  along the last open field lines,
          involves  an  electric  field  component  due to inertial-frame
          dragging.  Acceleration  can  also  take  place  in  the  outer
          magnetosphere  where  charge  depletion  due to global currents
          causes  a  large electric field along the magnetic field lines.
          All   models   require   a   detailed  knowledge  of  the  open
          magnetosphere   geometry   and  its  relativistic  distortions.
          Observational  trends  with  age,  spin-down power and magnetic
          field  as  well as population synthesis studies in the Galactic
          disc  and the nearby Gould Belt provide useful, however not yet
          conclusive, constraints on the competing models.

          With   the  MIPS  camera  on  Spitzer,  we  have  searched  for
          far-infrared   emission  from  dust  in  the  planetary  system
          orbiting  pulsar PSR 1257+12. With accuracies of 0.05 mJy at 24
          um  and  1.5  mJy  at  70  um, photometric measurements find no
          evidence  for emission at these wavelengths. These observations
          place   new  upper  limits  on  the  luminosity  of  dust  with
          temperatures  between  20  and  1000  K.  They are particularly
          sensitive  to  dust  temperatures  of 100-200 K, for which they
          limit  the  dust  luminosity to below $3 \times 10^{-5}$ of the
          pulsar's spin-down luminosity, three orders of magnitude better
          than  previous  limits.  Despite  these improved constraints on
          dust  emission,  an asteroid belt similar to the Solar System's
          cannot be ruled out.

          Title:   Shapes   of   Stellar  Systems  and  Dark  Halos  from
          Simulations of Galaxy Major Mergers
          Authors:  Gregory  S.  Novak,  Thomas  J. Cox, Joel R. Primack,

          Comments: 5 pages, 5 figures. Submitted to ApJL
          Using  a  sample  of  89  snapshots from 58 hydrodynamic binary
          galaxy  major merger simulations, we find that stellar remnants
          are mostly oblate while dark matter halos are mostly prolate or
          triaxial.  The  stellar  minor axis and the halo major axis are
          almost  always  nearly perpendicular. This can be understood by
          considering  the  influence of angular momentum and dissipation
          during  the  merger.  If  binary mergers of spiral galaxies are
          responsible  for  the  formation of elliptical galaxies or some
          subpopulation  thereof,  these  galaxies  can be expected to be
          oblate  and  inhabit  their halos with the predicted shapes and
          orientations.  These  predictions  are  potentially relevant to
          observational  studies of weak gravitational lensing, where one
          must   stack  many  optically  aligned  galaxies  in  order  to
          determine the shape of the resulting stacked mass distribution.
          The  simple  relationship  between the dark and luminous matter
          presented here can be used to guide the stacking of galaxies to
          minimize the information lost.

          Title:  Effect  of  r-mode  instability  on  the  evolution  of
          isolated strange stars
          Authors: X.P. Zheng, Y.W. Yu, J.R. Li
          Comments:  16  pages,  6  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We   studied   the   evolution   of   isolated   strange  stars
          synthetically,   considering  the  influence  of  {\it  r-}mode
          instability. Our results show that the cooling of strange stars
          with non-ultra strong magnetic fields is delayed by the heating
          due  to  the  {\it r-}modes damping during million years, while
          the  spin-down  of  the  stars  is  dominated  by gravitational
          radiation.  Especially  for  the  strange  stars  in a possible
          existing  color-flavor  locked  phase,  the  effect of the {\it
          r-}mode  instability  on  the  evolution  of  the stars becomes
          extremely   important   since   the   viscosity,  the  neutrino
          emissivity,  and  the specific heat involving paring quarks are
          blocked. It leads to the cooling of these color superconducting
          stars  is  very slow, and the stars can remain high temperature
          within   million   years  differing  completely  from  previous
          understanding.  In  this  case,  a strange star in color-flavor
          locked  phase  can be located at the bottom of its {\it r-}mode
          instability window for a long time, but does not spin down to a
          very low frequency within hours.

          Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures, A&A in press
          The pre-main sequence binary system V773 Tau A shows remarkable
          flaring  activity  around  periastron passage. Here, we present
          the  observation  of  such  a flare at a wavelength of 3 mm (90
          GHz)  performed  with  the  Plateau  de Bure Interferometer. We
          examine   different  possible  causes  for  the  energy  losses
          responsible  for the e-folding time of 2.3 hours of that flare.
          We exclude synchrotron, collisional, and inverse Compton losses
          because they are not consistent with observational constraints,
          and  we  propose  that the fading of the emission is due to the
          leakage  of electrons themselves at each reflection between the
          two  mirror points of the magnetic structure partially trapping
          them.  The  magnetic structure compatible with both our leakage
          model  and  previous  observations is that of a helmet streamer
          that,  as  in  the  solar  case,  can  occur  at the top of the
          X-ray-emitting,  stellar-sized  coronal  loops  of  one  of the
          stars. The streamer may extend up to 20 R and interact with the
          corona  of  the  other  star  at  periastron  passage,  causing
          recurring  flares.  The inferred magnetic field strength at the
          two mirror points of the helmet streamer is in the range 0.12 -
          125  G,  and  the  corresponding  Lorentz factor, gamma, of the
          partially  trapped  electrons is in the range 20 < gamma < 632.
          We   therefore   rule   out  that  the  emission  could  be  of
          gyro-synchrotron nature: the derived high Lorentz factor proves
          that  the  nature  of the emission at 90 GHz from this pre-main
          binary system is synchrotron radiation.
          Based on observations carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure
          Interferometer.  IRAM  is  supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG
          (Germany), and IGN (Spain).

          supermassive   black   hole   binary   mergers  with  amplitude
          signal-to-noise  ratio of several thousands. We investigate the
          extent  to  which such observations afford high-precision tests
          of  Einstein's  gravity.  We  show  that LISA provides a unique
          opportunity to probe the non-linear structure of post-Newtonian
          theory  both  in  the  context  of  general  relativity and its
          alternatives.

astro-ph.  Full  thesis  (22Mb) in separate chapters and with a
          summary in Catalan is available from: this http URL
          (Abridged)  In  the  first  part  of  this  thesis,  a  general
          methodology  for applying image deconvolution to wide-field CCD
          imagery.  Results  show  that  wavelet-based  deconvolution can
          increase  limiting magnitude up to 0.6 mag and improve limiting
          resolution  1  pixel  with  respect  to  original image with no
          astrometric accuracy degradation.
          In  the second part, a new observational technique based on CCD
          fast  drift  scanning  has been proposed for lunar occultations
          (LO)  and  speckle  interferometry.  This  enables  all kind of
          professional and high-end amateur observatories to perform such
          kind of observations.
          For LO, 16 new binaries up to 2mas of projected separation were
          detected and stellar diameters measurements in the 7 mas regime
          were obtained with that CCD and IR subarray based techniques. A
          new wavelet-based LO reduction pipeline was implemented.
          For  speckle,  CCD  fast drift scanning technique was validated
          with   the   observation  of  four  binary  systems  with  well
          determined  orbits.  The  results of separation, position angle
          and  magnitude  difference  are  in  accordance  with published
          measurements.  A  new approach for calibrating speckle transfer
          function  from  the  binary  power  spectrum  itself  has  been
          introduced.  It  does  not  require  point source observations,
          which gives a more effective use of observation time.

          Title:   Resonant   Tidal  Excitations  of  Inertial  Modes  in
          Coalescing Neutron Star Binaries
          Authors: Dong Lai (Cornell), Yanqin Wu (Toronto)
          Comments: 6 pages. Phys. Rev. D. submitted 3/23/06
          We  study  the  effect of resonant tidal excitation of inertial
          modes  in  neutron  stars  during  binary  inspiral.  For  spin
          frequencies   less   than  100  Hz,  the  phase  shift  in  the
          gravitational  waveform  associated with the resonance is small
          and   does   not   affect  the  matched  filtering  scheme  for
          gravitational  wave detection. For higher spin frequencies, the
          phase shift can become significant. Most of the resonances take
          place  at orbital frequencies comparable to the spin frequency,
          and  thus  significant  phase  shift  may  occur  only  in  the
          high-frequency  band (hundreds of Hertz) of gravitational wave.
          The  exception  is  a single odd-paity $m=1$ mode, which can be
          resonantly  excited for misaligned spin-orbit inclinations, and
          may  occur  in  the  low-frequency  band  (tens  of  Hertz)  of
          gravitational  wave  and induce significant (>> 1 radian) phase
          shift.

          Pieter Deroo, Clio Gielen
          Comments:  to  be included in the conference proceedings of the
          8th Torino Workshop held in Granada
          In   this  contribution  we  give  a  progress  report  on  our
          systematic  study  of  a  large  sample  of post-AGB stars. The
          sample  stars  were  selected  on  the  basis of their infrared
          colours  and  the  selection  criteria  were  tuned to discover
          objects  with  hot  dust  in  the  system.  We  started  a very
          extensive,   multi-wavelength   programme  which  includes  the
          analysis   of  our  radial  velocity  monitoring;  our  optical
          high-resolution  spectra;  our groundbased N-band spectral data
          as  well as the Spitzer full spectral scans; the broad-band SED
          and  the  high  spatial-resolution  interferometric experiments
          with  the  VLTI.  In  this  contribution  we highlight the main
          results  obtained  so  far  and  argue  that all systems in our
          sample  are  indeed  binaries,  which  are  surrounded by dusty
          Keplerian circumbinary discs. The discs play a lead role in the
          evolution of the systems.

          in favour of millisecond proto-neutron stars
          Authors:  Jacco  Vink  (1),  Lucien  Kuiper  (2)  ((1)  Utrecht
          University, The Netherlands, (2) SRON Netherlands Institute for
          Space Research, Utrecht, The Netherlands)
          Comments:  Accepted  for publication in MNRAS Letters. 5 pages,
          one color figure
          It  is  generally  accepted that Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs)
          and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) are magnetars, i.e. neutron
          stars  with extremely high surface magnetic fields (B > 10^{14}
          G).  The origin of these high magnetic fields is uncertain, but
          a popular hypothesis is that magnetars are born with an initial
          spin  period close to the break-up limit (~1 ms), which results
          in a powerful dynamo action, amplifying the seed magnetic field
          to  >  10^{15}  G. A neutron star spinning at such a rate has a
          rotational  energy  in  excess of 10^{52} erg, and part of that
          energy will power the supernova through rapid magnetic braking.
          It  is  therefore  expected  that  if  magnetars  are born with
          periods  <  3 ms their supernova remnants should be an order of
          magnitude  more  energetic  than  ordinary  supernova remnants.
          However,  we  list here evidence that the explosion energies of
          these  supernova  remnants associated with AXPs and SGRs -- Kes
          73  (AXP  1E  1841-045),  CTB 109 (AXP 1E2259+586) and N49 (SGR
          0526-66)  --  are  close  to  the canonical supernova explosion
          energy of 10^{51} erg.
          We  therefore  do  not  find evidence that magnetars are formed
          from  rapidly  rotating  proto-neutron  stars, allowing for the
          possibility that they descend from stellar progenitor with high
          magnetic  field cores, and discuss the merits of both formation
          scenarios.
          In   an   appendix  we  describe  the  analysis  of  XMM-Newton
          observations  of  Kes  73  and N49 used to derive the explosion
          energies for these remnants.

          MNRAS. Part I is currently with the referee
          Applications  of the phase space approach to the calculation of
          the  microlensing  autocorrelation  function are presented. The
          continuous  propagation equation for a random star field with a
          Gaussian   velocity  distribution  is  solved  in  the  leading
          non-trivial  approximation using the perturbation technique. It
          is  shown that microlensing modulations can be important in the
          interpretation  of  optical and shorter-wavelength light curves
          of  pulsars,  power  spectra  of  active  galactic  nuclei  and
          coherence  estimates  for  quasi-periodic oscillations of dwarf
          novae  and  low-mass  X-ray  binaries.  Extra  scatter  in  the
          brightness   of   type   Ia  supernovae  due  to  gravitational
          microlensing  is  shown  to  be  of  order  up  to  0.2 stellar
          magnitudes depending on the extent of the light curves.

          We  report on the XMM-Newton observation of the Be/neutron star
          X-ray  binary  system  RX  J0146.9+6121, a long period (~ 23 m)
          pulsar  in  the  NGC  663  open  cluster.  The X-ray luminosity
          decreased  by  a  factor  two  compared to the last observation
          carried  out  in  1998,  reaching a level of ~ 10^34 erg/s, the
          lowest  ever  observed  in  this  source. The spectral analysis
          reveals  the  presence  of a significant excess at low energies
          over the main power-law spectral component. The soft excess can
          be  described  by  a  black-body spectrum with a temperature of
          about  1  keV  and an emitting region with a radius of ~ 140 m.
          Although  the  current  data do not permit to ascertain whether
          the soft excess is pulsed or not, its properties are consistent
          with  emission  from  the  neutron  star polar cap. This is the
          third  detection  of a soft excess in a low luminosity (~ 10^34
          erg/s)   pulsar,  the  other  being  X  Per  and  3A  0535+262,
          suggesting that such spectral component, observed up to date in
          higher  luminosity  systems,  is  a  rather  common  feature of
          accreting  X-ray  pulsars.  The  results on these three sources
          indicate that, in low luminosity systems, the soft excess tends
          to have a higher temperature and a smaller surface area than in
          the high luminosity ones.

          We  present  new  results  from  a  study  of high quality, red
          spectra  of  the  massive binary star system HD 1383 (B0.5 Ib +

          tomographic   reconstructions   of  the  component  spectra.  A
          comparison  of  these  with  model  spectra  from non-LTE, line
          blanketed  atmospheres  indicates  that  both stars have almost

          (T_eff  = 28000 +/- 1000 K), gravities (log g = 3.25 +/- 0.25),
          and  projected  rotational  velocities  (V sin i < 30 km/s). We
          investigate  a number of constraints on the radii and masses of
          the  stars based upon the absence of eclipses, surface gravity,
          stellar  wind  terminal  velocity, and probable location in the
          Perseus spiral arm of the Galaxy, and these indicate a range in
          probable  radius and mass of R/R_sun = 14 - 20 and M/M_sun = 16
          -  35,  respectively.  These  values  are consistent with model
          evolutionary  masses  for  single stars of this temperature and
          gravity.  Both  stars  are  much  smaller than their respective
          Roche  radii,  so the system is probably in a pre-contact stage
          of   evolution.   A   fit   of  the  system's  spectral  energy
          distribution  yields  a reddening of E(B-V)=0.55 +/- 0.05 and a
          ratio  of  total-to-selective extinction of R=2.97 +/- 0.15. We
          find  no  evidence  of  H-alpha emission from colliding stellar
          winds,  which  is  probably  the  consequence  of  the  low gas
          densities in the colliding winds zone.

          Title:   Binary   black   hole   detection  rates  in  inspiral
          gravitational wave searches
          Authors: Chris Van Den Broeck
          Comments: 9 pages, 1 figure
          The   signal-to-noise  ratios  (SNRs)  for  binary  black  hole
          inspirals computed from restricted post-Newtonian waveforms are
          compared  with  those  attained by more complete post-Newtonian
          signals,   which   are  superpositions  of  amplitude-corrected
          harmonics  of  the  orbital  phase.  It  is shown that modeling
          signals   as   restricted   waveforms   can  lead  to  a  large
          overestimation  of  SNRs,  and  hence  of  detection rates. The
          effect   results   entirely   from  the  absence  of  amplitude
          corrections  to the dominant harmonic. By reinstating these, it
          is  possible  to  construct  reliable  waveforms  for simulated
          signals without having to include higher harmonics.

          Title:  A Survey for Spectroscopic Binaries Among Very Low-Mass
          Stars
          Authors: Gibor Basri, Ansgar Reiners
          Comments:  36  pages,  accepted for publication in AJ, abstract
          shortened for @arXiv.org
          We  report  on  the  results  of  a  survey for radial velocity
          variability  in  a  heterogeneous sample of very low-mass stars
          and  brown  dwarfs.  One  distinguishing  characteristic of the
          survey  is  its  timespan,  which  allows  an  overlap  between
          spectroscopic  binaries  and  those  which can be found by high
          angular-resolution   imaging.  We  are  able  to  place  a  new
          constraint on the total binary fraction in these objects, which
          suggests  that they are more likely the result of extending the
          same  processes  at work at higher masses into this mass range,
          rather  than  a distinct mode of formation. Our basic result is
          that  there  are  $6 \pm 2$ out of 53, or $11^{+0.07}_{-0.04}$%
          spectroscopic  binaries  in the separation range 0-6 AU, nearly
          as  many  as resolved binaries. This leads to an estimate of an
          upper  limit  of  $26  \pm  10$% for the binary fraction of VLM
          objects  (it  is an upper limit because of the possible overlap
          between   the   spectroscopic   and  resolved  populations).  A
          reasonable  estimate  for  the very low-mass binary fraction is
          $20  -  25$%.  We  consider  several  possible  separation  and
          frequency distributions, including the same one as found for GK
          stars,   a  compressed  version  of  that,  a  version  of  the
          compressed  distribution  truncated at 15 AU, and a theoretical
          distribution   which   considers  the  evaporation  of  small-N
          clusters.   We   conclude  that  the  latter  two  bracket  the
          observations,  which  may  mean  that  these  systems form with
          intrinsically  smaller  separations  due to their smaller mass,
          and  then are truncated due to their smaller binding energy. We
          do  not  find  support for the ``ejection hypothesis'' as their
          dominant  mode  of  formation,  particularly  in  view  of  the
          similarity  in the total binary fraction compared with slightly
          more  massive  stars,  and the difficulty this mechanism has in
          producing numerous binary systems.

          Title:  Envelope  Expansion with Core Collapse. III. Similarity
          Isothermal Shocks in a Magnetofluid
          Authors: Cong Yu, Yu-Qing Lou, Fu-Yan Bian, Yan Wu
          Comments: 21 pages, 33 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          We  explore  MHD  solutions  for  envelope expansions with core
          collapse (EECC) with isothermal MHD shocks in a quasi-spherical
          symmetry  and  outline  potential astrophysical applications of
          such magnetized shock flows. MHD shock solutions are classified
          into  three classes according to the downstream characteristics
          near  the  core.  Class  I solutions are those characterized by
          free-fall  collapses  towards  the  core  downstream  of an MHD
          shock,  while  Class  II  solutions  are those characterized by
          Larson-Penston  (LP)  type  near  the core downstream of an MHD
          shock.  Class III solutions are novel, sharing both features of
          Class  I  and  II solutions with the presence of a sufficiently
          strong  magnetic field as a prerequisite. Various MHD processes
          may  occur  within  the  regime  of  these isothermal MHD shock
          similarity  solutions,  such  as sub-magnetosonic oscillations,
          free-fall  core  collapses, radial contractions and expansions.
          We  can  also construct families of twin MHD shock solutions as
          well  as  an `isothermal MHD shock' separating two magnetofluid
          regions   of  two  different  yet  constant  temperatures.  The
          versatile  behaviours  of  such  MHD  shock  solutions  may  be
          utilized  to  model  a  wide  range  of astrophysical problems,
          including  star  formation  in magnetized molecular clouds, MHD
          link   between   the  asymptotic  giant  branch  phase  to  the
          proto-planetary  nebula  phase  with  a  hot central magnetized
          white   dwarf,  relativistic  MHD  pulsar  winds  in  supernova
          remnants,  radio  afterglows of soft gamma-ray repeaters and so

          Title:  Millimagnitude  Optical  Photometry  for the Transiting
          Planetary Candidate OGLE-TR-109

          Zoccali, Andrzej Udalski, Thomas Szeifert
          We  present  precise  V-band  photometry  for the low-amplitude
          transit  candidate  star  OGLE-TR-109.  This is an extreme case
          among the transiting candidates found by the OGLE group because
          of  the  early  spectral  type  of  the  star (F0V), of the low
          transit amplitude (A_I=0.008 mag), and of the very short period
          (P=0.58909  days)  of  the orbiting companion. Using difference
          image  photometry, we are able to achieve millimagnitude errors
          in the individual data points. One transit of this star is well
          defined  in  our  light curve. This confirms the OGLE detection
          and  rules  out  the  possibility  of  a  false  positive.  The
          measurement  of  this  transit  allows  to  refine  the transit
          amplitude  (A_V=0.006  +/-  0.001 mag), and the ephemerides for
          this  interesting system, as well as the radius of the possible
          orbiting   companion   (R_P=0.90   +/-   0.09  ~R_J),  and  the
          inclination  of  the orbit (i=77 +/- 5 deg). Two other transits
          observed  at  lower  S/N  confirm  the  period  of  this system
          measured  by  OGLE.  There  is  no  evidence for a blend of the
          F-type  main  sequence  star with a redder eclipsing binary, or
          for secondary transits in the present observations. The absence
          of  ellipsoidal  modulation  in  the light curve of the primary
          rules  out  a  low mass star companion or brown dwarf with M>14
          +/-  8  M_J.  The remaining possibilities for OGLE-TR-109 are a
          blend between the F-type star and a binary with a bluer primary
          star, or a new transiting extrasolar planet.

          Title: The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array
          Authors: R N Manchester
          Comments: 10 pages, in press ChJAA
          Given  sufficient  sensitivity,  pulsar timing observations can
          make a direct detection of gravitational waves passing over the
          Earth.  Pulsar  timing is most sensitive to gravitational waves
          with  frequencies in the nanoHertz region, with the most likely
          astronomical  sources being binary super-massive black holes in
          galaxy  cores.  The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project uses the
          Parkes   64-m   radio   telescope   to  make  precision  timing
          observations of a sample of about 20 millisecond pulsars with a
          principal  goal  of  making a direct detection of gravitational
          waves.  Observations  commenced  about  one year ago and so far
          sub-microsecond  timing  residuals  have been achieved for more
          than  half  of these pulsars. New receiver and software systems
          are being developed with the aim of reducing these residuals to
          the  level  believed  necessary  for  a  positive  detection of
          gravitational waves.

          clusters
          Authors: B. Tian, L. Deng, Z. Han, X.B. Zhang
          Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures, A&A accepted
          In  this  paper,  we present the simulations for the primordial
          blue  stragglers  in the old open cluster M67 based on detailed
          modelling  of  the evolutionary processes. The principal aim is
          to discuss the contribution to the blue straggler population in
          M67   from  mass  transfer  between  the  components  of  close
          binaries.  Firstly,  we  follow  the  evolution  of a binary of
          1.4M$_\odot$+0.9M$_\odot$.  The synthetic evolutionary track of
          the  binary system reveals that a primordial blue straggler can
          stay  at  the observed blue straggler region in Color-Magnitude
          diagram  with a long lifetime to secure observable probability.
          Secondly, a grid of models of close binary systems experiencing
          mass  exchanging  are  computed  from  1Gyr to 6Gyr in order to
          account  for  primordial  blue  straggler  formation  in a time
          sequence.  Based  on  such  a grid, Monte-Carlo simulations are
          applied  for  the  old  open  cluster M67. Adopting appropriate
          orbital  parameters, 4 primordial blue stragglers are predicted
          by  our  simulations. This is consistent with the observational
          fact  that  only a few blue stragglers in M67 are binaries with
          short orbital periods. An upper boundary of the primordial blue
          stragglers in the Color-Magnitude diagram is defined and can be
          used  to  distinguish  blue  stragglers that are not formed via
          mass  exchange.  Using  the  grid of binary models, the orbital
          periods  of  the primordial BSs can be predicted. Compared with
          the  observations,  the  predicted  blue  stragglers  via  mass
          exchange  from  the simulations is insufficient to fit the blue
          stragglers population in M67. There should be several processes
          to form the observed blue stragglers in M67.

          We  describe  a  simple  computer  package  which illustrates a

          Though  the  method  is  intended  for  elaborate  applications
          (especially  the  dynamical evolution of rich star clusters) it
          is  illustrated  here  in the context of three-body scattering,
          i.e.  interactions  between a binary star and a field of single
          stars.  We  describe the interface between the dynamics and the
          two  independent packages which describe the internal evolution
          of   single  stars  and  binaries.  We  also  give  an  example
          application, and introduce a stand alone utility for the visual
          presentation of simulation results.

          We  use  full  three-body  scattering  experiments to study the
          ejection  of  hypervelocity  stars (HVSs) by massive black hole
          binaries (MBHBs) at the center of galaxies. Ambient stars drawn
          from  a  Maxwellian  distribution  unbound  to  the  binary are
          expelled  by the gravitational slingshot. Accurate measurements
          of   thermally   averaged   hardening,   mass   ejection,   and
          eccentricity  growth  rates  (H, J, and K) for MBHBs in a fixed
          stellar  background are obtained by numerical orbit integration
          from  initial  conditions determined by Monte Carlo techniques.
          Three-body  interactions  create  a  subpopulation  of  HVSs on
          nearly  radial,  corotating orbits, with a spatial distribution
          that is initially highly flattened in the inspiral plane of the
          MBHB,   but  becomes  more  isotropic  with  decreasing  binary
          separation.  The  degree  of  anisotropy is smaller for unequal
          mass binaries and larger for stars with higher kick velocities.
          Eccentric  MBHBs produce a more prominent tail of high-velocity
          stars  and  break  planar symmetry, ejecting HVSs along a broad
          jet  perpendicular to the semimajor axis. The jet two-sidedness
          decreases  with  increasing  binary  mass  ratio, while the jet
          opening-angle  increases  with  decreasing  kick  velocity  and
          orbital  separation.  The detection of a numerous population of
          HVSs  in  the  halo  of the Milky Way by the next generation of
          large  astrometric  surveys  like  GAIA  may  provide  a unique
          signature of the history, nature, and environment of the MBH at
          the Galactic center.

          We  present  the first optical circular and linear polarization
          measurements   of   two   polar  candidates  from  ROSAT:  1RXS
          J161008.0+035222  and  1RXS J231603.9-052713. We also present H
          band  near-infrared photometry of the last object. The presence
          of  strong  circular  polarization  confirms  them  as  AM  Her
          systems.  1RXS  J231603.9-052713  was observed in two different
          brightness states. The orbital phase dependence of the flux and
          polarization of 1RXS J161008.0+035222 is reasonably fitted with
          a  simple  model  in  which  the  binary is observed at a small
          inclination  and  the magnetic field axis is almost parallel to
          the white-dwarf rotation axis resulting in the accretion column
          axis  being  seen from top during the whole orbital revolution.
          The  magnetic  field  is probably in the 10 to 20 MG range. The
          circular  polarization  of 1RXS J231603.9-052713 is complex and
          highly  variable.  The  light-curves  of  that object have been
          fitted  using  a model which includes the white-dwarf, a heated
          secondary  and  a  point-like  accretion  region. The secondary
          emission contributes significantly even in optical wavelengths.
          This  model  also  reproduces  the main features of the optical
          polarization  of  1RXS  J231603.9-052713.  We estimate the main
          parameters  of  the  binary,  of  the  accretion region and the
          distance  to the system. However, a more precise interpretation
          of   this  system  should  take  in  account  an  extended  and
          inhomogeneous accreting region as well as non-radial accretion.

          Title: Towards a successful reheating within supersymmetry
          Authors: Rouzbeh Allahverdi, Anupam Mazumdar
          Comments: 13 revtex pages, 2 tables
          Motivated  by  Refs \cite{am1,am2}, we analyze how the inflaton
          decay   reheats   the   Universe  within  supersymmetry.  In  a
          non-supersymmetric   case   the  inflaton  usually  decays  via
          preheating unless its couplings to other fields are very small.
          Naively  one  would  expect that supersymmetry enhances bosonic
          preheating  as  it  introduces  new scalars such as squarks and
          sleptons.  On  the  contrary,  we  point out that preheating is
          unlikely   within   supersymmetry.  The  reason  is  that  flat
          directions   in  the  scalar  potential,  classified  by  gauge
          invariant  combinations  of  slepton  and  squark  fields,  are
          generically  displaced towards a large vacuum expectation value
          (VEV)   in   the  early  Universe.  They  induce  supersymmetry
          preserving  masses  to  the inflaton decay products through the
          Standard  Model  Yukawa  couplings,  which kinematically blocks
          preheating  for  VEVs  $>  10^{13}$  GeV. The decay will become
          allowed  only  after the flat directions start oscillating, and
          once  the  flat  direction  VEV is sufficiently redshifted. For
          models  with weak scale supersymmetry, this generically happens
          at  a  Hubble  expansion rate: $H \simeq (10^{-3}-10^{-1}) {\rm
          TeV}$,  at  which  time the inflaton decays in the perturbative
          regime.  This  is  to  our  knowledge  first analysis where the
          inflaton  decay  to  the  Standard  Model  particles is treated
          properly  within  supersymmetry.  There are number of important
          consequences:  no  overproduction  of  dangerous supersymmetric
          relics  (particularly  gravitinos),  no  resonant excitation of
          superheavy dark matter, and no non-thermal leptogenesis through
          non-perturbative  creation  of  the  right-handed (s)neutrinos.
          Finally  supersymmetric  flat  directions can even spoil hybrid
          inflation  all  together  by  not  allowing the auxiliary field
          become tachyonic.

          Title:  Chandra  X-Ray  Observations  of  Nineteen  Millisecond
          Pulsars in the Globular Cluster 47 Tucanae
          Authors:  Slavko  Bogdanov,  Jonathan  E.  Grindlay,  Craig  O.
          Heinke, Fernando Camilo, Paulo C. C. Freire, Werner Becker

          Astrophysical Journal
          We  present spectral and long-timescale variability analyses of
          \textit{Chandra}  ACIS-S  observations  of  the  19 millisecond
          pulsars  (MSPs)  with precisely known positions in the globular
          cluster 47 Tucanae. The X-ray emission of the majority of these
          MSPs  is well described by a thermal (blackbody or neutron star
          hydrogen   atmosphere)  spectrum  with  a  temperature  $T_{\rm
          eff}\sim(1-3)\times10^6$    K,    emission    radius    $R_{\rm
          eff}\sim0.1-3$  km,  and  luminosity $L_{X}\sim10^{30-31}$ ergs
          s$^{-1}$.  For  several MSPs, there is indication that a second
          thermal  component is required, similar to what is seen in some
          nearby field MSPs. The radio-eclipsing binary MSPs 47 Tuc J, O,
          and  W  show  a  significant non-thermal component, with photon
          index  $\Gamma\sim  1-1.5$,  which  may  originate  in an shock
          formed  due to interaction between the relativistic pulsar wind
          and  matter  from  the  stellar  companion.  We  re-examine the
          X-ray--spindown  luminosity relation ($L_{X}-\dot{E}$) and find
          that  due  to  the  large  uncertainties in both parameters the
          result  is  consistent  with  both  the  linear $L_{X}-\dot{E}$
          relation and the flatter $L_X\propto\dot{E}^{0.5}$ predicted by
          polar cap heating models. In terms of X-ray properties, we find
          no  clear  systematic  differences  between  MSPs  in  globular
          clusters and in the field of the Galaxy.

          NGC  7538 IRS1 is a high-mass (approx. 30 M_sun) protostar with
          a CO outflow, an associated UCHII region, and a linear methanol
          maser   structure,   which  might  trace  a  Keplerian-rotating
          circumstellar  disk.  The  directions of the various associated
          axes  are  misaligned  with  each  other.  We  investigate  the
          near-infrared morphology of the source to clarify the relations
          among    the   various   axes.   K'-band   bispectrum   speckle
          interferometry was performed at two 6-meter-class telescopes --
          the  BTA  6m  telescope  and  the  6.5m MMT. Complementary IRAC
          images  from  the  Spitzer Space Telescope Archive were used to
          relate  the  structures  detected  with  the  outflow at larger
          scales.  High-dynamic  range  images  show  fan-shaped  outflow
          structure  in  which  we  detect  18 stars and several blobs of
          diffuse  emission.  We  interpret  the  misalignment of various
          outflow  axes  in  the  context  of  a  disk  precession model,
          including  numerical  hydrodynamic simulations of the molecular
          emission.  The  precession  period is approx. 280 years and its
          half-opening   angle  is  40  degrees.  A  possible  triggering
          mechanism    is    non-coplanar   tidal   interaction   of   an
          (undiscovered)    close   companion   with   the   circumbinary
          protostellar  disk. Our observations resolve the nearby massive
          protostar  NGC  7538  IRS2 as a close binary with separation of
          195  mas. We find indications for shock interaction between the
          outflow  activities  in  IRS1  and IRS2. Indications of outflow
          precession  have been discovered to date in a number of massive
          protostars,  all  with  large precession angles 20--45 degrees.
          This might explain the difference between the outflow widths in
          low-   and   high-mass  stars  and  add  support  to  a  common
          collimation mechanism.

          present-day mass function in NGC 3603

          version of the preprint can be found at this http URL
          Based  on  deep  VLT/ISAAC  JHK photometry, we have derived the
          present-day  mass function of the central starburst cluster NGC
          3603  YC  (Young Cluster) in the giant HII region NGC 3603. The
          effects  of  field  contamination,  individual reddening, and a
          possible  binary  contribution  are investigated. The MF slopes
          resulting  from the different methods are compared, and lead to
          a  surprisingly  consistent  cluster MF with a slope of Gamma =
          -0.9  +/-  0.15.  Analyzing  different radial annuli around the
          cluster  core,  no significant change in the slope of the MF is
          observed. However, mass segregation in the cluster is evidenced
          by  the  increasing  depletion  of  the  high-mass  tail of the
          stellar  mass  distribution  with increasing radius. We discuss
          the indications of mass segregation with respect to the changes
          observed  in  the binned and cumulative stellar mass functions,
          and  argue that the cumulative function as well as the fraction
          of  high-  to low-mass stars provide better indicators for mass
          segregation than the MF slope alone. (abridged)

          Comments: 27 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in AJ
          We  present  low-resolution  ($R\sim 90$) and medium-resolution
          ($R\sim 2500$) spectropolarimetry of Nova V475 Sct with the HBS
          instrument,  mounted  on  the  0.91-m  telescope at the Okayama
          Astrophysical Observatory, and with FOCAS, mounted on the 8.2-m
          Subaru  telescope.  We  estimated the interstellar polarization
          toward   the   nova  from  the  steady  continuum  polarization
          components   and  H$\alpha$  line  emission  components.  After
          subtracting  the  interstellar  polarization component from the
          observations, we found that the H$\alpha$ emission seen on 2003
          October   7  was  clearly  polarized.  In  the  polarized  flux
          spectrum,  the  H$\alpha$  emission  had  a  distinct  red wing
          extending  to  $\sim  +4900$  km s$^{-1}$ and a shoulder around
          $+3500$  km  s$^{-1}$,  showing  a  constant  position angle of
          linear   polarization   $\theta_{\rm   *}\simeq   155\arcdeg\pm
          15\arcdeg$.  This  suggests  that  the  nova  had an asymmetric
          outflow  with  a  velocity  of  $v_{\rm  wind}\simeq  3500$  km
          s$^{-1}$  or more, which is six times higher than the expansion
          velocity  of  the  ionized  shell  at  the  same  epoch. Such a
          high-velocity  component has not previously been reported for a
          nova  in  the  `moderately  fast' speed class. Our observations
          suggest  the  occurrence  of  violent mass-loss activity in the
          nova  binary  system even during the common-envelope phase. The
          position  angle of the polarization in the H$\alpha$ wing is in
          good agreement with that of the continuum polarization found on
          2003   September  26  ($p_{\rm  *}\simeq  0.4$--0.6  %),  which
          disappeared  within the following 2 d. The uniformity of the PA
          between the continuum polarization and the wing polarization on
          October 7 suggests that the axis of the circumstellar asymmetry
          remained nearly constant during the period of our observations.

          J. Braga & R. Rothschild, AIP Conf. Proc
          The  population  of  accretion-powered  millisecond pulsars has
          grown  rapidly  over the last four years, with the discovery of
          six  new examples to bring the total sample to seven. While the
          first  six  discovered  are  transients  active for a few weeks
          every  two  or  more years, the most recently-discovered source
          HETE  J1900.1-2455,  has been active for more than 8 months. We
          summarise the transient behaviour of the population to estimate
          long-term  time-averaged fluxes, and equate these fluxes to the
          expected  mass  transfer rate driven by gravitational radiation
          in  order to constrain the distances. We also estimate an upper
          limit  of 6 kpc to the distance of IGR J00291+5934 based on the
          non-detection of bursts from this source.

          Title: Force-Free Electrodynamics of Pulsars
          Authors: Andrei Gruzinov (CCPP, NYU)
          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures
          We  show that FFE (Force-Free Electrodynamics) describes pulsar
          magnetospheres  --  even when radiation and particle wind power
          are  comparable  to  the  spin-down power. At the same time, we
          show   that   FFE   is   insufficient  for  calculating  pulsar
          magnetospheres.  This  is  because FFE admits a large family of
          stationary  solutions  with  different  currents flowing in the
          closed  line  region. To choose the actual solution one needs a
          model of current generation which goes beyond pure FFE.
          We   calculate  several  FFE  magnetospheres  for  the  aligned
          rotator.  The Poynting power of these solutions fills the range
          $c^{-3}\mu     ^2\Omega^4~<     ~L~     <~    0.67    c^{-3}\mu
          ^2\Omega^4(c/\Omega  R_s)^2$, for angular velocity $\Omega$ and
          magnetic  field  which is a pure dipole $\mu$ on the surface of
          the star of radius $R_s$.
          Anomalous  braking  indices of young pulsars might be explained
          by currents flowing in the closed-line region.

          Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys
          We  summarize  masses and radii for a number of white dwarfs as
          deduced  from a combination of proper motion studies, Hipparcos
          parallax  distances,  effective  temperatures,  and  binary  or
          spectroscopic  masses. A puzzling feature of these data is that
          some stars appear to have radii which are significantly smaller
          than   that   expected   for   a  standard  electron-degenerate
          white-dwarf  equations  of  state. We construct a projection of
          white-dwarf  radii  for  fixed effective mass and conclude that
          there  is  at  least  marginal  evidence  for bimodality in the
          radius  distribution  forwhite  dwarfs.  We  argue that if such
          compact  white dwarfs exist it is unlikely that they contain an
          iron  core.  We  propose an alternative of strange-quark matter
          within  the white-dwarf core. We also discuss the impact of the
          so-called  color-flavor  locked  (CFL)  state in strange-matter
          core  associated with color superconductivity. We show that the
          data  exhibit  several  features  consistent  with the expected
          mass-radius  relation  of  strange  dwarfs.  We  identify eight
          nearby  white  dwarfs which are possible candidates for strange
          matter   cores   and   suggest   observational  tests  of  this
          hypothesis.

          Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures, in press ChJAA
          The  Parkes  Multibeam  Survey  led  to  the identification ofa
          number  of  long-period  radio pulsars with magnetic field well
          above  the  quantum  critical  field  of  4.4  times 10 to 13 G
          (defined  as  high  magnetic  field  radio  pulsars  -  HBRPs).
          Traditional  pulsar  emission  theories  postulate  that  radio
          emission  is  suppressed  above this critical field. The aim of
          thisproject is to understand emission properties of HBRPs.

          Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures
          Young,  rapidly  rotating  neutron  stars could accelerate ions
          from  their  surface  to  energies  of $\sim 1$ PeV. If protons
          reach   such  energies,  they  will  produce  pions  (with  low
          probability)  through  resonant scattering with x-rays from the
          stellar  surface.  The pions subsequently decay to produce muon
          neutrinos.  Here  we  calculate  the  energy  spectrum  of muon
          neutrinos,  and estimate the event rates at Earth. The spectrum
          consists of a sharp rise at $\sim 50$ TeV, corresponding to the
          onset  of  the  resonance,  above  which  the  flux  drops with
          neutrino  energy  as  $\epsilon_\nu^{-2}$ up to an upper-energy
          cut-off  that  is  determined  by  either  kinematics or by the
          maximum  energy  to  which protons are accelerated. We estimate
          event  rates  as  high  as 10-100 km^${-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ from some
          candidates,  a  flux  that would be easily detected by IceCube.
          Lack  of detection would allow constraints on the energetics of
          the poorly-understood pulsar magnetosphere.

          We first review on the peculiar characteristics of the bursting
          and  flaring  activity  of  the  Soft  Gamma-ray  Repeaters and
          Anomalous  X-ray  Pulsars.  We then report on the properties of
          the  SGR  1806-20's Giant Flare occurred on 2004 December 27th,
          with   particular   interest   on   the   pre  and  post  flare
          intensity/hardness  correlated  variability. We show that these
          findings  are consistent with the picture of a twisted internal
          magnetic field which stresses the star solid crust that finally
          cracks  causing  the  giant  flare  (and the observed torsional
          oscillations).  This  crustal  fracturing  is  accompanied by a
          simplification  of the external magnetic field with a (partial)
          untwisting of the magnetosphere.

          Observations  of  the  inspiral  of  massive binary black holes
          (BBH)  in  the  Laser  Interferometer  Space Antenna (LISA) and
          stellar    mass    binary   black   holes   in   the   European
          Gravitational-Wave    Observatory   (EGO)   offer   an   unique
          opportunity   to  test  the  non-linear  structure  of  general
          relativity.  For  a  binary  composed of two non-spinning black
          holes,  the non-linear general relativistic effects depend only
          on  the  masses  of  the  constituents.  In a recent letter, we
          explored  the  possibility  of  a  test  to  determine  all the
          post-Newtonian  coefficients in the gravitational wave-phasing.
          However,  mutual covariances dilute the effectiveness of such a
          test. In this communication, we propose a more powerful test in
          which   the   various   post-Newtonian   coefficients   in  the
          gravitational  wave  phasing  are  systematically  measured  by
          treating  three of them as independent parameters and demanding
          their mutual consistency. LISA (EGO) will observe BBH inspirals
          with  a  signal-to-noise  ratio  of  more  than  1000 (100) and
          thereby   test   the  self-consistency  of  each  of  the  nine
          post-Newtonian  coefficients that have so-far been computed, by
          measuring  the  lower order coefficients to a relative accuracy
          of $\sim 10^{-5}$ (respectively, $\sim 10^{-4}$) and the higher
          order   coefficients  to  a  relative  accuracy  in  the  range
          $10^{-4}$-0.1 (respectively, $10^{-3}$-1).

          The  recently  started  Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) pulsar
          survey aims to find ~1000 new pulsars. Due to its high time and
          frequency  resolution  the  survey  is  especially sensitive to
          millisecond   pulsars,   which   have  the  potential  to  test
          gravitational  theories,  detect  gravitational waves and probe
          the  neutron-star equation of state. Here we report the results
          of  our  preliminary  analysis:  in  the  first  months we have
          discovered  21  new pulsars. One of these, PSR J1906+0746, is a
          young   144-ms   pulsar   in   a  highly  relativistic  3.98-hr
          low-eccentricity  orbit.  The 2.61 +- 0.02 solar-mass system is
          expected  to coalesce in ~300 Myr and contributes significantly
          to the computed cosmic inspiral rate of compact binary systems.

          Title: High frequency observations of southern pulsars
          Authors: {Simon Johnston, Aris Karastergiou, Kyle Willett
          Comments: Accepted by MNRAS. 13 pages. 6 figures
          We  present polarization data for 32 mainly southern pulsars at
          8.4  GHz.  The observations show that the polarization fraction
          is  low in most pulsars at this frequency except for the young,
          energetic pulsars which continue to show polarization fractions
          in  excess  of  60 per cent. All the pulsars in the sample show
          evidence  for  conal  emission with only one third also showing
          core  emission.  Many  profiles are asymmetric, with either the
          leading  or  the trailing part of cone not detectable. Somewhat
          surprisingly, the asymmetric profiles tend to be more polarized
          than  the symmetrical profiles. Little or no pulse narrowing is
          seen  between  1  and  8.4  GHz.  The spectral behaviour of the
          orthogonal  polarization  modes and radius to frequency mapping
          can likely account for much of the observational phenomenology.
          Highly  polarized  components  may  orginate from higher in the
          magnetosphere than unpolarized components.

          pages, 7 figures
          During   2003,   a  camera  designed  to  measure  the  optical
          pulsations  of  pulsars  was  installed  on  a telescope of the
          H.E.S.S.  array.  The array is designed for gamma-ray astronomy
          in  the  ~100  GeV  -  100  TeV energy regime. The aims of this
          exercise were two-fold: to prove the pulsar timing capabilities
          of  H.E.S.S.  on  all  relevant time-scales, and to explore the
          possibility of performing sensitive optical pulsar measurements
          using   the   ~100   m^2   mirror  of  a  Cherenkov  telescope.
          Measurements   of   the   Crab   pulsar  with  this  instrument
          demonstrate  an order of magnitude sensitivity improvement over
          previous  attempts using Cherenkov telescopes. Here we describe
          the  design  and  performance  of the system and discuss design
          considerations for future instruments of this type.

          Title:  Discovery  of  14  radio  pulsars  in  a  survey of the
          Magellanic Clouds
          Authors: R N Manchester, G Fan, A G Lyne, V M Kaspi
          Comments: In press, ApJ
          A  systematic  survey  of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds
          for  radio  pulsars  using  the  Parkes radio telescope and the
          20-cm  multibeam  receiver  has resulted in the discovery of 14
          pulsars  and  the  redetection  of five of the eight previously
          known  spin-powered  pulsars  believed to lie in the Magellanic
          Clouds.  Of  the  14  new  discoveries,  12 are believed to lie
          within  Clouds,  three in the Small Cloud and nine in the Large
          Cloud,  bringing the total number of known spin-powered pulsars
          in  the  Clouds  to  20. Averaged over all positions within the
          survey  area,  the  survey had a limiting flux density of about
          0.12  mJy.  Observed  dispersion measures suggest that the mean
          free  electron  density  in the Magellanic Clouds is similar to
          that in the disk of our Galaxy. The observed radio luminosities
          have little or no dependence on pulsar period or characteristic
          age and the differential luminosity function is consistent with
          a power-law slope of -1 as is observed for Galactic pulsars.

          It is generally agreed on that the tremendous densities reached
          in  the  centers  of  neutron  stars  provide  a  high-pressure
          environment in which several intriguing particles processes may
          compete  with  each  other.  These range from the generation of
          hyperons  to  quark  deconfinement  to  the  formation  of kaon
          condensates  and H-matter. There are theoretical suggestions of
          even  more  exotic  processes inside neutron stars, such as the
          formation  of  absolutely  stable  strange quark matter. In the
          latter  event,  neutron  stars  would  be  largely  composed of
          strange  quark  matter  possibly  enveloped  in  a thin nuclear
          crust.  This  paper  gives  a  brief overview of these striking
          physical  possibilities  with an emphasis on the role played by
          strangeness   in   neutron   star   matter,  which  constitutes
          compressed  baryonic matter at ultra-high baryon number density
          but  low  temperature  which  is  no accessible to relativistic
          heavy ion collision experiments.

          Title:  The  Environments  around Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Burst
          Progenitors
          Authors: Chris L. Fryer, Gabriel Rockefeller, Patrick A. Young
          Comments: 44 pages including 11 figures
          Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observations have allowed us to
          significantly  constrain  the engines producing these energetic
          explosions.  Te  redshift  and position information provided by
          these   afterglows   have  already  allowed  us  to  limit  the
          progenitors  of  GRBs  to only a few models. The afterglows may
          also   provide  another  observation  that  can  place  further
          constraints  on  the  GRB  progenitor:  measurements telling us
          about  the  environments  surrounding GRBs. Current analyses of
          GRB  afterglows  suggest  that  roughly  half  of long-duration
          gamma-ray  bursts  occur  in surroundings with density profiles
          that  are  uniform.  We  study  the  constraints placed by this
          observation  on  both  the  classic  ``collapsar'' massive star
          progenitor  and its relative, the ``helium-merger'' progenitor.
          We  study  several  aspects of wind mass-loss and find that our
          modifications to the standard Wolf-Rayet mass-loss paradigm are
          not  sufficient  to produce constant density profiles. Although
          this  does  not rule out the standard ``collapsar'' progenitor,
          it  does suggest a deficiency with this model. We then focus on
          the  He-merger  models  and  find that such progenitors can fit
          this   particular   constraint   well.  We  show  how  detailed
          observations  can not only determine the correct progenitor for
          GRBs, but also allow us to study binary evolution physics.

          Title:  Nova  V4743  Sagittarii  2002:  An  Intermediate  Polar
          Candidate
          Authors: Tae W. Kang, Alon Retter, Alex Liu, Mercedes Richards
          Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures, AJ accepted
          We   present  the  results  of  11  nights  of  CCD  unfiltered
          photometry of V4743 Sgr (Nova Sgr 2002 # 3) from 2003 and 2005.
          We  find two periods of 0.2799 d ~ 6.7 h and 0.01642 d ~ 24 min
          in  the  2005 data. The long period is also present in the 2003
          data,  but only weak evidence of the shorter period is found in
          this year. The 24-min period is somewhat longer than the 22-min
          period,  which was detected from X-ray observations. We suggest
          that the 6.7-h periodicity represents the orbital period of the
          underlying binary system and that the 24-min period is the beat
          periodicity  between  the  orbital period and the X-ray period,
          which  is  presumably the spin period of the white dwarf. Thus,
          V4743 Sgr should be classified as an intermediate polar (DQ Her
          star).  About  six  months after the nova outburst, the optical
          light   curve  of  V4743  Sgr  seemed  to  show  quasi-periodic
          oscillations,  which  are  typical  of  the  transient phase in
          classical  nova.  Therefore,  our  results support the previous
          suggestion  that  the trans ition phase in novae may be related
          to intermediate polars.

          Branch Stars
          Authors:  J.  Nordhaus (Univ. Rochester), E. G. Blackman (Univ.
          Rochester)
          Comments: 24 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          A   significant   fraction   of  planetary  nebulae  (PNe)  and
          proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe) exhibit aspherical, axisymmetric
          structures,  many of which are highly collimated. The origin of
          these  structures  is  not  entirely understood, however recent
          evidence suggests that many observed PNe harbor binary systems,
          which  may  play  a  role  in  their  shaping.  In an effort to
          understand  how binaries may produce such asymmetries, we study
          the effect of low-mass (< 0.3 M_sun) companions (planets, brown
          dwarfs  and  low-mass  main  sequence  stars) embedded into the
          envelope  of  a  3.0  M_sun  star  during  three  epochs of its
          evolution  (Red  Giant  Branch,  Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB),
          interpulse  AGB).  We  find  that common envelope evolution can
          lead  to three qualitatively different consequences: (i) direct
          ejection  of  envelope  material  resulting  in a predominately
          equatorial  outflow,  (ii) spin-up of the envelope resulting in
          the  possibility of powering an explosive dynamo driven jet and
          (iii)  tidal  shredding  of  the  companion  into  a disc which
          facilitates  a  disc  driven  jet.  We study how these features
          depend  on  the  secondary's  mass  and  discuss  observational
          consequences.

          Title:  The Constraints on the Relic Gravitational Waves By the
          Current and Future Observations
          Authors: Wen Zhao, Yang Zhang
          Comments: 13 pages, 4 figures
          In  this  paper, by solving the inflationary flow equations, we
          study  the  constraints  on the relic gravitational waves (RGW)
          from  the  observations  at  large scale, i.e. cosmic microwave
          background radiation (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS), and
          those  at  small  scale,  i.e. the pulsar timing, LIGO, and big
          bang   nucleosynthesis   (BBN).   We   find  that  the  current
          constraints  on  the  RGW  from small scale are too loose to be
          ignored,  but which from large scale is relatively tight. Under
          the current constraints, and considering the the damping effect
          of neutrino and accelerating expansion of the Universe, we also
          study  the  detection  ability on RGW of the future observation
          projects  at  large  scale.  i.e.  Planck, CMBPol, and those at
          small  scale, i.e. advanced LIGO, LISA, ASTROD, BBO and DECIGO.
          We  find  the  observations  from  CMB observations have larger
          probability   to   detect   RGW   ($>50%$).   But   the   laser
          interferometers   have   relatively   smaller  probability  for
          detection: the BBO and Ultimate DECIGO project are the possible
          ways   to   detect   RGW   at   small  scale  ($\sim3.48%$  and
          $\sim26.49%$),  but  the  Advanced  LIGO,  LISA and ASTROD have
          little change to detect them.

          We  have  obtained  deep  spectroscopic observations of several
          nearby  gamma-ray  burst  (GRB) host galaxies revealing for the
          first time the presence of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars and numerous O
          stars  located  in  rich  and  compact clusters or star forming
          regions.  Surprisingly,  high  spatial resolution imaging shows
          that  the  GRBs  and the associated supernovae did not occur in
          these regions, but several hundreds of parsec away. Considering
          various  scenarios  for  GRB  progenitors,  we  do not find any
          simple explanation of why they should be preferentially born in
          regions  with  low stellar densities. All the examined GRBs and
          associated  SNe  have  occurred  400  to  800 pc from very high
          density  stellar  environments  including  large  numbers of WR
          stars. Such distances can be travelled through at velocities of
          100  km/s or larger, assuming the travel time to be the typical
          life  time  of  WR  stars.  It  leads  us  to  suggest that GRB
          progenitors  may  be runaway massive stars ejected from compact
          massive  star  clusters.  The  ejection  from  such  super star
          clusters  may  lead  to a spin-up of these stars, producing the
          loss  of  the  hydrogen  and/or helium envelopes leading to the
          origin of the type Ibc supernovae associated with GRBs. If this
          scenario  applies  tocd text/Sc all GRBs, it provides a natural
          explanation  of  the  very small fraction of massive stars that
          emit  a  GRB  at  the end of their life. An alternative to this
          scenario  could  be  a  binary  origin for GRBs, but this still
          requires an explanation of why it would preferentially occur in
          low stellar density regions.

          Title: Discovery of a 3.6-hr Eclipsing Luminous X-Ray Binary in
          the Galaxy NGC 4214
          Authors:  Kajal  K.  Ghosh,  Saul  Rappaport, Allyn F. Tennant,
          Douglas A. Swartz, David Pooley, N. Madhusudhan
          Comments: 7 pages, submitted to ApJ
          We  report  the  discovery  of an eclipsing X-ray binary with a
          3.62-hr period within 24'' of the center of the dwarf starburst
          galaxy   NGC   4214.  The  orbital  period  places  interesting
          constraints  on  the nature of the binary, and allows for a few
          very  different interpretations. The most likely possibility is
          that  the  source  lies  within  NGC  4214  and  has  an  X-ray
          luminosity   of   up   to   0.7e39  erg/s  or  just  below  the
          ultraluminous  X-ray  source range. In this case the binary may
          well  be  comprised  of  a  naked  He-burning donor star with a
          neutron-star   accretor,   though   a  stellar-mass  black-hole
          accretor  cannot  be  completely  excluded. There is no obvious
          evidence  for  a strong stellar wind in the X-ray orbital light
          curve  that would be expected from a massive He star; thus, the
          mass  of  the He star should be < 3-4 solar masses. If correct,
          this  would represent a new class of very luminous X-ray binary
          --  perhaps related to Cyg X-3. Other less likely possibilities
          include  a  conventional  low-mass  X-ray  binary  that somehow
          manages  to  produce  such  a  high  X-ray  luminosity  and  is
          apparently   persistent   over  an  interval  of  years;  or  a
          foreground   AM  Her  binary  of  much  lower  luminosity  that
          fortuitously  lies  in the direction of NGC 4214. Any model for
          this system must accommodate the lack of an optical counterpart
          down to a limiting magnitude of 22.6 in the visible.

          We  present further results from our optical spectrophotometric
          campaign  ongoing at the Astronomical Observatory of Bologna in
          Loiano  (Italy)  on unidentified hard X-ray sources detected by
          INTEGRAL.  We  observed  spectroscopically the putative optical
          counterparts  of  the  INTEGRAL  sources  IGR  J00234+6141, IGR
          J01583+6713,   IGR   J06074+2205,   IGR   J13091+1137  and  IGR
          J20286+2544.  We  find that the first two are Galactic objects,
          namely a Cataclysmic Variable at a distance of about 300 pc and
          a Be/X transient High-Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) located at about
          6.4  kpc, respectively, whereas the last one is identified with
          MCG  +04-48-002,  a  Starburst/HII galaxy at redshift z = 0.013
          hiding  a Seyfert 2 nucleus. We identify IGR J13091+1137 as the
          (likely  Seyfert  2  type)  active  nucleus of galaxy NGC 4992,
          which  we classify as an X-ray Bright, Optically Normal Galaxy;
          this is the first example of this type of object to be detected
          by  INTEGRAL, and one of the closest of this class. We moreover
          confirm  the  possible  Be/X  nature of IGR J06074+2205, and we
          estimate  it  to  be  at  a  distance  of  about 1 kpc. We also
          reexamine the spectrum of the z = 0.087 elliptical radio galaxy
          PKS  0352-686,  the possible counterpart of the INTEGRAL source
          IGR  J03532-6829,  and  we  find  that it is a BL Lac. Physical
          parameters  for  these sources are also evaluated by discussing
          our  findings  in  the context of the available multiwavelength
          information.   These   identifications   further   stress   the
          importance  of INTEGRAL in the study of the hard X-ray spectrum
          of Active Galactic Nuclei, HMXBs and Cataclysmic Variables.

          Title:  An  Association in the Aquila Star-Forming Region: High
          Resolution Infrared Spectroscopy of T Tauri Stars
          Authors:  E.  L.  Rice  (UCLA),  L.  Prato (Lowell Obs.), I. S.
          McLean (UCLA)
          Comments: 7 figures, accepted to Astrophysical Journal
          We  present the properties of a group of young stars associated
          with  the  well-studied  T Tauri star system AS 353, located in
          the  Aquila  star-forming region. The association is identified
          using  radial  velocity measurements of sample objects selected
          from  the  Herbig  and  Bell  Catalog  based  on  their spatial
          proximity  to  AS  353.  Radial velocities of nine objects were
          measured  from  multi-epoch  high-resolution  (R~30,000) H-band
          spectra  obtained  with  NIRSPEC  on  Keck  II. High-resolution
          K-band  spectra  were  also  obtained  for  most  of the sample
          objects.   Spectral   types   and   rotational  velocities  are
          determined  for  all  objects  in  the  sample. The multi-epoch
          H-band  spectra were examined for radial velocity variations in
          order  to  detect possible spectroscopic binaries. Eight of the
          nine  objects have radial velocities that are consistent within
          the 1-sigma scatter of the sample. From their mean of -8.6 km/s
          these  eight objects have a standard deviation of 2 km/s, which
          suggests  that  the  sample stars are related. The ninth object
          shows  significant  radial  velocity variations between epochs,
          characteristic   of   a   spectroscopic   binary.  The  overall
          multiplicity  of  the  sample  is high; we observed 13 stars in
          seven   systems,   identifying   three   new  candidate  binary
          components in this project. Many of the spectra reveal hydrogen
          emission   lines   typical   of   strong  accretion  processes,
          indicating  that  most  of  these  objects harbor circumstellar
          disks  and  are  less  than a few million years old. We discuss
          possible  interpretations  of  the enigmatic pure emission line
          spectrum  of HBC 684. This work represents the highest spectral
          resolution  infrared  observations to date of these intriguing,
          nearby young stars.

          Title: Polarised views of the drifting subpulse phenomenon
          Authors: R. T. Edwards
          Comments:  7  pages,  2  figures, to appear in Chin. J. Astron.
          Astrophys,  proceedings of 2005 Lake Hanas International Pulsar
          Symposium
          I  review  recent  results  concerning  the  shape  of drifting
          subpulse  patterns,  and the relationship to model predictions.
          While  a  variety  of  theoretical  models  exist  for drifting
          subpulses,   observers   typically   think   in   terms   of  a
          spatio-temporal  model  of  circulating  beamlets. Assuming the
          model  is  correct, geometric parameters have been inferred and
          animated  "maps" of the beam have been made. However, the model
          makes  very  specific  predictions  about  the curvature of the
          drift bands that have remained largely untested. Work so far in
          this  area  indicates  that  drift bands tend not to follow the
          prediction, and in some cases discontinuities are seen that are
          suggestive of the superposition of out of phase drift patterns.
          Recent  polarimetric  observations  also  show  that  the drift
          patterns in the two orthogonal polarisation modes are offset in
          phase.  In  one  case  the  pattern in one of the modes shows a
          discontinuity   suggesting   no  less  than  three  superposed,
          out-of-phase   drift   patterns!   I   advise  caution  in  the
          interpretation  of  observational data in the context of overly
          simplistic models.

          Title: Composite Dark Matter and its Charged Constituents
          Authors: K.M. Belotsky, M.Yu. Khlopov, K.I.Shibaev
          Comments: Latex, 8pages
          Stable  charged  heavy leptons and quarks can exist and hide in
          elusive atoms, bound by Coulomb attraction and playing the role
          of  dark  matter.  However, in the expanding Universe it is not
          possible  to  recombine  all  the  charged  particles into such
          atoms,  and the positively charged particles, which escape this
          recombination,  bind  with  electrons  in  atoms  of  anomalous
          isotopes  with  pregalactic  abundance, exceeding substantially
          the terrestrial upper limits. This abundance can not be reduced
          in  the  dense  matter  bodies, if negatively charged particles
          have  charge  -1.  Therefore  composite dark matter can involve
          only  negatively charged particles with charge -2, while stable
          heavy  particles  with  charge -1 should be excluded. Realistic
          scenarios  of  composite  dark matter, avoiding this problem of
          anomalous   isotope  over-production,  inevitably  predict  the
          existence  of  primordial  "atoms",  in which primordial helium
          traps  all  the free negatively charged heavy constituents with
          charge  -2.  Study of the possibility for such primordial heavy
          $\alpha$  particle  with compensated charge to exist as well as
          the  search  for the stable charged constituents in cosmic rays
          and accelerators provide crucial test for composite dark matter
          scenarios.

          Title: The Stability of Strange Star Crusts and Strangelets
          Authors:  Mark  G.  Alford,  Krishna  Rajagopal,  Sanjay Reddy,
          Andrew Steiner
          Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX
          We  construct  strangelets,  taking  into account electrostatic
          effects,  including  Debye  screening,  and  arbitrary  surface
          tension sigma of the interface between vacuum and quark matter.
          We  find  that  there  is a critical surface tension sigma_crit
          below which large strangelets are unstable to fragmentation and
          below   which   quark   star  surfaces  will  fragment  into  a
          crystalline  crust  made  of charged strangelets immersed in an
          electron   gas.  We  derive  a  model-independent  relationship
          between  sigma_crit  and  two  parameters that characterize any
          quark  matter equation of state. For reasonable model equations
          of state, we find sigma_crit typically of order a few MeV/fm^2.
          If sigma <= sigma_crit, the size-distribution of strangelets in
          cosmic  rays  could  feature a peak corresponding to the stable
          strangelets that we construct.

          of  the  IXth  Workshop  on  High  Energy Physics Phenomenology
          (WHEPP-9), Bhubaneswar, India, 3-14 Jan. 2006
          We  investigate  the  impact of magnetic fields on the electron
          distribution   in   the   electrosphere  of  quark  stars.  For
          moderately    strong    magnetic   fields   $B\sim   10^{13}$G,
          quantization effects are generally weak due to the large number
          density  of  electrons  at surface, but can nevertheless affect
          the  spectral  features  of  quark  stars.  We outline the main
          observational  characteristics  of quark stars as determined by
          their  surface emission, and briefly discuss their formation in
          explosive  events termed Quark-Novae, which may be connected to
          the $r$-process.

          Thermal-gravitational  instability  (TGI)  is  studied  in  the
          protogalactic  environment.  We extend our previous work, where
          we found that dense clumps first form out of hot background gas
          by  thermal instability and later a small fraction of them grow
          to   virialized   clouds   of  mass  M_c  >~  6X10^6  M_sun  by
          gravitational  infall  and merging. But these clouds have large
          angular   momentum,   so   they  would  be  difficult,  if  not
          impossible,  to  further evolve into globular clusters. In this
          paper,  through three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in a
          uniformly  rotating frame, we explore if the Coriolis force due
          to  rotation  in  protogalactic  disk regions can hinder binary
          merging  and reduce angular momentum of the clouds formed. With
          rotation  comparable  to  the  Galactic  rotation  at the Solar
          circle,  the  Coriolis force is smaller than the pressure force
          during  the  early thermal instability stage. So the properties
          of  clumps  formed  by  thermal  instability  are  not affected
          noticeably  by  rotation,  except  increased  angular momentum.
          However, during later stage the Coriolis force becomes dominant
          over   the   gravity,   and   hence   the   further  growth  to
          gravitationally   bound  clouds  by  gravitational  infall  and
          merging is prohibited. Our results show that the Coriolis force
          effectively  destroys  the  picture of cloud formation via TGI,
          rather than alleviate the problem of large angular momentum.

          Globally  symmetric spinor condensates in free space are argued
          not  to  support  stable  topological  defects in either two or
          three  dimensions.  In the latter case, however, we show that a
          topological  skyrmion  can be stabilized by forcing it to adopt
          certain  density  profiles.  A  sufficient  condition  for  the
          existence   of   a  stable  skyrmion  in  three  dimensions  is
          formulated  and  illustrated  in  simple  examples. Our results
          pertain to Bose-Einstein condensation in Rb.

          rotation  comparable  to  the  Galactic  rotation  at the Solar
          circle,  the  Coriolis force is smaller than the pressure force
          during  the  early thermal instability stage. So the properties
          of  clumps  formed  by  thermal  instability  are  not affected
          noticeably  by  rotation,  except  increased  angular momentum.
          However, during later stage the Coriolis force becomes dominant
          over   the   gravity,   and   hence   the   further  growth  to
          gravitationally   bound  clouds  by  gravitational  infall  and
          merging is prohibited. Our results show that the Coriolis force
          effectively  destroys  the  picture of cloud formation via TGI,
          rather than alleviate the problem of large angular momentum.

          Title: Stable skyrmions in spinor condensates
          Authors: Igor F. Herbut, Masaki Oshikawa
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures
          Subj-class:  Superconductivity;  Statistical Mechanics; Pattern
          Formation and Solitons
          Globally  symmetric spinor condensates in free space are argued
          not  to  support  stable  topological  defects in either two or
          three  dimensions.  In the latter case, however, we show that a
          topological  skyrmion  can be stabilized by forcing it to adopt
          certain  density  profiles.  A  sufficient  condition  for  the
          existence   of   a  stable  skyrmion  in  three  dimensions  is
          formulated  and  illustrated  in  simple  examples. Our results
          pertain to Bose-Einstein condensation in Rb.

          Title: The X-ray properties of the dwarf Magellanic-type galaxy
          NGC 55

          MNRAS
          We   present  an  analysis  of  the  X-ray  properties  of  the
          Magellanic-type   galaxy   NGC   55  based  on  two  contiguous
          XMM-Newton observations. We detect a total of 137 X-ray sources
          in  the  field  of  view,  42  of  which are located within the
          optical  confines  of  the galaxy. On the basis of X-ray colour
          classification  and after correcting for background objects, we
          conclude that our source sample includes ~ 20 X-ray binaries, 5
          supernova  remnants  and  7 very soft sources (including 2 good
          candidate  supersoft  sources) associated with NGC 55. Detailed
          spectral  and  timing  analysis  was  carried  out  on 4 of the
          brightest  X-ray  sources.  One  of these objects is identified
          with  a  Galactic  foreground star and is a possible new RS CVn
          system.  The  other  three  are consistent with accreting X-ray
          binaries,  though further evidence of short term variability is
          required   to  confirm  this.  We  also  find  evidence  of  an
          underlying  component,  which is concentrated on the bar region
          but  has  an  extent of at least 6' (3 kpc) in the plane of the
          galaxy  and  +/-  1'  (+/-  500  pc)  perpendicular to it. This
          emission  is  best  fitted  by  a thermal plasma plus power-law
          model  but  with  high intrinsic absorption consistent with its
          location  in  the  central disc of the galaxy. We interpret the
          soft component as diffuse thermal emission linked to regions of
          current star formation, whilst the hard power-law component may
          originate  in  unresolved  X-ray  binary sources. The intrinsic
          luminosity  of this residual disc emission may exceed Lx ~ 6e38
          ergs/s  (0.3-6 keV). A comparison with other Magellanic systems
          confirms  that,  in  terms  of  both  its discrete X-ray source
          population   and  its  extended  emission,  NGC  55  has  X-ray
          properties which are typical of its class.

          PSR B1931+24 (J1933+2421) behaves as an ordinary isolated radio
          pulsar  during  active phases that are 5-10 days long. However,
          the  radio  emission  switches  off in less than 10 seconds and
          remains  undetectable for the next 25-35 days, then it switches
          on  again.  This pattern repeats quasi-periodically. The origin
          of  this behaviour is unclear. Even more remarkably, the pulsar
          rotation  slows  down  50% faster when it is on than when it is
          off.  This  indicates  a  massive  increase  in  magnetospheric
          currents  when the pulsar switches on, proving that pulsar wind
          plays  a  substantial role in pulsar spin-down. This allows us,
          for  the  first  time,  to  estimate  the  currents in a pulsar

          Title:   Star  formation  through  gravitational  collapse  and
          competitive accretion
          Authors: Ian A. Bonnell (St Andrews), Matthew R. Bate (Exeter)
          Comments: 7 pages, 1 figure, MNRAS, in press
          Competitive  accretion,  a process to explain the origin of the
          IMF,  occurs  when  stars  in  a common gravitational potential
          accrete  from  a  distributed  gaseous  component. We show that
          concerns  recently  raised  on  the  efficiency  of competitive
          accretion   are   incorrect   as  they  use  globally  averaged
          properties  which are inappropriate for the detailed physics of
          a   forming  stellar  cluster.  A  full  treatment  requires  a
          realistic  treatment of the cluster potential, the distribution
          of  turbulent  velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does
          not  travel  at the global virial velocity of the system due to
          the  velocity-sizescale  relation inherent in turbulent gas and
          due  to  the  lower  velocity dispersion of small-N clusters in
          which  much  of  the  accretion  occurs.  Stars  located in the
          gas-rich  centres  of  such  systems initially accrete from low
          relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to
          accrete  the  higher  velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of
          such  potentials,  or  that  enter  the  cluster later when the
          velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete significantly and
          thus  retain  their  low-masses. In competitive accretion, most
          stars  do not continue to accrete significantly such that their
          masses  are  set  from the fragmentation process. It is the few
          stars  which continue to accrete that become higher-mass stars.
          Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be responsible for
          the  formation  of  higher-mass  stars and can explain the mass
          distribution,  mass  segregation  and binary frequency of these
          stars.   Global  kinematics  of  competitive  accretion  models
          include large-scale mass infall, with mean inflow velocities of
          order  0.5  km/s at scales of 0.5 pc, but infall signatures are
          likely  to  be  confused by the large tangential velocities and
          the velocity dispersion present.

          Title: Strategies for observing extreme mass ratio inspirals
          Authors: Steve Drasco
          Comments: 16 pages, submitted to the proceedings of 10th Annual
          Gravitational Wave Data Analysis Workshop (GWDAW 10)
          I  review  the  status  of  research, conducted by a variety of
          independent  groups,  aimed  at  the  eventual  observation  of
          Extreme  Mass  Ratio  Inspirals (EMRIs) with gravitational wave
          detectors. EMRIs are binary systems in which one of the objects
          is  much  more massive than the other, and which are in a state
          of  dynamical  evolution  that  is  dominated by the effects of
          gravitational  radiation.  Although  these  systems  are highly
          relativistic,  with  the  smaller object moving relative to the
          larger  at  nearly  light-speed,  they  are  well  described by
          perturbative  calculations  which  exploit  the mass ratio as a
          natural   small   parameter.   I   review   the   use  of  such
          approximations  to  generate  waveforms needed by data analysis
          algorithms for observation. I also briefly review the status of
          developing the data analysis algorithms themselves.

          IMF,  occurs  when  stars  in  a common gravitational potential
          accrete  from  a  distributed  gaseous  component. We show that
          concerns  recently  raised  on  the  efficiency  of competitive
          accretion   are   incorrect   as  they  use  globally  averaged
          properties  which are inappropriate for the detailed physics of
          a   forming  stellar  cluster.  A  full  treatment  requires  a
          realistic  treatment of the cluster potential, the distribution
          of  turbulent  velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does
          not  travel  at the global virial velocity of the system due to
          the  velocity-sizescale  relation inherent in turbulent gas and
          due  to  the  lower  velocity dispersion of small-N clusters in
          which  much  of  the  accretion  occurs.  Stars  located in the
          gas-rich  centres  of  such  systems initially accrete from low
          relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to
          accrete  the  higher  velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of
          such  potentials,  or  that  enter  the  cluster later when the
          velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete significantly and
          thus  retain  their  low-masses. In competitive accretion, most
          stars  do not continue to accrete significantly such that their
          masses  are  set  from the fragmentation process. It is the few
          stars  which continue to accrete that become higher-mass stars.
          Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be responsible for
          the  formation  of  higher-mass  stars and can explain the mass
          distribution,  mass  segregation  and binary frequency of these
          stars.   Global  kinematics  of  competitive  accretion  models
          include large-scale mass infall, with mean inflow velocities of
          order  0.5  km/s at scales of 0.5 pc, but infall signatures are
          likely  to  be  confused by the large tangential velocities and
          the velocity dispersion present.

          Title: Strategies for observing extreme mass ratio inspirals
          Authors: Steve Drasco
          Comments: 16 pages, submitted to the proceedings of 10th Annual
          Gravitational Wave Data Analysis Workshop (GWDAW 10)
          I  review  the  status  of  research, conducted by a variety of
          independent  groups,  aimed  at  the  eventual  observation  of
          Extreme  Mass  Ratio  Inspirals (EMRIs) with gravitational wave
          detectors. EMRIs are binary systems in which one of the objects
          is  much  more massive than the other, and which are in a state
          of  dynamical  evolution  that  is  dominated by the effects of
          gravitational  radiation.  Although  these  systems  are highly
          relativistic,  with  the  smaller object moving relative to the
          larger  at  nearly  light-speed,  they  are  well  described by
          perturbative  calculations  which  exploit  the mass ratio as a
          natural   small   parameter.   I   review   the   use  of  such
          approximations  to  generate  waveforms needed by data analysis
          algorithms for observation. I also briefly review the status of
          developing the data analysis algorithms themselves.

          MNRAS
          We   present  an  analysis  of  the  X-ray  properties  of  the
          Magellanic-type   galaxy   NGC   55  based  on  two  contiguous
          XMM-Newton observations. We detect a total of 137 X-ray sources
          in  the  field  of  view,  42  of  which are located within the
          optical  confines  of  the galaxy. On the basis of X-ray colour
          classification  and after correcting for background objects, we
          conclude that our source sample includes ~ 20 X-ray binaries, 5
          supernova  remnants  and  7 very soft sources (including 2 good
          candidate  supersoft  sources) associated with NGC 55. Detailed
          spectral  and  timing  analysis  was  carried  out  on 4 of the
          brightest  X-ray  sources.  One  of these objects is identified
          with  a  Galactic  foreground star and is a possible new RS CVn
          system.  The  other  three  are consistent with accreting X-ray
          binaries,  though further evidence of short term variability is
          required   to  confirm  this.  We  also  find  evidence  of  an
          underlying  component,  which is concentrated on the bar region
          but  has  an  extent of at least 6' (3 kpc) in the plane of the
          galaxy  and  +/-  1'  (+/-  500  pc)  perpendicular to it. This
          emission  is  best  fitted  by  a thermal plasma plus power-law
          model  but  with  high intrinsic absorption consistent with its
          location  in  the  central disc of the galaxy. We interpret the
          soft component as diffuse thermal emission linked to regions of
          current star formation, whilst the hard power-law component may
          originate  in  unresolved  X-ray  binary sources. The intrinsic
          luminosity  of this residual disc emission may exceed Lx ~ 6e38
          ergs/s  (0.3-6 keV). A comparison with other Magellanic systems
          confirms  that,  in  terms  of  both  its discrete X-ray source
          population   and  its  extended  emission,  NGC  55  has  X-ray
          properties which are typical of its class.

          PSR B1931+24 (J1933+2421) behaves as an ordinary isolated radio
          pulsar  during  active phases that are 5-10 days long. However,
          the  radio  emission  switches  off in less than 10 seconds and
          remains  undetectable for the next 25-35 days, then it switches
          on  again.  This pattern repeats quasi-periodically. The origin
          of  this behaviour is unclear. Even more remarkably, the pulsar
          rotation  slows  down  50% faster when it is on than when it is
          off.  This  indicates  a  massive  increase  in  magnetospheric
          currents  when the pulsar switches on, proving that pulsar wind
          plays  a  substantial role in pulsar spin-down. This allows us,
          for  the  first  time,  to  estimate  the  currents in a pulsar
          magnetospheric during the occurrence of radio emission.

          Title: Populating the Galaxy with low-mass X-ray binaries
          Authors: Paul D. Kiel, Jarrod R. Hurley
          Comments: 17 pages and 9 figures; accepted by MNRAS
          We   perform   binary   population  synthesis  calculations  to
          investigate  the incidence of low-mass X-ray binaries and their
          birth  rate  in the Galaxy. We use a binary evolution algorithm
          that   models   all  the  relevant  processes  including  tidal
          circularization   and   synchronization.   Parameters   in  the
          evolution  algorithm  that  are  uncertain and may affect X-ray
          binary  formation are allowed to vary during the investigation.
          We  agree with previous studies that under standard assumptions
          of binary evolution the formation rate and number of black-hole
          low-mass X-ray binaries predicted by the model are more than an
          order of magnitude less than what is indicated by observations.
          We  find that the common-envelope process cannot be manipulated
          to  produce  significant  numbers  of black-hole low-mass X-ray
          binaries.  However,  by simply reducing the mass-loss rate from
          helium  stars  adopted  in  the  standard model, to a rate that
          agrees  with  the  latest  data, we produce a good match to the
          observations.  Including  low-mass  X-ray  binaries that evolve
          from   intermediate-mass   systems  also  leads  to  favourable
          results.  We  stress  that  constraints  on  the  X-ray  binary
          population  provided  by observations are used here merely as a
          guide   as   surveys   suffer   from  incompleteness  and  much
          uncertainty is involved in the interpretation of results.

          of the average pulse by a factor of 200, in which it stands out
          from  all known pulsars with GPs. PSR J1752+2359 as well as the
          previously  detected  PSR B0031-07 and PSR B1112+50, belongs to
          the  first  group  of  pulsars found to have GPs without a high

          We  present  XMM-Newton  and  Chandra X-ray observations of the
          middle-aged  radio  pulsar PSR B0355+54. Our X-ray observations
          reveal  emission not only from the pulsar itself, but also from
          a  compact  diffuse  component  extending ~50'' in the opposite
          direction to the pulsar's proper motion. There is also evidence
          for the presence of fainter diffuse emission extending ~5' from
          the  point  source.  The compact diffuse feature is well-fitted
          with  a  power-law,  the  index of which is consistent with the
          values  found  for other pulsar wind nebulae. The morphology of
          the  diffuse  component is similar to the ram-pressure confined
          pulsar  wind  nebulae  detected  for  other  sources. The X-ray
          emission  from the pulsar itself is described well by a thermal
          plus  power-law  fit,  with  the  thermal  emission most likely
          originating in a hot polar cap.

          Title:  EXO  0748-676  Rules  out  Soft  Equations of State for
          Neutron Star Matter
          Authors: F. Ozel (University of Arizona)
          Comments: To appear in Nature, press embargo until publication
          The  interiors  of  neutron  stars  contain matter at very high
          densities,  in a state that differs greatly from those found in
          the  early  universe  or  achieved  at terrestrial experiments.
          Matter   in   these  conditions  can  only  be  probed  through
          astrophysical  observations that measure the mass and radius of
          neutron  stars with sufficient precision. Here I report for the
          first time a unique determination of the mass and radius of the
          neutron  star  EXO  0748-676, which appears to rule out all the
          soft  equations of state of neutron star matter. If this object
          is typical, then condensates and unconfined quarks do not exist
          in the centers of neutron stars.

          We  present  medium-resolution optical spectra of the secondary
          star  in the high Galactic latitude black hole X-ray binary XTE
          J1118+480 and determine the abundance of Mg, Al, Ca, Fe, and Ni
          in  its  atmosphere.  For all the elements investigated we find
          supersolar  abundances; thus, we reject the hypothesis that the
          black  hole came from the direct collapse of an ancient massive
          halo  star.  The  compact  primary  most  likely  formed  in  a
          supernova   event  of  a  massive  star  whose  nucleosynthetic
          products  polluted  the  secondary  star.  The observed element
          abundances and their ratios can be explained using a variety of
          supernova  models  with a wide range of metallicities. While an
          explosive  origin  in the Galactic halo or thick disk cannot be
          discarded,  a  metal-rich  progenitor is clearly favored by the
          observed  abundance  pattern. This suggests that the black hole
          was  produced  in  the  Galactic thin disk with a violent natal
          kick,  propelling  the X-ray binary to its current location and
          orbit.

          Title:  Neutron  stars  in  globular  clusters:  formation  and
          observational manifestations
          Authors: A.G.Kuranov, K.A.Postnov
          Comments: LATEX, 21 pages, 8 gif figures, Astronomy Letters, in
          press
          Population  synthesis  is  used  to model the number of neutron
          stars  in  globular  clusters  that  are  observed as LMXBs and
          millisecond  PSRs. The dynamical interaction between binary and
          single  stars  in  a  GC  are  assumed  to  take  place  with a
          permanently  replenished  "background"  of  single  stars whose
          density  distribution keeps track with the cluster evolution as
          a  whole  and  evolution of single stars. We use the hypothesis
          (Podsiadlowski  et  al)  that NS forming in binary systems from
          components  with  initial  masses  \sim 8-12 M_\odot during the
          electron-capture collapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg core do not
          acquire  a  high  space  velocities  (kicks). The remaining NSs
          (i.e.  from  single  stars with M>8 M_\odot or binary comonents
          with  M>12  M_\odot) are assumed to be born with high kicks, as
          found  from obsrevations of single pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005).
          Under this assumption, a sizeable fraction of NSs remain in GCs
          (about  1000  NSs in a GC with a mass of 5\times 10^5 M_\odot).
          The  number  of  ms  PSRs  formed  in the cluster via accretion
          spin-up  in binaries is then about 10, which is consistent with
          observations.  Our  modelling  reproduces the observed shape of
          the  X-ray  luminosity  function  for accreting NSs in binaries
          with  normal  and degenerate components and the distribution of
          spin  periods  of  ms  PSRs  in  GCs  under  the  assumption of
          accretion-driven  magnetic  field  decay  of NSs up to a bottom
          value  of  10^8  G. The number of LMXBs and ms PSRs dynamically
          expelling from GCs is also calculated.

          Title: A Neutron Star in F-sharp
          Authors: Jonathan E. Grindlay
          Comments: Invited Perspective for Science; 3 pages, 3 figures
          Journal-ref: Science, 311, 1876 (2006)
          In  this short introductory commentary on the paper (Hessels et
          al  2006,  Science,  311,  1901) reporting the discovery of the
          shortest  spin  period  millisecond pulsar (MSP) Ter5-ad in the
          globular  cluster  Terzan 5, I also point out a new explanation
          for possible minimum spin periods, P, of MSPs without requiring
          gravitational  radiation  (or  other) slow-down torques. If the
          accretion  of  matter  required  to  spinup  a MSP also reduces
          (buries)  the  neutron star (NS) magnetic field, B, as commonly
          believed,  an inverse correlation between neutron star mass, M,
          and  B is expected together with a positive correlation between
          P  and  B.  Both  are  suggested  for  the  4 MSPs with NS mass
          measures reported (Latimer and Prakash 2004, Science, 304, 536)
          to have <~10% uncertainties. The correlations imply the Ter5-ad
          NS  has  ~2.5 Msun, B ~5 x 10^7 G and thus Pdot ~3 x 10^-21 s/s
          --  which  can  be  tested  when a timing solution is found. If
          confirmed,  the  highest spin frequency NSs do not pulse simply
          because their B fields are too low.

          Globulars
          Authors: Jonathan E. Grindlay

          Colloquium  on  "Spectra and Timing of Compact X-ray Binaries",
          Mumbai, India (Jan. 2005), to be published in journal: Advances
          in Space Research (Elsevier)
          We  review  new  Chandra  and  HST  observations  of  the  core
          collapsed  cluster  NGC  6397  as  a guide to understanding the
          compact binary (CB) populations in core collapse globulars. New
          cataclysmic variables (CVs) and main sequence chromospherically
          active  binaries  (ABs) have been identified, enabling a larger
          sample  for  comparison  of the Lx, Fx/Fv and X-ray vs. optical
          color  distributions.  Comparison of the numbers of CBs with Lx
          >10^31  erg/s  in  4  core  collapse vs. 12 King model clusters
          reveals  that the specific frequency Sx (number of CBs per unit
          cluster  mass) is enhanced in core collapse clusters, even when
          normalized  for  their  stellar  encounter  rate. Although core
          collapse is halted by the dynamical heating due to stellar (and
          binary)  interaction  with  CBs  in  the core, we conclude that
          production  of the hardest CBs -- especially CVs -- is enhanced
          during  core  collapse.  NGC  6397  has  its  most luminous CVs
          nearest  the cluster center, with two newly discovered very low
          luminosity  (old,  quiescent) CVs far from the core. The active
          binaries  as  well  as  neutron  star  systems  (MSP and qLMXB)
          surround the central core. The overall CB population appears to
          be  asymmetric  about  the  cluster center, as in several other
          core  collapse clusters observed with Chandra, suggesting still
          poorly-understood scattering processes.

          Comments:  16  pages, 7 figures. To appear in the Classical and
          Quantum Gravity special issue on Numerical Relativity
          We  introduce  a  computational  framework which avoids solving
          explicitly  hydrodynamic equations and is suitable to study the
          pre-merger evolution of black hole-neutron star binary systems.
          The  essence  of  the method consists of constructing a neutron
          star  model  with  a  black  hole  companion  and  freezing the
          internal  degrees  of  freedom  of  the neutron star during the
          course  of the evolution of the space-time geometry. We present
          the  main ingredients of the framework, from the formulation of
          the  problem  to  the  appropriate  computational techniques to
          study  these  binary systems. In addition, we present numerical
          results of the construction of initial data sets and evolutions
          that demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.

          We  present  the first high time-resolution simultaneous X-ray,
          ultraviolet,  and  optical  observations  of X-ray bursts in UY
          Vol,  the  optical counterpart of the low mass X-ray binary EXO
          0748-676,   obtained  with  RXTE,  HST,  and  Gemini-S.  Strong
          reprocessed signals are present in the ultraviolet (a factor of
          4) and optical (a factor of 2.5). These signals are lagged with
          respect to the X-rays and appear significantly smeared as well.
          The   addition  of  far-ultraviolet  coverage  for  one  burst,
          together  with  the  high  quality  of  the dataset, allow much
          tighter  constraints  upon  the temperature and geometry of the
          reprocessing  region  than  previously  possible. A single-zone
          black body reprocessing model for this burst suggests a rise in
          temperatures  during  the  burst  from 18,000 to 35,000K and an
          emitting  area  comparable to that expected for the disk and/or
          irradiated  companion  star. The lags, a mean of 4.0s and range
          of  2.5s, are consistent with those expected within the binary.
          The  single-zone black body model cannot reproduce the ratio of
          optical  to  ultraviolet  flux  during  the burst, however. The
          discrepancy,  corresponding  to  underpredicting the optical by
          more  than  a  factor  of  two, seems too large to explain with
          deviations  from  a  local  black body spectrum and more likely
          indicates   that  a  range  of  reprocessing  temperatures  are
          required,  as  would  be  expected,  with  cooler  regions  not
          contributing  to  the  UV.  Comparable results are derived from
          other  bursts,  and  in  particular  the  lag and smearing both
          appear  shorter  when the companion star is on the near side of
          the disk as predicted. The burst observed by HST also yielded a
          spectrum of the reprocessed light. [Abridged]

          Title: Rocking the Lighthouse: Circumpulsar Asteroids and Radio
          Intermittency
          Authors: J. M. Cordes, R. M. Shannon
          Comments: 20 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We propose that neutral, circumpulsar debris entering the light
          cylinder  can  account for many time-dependent pulsar phenomena
          that  are  otherwise  difficult  to  explain.  Neutral material
          avoids  propeller  ejection  and  injects sufficient charges --
          after  heating, evaporation, and ionization -- to alter current
          flows   and   pair-production  and  thus  trigger,  detune,  or
          extinguish  coherent  emission.  Relevant  phenomena, with time
          scales  from  seconds  to months, include nulls, rotating radio
          transients  (RRATs),  rapid  changes  in  pulse profile (``mode
          changes''),   variable  subpulse  drift  rates,  quasi-periodic
          bursts  from  B1931+24,  and torque variations. Over the 10 Myr
          lifetime  of  a  canonical  pulsar  with trillion-gauss surface
          magnetic  field,  less  than  a  millionth  of an Earth mass of
          material  is needed to modulate the Goldreich-Julian current by
          100%.   Circumpulsar   material   originates  from  metal-rich,
          supernova  fallback  gas that aggregates into asteroids. Debris
          disks   can  inject  sufficient  material  on  time  scales  of
          interest,  yet  be too tenuous to form large planets detectable
          in   pulse   timing   data.  Asteroid  migration  results  from
          collisions    and    the    radiation-driven    Yarkovsky   and
          Poynting-Robertson  effects.  For  B1931+24,  an  asteroid in a
          $\sim  40$~day  elliptical  orbit  pollutes  the  magnetosphere
          stochastically  through collisions with other debris. Injection
          is  less likely for hot, young and highly magnetized pulsars or
          millisecond  pulsars  that  pre-ionize any debris material well
          outside  their  small  magnetospheres.  Injection  effects will
          therefore  be  most  prominent  in long-period, cooler pulsars,
          consistent  with  the distribution of relevant objects in perid
          and   period  derivative.  A  pulsar's  spin  history  and  its
          radiation-beam  orientation  may  influence whether it displays
          nulling, RRATs and other effects.

          Title: Nature of giant pulses in radio pulsars
          Authors: S. A. Petrova
          Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures. Invited review for the 2005 Hanas
          Lake International Pulsar Symposium, to appear in ChJAA
          Formation  of  giant  radio pulses is attributed to propagation
          effects   in   the  plasma  of  pulsar  magnetosphere.  Induced
          scattering  of  radio waves by the plasma particles is found to
          lead  to  an  efficient redistribution of the radio emission in
          frequency.   With  the  steep  spectrum  of  pulsar  radiation,
          intensity  transfer  between  the widely spaced frequencies may
          imply  significant  narrow-band amplification of the radiation.
          This may give rise to giant pulses. It is demonstrated that the
          statistics   of   giant   pulse  intensities  observed  can  be
          reproduced if one take into account pulse-to-pulse fluctuations
          of  the  plasma  number  density  and  the  original intensity.
          Polarization properties of the strongly amplified pulses, their
          location  in  the  average  pulse  window and the origin of the
          nanostructure of giant pulses are discussed as well.

          Title:   Relativistic   mechanics   of  neutron  superfluid  in
          (magneto) elastic star crust
          Authors: Brandon Carter, Lars Samuelsson
          Comments: 28 pages, Latex
          At densities below the neutron drip threshold, a purely elastic
          solid  model  (including,  if  necessary,  a frozen-in magnetic
          field)  can  provide  an adequate description of a neutron star
          crust,  but  at  higher densities it will be necessary to allow
          for  the  penetration  of the solid lattice by an independently
          moving current of superfluid neutrons. In order to do this, the
          previously available category of relativistic elasticity models
          is  combined  here  with  a  separately  developed  category of
          relativistic  superfluidity models in a unified treatment based
          on  the  use  of  an appropriate Lagrangian master function. As
          well  as  models  of  the purely variational kind, in which the
          vortices  flow  freely  with  the fluid, such a master function
          also  provides  a  corresponding  category  of  non-dissipative
          models in which the vortices are pinned to the solid structure.

          We  present  our  findings based on a detailed analysis for the
          binaries  of  the Hyades, in which the masses of the components
          are  well  known.  We  fit the models of components of a binary
          system  to  the observations so as to give the observed total V
          and   B-V  of  that  system  and  the  observed  slope  of  the
          main-sequence  in  the  corresponding  parts.  According to our
          findings,  there  is  a  very definite relationship between the
          mixing-length  parameter  and  the  stellar  mass.  The fitting
          formula  for  this  relationship  can be given as $alpha = 9.19
          (M/M_sun-0.74)^{0.053}-6.65$, which is valid for stellar masses
          greater  than  0.77  M_sun.  While  no  strict  information  is
          gathered  for  the  chemical  composition  of the cluster, as a
          result  of  degeneracy  in  the  colour-magnitude  diagram,  by
          adopting  Z=0.033 and using models for the components of 70 Tau
          and  theta^2  Tau  we find the hydrogen abundance to be X=0.676
          and  the  age  to  be  670 Myr. If we assume that Z=0.024, then
          X=0.718  and  the  age  is 720 Myr. Our findings concerning the
          mixing  length  parameter  are  valid  for  both  sets  of  the
          solution.  For both components of the active binary system V818
          Tau,  the  differences between radii of the models with Z=0.024
          and   the  observed  radii  are  only  about  4  percent.  More
          generally, the effective temperatures of the models of low mass
          stars  in the binary systems studied are in good agreement with
          those determined by spectroscopic methods.

          Title: The X-ray Halo of GX5-1
          Authors:  Randall  K Smith, T. M. Dame, Elisa Costantini, Peter
          Predehl
          Comments: 10 pages, accepted by ApJ
          Using Chandra observations we have measured the energy-resolved
          dust-scattered  X-ray  halo  around  the  low-mass X-ray binary
          GX5-1, which shows signs of both singly- and multiply-scattered
          X-rays. We compared the observed X-ray halo at various energies
          to  predictions  from  a  range of dust models. These fits used
          both  smoothly-distributed  dust  as  well  as  dust in clumped
          clouds, with CO and 21 cm observations helping to determine the
          position  of  the clouds along the line of sight. We found that
          the BARE-GR-B model of Zubko, Dwek & Arendt (2004 generally led
          to  the best results, although inadequacies in both the overall
          model  and  the  data limit our conclusions. We also found that
          the  composite  dust  models  of  Zubko,  Dwek & Arendt (2004),
          especially  the  ``no  carbon''  models,  gave  uniformly  poor
          results.  Although  models  using cloud positions and densities
          derived  naively  from  CO  and  21 cm data gave generally poor
          results,  plausible  adjustments to the distance of the largest
          cloud  and  the mass of a cloud in the expanding 3 kpc Arm lead
          to significantly improved fits. We suggest that combining X-ray
          halo,  CO,  and 21 cm observations will be a fruitful method to
          improve  our  understanding  of both the gas and dust phases of
          the interstellar medium.

          Title: Statistics of the drifting subpulse phenomenon

          Astrophys,  proceedings of 2005 Lake Hanas International Pulsar
          Symposium
          We  present  the  statistical results of a systematic, unbiased
          search  for  subpulse  modulation of 187 pulsars performed with
          the   Westerbork   Synthesis  Radio  Telescope  (WSRT)  in  the
          Netherlands  at an observing wavelength of 21 cm (Weltevrede et
          al.  2006). We have increased the list of pulsars that show the
          drifting  subpulse  phenomenon by 42, indicating that more than
          55%  of  the  pulsars show this phenomenon. The large number of
          new drifters we have found allows us, for the first time, to do
          meaningful  statistics on the drifting phenomenon. We find that
          the  drifting phenomenon is correlated with the pulsar age such
          that drifting is more likely to occur in older pulsars. Pulsars
          that  drift  more  coherently seem to be older and have a lower
          modulation  index.  Contrary claims from older studies, both P3
          (the  repetition  period  of the drifting subpulse pattern) and
          the  drift  direction  are  found to be uncorrelated with other
          pulsar parameters.

          Title: Transport on Adaptive Random Lattices
          Authors: Jelle Ritzerveld, Vincent Icke
          Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures, submitted to PRE
          Subj-class:   Statistical  Mechanics;  Mesoscopic  Systems  and
          Quantum Hall Effect; Computational Physics
          In  this  paper,  we  present  a new method for the solution of
          those  generic  transport  processes that may be described by a
          Master Equation. We base our algorithm on a Markov process on a
          Voronoi-Delaunay  grid,  a nonperiodic lattice which is derived
          from  a  random  point  process  that  is  chosen  to optimally
          represent  certain  properties  of the medium through which the
          transport  occurs. Our grid is locally translation and rotation
          invariant in the mean. We illustrate our approach by means of a
          particular  example,  in  which  the  expectation  value of the
          length  of a grid line corresponds to the local mean free path.
          In  this example, the lattice is a direct representation of the
          `free  path  space'  of  the medium. Subsequently, transport is
          defined  as  simply moving particles from one node to the next,
          interactions   taking  place  at  each  point.  We  derive  the
          statistical  properties of such lattices, describe the limiting
          behaviour, and show how interactions are incorporated as global
          coefficients.  Two elementary transport problems are discussed:
          that   of  free  ballistic  transport,  and  the  transport  of
          particles  through  a  scattering  medium.  We  also  mention a
          combination  of  these  two.  We  discuss the efficiency of our
          method, showing that it is much faster than most other methods,
          because  the  operation count does not scale with the number of
          sources.  We  test  our  method by focusing on the transport of
          ionizing  radiation  through a static medium, and show that the
          computed  results  for the classical test case of an ionization
          front  expanding  in  a homogeneous medium agree perfectly with
          the analytic solution. We finish by illustrating the efficiency
          and  flexibility of our method with the results of a simulation
          of  the  reionization  of  the  large  scale  structure  of the
          Universe.

          Title: The LISA verification binaries
          Authors: A. Stroeer, A. Vecchio
          Comments:   Submitted   to   Classical   and  Quantum  Gravity,
          Proceedings  of  the  10th  Gravitational  Wave  Data  Analysis
          Workshop. 10 pages, 3 Figures, 1 Table
          The  Laser  Interferometer  Space Antenna (LISA) guarantees the
          detection  of  gravitational  waves  by monitoring a handful of
          known   nearby   galactic   binary   systems,   the   so-called
          ``verification   binaries''.   We  consider  the  most  updated
          information  on  the  source  parameters  for  the  thirty more
          promising  verification  binaries. We investigate which of them
          are  indeed  guaranteed  sources  for  LISA  and  estimate  the
          accuracy  of  the  additional information that can be extracted
          during  the mission. Our analysis considers the two independent
          Michelson  outputs  that  can  be  synthesised  from  the  LISA
          constellation,  and  we  model the LISA transfer function using
          the rigid adiabatic approximation. We carry out extensive Monte
          Carlo  simulations  to explore the dependency of our results on
          unknown  or  poorly constrained source parameters. We find that
          four  sources -- RXJ0806.3+1527, V407 Vul, ES Cet and AM CVn --
          are   clearly   detectable   in   one   year   of  observation;
          RXJ0806.3+1527  should  actually  be  observable in less than a
          week.  For  these sources LISA will also provide information on
          yet  unknown  parameters  with an error between approximately 1
          percent  and  10  percent. Four additional binary systems -- HP
          Lib,  4U  1820-30,  WZ  Sge  and KPD 1930+2752 -- might also be
          marginally detectable.

          Authors: Stratos Boutloukos, Hans-Peter Nollert
          Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Physical Review D
          We   use  perturbation  theory  and  the  relativistic  Cowling
          approximation to numerically compute characteristic oscillation
          modes of rapidly rotating relativistic stars which consist of a
          perfect  fluid  obeying a polytropic equation of state. We find
          the  expected infinite pressure mode spectrum extending towards
          higher  frequencies,  but  also  what appears to be an infinite
          number  of  inertial  modes  confined to a finite, well-defined
          frequency  range, depending on the compactness and the rotation
          frequency  of  the  star.  We  observe  the shift of this range
          towards  negative  frequencies  for non-axisymmetric modes with
          respect   to  the  axisymmetric  ones,  making  all  m>2  modes
          unstable. We discuss whether our results indicate the existence
          of  a  continuous  part of the star's spectrum, or whether they
          all are discrete solutions.

          Authors: Rouzbeh Allahverdi, Juan Garcia-Bellido, Kari Enqvist,
          Anupam Mazumdar
          Comments: 4 revtex pages
          We  argue  that  all the necessary ingredients for a successful
          inflation  are  present in the flat directions of the Minimally
          Supersymmetric  Standard  Model. We show that out of many gauge
          invariant  combinations of squarks, sleptons and Higgses, there
          are  two  directions,  ${\bf  LLe}$, and ${\bf udd}$, which are
          promising  candidates for the inflaton. The model predicts more
          than  $10^6$  e-foldings  with an inflationary scale of $H_{\rm
          inf}\sim  {\cal  O}(1-10)$ GeV, provides a tilted spectrum with
          an  amplitude of $\delta_H\sim 10^{-5}$ and a negligible tensor
          perturbation.  The  temperature of the thermalized plasma could
          be  as  low  as  $T_{rh}\sim  {\cal O}(1-10)$ TeV. Parts of the
          inflaton potential can be determined independently of cosmology
          by future particle physics experiments.

          Authors: M. Jamin, J.A. Oller, A. Pich
          Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure
          Recent  experimental  improvements  on K-decay data allow for a
          precise extraction of the strangeness-changing scalar K pi form
          factor and the related strange scalar spectral function. On the
          basis  of this scalar as well as the corresponding pseudoscalar
          spectral  function,  the strange quark mass is determined to be
          m_s(2  GeV)  =  92 +- 9 MeV. Further taking into account chiral
          perturbation  theory  mass  ratios, the light up and down quark
          masses  turn  out  to be m_u(2 GeV) = 2.7 +- 0.4 MeV as well as
          m_d(2  GeV)  =  4.8 +- 0.5 MeV. As a by-product, we also find a
          value for the Cabibbo angle |V_{us}| = 0.2236(29) and the ratio
          of meson decay constants F_K/F_\pi = 1.203(16).

          Comments:  4 pages, 3 figures, submitted for publication in the

          X-ray  emission  from many rotation-powered millisecond pulsars
          (MSPs)  is  observed  to be of predominantly thermal nature. In
          PSR  J0437--4715,  the  nearest  MSP known, an additional faint
          power-law  tail  is observed above 2.5 keV, commonly attributed
          to  non-thermal  magnetospheric  radiation. We propose that the
          hard  emission in this and other similar MSPs is instead due to
          weak  Comptonization  of  the  thermal  (blackbody  or hydrogen
          atmosphere) polar cap emission by energetic electrons/positrons
          of  small  optical  depth  in  the  pulsar  magnetosphere. This
          spectral  model  implies  that  all  soft  X-rays are of purely
          thermal origin, which has profound implications in the study of
          neutron star structure and fundamental pulsar physics.

          Title: Supernova Neutrinos: The Accretion Disk Scenario
          Authors: G. C. McLaughlin, R. Surman
          Neutrinos  from  core collapse supernovae can be emitted from a
          rapidly accreting disk surrounding a black hole, instead of the
          canonical  proto-neutron  star.  For  Galactic events, detector
          count  rates  are  considerable  and  in  fact  can  be  in the
          thousands for Super-Kamiokande. The rate of occurrence of these
          accreting  disks  in the Galaxy is predicted to be on the order
          of  10^-5  yr^-1, yet there is little observational evidence to
          provide  an  upper  limit  on  their  formation  rate. It would
          therefore  be  useful  to  discriminate between neutrinos which
          have been produced in a proto-neutron star and those which have
          been  produced accretion disks. In order to distinguish between
          the  two  scenarios,  either  the  time profile of the neutrino
          luminosity or the relative fluxes of different neutrino flavors
          may  be  considered.  There are some signals that would clearly
          point to one scenario or the other.

          Title: The Birth of Quark Stars: Photon-driven Supernovae?
          Authors: Anbo Chen (PKU), Renxin Xu (PKU)
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures
          In  this  work  we  propose  a  possible  mechanism  trying  to
          alleviate the current difficulty in core-collapse supernovae by
          forming  a  strange  quark  star  inside  the  collapsing core.
          Although  the  cooling  behavior  of  nascent  strange stars is
          dominated  by  neutrino  emissions, thermal emissions including
          photons and e^\pm pair plasma do play a significant role in the
          explosion  dynamics  under  this  picture. The key to promote a
          successful  shock  is  more likely to be the radiation pressure
          caused by thermal photons rather than neutrinos in conventional
          models.  We  observed  through  calculation  that  despite much
          energy  is  lost to neutrinos, photons and e^\pm pairs can take
          away energy as much as 10^{51} erg ~ 10^{52} erg and hence make
          it  possible  to  supply  enough  energy ejecting the overlying
          mantle through photon-electron scattering. This result not only
          indicates  that  strange  quark stars should be bare ever since
          their  formations, it could also provide a possible explanation
          to  the  formation  of fire balls in cosmic long-soft Gamma-ray
          bursts associated to supernovae.

          Title: Gamma-ray binaries: pulsars in disguise ?
          Authors: Guillaume Dubus
          Comments: 20 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          LS  5039  and  LSI  +61  303 are unique amongst high-mass X-ray
          binaries (HMXB) for their spatially-resolved radio emission and
          their  counterpart  at  >GeV  gamma-ray  energies,  canonically
          attributed  to  non-thermal  particles  in an accretion-powered
          relativistic  jet.  The only other HMXB known to emit very high
          energy (VHE) gamma-rays, PSR B1259-63, harbours a non-accreting
          millisecond  pulsar.  I  investigate whether the interaction of
          the  relativistic  wind  from a young pulsar with the wind from
          its stellar companion, as in PSR B1259-63, constitutes a viable
          scenario  to  explain  the  observations of LS 5039 and LSI +61
          303.   Emission  would  arise  from  the  shocked  pulsar  wind
          material,  which  then  flows  away  to  large  distances  in a
          comet-shape  tail,  reproducing  on  a  smaller  scale  what is
          observed  in isolated, high motion pulsars interacting with the
          ISM.  Simple expectations for the SED are derived and are shown
          to  depend  on  few input parameters. Detailed modelling of the
          particle  evolution  is compared to the observations from radio
          to TeV energies. Acceleration at the shock provides high energy
          electrons  that steadily emit synchrotron in X-rays and inverse
          Compton   scatter   stellar   light  to  gamma-rays.  Electrons
          streaming  out  of the system emit at IR frequencies and below.
          The  overall  aspect  of  the SEDs is adequately reproduced for
          standard  values of the parameters. The morphology of the radio
          tail  can mimic a microquasar jet. Good agreement is found with
          the  published  VLBI map of LS 5039 and predictions are made on
          the  expected  change  in  appearance  with  orbital phase. The
          pulsar  wind scenario can provide a common, viable framework to
          interpret the emission from all three gamma-ray binaries.

          spectroscopic observations. We then produced a colour-magnitude
          diagram,    looked    at   the   overall   evolution   of   the
          multi-wavelength  light curve, and analysed the spectral energy
          distribution. Results: We discovered the optical counterpart in
          the  R-band  (R  $\sim  21.5$)  and confirmed the near-infrared
          counterpart.  We  show  that, for an absorption between 6 and 8
          magnitudes,  XTE J1720-318 is likely to be an intermediate mass
          X-ray  binary  located  at  a  distance  between  3 and 10 kpc,
          hosting  a  main  sequence star of spectral type between late B
          and  early  G.  Our  second  set  of  observations  took  place
          simultaneously  with  the  third  secondary outburst present in
          X-ray  and  near-infrared  light  curves.  The evolution of its
          spectral energy distribution shows that XTE J1720-318 entered a
          transition  from a high-soft to a low-hard state in-between the
          two observations.

          Stellar explosions such as novae and supernovae produce most of
          the heavy elements in the Universe. Although the onset of novae
          from runaway thermonuclear fusion reactions on the surface of a
          white  dwarf  in  a  binary  star  system is understood[1], the
          structure, dynamics, and mass of the ejecta are not well known.
          In  rare  cases, the white dwarf is embedded in the wind nebula
          of  a  red-giant companion; the explosion products plow through
          the  nebula  and  produce  X-ray  emission. Early this year, an
          eruption  of  the  recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi[2,3] provided the
          first  opportunity  to perform comprehensive X-ray observations
          of  such  an  event  and diagnose conditions within the ejecta.
          Here  we  show  that  the  hard X-ray emission from RS Ophiuchi
          early  in  the  eruption  emanates from behind a blast wave, or
          outward-moving shock wave, that expanded freely for less than 2
          days  and  then decelerated due to interaction with the nebula.
          The  X-rays  faded  rapidly,  suggesting  that  the  blast wave
          deviates  from the standard spherical shell structure[4-6]. The
          early  onset  of  deceleration indicates that the ejected shell
          had a low mass, the white dwarf has a high mass[7], and that RS
          Ophiuchi  is  a progenitor of the type of supernova integral to
          studies of the expansion of the universe.

          Comments: 12 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL
          We report the direct measurement of orbital period decay in the
          double neutron star pulsar system PSR B2127+11C in the globular
          cluster  M15 at the rate of $(-3.95 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-12}$,
          consistent  with  the  prediction  of general relativity at the
          $\sim  3  %$ level. We find the pulsar mass to be $m_p = (1.358
          \pm  0.010)  M_\odot$  and the companion mass $m_c = (1.354 \pm
          0.010)  M_\odot$. We also report long-term pulse timing results
          for  the  pulsars  PSR  B2127+11A  and PSR B2127+11B, including
          confirmation of the cluster proper motion.

          Title:  A  radio-emitting  outflow  in  the  quiescent state of
          A0620-00:  implications for modelling low-luminosity black hole
          binaries

          S.  Heinz  (MIT),  T.  Maccarone (Southampton), M. van der Klis
          (Amsterdam)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Deep  observations  with  the  Very  Large  Array  of A0620-00,
          performed  in  2005  August, resulted in the first detection of
          radio  emission  from a black hole binary at X-ray luminosities
          as  low  as  10^{-8.5}  times the Eddington limit. The measured
          radio  flux  density,  of  51  \pm 7 microJy at 8.5 GHz, is the
          lowest  reported  for  an  X-ray  binary  system so far, and is
          interpreted  in  terms  of  partially self-absorbed synchrotron
          emission  from  outflowing  plasma. Making use of the estimated
          outer  accretion rate of A0620-00 in quiescence, we demonstrate
          that the outflow kinetic power must be energetically comparable
          to  the  total accretion power associated with such rate, if it
          was  to  reach  the  black  hole  with  the  standard radiative
          efficiency  of 10 per cent. This favours a model for quiescence
          in  which  a  radiatively  inefficient  outflow  accounts for a
          sizable   fraction   of  the  missing  energy,  and,  in  turn,
          substantially  affects  the  overall  dynamics of the accretion
          flow.   Simultaneous  observations  in  the  X-ray  band,  with
          Chandra,  confirm  the  validity  of  a  non-linear radio/X-ray
          correlation  for  hard  state  black  hole binaries down to low
          quiescent  luminosities, thereby contradicting some theoretical
          expectations.  Taking  the mass term into account, the A0620-00
          data  lie  on  the  extrapolation  of the so called Fundamental
          Plane  of  black hole activity, which has thus been extended by
          more  than 2 orders of magnitude in radio and X-ray luminosity.
          With  the  addition  of  the A0620-00 point, the plane relation
          provides  an  empirical  proof  for the scale-invariance of the
          jet-accretion coupling in accreting black holes over the entire
          parameter space observable with current instrumentation.

          Title:  A  Library  of  Lick/IDS  Indices  for  Binary  Stellar
          Populations
          Authors: Fenghui Zhang, Lifang Li
          Comments: 16 pages, 2 figures, to be published in MNRAS
          Using  EPS  we  present  13  refined  Lick/IDS  absorption-line
          indices  for  an  extensive  set  of instantaneous-burst binary
          stellar  populations  (BSPs)  at  high  resolution (0.3 \AA) of
          various  age  and  metallicity  (1-15Gyr,  0.004-0.03),  and 38
          indices  at  intermediate resolution (3 \AA). These indices are
          obtained by two methods: (1) obtain them by using the empirical
          fitting  functions (FFs method); (2) measure them directly from
          the  synthetic  spectra (DC method). Together with our previous
          paper  a  database of Lick/IDS spectral absorption-line indices
          for BSPs at high and intermediate resolutions is provided. This
          set  of  indices  includes  21  indices of Worthey et al., four
          Balmer  indices  defined  by Worthey & Ottaviani and 13 indices
          with the new passband definitions of Trager et al. The full set
          of  synthetic  indices  and the integrated pseudo-continuum are
          listed  in the Appendix, which is only available online or from
          our  website (this http URL com/), or on request from the first
          author. Moreover, the ISEDs can be obtained from our website.
          We  compare  the  synthetic  Lick/IDS  indices  obtained by FFs
          method  and those by DC method, and find that the discrepancies
          are  significant:  Ca4455  (index  6),  Fe4668  (8), Mg_b (13),
          Fe5709  (17),  NaD  (19),  TiO_1 (20) and TiO_2 (21, except for
          Z=0.02)  in  the  W94 system, Ca4455^T (6^T), C_2 4668^T (8^T),
          NaD^T  (19^T),  TiO_1^T  (20^T)  and  TiO_2^T (21^T, except for
          Z=0.02)  in  the  T98  system  obtained  by  DC method are less
          (bluer)  than the corresponding ones obtained by FFs method for
          all metallicities. Ca4227 (index 3), Fe5782 (18),Ca4227^T (3^T)
          and  Fe5782^T  (18^T)  are  greater  at Z=0.03 and become to be
          bluer  at  Z=0.004, Fe5709^T (17^T) index is less at Z=0.03 and
          becomes  to  be  redder  at Z=0.004 than the corresponding ones
          obtained by FFs method.

          Title:  A  strong $\ddot{\nu} - \dot{\nu}$ correlation in radio
          pulsars with implications for torque variations
          Authors: J. O. Urama, B. Link, J. M. Weisberg
          Comments: MNRAS, in press. 5 pages, 2 figures
          We  present  an  analysis  of  the spin-down parameters for 131
          radio  pulsars  for  which $\ddot\nu$ has been well determined.
          These  pulsars  have characteristic ages ranging from $10^{3} -
          10^{8}$  yr  and  spin  periods  in the range 0.4--30 s; nearly
          equal  numbers of pulsars have $\ddot\nu>0$ as $\ddot\nu<0$. We
          find  a strong correlation of $\ddot\nu$ with $\dot{\nu}$, {\em
          independent  of  the  sign of} $\ddot\nu$. We suggest that this
          trend  can  be accounted for by small, stochastic deviations in
          the   spin-down  torque  that  are  directly  proportional  (in
          magnitude) to the spin-down torque.

          Context  :  Highly-collimated  outflows  are believed to be the
          earliest   stage  in  outflow  evolution,  so  their  study  is
          essential for understanding the processes driving outflows. The
          BHR71  Bok globule is known to harbour such a highly-collimated
          outflow,  which  is  powered  by  a  protostar  belonging  to a
          protobinary  system.  Aims  :  We  aimed  at  investigating the
          interaction  of  collimated outflows with the ambient molecular
          cloud by using molecular tracers. Methods : We mapped the BHR71
          highly-collimated  outflow  in CO(3-2) with the APEX telescope,
          and  observed  several  bright  points  of  the  outflow in the
          molecular   transitions   CO(4-3),  13CO(3-2),  C18O(3-2),  and
          CH3OH(7-6).  We use an LVG code to characterise the temperature
          enhancements  in  these  regions. Results : In our CO(3-2) map,
          the  second  outflow driven by IRS2, which is the second source
          of  the  binary  system, is completely revealed and shown to be
          bipolar. We also measure temperature enhancements in the lobes.
          The  CO  and  methanol  LVG  modelling  points  to temperatures
          between  30 and 50K in the IRS1 outflow, while the IRS2 outflow
          seems to be warmer (up to 300K).

          Although  disk  accretion  onto compact objects - white dwarfs,
          neutron  stars,  and  black  holes - is central to much of high
          energy  astrophysics,  the mechanisms which enable this process
          have  remained  observationally  elusive.  Accretion disks must
          transfer  angular momentum for matter to travel radially inward
          onto  the  compact  object.  Internal  viscosity  from magnetic
          processes and disk winds can in principle both transfer angular
          momentum,  but  hitherto we lacked evidence that either occurs.
          Here  we  report  that an X-ray-absorbing wind discovered in an
          observation  of the stellar-mass black hole binary GRO J1655-40
          must  be  powered  by  a  magnetic  process that can also drive
          accretion  through  the  disk.  Detailed  spectral analysis and
          modeling  of  the  wind  shows  that  it can only be powered by
          pressure  generated  by magnetic viscosity internal to the disk
          or  magnetocentrifugal  forces.  This  result demonstrates that
          disk  accretion  onto  black  holes is a fundamentally magnetic
          process.

          We have studied the photometric variability of ten SMC Be/X-ray

          we  have  found  periodic behavior, including orbital outbursts
          and/or nonradial pulsations (NRP) of the Be star. For others we
          were  unable  to  identify  any  clear photometric periodicity,
          although   their   longterm   light   curves  show  significant
          structure.    We   present   periodograms,   phase   dispersion
          minimization  (PDM)  variances, and folded light curves for the
          systems which exhibit periodic photometric variability.

          Anomalous   X-ray   pulsars  (AXPs)  are  neutron  stars  whose
          properties are best explained by the magnetar model. Their very
          large X-ray luminosities exceed those available from braking of
          the  stellar  rotation  by  magnetic  torque, and are generated
          instead   by   decay   of  ultra-strong  magnetic  fields.  The
          ubiquitous  radio  pulsars,  which  are  powered  by rotational
          energy  loss,  display no magnetar-like X-ray activity and have
          enduring  radio emission, while magnetars have lacked any radio
          emission.  XTE  J1810-197  was identified as a transient AXP in
          early  2003  when its X-ray luminosity increased by a factor of
          ~100 compared to the quiescent level, and X-ray pulsations were
          observed with period 5.54s. The detection from XTE J1810-197 of
          a  point-like radio source of unknown origin one year after the
          X-ray   outburst   further  distinguishes  it  from  all  other
          magnetars.  Here  we  show  that XTE J1810-197 emits remarkable
          radio  pulsations.  These are sharply modulated at the rotation
          period  with  peak  flux  density  >1Jy and are highly linearly
          polarised,  conclusively  establishing  the  first detection of
          magnetospheric  radio  emission from a magnetar. In contrast to
          ordinary  pulsars, there is no evidence of radio activity prior
          to  the  2003  X-ray outburst, and the intrinsic flux varies on
          short timescales with an approximately flat spectrum such that,
          at  >20GHz,  XTE  J1810-197  is currently the brightest neutron
          star  known.  This  discovery  provides a unique opportunity to
          probe  in  detail  the  dynamic magnetosphere of a neutron star
          with extreme properties.

          Title:   The   peculiar  sdB  NGC6121-V46:  A  low-mass  double

          The  variable  sdB  known as V46 in the globular cluster M4 has
          remained  enigmatic since its discovery almost 10 years ago. We
          present   here   radial  velocity  measurements  obtained  from
          medium-resolution  VLT/FORS2  spectra  that  show variations at
          twice  the  period of the luminosity changes. This implies that
          the  system  is  an  ellipsoidal variable. Unlike the other sdB
          binaries  of  this  nature,  the fundamental parameters of this
          star  we derive suggest that it lies below the Zero Age Extreme
          Horizontal Branch. From the cluster distance and the gravity we
          determine  the  mass of V46 to be ~0.19Msun. This is too low to
          sustain core helium burning. From the mass function we derive a
          lower  limit for the companion of only 0.26Msun. We discuss the
          star's  origin  in the context of close binary evolution in the
          field and globular clusters.

          Title:  The  X-ray afterglow flat segment in short GRB 051221A:
          Energy injection from a millisecond magnetar?
          Authors: Yizhong Fan, Dong Xu
          Comments: 4 pages including 1 figure
          In  GRB  051221A, an X-ray afterglow flat segment lasting $\sim
          10^4$  seconds represents the first clear case of strong energy
          injection  in  the  external shock of a short GRB afterglow. In
          this  work,  we  show  that  a  millisecond  pulsar with dipole
          magnetic field $\sim 10^{14}$ Gauss could well account for that
          energy  injection.  The  good  quality  X-ray flat segment thus
          suggests  that  the central engine of this short burst may be a
          millisecond magnetar.

          Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  study  thermal  structure  and  evolution  of  magnetars as
          cooling  neutron stars with a phenomenological heat source in a
          spherical internal layer. We explore the location of this layer
          as  well as the heating rate that could explain high observable
          thermal  luminosities of magnetars and would be consistent with
          the  energy  budget of neutron stars. We conclude that the heat
          source  should  be  located  in  an  outer magnetar's crust, at
          densities rho < 5e11 g/cm^3, and should have the heat intensity
          of  the  order of 1e20 erg/s/cm^3. Otherwise the heat energy is
          mainly emitted by neutrinos and cannot warm up the surface.

          Title:  Elastic  or  magnetic?  A toy model for global magnetar
          oscillations with implications for QPOs during flares
          Authors: Kostas Glampedakis, Lars Samuelsson, Nils Andersson
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 eps figures, submitted to MNRAS Letters
          We  use  a  simple  toy-model  to discuss global MHD modes of a
          neutron star, taking into account the magnetic coupling between
          the  elastic crust and the fluid core. Our results suggest that
          the  notion of pure torsional crust modes is not useful for the
          coupled  system,  all  modes  excite  Alfven waves in the core.
          However, we also show that the modes that are most likely to be
          excited  by a fractured crust, eg. during a magnetar flare, are
          such  that the crust and the core oscillate in concert. For our
          simple model, the frequencies of these modes are similar to the
          ``pure crustal'' frequencies. In addition, our model provides a
          natural  explanation  for  the  presence of lower frequency ($<
          30$~Hz)  QPOs  seen  in  the  December  2004 giant flare of SGR

          figures, figure 1 in color
          We  study  in  a systematic way the quality factor of the lower
          and  upper  kHz QPOs in a sample of low luminosity neutron star
          X-ray binaries, showing both QPOs varying over a wide frequency
          range.  The  sample  includes  4U  1636-536,  4U  1608-522,  4U
          1735-44,  4U  1728-34, 4U 1820-303 and 4U 0614+09. We find that
          all  sources  except 4U 0614+091 show evidence of a drop in the
          quality  factor  of their lower kHz QPOs at high frequency. For
          4U  0614+091  only the rising part of the quality factor versus
          frequency  curve  has been sampled so far. At the same time, in
          all  sources  but  4U  1728-34, the quality factor of the upper
          kilo-Hz  QPO  increases  all  the way to the highest detectable
          frequencies. We show that the high-frequency behaviours of both
          the lower and upper kHz QPO quality factors are consistent with
          what  is expected if the drop is produced by the approach of an
          active  oscillating  region  to  the  innermost stable circular
          orbit:  the  existence  of  which  is  a key feature of General
          Relativity   in   the   strong   field   regime.   Within  this
          interpretation, our results imply gravitational masses around 2
          solar masses for the neutron stars in those systems.

          We  present  Chandra  and  XMM-Newton  X-ray  observations that
          monitor  the  neutron  star  cooling  of  the  quasi-persistent
          neutron  star  X-ray transients KS 1731-260 and MXB 1659-29 for
          approximately   4   years   after  these  sources  returned  to
          quiescence  from  prolonged  outbursts.  In  both  sources  the
          outbursts  were  long  enough to significantly heat the neutron
          star  crust  out  of  thermal  equilibrium  with  the core. The
          results  of our analysis strengthen the preliminary findings of
          Wijnands  et  al.  that  in both sources the neutron star crust
          cools   down  very  rapidly  suggesting  it  has  a  high  heat
          conductivity  and  that the neutron star core requires enhanced
          core   cooling   processes.  Importantly,  we  now  detect  the
          flattening  of the cooling in both sources as the crust returns
          to  thermal  equilibrium  with the core. We measure the thermal
          equilbrium  flux  and  temperature in both sources by fitting a
          curve  that  decays  exponentially  to  a  constant  level. The
          cooling  curves  cannot  be  fit with just a simple exponential
          decay  without  the  constant  offset.  We  find  the  constant
          bolometric flux and effective temperature components to be (9.6
          +/- 0.9)E-14 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 and 71.3 +/- 1.6 eV in KS 1731-260
          and  (1.8  +/-  0.3)E-14 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 and 52.1 +/- 1.6 eV in
          MXB 1659-29. In addition, we find that the crust of KS 1731-260
          cools faster than that of MXB 1659-29 by a factor of ~2, likely
          due  to  different  crustal  properties. This is the first time
          that   the  cooling  of  a  neutron  star  crust  into  thermal
          equilibrium with the core has been observed in such detail.

          We  present  a new theory for the gravitational wave signatures
          of   core-collapse   supernovae.  Previous  studies  identified
          axisymmetric  rotating  core  collapse, core bounce, postbounce
          convection,  and  anisotropic  neutrino emission as the primary
          processes  and phases for the radiation of gravitational waves.
          Our   results,  which  are  based  on  axisymmetric,  Newtonian
          radiation-hydrodynamics  supernova  simulations (Burrows et al.
          2006),   indicate   that   the  dominant  emission  process  of
          gravitational  waves  in  core-collapse  supernovae  may be the
          oscillations  of  the  protoneutron star core. The oscillations
          are  predominantly of g-mode character, are excited hundreds of
          milliseconds  after  bounce,  and  typically  last  for several
          hundred milliseconds. Our results suggest that even nonrotating
          core-collapse   supernovae   should   be   visible  to  current
          LIGO-class  detectors  throughout  the Galaxy, and depending on
          progenitor structure, possibly out to Megaparsec distances.

          Title:  Detection  of  the  radial  velocity curve of the B5-A0
          supergiant companion star of Cir X-1?
          Authors: P.G. Jonker, G. Nelemans, C.G. Bassa
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          In  this  Paper  we  report  on  phase  resolved I-band optical
          spectroscopic  and photometric observations of Cir X-1 obtained
          with  the  Very  Large  Telescope. The spectra are dominated by
          Paschen  absorption  lines  at nearly all orbital phases except
          near  phase  zero  (coinciding  with  the  X-ray  dip) when the
          absorption lines are filled-in by broad Paschen emission lines.
          The  radial  velocity curve of the absorption lines corresponds
          to  an  eccentric  orbit  (e=0.45)  whose  period  and  time of
          periastron  passage  are  consistent  with the period and phase
          predicted by the most recent X-ray dip ephemeris. We found that
          the  I-band  magnitude  is  consistent  with  being constant at
          I=17.6    in   the   binary   phase   interval   0.1-0.6.   The
          source-brightness  peaks  at I=16.7-16.9 at phase 0.9-1.0. This
          I-band  brightening coincides in phase with the X-ray dip. Even
          though  it  is  likely  that  the  absorption  line spectrum is
          associated  with  the  companion  star  of  Cir  X-1, we cannot
          exclude  the  possibility  that  the spectrum originates in the
          accretion  disc. If the spectrum belongs to the companion star,
          it  must  be  a  supergiant  of  spectral type B5-A0. Under the
          assumption  that  the compact object is a 1.4 Msun neutron star
          and  that  it  does  not  move  through  the  companion star at
          periastron,  the companion star mass is constrained to ~<2 Msun
          and  the orbital inclination to i~< 27 degrees. In principle, a
          mass  of  ~2  Msun  is too low for a supergiant, although it is
          conceivable  that tidal effects have heated and enlarged a star
          of  lower mass to resemble a supergiant. Furthermore, mass loss
          will  have  reduced  the  companion  star  mass.  The stringent
          constraint on the companion star mass is alleviated if the mass
          of  the  compact  object is higher than 1.4 Msun. For a 10 Msun
          compact  object  the  companion  star mass is more in line with
          that expected for a B5-A0 supergiant (abridged).

          Proportional  Counter  Array  (PCA)  data of the low mass X-ray
          binary  (LMXB)  system  XB 1254-690. We calculate colour-colour
          diagram,  hardness-intensity  diagram and power spectra of this
          source  and  establish  that XB 1254-690 is an atoll source. We
          also  find  moderate  evidence of millisecond period brightness
          oscillations  at  the  frequency ~ 95 Hz during a thermonuclear
          X-ray  burst.  This is the first such finding from this source,
          which  suggests  that the spin frequency of the neutron star in
          XB  1254-690  is ~ 95 Hz. We discuss that, if confirmed, such a
          low spin frequency will be useful for the detection of spectral
          lines from the surface of the neutron star.

          quark  matter  at  zero temperature for nonlocal instantaneous,
          separable  interactions. We employ a Lorentzian-type formfactor

          influence  on  the  CSL  condensate  the deviation from the NJL
          model entails. This smoothing of the NJL model formfactor shows
          advantageous  features  for the phenomenology of compact stars:
          (i) a lowering of the critical chemical potential for the onset
          of  the chiral phase transition as a prerequisite for stability
          of  hybrid  stars  with  extended quark matter cores and (ii) a
          reduction  of the smallest pairing gap to the order of 100 keV,
          being  in  the range of values interesting for phenomenological
          studies of hybrid star cooling evolution.

          We  have  calculated  the first dynamical evolutions of merging
          black  hole-neutron  star  binaries  that  treat  the  combined
          spacetime  in a nonperturbative general relativistic framework.
          Using the conformal flatness approximation, we have studied how
          the location of the tidal disruption radius with respect to the
          the  black  hole  horizon  and  innermost stable circular orbit
          (ISCO)  affects  the qualitative evolution of the system. Based
          on  simple  arguments,  we  show  that  for a binary mass ratio
          q>~0.24,  tidal  disruption  occurs outside the ISCO, while the
          opposite  is  true  for  q<~0.24.  When tidal disruption occurs
          sufficiently far outside the ISCO, mass is transferred unstably
          from  the  neutron  star  to  the  black hole, resulting in the
          complete  disruption of the neutron star. When tidal disruption
          occurs  slightly within the ISCO, we find that some of the mass
          forms  an  extremely  hot  disk  around  the  black  hole.  The
          resulting  configurations in this case are excellent candidates
          for the progenitors of short-hard gamma ray bursts.

          An  algorithm of finding numerical solutions of pulsar equation

          in  the  pioneering  paper  by  Contopoulos,  Kazanas and Fendt
          (CKF).  The  problem  of  finding  the solutions was reduced to

          Title:  Optical  Monitoring  of  BL  Lacertae  Object OJ 287: a
          40-Day Period?

          We  present  the  results  of  our optical monitoring of the BL
          Lacertae  object  OJ  287  during  the  first half of 2005. The
          source  did  not  show  large-amplitude  variations during this
          period  and  was  in  a  relatively quiescent state. A possible
          period  of  40  days was derived from its light curves in three
          BATC    wavebands.   A   bluer-when-brighter   chromatism   was
          discovered,  which is different from the extremely stable color
          during  the outburst in 1994--96. The different color behaviors
          imply different variation mechanisms in the two states. We then
          re-visited  the  optical  data on OJ 287 from the OJ-94 project
          and  found  as well a probable period of 40 days in its optical
          variability  during the late-1994 outburst. The results suggest
          that  two  components  contribute  to the variability of OJ 287
          during  its  outburst  state. The first component is the normal
          {\sl blazar} variation. This component has an amplitude similar
          to  that  of  the  quiescent state and also may share a similar
          periodicity.   The   second   component   can  be  taken  as  a
          `low-frequency  modulation'  to  the first component. It may be
          induced by the interaction of the assumed binary black holes in
          the  center of this object. The 40-day period may be related to
          the  helical structure of the magnetic field at the base of the
          jet,  or  to  the  orbital  motion close to the central primary
          black hole.

          Microquasar LS I +61 303
          Authors: MAGIC Collaboration: J. Albert, et al
          Comments: 11 pages with 4 figures
          Microquasars   are   binary   star  systems  with  relativistic
          radio-emitting  jets. They are potential sources of cosmic rays
          and  laboratories  for  elucidating the physics of relativistic
          jets.  Here  we  report  the  detection  of  variable gamma-ray
          emission above 100 gigaelectron volts from the microquasar LS I
          +61  303.  Six orbital cycles were recorded. Several detections
          occur  at  a  similar orbital phase, suggesting the emission is
          periodic. The strongest gamma-ray emission is not observed when
          the  two  stars  are  closest to one another, implying a strong
          orbital modulation of the emission or the absorption processes.

          Title:   The   planets   capture  model  of  V838  Monocerotis:
          conclusions for the penetration depth of the planet/s
          Authors: Alon Retter, Bing Zhang, Lionel Siess, Amir Levinson
          Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures, MNRAS, accepted
          V838   Mon  is  the  prototype  of  a  new  class  of  objects.
          Understanding  the  nature  of  its  multi-stage  outburst  and
          similar  systems is challenging. So far, several scenarios have
          been  invoked to explain this group of stars. In this work, the
          planets-swallowing  model for V838 Mon is further investigated,
          taking  into  account  the findings that the progenitor is most
          likely  a massive B type star. We find that the super-Eddington
          luminosity  during  the  eruption  can  explain the fast rising
          times  of  the  three peaks in the optical light curve. We used
          two  different  methods  to  estimate  the  location  where the
          planets  were  consumed.  There is a nice agreement between the
          values  obtained  from  the  luminosities of the peaks and from
          their  rising  time  scale.  We  estimate that the planets were
          stopped  at  a  typical  distance  of one solar radius from the
          center  of  the  host  giant  star. The planets-devouring model
          seems  to  give  a satisfying explanation to the differences in
          the  luminosities  and  rising  times of the three peaks in the
          optical  light curve of V838 Mon. The peaks may be explained by
          the  consumption  of  three  planets  or alternatively by three
          steps  in  the  terminal falling process of a single planet. We
          argue  that  only  the binary merger and the planets-swallowing
          models  are consistent with the observations of the new type of
          stars defined by V838 Mon.

          One  of the most recent discoveries of the INTEGRAL observatory
          is  the  existence  of a previously unknown population of X-ray
          sources  in  the inner arms of the Galaxy. IGR J17544-2619, IGR
          J16465-4507 and XTE J1739-302 are among these sources. Although
          the   nature   of  these  systems  is  still  unexplained,  the
          investigations  of the optical/NIR counterparts of the two last
          sources, combined with high energy data, have provided evidence
          of  them  being  highly  absorbed high mass X-ray binaries with
          blue supergiant secondaries and displaying fast X-ray transient
          behaviour. In this work we present our optical/NIR observations
          of IGR J17544-2619, aimed at identifying and characterizing its
          counterpart.  We  show  that  the  source  is a high mass X-ray
          binary  at  a distance of 2-4 kpc with a strongly absorbed O9Ib
          secondary, and discuss the nature of the system.

          We   present  a  systematic  analysis  of  archival  HST  WFPC2
          ``Association''  data  sets  that  correlate  with  the Chandra
          positions of a set of 44 ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) of
          nearby  galaxies.  We  have  improved  the Chandra-HST relative
          astrometry  whenever  possible.  Disparate numbers of potential
          ULX  counterparts  are found, and in some cases none are found.
          The  lack of or low number of counterparts in some cases may be
          due  to insufficient depth in the WFPC2 images. Particularly in
          late-type  galaxies,  the HST image in the ULX region was often
          complex  or crowded. We therefore address various scenarios for
          the  nature  of the ULX since it is not known which, if any, of
          the   sources   found   are   true  counterparts.  The  optical
          luminosities  of  the sources are typically in the range 10^4-6
          L_sun.  In  several  cases color information is available, with
          the  colors  roughly  tending  to  be  more  red  in early-type
          galaxies.  This  suggests  that,  in  general,  the (potential)
          counterparts  found  in  early-type  galaxies  are likely to be
          older  stellar populations, and are probably globular clusters.
          Several  early-type galaxy counterparts have blue colors, which
          may be due to younger stellar populations in the host galaxies,
          however  these  could  also  be  background  sources. In spiral
          galaxies  the sources may also be due to localized structure in
          the disks rather than bound stellar systems. Alternatively some
          of  the  counterparts  in  late-type  galaxies  may be isolated
          supergiant  stars.  The  observed  X-ray/optical  flux ratio is
          diluted  by  the optical emission of the cluster in cases where
          the system is an X-ray binary in a cluster, particularly in the
          case of a low-mass X-ray binaries in old cluster. (abridged)

          Title:   Gravitational   Waves   from   Light  Cosmic  Strings:
          Backgrounds and Bursts with Large Loops
          Authors: Craig J. Hogan
          Comments: 22 pages, Latex, 1 figure, submitted to Phys Rev D
          The  mean  spectrum and burst statistics of gravitational waves
          produced  by  a  cosmological population of cosmic string loops
          are  estimated  using  analytic approximations, calibrated with
          earlier   simulations.   Formulas   are   derived  showing  the
          dependence  of observables on the string tension, in the regime
          where  newly-formed  loops  are relatively large, not very much
          smaller  than  the  horizon. Large loops form earlier, are more
          abundant, and generate a more intense stochastic background and
          more   frequent  bursts  than  assumed  in  earlier  background
          estimates, enabling experiments to probe lighter cosmic strings
          of  interest  to  string  theory. Predictions are compared with
          instrument  noise from current and future experiments, and with
          confusion  noise  from  known  astrophysical gravitational wave
          sources  such  as  stellar  and massive black hole binaries. In
          these  large-loop  models, current data from millisecond pulsar
          timing  already  suggests  that  the tension is less than about
          $10^{-10}$,  a  typical  value  expected  in strings from brane
          inflation.  LISA  will  be  sensitive to stochastic backgrounds
          created  by  strings  as  light  as  $G\mu\approx 10^{-15}$, at
          frequencies  where it is limited by confusion noise of Galactic
          stellar  populations;  however,  for  those lightest detectable
          strings, bursts are rarely detectable.

          publication in MNRAS
          The  silicate  carbon star V778 Cyg is a source of 22 GHz water
          maser   emission   which   was  recently  resolved  by  MERLIN.
          Observations revealed an elongated S-like structure along which
          the  velocities  of the maser features show a linear dependence
          on   the   impact   parameter.   This   is  consistent  with  a
          doubly-warped  m=2  disc  observed  edge-on.  Water  masers and
          silicate dust emission (detected by IRAS and ISO) have a common
          origin  in  O-rich  material and are likely to be co-located in
          the  disc.  We  propose  a  detailed self-consistent model of a
          masing gas-dust disc around a companion to the carbon star in a
          binary  system,  which allows us to estimate the companion mass
          of  1.7  +-  0.1  M_sun,  the  disc radius of 40 +-3 AU and the
          distance  between  companions  of about 80 AU. Using a dust-gas
          coupling  model  for water masing, we calculate the maser power
          self-consistently,  accounting  for  both  the gas and the dust
          energy  balances.  Comparing  the  simulation  results with the
          observational  data,  we deduce the main physical parameters of
          the  masing  disc,  such  as  the gas and dust temperatures and
          their  densities.  We also present an analysis of the stability
          of the disc.

          We  test  the  physical  model  of the relativistic jets in the
          galactic  X-ray  binary  SS  433 proposed in our previous paper
          using  additional  observations  from  the  Chandra High Energy
          Transmission  Grating  Spectrometer.  These observations sample
          two   new   orbital/precessional  phase  combinations.  In  the
          observation  near  orbital  phase  zero,  the H- and He-like Fe
          lines  from  both  receding and approaching jets are comparably
          strong and unocculted while the He-like Si line of the receding
          jet  is  significantly weaker than that of the approaching jet.
          This  condition  may imply the cooler parts of the receding jet
          are  eclipsed  by  the  companion. The X-ray spectrum from this
          observation has broader emission lines than obtained in Paper I
          that may arise from the divergence of a conical outflow or from
          Doppler  shift  variations during the observation. Using recent
          optical  results,  along  with  the  length  of  the unobscured
          portion  of  the  receding  jet  assuming adiabatic cooling, we
          calculate  the  radius  of the companion to be 9.6+/-1.0 R_sun,
          about  one  third of the Roche lobe radius. For a main sequence
          star,  this  corresponds  to  a companion mass of 35+/-7 M_sun,
          giving  a  primary source mass of 20+/-5 M_sun. If our model is
          correct,  this  calculation  indicates  the compact object is a
          black  hole,  and accretion occurs through a wind process. In a
          subsequent paper, we will examine the validity of the adiabatic
          cooling model of the jets and test the mode of line broadening.

          We  present  the  results  of  a  Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS
          imaging  survey  of  22  T-type  field  brown  dwarfs. Five are
          resolved   as   binary  systems  with  angular  separations  of
          0"05-0"35,  and  companionship  is  established on the basis of
          component F110W-F170M colors (indicative of CH4 absorption) and
          low    probabilities   of   background   contamination.   Prior
          ground-based observations show 2MASS 1553+1532AB to be a common
          proper  motion  binary.  The  properties of these systems - low
          multiplicity  fraction  (11[+7][-3]% resolved, as corrected for
          sample  selection  baises),  close  projected  separations (a =
          1.8-5.0  AU)  and  near-unity mass ratios - are consistent with
          previous  results  for field brown dwarf binaries. Three of the
          binaries   have  components  that  span  the  poorly-understood
          transition   between   L   dwarfs   and   T   dwarfs.  Spectral
          decomposition  analysis  of  one  of  these,  SDSS 1021-0304AB,
          reveals a peculiar flux reversal between its components, as its
          T5  secondary is ~30% brighter at 1.05 and 1.27 micron than its
          T1 primary. This system, 2MASS 0518-2828AB and SDSS 1534+1615AB
          all  demonstrate  that  the J-band brightening observed between
          late-type  L  to  mid-type  T dwarfs is an intrinsic feature of
          this   spectral   transition,   albeit   less  pronounced  than
          previously  surmised.  We  also  find  that the resolved binary
          fraction  of  L7  to T3.5 dwarfs is twice that of other L and T
          dwarfs,  an anomaly that can be explained by a relatively rapid
          evolution  of  brown dwarfs through the L/T transition, perhaps
          driven  by  dynamic  (nonequilibrium) depletion of photospheric
          condensates.

          from  H2CO  (40-60  K)  and CH3OH (20 K), possibly indicating a

          We  have  identified a binary companion to (42355) 2002 CR46 in
          our ongoing deep survey using the Hubble Space Telescope's High
          Resolution Camera. It is the first companion to be found around
          an  object  in  a non-resonant orbit that crosses the orbits of
          giant  planets.  Objects  in orbits of this kind, the Centaurs,
          have  experienced  repeated  strong scattering with one or more
          giant  planets  and  therefore the survival of binaries in this
          transient   population   has  been  in  question.  Monte  Carlo
          simulations  suggest,  however,  that  binaries in (42355) 2002
          CR46  -like  heliocentric  orbits  have  a  high probability of
          survival for reasonable estimates of the binary's still-unknown
          system  mass and separation. Because Centaurs are thought to be
          precursors   to  short  period  comets,  the  question  of  the
          existence  of binary comets naturally arises; none has yet been
          definitively  identified.  The  discovery  of  one  binary in a
          sample  of eight observed by HST suggests that binaries in this
          population may not be uncommon.

          Title:  Binary Stellar Population Synthesis Study of Elliptical
          Galaxies
          Authors: Zhongmu Li, Fenghui Zhang, Zhanwen Han
          Comments:  15  pages,  10  figures, accepted for publication to
          ChJAA
          We determine relative stellar ages and metallicities mainly for
          about   80   elliptical   galaxies  in  low  and  high  density
          environments  via  the  latest  binary stellar population (BSP)
          synthesis  model and test a latest hierarchical formation model
          of  elliptical  galaxies  which  adopted  the  new $\Lambda$CDM
          cosmology   for   the   first   time.   The  stellar  ages  and
          metallicities  of  galaxies are estimated from two high-quality
          published  spectra  line indices, i.e. H$\beta$ and [MgFe]. The
          results  show that elliptical galaxies have stellar populations
          older  than  3.9 Gyr and more metal rich than 0.02. Most of our
          results  are in agreement with predictions of the model: First,
          elliptical  galaxies  in denser environment are redder and have
          older  populations  than  field  galaxies.  Second,  elliptical
          galaxies  with more massive stellar components are redder while
          have  older  and  more metal rich populations than less massive
          ones.  Third,  the  most massive galaxies are shown to have the
          oldest  and most metal rich stars. However, some of our results
          are  found  to  be  different  with  predictions  of the galaxy
          formation model, i.e. the metallicity distributions of low- and
          high-density  elliptical galaxies and the relations relating to
          cluster-centric distance.

          Title:  Merging  of  a  massive binary due to ejection of bound
          stars
          Authors: Christian Zier
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 pages, submitted to MNRAS
          From  the  results  of  numerical  scattering  experiments  and
          simulations  of  a  massive  black  hole  binary in spherically
          symmetric  and  shallow  cores  it  has  been deduced that most
          likely  the shrinking process stalls due to loss-cone depletion
          before  emission  of gravitational radiation becomes important.
          Here we follow a different approach and focus on the population
          of  stars  which  is  bound  to  the  binary and so far has not
          received  much  attention. With simple assumptions which should
          not  be sensitive to initial conditions we derive a lower limit
          for  the mass of stars that need to be ejected by the binary in
          order  to  coalesce. We also compute this mass in dependency on
          the  steepness  of  the  density profile according to which the
          stars  are  distributed.  Our results are not as pessimistic as
          earlier conclusions and actually suggest that the BHs merge.

          Title:  New  light  on  the  old  problem  of  lithium  pre--MS
          depletion: models with 2D RHD convection
          Authors: Josefina Montalban, Francesca D'Antona
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          The  Teff  location  of  Pre-Main  Sequence  (PMS) evolutionary
          tracks  depends  on  the  treatment  of  over-adiabaticity.  We
          present  here the PMS evolutionary tracks computed by using the
          mixing   length   theory  of  convection  (MLT)  in  which  the
          alpha_MLT=l/H_p    parameter    calibration    is    based   on
          2D--hydrodynamical   models   (Ludwig   et   al.  1999).  These
          MLT--\alpha^2D  stellar  models  and tracks are very similar to
          those  computed  with  non--grey  ATLAS9  atmospheric  boundary
          conditions  and  Full  Spectrum  of Turbulence (FST) convection
          model   both  in  the  atmosphere  and  in  the  interior.  The
          comparison  of  the  new  tracks  with  the  location on the HR
          diagram  of  pre--MS binariesis not completely satisfactory, as
          some  binary  components are located at too low \teff. Besides,
          the  pre--MS  lithium depletion in the MLT--\alpha^2D tracks is
          still  much  larger than that expected from the observations of
          lithium  in young open clusters. This result is similar to that
          of  FST  models.  Thus, in spite of the fact that 2D RHD models
          should  provide  a better convection description than any local
          model, their introduction is not sufficient to reconcile theory
          and  observations.  Lithium  depletion in young clusters points
          towards  a  convection  efficiency which, in pre--MS, should be
          smaller than in the MS. The pre--MS lithium depletion decreases
          significantly  in FST models if we reduce the solar metallicity
          down  to  the  value suggested by Asplund et al.(2004), but the
          corresponding  solar  model does not reproduce the depth of the
          convective zone as determined by helioseismology.

          Title:   On   the   search   of   electromagnetic  cosmological
          counterparts to coalescences of massive black hole binaries
          Authors:  M.  Dotti,  R.  Salvaterra,  A.  Sesana, M. Colpi, F.
          Haardt
          Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  explore the nature of possible electromagnetic counterparts
          of  coalescences of massive black hole binaries at cosmological
          distances  detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
          (LISA).  An  electromagnetic precursor, during the last year of
          gravitational wave (GW)-driven inspiral, or an afterglow within
          few  years after coalescence, may highlight the position in the
          sky of galaxies hosting LISA sources. We show that observations
          of  precursors and afterglows are mutually exclusive, depending
          on  the mass of the primary black hole. Precursors are expected
          to  occur  in  binaries  where the primary (more massive) black
          hole is heavier than ~10^7 \Msun. They may correspond to on-off
          states  of  accretion,  i.e., to a bright X-ray source decaying
          into  quiescence  before black hole coalescence, and are likely
          associated  to  disturbed  galaxies  showing  signs  of ongoing
          starbursts.  Coalescences  of  lighter  binaries,  with  masses
          <5x10^6  \Msun, lack of any precursor, as gas is expected to be
          consumed  long  before the GW-driven orbital decay. Such events
          would  not  be  hosted by (massive) galaxies with an associated
          starburst,  given the slow binary inspiral time compared to the
          typical time scale of starbursts. By contrast, coalescence, for
          such   light   binaries,  is  followed  by  an  electromagnetic
          afterglow,  i.e.,  an off-on accretion state rising in <20 yrs.
          Using a cosmological merger tree algorithm, we show that future
          X-ray missions such as XEUS will be able to identify, in 20 yrs
          operation, almost all the massive BH binary detectable by LISA,
          and, in only 5 yrs, all the LISA sources at z>6.

          Title: Binary central stars of planetary nebula
          Authors: Orsola De Marco
          Comments:   8  pages,  no  figures.  Review  presented  at  IAU
          Symposium 234 on Planetary Nebulae. Proceedings in press
          Only  a  handful  of  binary central stars of planetary nebulae
          (PNe) are known today, due to the difficulty of detecting their
          companions.  Preliminary  results from radial velocity surveys,
          however,    seem    to   indicate   that   binarity   plays   a
          fundamental,rather  than  marginal role in the evolution of PNe
          and  that  the  close binary fraction might be much larger than
          the  currently  known  value of 10-15%. In this review, we list
          all the known binary central stars, giving an updated census of
          their  numbers  and  selected characteristics. A review is also
          given  of  the  techniques  used  to detect binaries as well as
          selected characteristics of related stellar classes which might
          provide constraints (or additional puzzles) to the theory of PN
          evolution.  Finally,  we will formulate the conjecture that all
          PNe  derive  from  binary interactions and suggest that this is
          not inconsistent with our current knowledge.

          We  present  optical  and ultraviolet spectra, lightcurves, and
          Doppler  tomograms  of  the low-mass X-ray binary EXO 0748-676.
          Using  an  extensive set of 15 emission line tomograms, we show
          that,  along  with the usual emission from the stream and ``hot
          spot'',  there  is  extended non-axisymmetric emission from the
          disk  rim.  Some of the emission and Halpha and beta absorption
          features  lend weight to the hypothesis that part of the stream
          overflows  the  disk rim and forms a two phase medium. The data
          are  consistent  with  a  1.35M_sun  neutron  star  with a main
          sequence companion and hence a mass ratio q~0.34.

          We  propose  that  a  nova  shell ejected from a recurrent nova
          progenitor  system  created  the  evacuated  region  around the
          explosion  center of SN 2002ic. In this picture, periodic shell
          ejections  due to nova explosions on a white dwarf sweep up the
          slow   wind   from   the  binary  companion,  creating  density
          variations  and  instabilities  that  lead  to structure in the
          circumstellar  medium  (CSM).  Our model naturally explains the
          observed gap between the supernova explosion center and the CSM
          in  SN  2002ic, accounts for the density variations observed in
          the  CSM, and resolves the coincidence problem of the timing of
          the  explosion  of  SN  2002ic  with  respect  to  the apparent
          cessation  of  mass-loss  in  the  progenitor  system.  We also

          Type Ia supernovae with recurrent nova progenitors.

          Title:  Accretion  onto the Companion of Eta Carinae During the
          Spectroscopic Event: III. the He II 4686 Line
          Authors: Noam Soker, Ehud Behar (Technion, Israel)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          We  continue  to  explore  the  accretion  model of the massive
          binary  system  Eta Carinae by studying the anomalously high He
          II  lambda-4686  line.  The line appears just before periastron
          and  disappears  immediately  thereafter.  Based  on  the He II
          lambda-4686  line  emission  from O-stars and their modeling in
          the  literature,  we  postulate that the He II lambda-4686 line
          comes from the acceleration zone of the secondary stellar wind.
          We  attribute  the  large  increase  in the line intensity to a
          slight increase in the density of the secondary stellar wind in
          its  acceleration zone. The increase in density could be due to
          the  ionization  and subsequent deceleration of the wind by the
          enhanced X-ray emission arising from the shocked secondary wind
          further downstream or to accretion of the primary stellar wind.
          Accretion  around  the secondary equatorial plane gives rise to
          collimation of the secondary wind, which increases its density,
          hence  enhancing  the  He  II  lambda-4686  emission  line.  In
          contrast  with  previous  explanations,  the presently proposed
          model  does  not  require  a  prohibitively  high X-ray flux to
          directly photoionize the He.

          counterpart  to  the  proposed ultra-compact binary system V407
          Vul  (=RX  J1914.4+2456).  Our  Gemini spectra resolve the 9.48
          minute  periodicity  that has previously been reported for this

          exceeding  10 km/s could be detected on periods from minutes to
          hours.  Using  interstellar  extinction  estimates, we derive a
          distance  to  the  G9  star of 1.1-3.5 kpc. In addition to this
          stellar  spectrum,  we  detect  a blue component that modulates
          solely  on  the  9.48  minute  period, and peaks ~0.15 in phase
          ahead  of the X-ray peak. This blue component which contributes
          up  to  40%  of  the  light shows no evidence for emission line
          features that are the usual hallmarks of an interacting binary.
          Good  seeing  images  obtained  with  the  Magellan  telescopes
          indicate that the variable and the G-star are aligned to better
          than 0.1". Despite the low probability of a chance alignment of
          a  field  star  along the line of sight, the G9 light cannot be
          directly  associated  with the 9.48 minute variable that powers
          the  luminous (~10^35 ergs/s) and highly variable X-ray source.
          The  outlook  for  the  detection of conclusive radial velocity
          measurements  will  remain  challenging  due  to the extinction
          along  the  line of sight in conjunction with the contaminating

          Title: New ways to catch a wave
          Authors: Neil J. Cornish, Edward K. Porter
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          The  gravitational  wave  signals  from coalescing Supermassive
          Black  Hole Binaries are one of the prime targets for the Laser
          Interferometer   Space   Antenna   (LISA).  With  optimal  data
          processing  techniques  the  LISA observatory should be able to
          detect  these  black hole mergers anywhere in the Universe. The
          challenge  is  to  find  ways  to  dig  the  signals  out  of a
          combination  of  instrument noise and the large foreground from
          stellar mass binaries in our own galaxy. The standard procedure
          of  matched  filtering  against  a  bank  of  templates  can be
          computationally  prohibitive,  especially  when the black holes
          are  spinning  or  the  mass ratio is large. Here we develop an
          alternative  approach  based  on annealed Markov Chains that is
          orders  of magnitude cheaper than a grid search. We demonstrate
          our  approach on a simulated LISA data stream that contains the
          signal  from  a  binary  system  of  Schwarzschild Black Holes,
          embedded  in  instrument  noise  and a foreground containing 26
          million  galactic  binaries.  The  annealed  chains are able to
          accurately  recover  the  9  parameters that describe the black
          hole  binary  without  first having to remove any of the bright
          sources in the foreground.

          Title: Gravitino Dark Matter and Cosmological Constraints
          Authors: Frank Daniel Steffen
          Comments: 62 pages, 20 figures
          The gravitino is a promising candidate for cold dark matter. We
          study  cosmological  constraints  on  scenarios  in  which  the
          gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle and a charged
          slepton the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). We
          obtain  new  results for the hadronic nucleosynthesis bounds by
          computing  the  4-body  decay  of  the  NLSP  slepton  into the
          gravitino,  the  associated lepton, and a quark-antiquark pair.
          The bounds from the observed dark matter density are refined by
          taking  into  account gravitinos from both late NLSP decays and
          thermal  scattering  in  the  early  Universe.  We  examine the
          present  free-streaming  velocity  of gravitino dark matter and
          the   limits   from  observations  and  simulations  of  cosmic
          structures.  Assuming  that the NLSP sleptons freeze out with a
          thermal  abundance  before their decay, we derive new bounds on
          the  slepton  and  gravitino  masses.  The  implications of the
          constraints   for  cosmology  and  collider  phenomenology  are
          discussed  and  the  potential insights from future experiments
          are  outlined.  We  propose  a  set of benchmark scenarios with
          gravitino  dark matter and long-lived charged NLSP sleptons and
          describe  prospects  for  the  Large  Hadron  Collider  and the
          International Linear Collider.

          Title:  Accretion  onto the Companion of Eta Carinae During the
          Spectroscopic Event: III. the He II 4686 Line
          Authors: Noam Soker, Ehud Behar (Technion, Israel)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          We  continue  to  explore  the  accretion  model of the massive
          binary  system  Eta Carinae by studying the anomalously high He
          II  lambda-4686  line.  The line appears just before periastron
          and  disappears  immediately  thereafter.  Based  on  the He II
          lambda-4686  line  emission  from O-stars and their modeling in
          the  literature,  we  postulate that the He II lambda-4686 line
          comes from the acceleration zone of the secondary stellar wind.
          We  attribute  the  large  increase  in the line intensity to a
          slight increase in the density of the secondary stellar wind in
          its  acceleration zone. The increase in density could be due to
          the  ionization  and subsequent deceleration of the wind by the
          enhanced X-ray emission arising from the shocked secondary wind
          further downstream or to accretion of the primary stellar wind.
          Accretion  around  the secondary equatorial plane gives rise to
          collimation of the secondary wind, which increases its density,
          hence  enhancing  the  He  II  lambda-4686  emission  line.  In
          contrast  with  previous  explanations,  the presently proposed
          model  does  not  require  a  prohibitively  high X-ray flux to
          directly photoionize the He.

          We   present   time-resolved   spectroscopy   of   the  optical
          counterpart  to  the  proposed ultra-compact binary system V407
          Vul  (=RX  J1914.4+2456).  Our  Gemini spectra resolve the 9.48
          minute  periodicity  that has previously been reported for this

          reddened  late-type  spectrum  of  type G9V and contains solely
          unresolved  absorption  features. No radial velocity signatures
          exceeding  10 km/s could be detected on periods from minutes to

          We  present the first low luminosity (LX > 5 - 10 1036 erg s-1)
          X-ray  luminosity  functions  (XLFs) of low-mass X-ray binaries
          (LMXBs) determined for two typical old elliptical galaxies, NGC
          3379 and NGC 4278. Because both galaxies contain little diffuse
          emission  from hot ISM and no recent significant star formation
          (hence  no  high-mass X-ray binary contamination), they provide
          two  of  the best homogeneous sample of LMXBs. With 110 and 140
          ks Chandra ACIS S3 exposures, we detect 59 and 112 LMXBs within
          the  D25  ellipse  of  NGC 3379 and NGC 4278, respectively. The
          resulting  XLFs are well represented by a single power-law with
          a  slope  (in  a differential form) of 1.9 0.1. In NGC 4278, we
          can  exclude  the  break  at  LX  ~  5  x 1037 erg s-1 that was
          recently suggested to be a general feature of LMXB XLFs. In NGC
          3379  instead we find a localized excess over the power law XLF
          at  ~4  x  1037  erg  s-1,  but with a marginal significance of
          ~1.6s.  Because  of  the  small  number of luminous sources, we
          cannot  constrain  the  high  luminosity break (at 5 x 1038 erg
          s-1)  found in a large sample of early type galaxies. While the
          optical  luminosities  of  the  two galaxies are similar, their
          integrated  LMXB  X-ray  luminosities  differ by a factor of 4,
          consistent  with  the  relation  between  the  X-ray to optical
          luminosity ratio and the globular cluster specific frequency.

          Title:   The   Eccentricity-Mass  Distribution  of  Exoplanets:
          Signatures of Different Formation Mechanisms?
          Authors:  Ignasi Ribas (CSIC/IEEC, Spain), Jordi Miralda-Escude
          (ICREA/IEEC, Spain, and IAS Princeton, USA)
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to A&A
          We  examine  the  distributions  of  eccentricity and host star
          metallicity  of exoplanets as a function of their mass. Planets
          with  M  sin  i  >~  4  M_J  have  an eccentricity distribution
          consistent  with that of binary stars, while planets with M sin
          i  <~  4  M_J  are  less  eccentric  than binary stars and more
          massive  planets. In addition, host star metallicities decrease
          with planet mass. The statistical significance of both of these
          trends  is only marginal with the present sample of exoplanets.
          To  account for these trends, we hypothesize that there are two
          populations  of  gaseous planets: the low-mass population forms
          by  gas  accretion onto a rock-ice core in a circumstellar disk
          and is more abundant at high metalliticities, and the high-mass
          population  forms  directly  by  fragmentation of a pre-stellar
          cloud.  Planets  of  the  first  population  form  in initially
          circular  orbits  and  grow their eccentricities later, and may
          have  a  mass  upper limit from the total mass of the disk that
          can  be  accreted by the core. The second population may have a
          mass  lower limit resulting from opacity-limited fragmentation.
          This would roughly divide the two populations in mass, although
          they would likely overlap over some mass range. If most objects
          in  the  second  population  form  before the pre-stellar cloud
          becomes  highly opaque, they would have to be initially located
          in  orbits larger than ~30 AU, and would need to migrate to the
          much smaller orbits in which they are observed. The higher mean
          orbital  eccentricity  of the second population might be caused
          by  the  larger required intervals of radial migration, and the
          brown  dwarf  desert might be due to the inability of high-mass
          brown dwarfs to migrate inwards sufficiently in radius.

          We  have  undertaken  the simulation of hydrodynamic flows with
          bulk  Lorentz  factors  in the range 10^2--10^6. We discuss the
          application   of   an   existing   relativistic,   hydrodynamic
          primitive-variable  recovery  algorithm  to  a  study of pulsar
          winds,  and,  in  particular, the refinement necessary to admit
          such  ultra-relativistic  flows.  We  show  that  the use of an
          analytical  quartic root finder is required for Lorentz factors
          above 10^2, but that an iterative quartic root finder, which is
          known  to  be  robust  for  Lorentz  factors up to at least 25,
          offers a 24% speed advantage. We demonstrate the existence of a
          simple  diagnostic  allowing  for  a hybrid primitives recovery
          algorithm  that includes an automatic, real-time toggle between
          the  iterative and analytical methods. We further determine the
          accuracy   of   the  iterative  and  hybrid  algorithms  for  a
          comprehensive selection of input parameters.

          A synthesis of the present knowledge on gamma-ray emission from
          the  magnetosphere  of  a  rapidly  rotating  neutron  star  is
          presented,   focusing   on   the  electrodynamics  of  particle
          accelerators.   The   combined   curvature,   synchrotron,  and
          inverse-Compton  emission from ultra-relativistic positrons and
          electrons,  which  are  created by two-photon and/or one-photon
          pair  creation  processes,  or  emitted  from  the neutron-star
          surface,   provide   us   with  essential  information  on  the
          properties  of the accelerator -- electric potential drop along
          the  magnetic  field lines. A new accelerator model, which is a
          mixture  of traditional inner-gap and outer gap models, is also
          proposed, by solving the Poisson equation for the electrostatic
          potential  together  with the Boltzmann equations for particles
          and   gamma-rays   in  the  two-dimensional  configuration  and
          two-dimensional momentum spaces.

          The  results  of  simultaneous  multifrequency  observations of
          giant  radio  pulses from the Crab pulsar, PSR B0531+21, at 23,
          111,  and 600 MHz are presented and analyzed. Giant pulses were
          detected at a frequency as low as 23 MHz for the first time. Of
          the 45 giant pulses detected at 23 MHz, 12 were identified with
          counterparts  observed  simultaneously  at  600 MHz. Of the 128
          giant  pulses  detected  at  111  MHz,  21 were identified with
          counterparts  observed  simultaneously at 600 MHz. The spectral
          indices   for   the   power-law  frequency  dependence  of  the
          giant-pulse  energies  are from -3.1 to -1.6. The mean spectral
          index  is  -2.7  +/-  0.1  and  is  the same for both frequency
          combinations (600-111 MHz and 600-23 MHz). The large scatter in
          the  spectral  indices  of  the individual pulses and the large
          number of unidentified giant pulses suggest that the spectra of
          the  individual  giant  pulses  do not actually follow a simple
          power law. The observed shapes of the giant pulses at all three
          frequencies are determined by scattering on interstellar plasma
          irregularities.  The  scatter  broadening of the pulses and its
          frequency dependence were determined as tau_sc=20*(f/100)^(-3.5
          +/- 0.1) ms, where the frequency f is in MHz.

          Stars

          We  identify  `red  clump stars' - core helium-burning giants -
          among  2MASS stars and use them to measure the run of reddening
          with  distance  in  the  direction  of  each  of  the  Galactic
          Anomalous  X-ray Pulsars (AXP). We combine this with extinction
          estimates  from  X-ray spectroscopy to infer distances and find
          that  the  locations  of  all  AXP are consistent with being in
          Galactic   spiral   arms.  We  also  find  that  the  2-10  keV
          luminosities  implied  by  our distances are remarkably similar
          for  all  AXPs,  being  all around 1.3e35 erg s-1. Furthermore,
          using  our  distances to estimate effective black-body emitting
          radii,  we find that the radii are tightly anti-correlated with
          pulsed fraction, and somewhat less tightly anti-correlated with
          black-body  temperature. We find no obvious relationship of any
          property  with the dipole magnetic field strength inferred from
          the spin-down rate.

          Comments: 11 pages, with 3 figures. Submitted to ApJ Lett
          We  present  the results of HST observations of the source star
          for the first clear extrasolar planet detected by microlensing.
          The  light  curve  model  for this event predicts that the lens
          star  should be separated from the source star by ~6 mas at the
          time  of  the  HST  images.  If the lens star is a late G, K or
          early  M dwarf, then it will be visible in the HST images as an
          additional  source  of  light  that  is blended with the source
          image. Unless the lens and source have exactly the same colors,
          its  presence  will  also  be  revealed  by  a systematic shift
          between  centroids  of the source plus lens in different filter
          bands.  The  HST  data indicates both of these effects: the HST
          source  that  matches  the  position of the source star is 0.21
          magnitudes  brighter  in  the  ACS/HRC-F814W  filter  than  the
          microlensing model predicts, and there is an offset of ~0.7 mas
          between  the  centroid  of  this  source in the F814W and F435W
          filter  bands.  We  conclude  the  planetary host star has been
          detected  in  these  HST images, and this identification of the
          lens  star  enables a complete solution of the lens system. The
          lens  parameters  are  determined  with  a  Bayesian  analysis,
          averaging   over  uncertainties  in  the  measured  parameters,
          interstellar  extinction, and allowing for the possibility of a
          binary companion to the source star. This yields a stellar mass
          of  M_* = 0.63 (+0.07/-0.09) M_solar and a planet mass of M_p =
          2.6   (+0.8/-0.6}  M_Jup,  at  an  orbital  separation  of  4.3
          (+2.5/-0.8)  AU.  Thus, the lens system resembles our own Solar
          System,  with  a  planet of ~3 Jupiter-masses in a Jupiter-like
          orbit  around  a  star  of  two-thirds  of  a Solar mass. These
          conclusions  can be tested with future HST images, which should
          reveal  a  broadening  of  the  blended  source-plus-lens point
          spread function due to the relative lens-source proper motion.

          Using  the  3-telescope  IOTA interferometer on Mt. Hopkins, we
          report  results  from  the first near-infrared (lambda=1.65 mu)
          closure-phase  survey  of  Young  Stellar Objects (YSOs). These
          closure phases allow us to unambiguously detect departures from
          centrosymmetry  (i.e.,  skew)  in the emission pattern from YSO
          disks on the scale of ~4 milliarcseconds, expected from generic
          ``flared  disk''  models. Six of fourteen targets showed small,
          yet  statistically-significant,  non-zero  closure phases, with
          largest  values  from the young binary system MWC 361-A and the
          (pre-main  sequence?)  Be  star  HD 45677. Our observations are
          quite sensitive to the vertical structure of the inner disk and
          we  confront  the  predictions  of the ``puffed-up inner wall''
          models of Dullemond, Dominik, and Natta (DDN). Our data support
          disks  models  with  curved  inner  rims  because  the expected
          emission  appear symmetrically-distributed around the star over
          a  wide  range  of inclination angles. In contrast, our results
          are  incompatible  with  the  models  possessing vertical inner
          walls  because  they  predict  extreme  skewness  (i.e.,  large
          closure phases) from the near-IR disk emission that is not seen
          in  our  data.  In  addition,  we also present the discovery of
          mysterious   H-band   ``halos''  (~5-10%  of  light  on  scales
          0.01-0.50   arcsec)   around   a  few  objects,  a  preliminary
          ``parametric  imaging''  study  for  HD  45677,  and  the first

          through  Di-Jet Suppression, Mono-Jet Emission and a Supersonic
          Boom in the Quark-Gluon Plasma
          Authors: Horst Stoecker
          Comments:  21  pages,  9  figures.  accepted for publication in
          International  Journal  of Modern Physics D, added reference in
          Section 2
          The  production  of  Large  Extra  Dimension  (LXD) Black Holes
          (BHs), with a new, fundamental mass scale of $M_f = 1$ TeV, has
          been predicted to occur at the Large Hadron Collider, LHC, with
          the  formidable  rate  of  $10^8$ per year in p-p collisions at
          full  energy, 14 TeV, and at full luminosity. We show that such
          LXD-BH  formation  will be experimentally observable at the LHC
          by  the  complete disappearance of all very high $p_t$ ($> 500$
          GeV)  back-to-back  correlated Di-Jets of total mass $M > M_f =
          1$  TeV.  We suggest to complement this clear cut-off signal at
          $M > 2*500$ GeV in the di-jet-correlation function by detecting
          the  subsequent,  Hawking-decay products of the LXD-BHs, namely
          either  multiple  high  energy ($> 100$ GeV) SM Mono-Jets (i.e.
          away-side   jet  missing),  sprayed  off  the  evaporating  BHs
          isentropically into all directions or the thermalization of the
          multiple      overlapping      Hawking-radiation      in      a
          Heckler-Kapusta-Plasma.   Microcanonical   quantum  statistical
          calculations  of  the  Hawking  evaporation  process  for these
          LXD-BHs show that cold black hole remnants (BHRs) of Mass $\sim
          M_f$   remain  leftover  as  the  ashes  of  these  spectacular
          Di-Jet-suppressed  events.  Strong  Di-Jet  suppression is also
          expected   with   Heavy   Ion   beams   at   the  LHC,  due  to
          Quark-Gluon-Plasma induced jet attenuation at medium to low jet
          energies,  $p_t < 200$ GeV. The (Mono-)Jets in these events can
          be used to trigger for Tsunami-emission of secondary compressed
          QCD-matter  at  well  defined  Mach-angles, both at the trigger
          side  and  at  the awayside (missing) jet. The Machshock-angles
          allow  for  a  direct measurement of both the equation of state
          EoS  and  the  speed  of sound $c_s$ via supersonic bang in the
          "big bang" matter.

          +61 303
          Authors: M.Chernyakova, A.Neronov, R.Walter
          Comments: 8 pages, submitted to MNRAS
          LSI  +61  303  is  one  of  the few X-ray binaries with Be star
          companion  from  which  both  radio  and  high-energy gamma-ray
          emission have been observed. We present XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL
          observations  which  reveal  variability  of the X-ray spectral
          index of the system. The X-ray spectrum is hard (photon index ~
          1.5) during the orbital phases of both high and low X-ray flux.
          However,  the spectrum softens at the moment of transition from
          high to low X-ray state. The spectrum of the system in the hard
          X-ray  band  does  not reveal the presence of a cut-off (or, at
          least  a spectral break) at 10-60 keV energies, expected if the
          compact  object  is  an  accreting  neutron  star. The observed
          spectrum  and  spectral  variability  can  be  explained if the
          compact object in the system is a rotation powered pulsar.

          Comments: 60 pages including 20 figures; submitted to ApJ
          Based  on  a  spectral  analysis  of  the  X-ray  continuum, we
          conclude  that  the  compact primary of the binary X-ray source
          GRS  1915+105  is a rapidly-rotating Kerr black hole. We find a
          lower  limit  on the dimensionless spin parameter of a* greater
          than  0.98.  Our  result  is  robust  in  the  sense that it is
          independent of the details of the data analysis and insensitive
          to  the  uncertainties  in  the  mass and distance of the black
          hole.  Furthermore, the result is based on a fully relativistic
          accretion-disk  model,  which includes an advanced treatment of
          spectral hardening. Our data selection relies on a rigorous and
          quantitative  definition  of  the  thermal  state of black hole
          binaries, which we used to screen all of the available RXTE and
          ASCA  data  for the thermal state of GRS 1915+105. We also give
          an update on published results on the relatively moderate spins
          that  have  been  reported  for  three other stellar-mass black
          holes:  a*  ~ 0.65-0.80 for GRO J1655-40, a* ~ 0.70-0.85 for 4U
          1543-47, and a* less than 0.26 for LMC X-3. Finally, we discuss
          the  significance  of  our  results  for  relativistic-jet  and
          core-collapse  models,  and  for the detection of gravitational
          waves.

          We  have  studied  the face-on, barred spiral NGC 7424 (site of
          the  rare  Type  IIb  SN  2001ig)  with Chandra, Gemini and the
          Australia  Telescope  Compact Array. After giving revised X-ray
          colours  and luminosity of the supernova, here we focus on some
          other  interesting  sources  in  the galaxy: in particular, our
          serendipitous  discovery  of  two  ultraluminous  X-ray sources
          (ULXs). The brighter one (~ 10^{40} erg/s) has a power-law-like
          spectrum  with  photon index Gamma ~ 1.8. The other ULX shows a
          spectral  state  transition or outburst between the two Chandra
          observations, 20 days apart. Optical data show that this ULX is
          located  in  a young (age ~ 7-10 Myr), bright complex rich with
          OB  stars  and  clusters.  An  exceptionally bright, unresolved
          radio source (0.14 mJy at 4.79 GHz, implying a radio luminosity
          twice  as  high as Cas A) is found slightly offset from the ULX
          (~  80  pc).  Its  radio  spectral  index alpha ~ -0.7 suggests
          optically-thin   synchrotron  emission,  either  from  a  young
          supernova remnant or from a radio lobe powered by a ULX jet. An
          even  brighter,  unresolved radio source (0.22 mJy at 4.79 GHz)
          is  found  in  another  young,  massive  stellar  complex,  not
          associated  with  any X-ray sources: based on its flatter radio
          spectral  index  (alpha  ~ -0.3), we suggest that it is a young
          pulsar wind nebula, a factor of 10 more radio luminous than the
          Crab.

          Title:  Orbital Evolution of Algol Binaries with a Circumbinary
          Disk
          Authors: Wen-Cong Chen, Xiang-Dong Li, Sheng-Bang Qian
          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          It  is  generally  thought  that  conservative mass transfer in
          Algol  binaries  causes  their orbits to be wider, in which the
          less  massive  star  overflows  its  Roche-lobe.  The  observed
          decrease in the orbital periods of some Algol binaries suggests
          orbital  angular momentum loss during the binary evolution, and
          the  magnetic braking mechanism is often invoked to explain the
          observed  orbital  shrinkage.  Here  we  suggest an alternative
          explanation,  assuming that a small fraction of the transferred
          mass  forms a circumbinary disk, which extracts orbital angular
          momentum from the binary through tidal torques. We also perform
          numerical  calculations of the evolution of Algol binaries with
          typical   initial  masses  and  orbital  periods.  The  results
          indicate   that,   for   reasonable   input   parameters,   the
          circumbinary  disk  can  significantly  influence  the  orbital
          evolution, and cause the orbit to shrink on a sufficiently long
          timescale.  Rapid mass transfer in Algol binaries with low mass
          ratios can also be accounted for in this scenario.

          showed also that waveform fitting of the oscillations resulting
          from hot spots at the surface of rapidly rotating neutron stars
          constrain  their  masses  and  radii.  These  two breakthroughs
          suddenly  opened  up  a  new  window on fundamental physics, by
          providing  new  insights  on  strong  gravity and dense matter.
          Building  upon  the RXTE legacy, in the Cosmic Vision exercise,
          testing  General  Relativity  in  the  strong  field  limit and
          constraining  the  equation  of  state  of  dense  matter  were
          recognized  recently  as  key  goals  to  be pursued in the ESA
          science   program   for  the  years  2015-2025.  This  in  turn
          identified  the  need  for a large (10 m2 class) aperture X-ray
          observatory.  In  recognition  of  this  need, the XEUS mission
          concept  which  has  evolved  into a single launch L2 formation
          flying  mission will have a fast timing instrument in the focal
          plane.  In  this  paper  I will outline the unique science that
          will be addressed with fast X-ray timing on XEUS.

          Title: Light Curves of Swift Gamma Ray Bursts
          Authors: Paolo Cea
          Comments: 17 pages, 13 figures
          Recent  observations  from  the  Swift gamma ray burst explorer
          indicate  that  a  large  fraction  of  gamma  ray  bursts  are
          characterized by a canonical behaviour of the X-ray afterglows.
          We  present  an effective theory which allows us to account for
          X-ray  light  curves  of  both  gamma ray bursts and X-ray rich
          flashes.  We  propose  that  gamma  ray  bursts  originate from
          massive magnetic powered pulsars.

          Title: The Crystallography of Three-Flavor Quark Matter
          Authors: Krishna Rajagopal (MIT and LBNL), Rishi Sharma (MIT)
          Comments: 41 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables
          We  analyze  and  compare  candidate crystal structures for the
          crystalline color superconducting phase that may arise in cold,
          dense  but not asymptotically dense, three-flavor quark matter.
          We   determine   the   gap  parameter  Delta  and  free  energy
          Omega(Delta)  for  many  possible  crystal  structures within a
          Ginzburg-Landau approximation, evaluating Omega(Delta) to order
          Delta^6. In contrast to the two-flavor case, we find a positive
          Delta^6  term  and  hence  an Omega(Delta) that is bounded from
          below  for  all the structures that we analyze. This means that
          we  are  able  to evaluate Delta and Omega as a function of the
          splitting  between  Fermi  surfaces  for  all the structures we
          consider.  We  find  two  structures  with  particularly robust
          values of Delta and the condensation energy, within a factor of
          two  of  those for the CFL phase which is known to characterize
          QCD  at asymptotically large densities. The robustness of these
          phases  results  in  their  being  favored  over wide ranges of
          density.  However,  it  also  implies  that the Ginzburg-Landau
          approximation   is  not  quantitatively  reliable.  We  develop
          qualitative  insights  into  what  makes  a  crystal  structure
          favorable,  and  use these to winnow the possibilities. The two
          structures  that  we  find  to be most favorable are both built
          from  condensates  with  face-centered  cubic  symmetry: in one
          case,  the  <ud>  and  <us>  condensates  are  separately  face
          centered  cubic;  in the other case <ud> and <us> combined make
          up a face centered cube.

          With  central densities way above the density of atomic nuclei,
          neutron  stars contain matter in one of the densest forms found
          in  the universe. Depending of the density reached in the cores
          of  neutron  stars,  they  may  contain stable phases of exotic
          matter  found nowhere else in space. This article gives a brief
          overview of the phases of ultra-dense matter predicted to exist
          deep  inside  neutron stars and discusses the equation of state
          associated with such matter.

          Title: Magnetars versus Radio Pulsars: MHD Stability in Newborn
          Highly Magnetized Neutron Stars
          Authors: U. Geppert, M. Rheinhardt
          Comments:   14  pages,  5  figures;  accepted  by  Astronomy  &
          Astrophysics
          We  study  the stability/establishment of dipolar magnetostatic
          equilibrium  configurations in new--born neutron stars (NSs) in
          dependence  on  the  rotational  velocity  $\Omega$  and on the
          initial  angle $\alpha$ between rotation and magnetic axis. The
          NS  is  modeled  as  a  sphere  of a highly magnetized ($B \sim
          10^{15}$G)   incompressible  fluid  of  uniform  density  which
          rotates  rigidly.  For  the initial dipolar background magnetic
          field,   which   defines   the  magnetic  axis,  two  different
          configurations  are  assumed.  We  solve the 3D non--linear MHD
          equations   by   use   of  a  spectral  code.  The  problem  in
          dimensionless  form  is completely defined by the initial field
          strength  (for  a  fixed  field geometry), the magnetic Prandtl
          number  $\Pm$,  and the normalized rotation rate. The evolution
          of  the  magnetic and velocity fields is considered for initial
          magnetic  field  strengths  characterized by the ratio of ohmic
          diffusion and initial \Alf{} travel times $\ttOhm/\ttAO \approx
          1000$, for $\Pm = 0.1, 1, 10$, and the ratio of rotation period
          and  initial  \Alf{}  travel time, $P/\ttAO = 0.012, 0.12, 1.2,
          12$. We find hints for the existence of a unique stable dipolar
          magnetostatic   configuration   for   any   specific  $\alpha$,
          independent  of  the  initial  field  geometry.  Comparing  NSs
          possessing  the  same  field  structure  at  the  end  of their
          proto--NS  phase,  it turns out that sufficiently fast rotating
          NSs  ($P\la6  $ms) with $\alpha \la 45^0$ retain their magnetar
          field,  while  the  others  lose  almost  all  of their initial
          magnetic  energy  by  transferring it into magnetic and kinetic
          energy  of  relatively  small--scaled fields and continue their
          life   as  radio  pulsars  with  a  dipolar  surface  field  of
          $10^{12...13}$G.

          Authors: Hidenori Matsui, Asao Habe, Takayuki R. Saitoh
          Comments: 19 pages, 11 figures, accepted to ApJ
          We  study  influence  of  a galactic central supermassive black
          hole  (SMBH) binary on gas dynamics and star formation activity
          in  a  nuclear  gas  disk  by making three-dimensional Tree+SPH
          simulations. Due to orbital motions of SMBHs, there are various
          resonances  between  gas  motion and the SMBH binary motion. We
          have  shown  that  these  resonances create some characteristic
          structures  of  gas  in the nuclear gas disk, for examples, gas
          elongated  or  filament structures, formation of gaseous spiral
          arms,  and small gas disks around SMBHs. In these gaseous dense
          regions,  active  star  formations  are induced. As the result,
          many star burst regions are formed in the nuclear region.

          Remnants
          Authors:  Roland  Jesseit,  Thorsten  Naab,  Reynier  Peletier,
          Andreas Burkert
          Comments: submitted
          We present a two-dimensional kinematic analysis for a sample of
          simulated  binary disc merger remnants with mass ratios 1:1 and
          3:1.  For  the  progenitor discs we used pure stellar models as
          well  as  models  with 10% of their mass in gas. A multitude of
          phenomena  also  observed  in  real  galaxies  are found in the
          simulations. These include misaligned rotation, embedded discs,
          gas  rings,  counter-rotating  cores  and  kinematic misaligned
          discs.  Using  the 2D maps we illustrate projection effects and
          the  change  in  properties  of  a  merger  remnant when gas is
          included  in  the  merger.  We  find  that  kinematic  peculiar
          subsystems   are  preferably  formed  in  equal  mass  mergers.
          Equal-mass  collisionless remnants can show almost no rotation,
          regular   rotation   or   strong  kinematic  misalignment.  The
          inclusion  of gas makes the remnants appear more round(1:1) and
          axisymmetric(3:1).  Counter-Rotating  Cores  (CRCs)  are almost
          exclusively  formed  in equal-mass mergers with a dissipational
          component.  3:1 remnants show a much more regular structure. We
          quantify  these  properties  by applying the kinemetric methods
          recently developed by Krajnovi\'c et al. This work will help to
          understand  observations  of  elliptical galaxies with 2D field
          spectrographs, like SAURON and Sinfoni.

          We  have observed the Crab Pulsar in the optical with S-Cam, an
          instrument  based on Superconducting Tunneling Junctions (STJs)
          with  $\mu$s  time  resolution.  Our aim was to study the delay
          between  the  radio  and  optical  pulse.  The  Crab Pulsar was
          observed three times over a time span of almost 7 years, on two
          different  locations,  using  three  different  versions of the
          instrument,  and using two different GPS units. We consistently
          find  that  the optical peak leads the radio peak by 49$\pm$90,
          254$\pm$170,   and  291$\pm$100  $\mu$s.  On  assumption  of  a
          constant  optical lead, the weighted-average value is $\sim$170
          $\mu$s,  or  when  rejecting  (based  on a perhaps questionable
          radio ephemeris) the first measurement, 273$\pm$100 $\mu$s.

          We  present  the  results  of  a  deep  imaging survey of stars
          surrounded  by  planets  detected  through  the radial velocity
          technique.  The  purpose  is  to search for and to characterize
          long-period  stellar  and  substellar  companions.  The  sample
          contains  a total of 26 stars, among which 6 exhibit additional
          radial  velocity  drifts.  We  used NACO, at the ESO Very Large
          Telescope,   and  PUEO-KIR,  at  the  Candian  French  Hawaiian
          Telescope,  in  order  to conduct a near-infrared coronographic
          survey   with   adaptive  optics  of  the  faint  circumstellar
          environment  of  the  planetary  hosts. The domain investigated
          ranges  between  typically  0.1 to 15" (i.e. about 3 to 500 AU,
          according  to  the  mean distance of the sample). The survey is
          sensitive  to  companions within the stellar and the substellar
          domains,  depending on the distance to the central stars and on
          the  stars properties. The images of 14 stars do not reveal any
          companions  once  the  field  objects are removed. 8 stars have
          close  potential  companions that need to be re-observed within
          1-2  years  to  check  for  physical companionship. 4 stars are
          surrounded  by  faint  objects  which  are  confirmed  or  very
          probable  companions.  The  companion  to  HD  13445 (Gl 86) is
          already  known. The HD 196885 star is a new close visual binary
          system  with a high probability for being bound. Finally, the 2
          newly  discovered  companions,  HD 1237 B and HD 27442 B, share
          common  proper  motions  with the central stars. Orbital motion
          is,  in addition, detected for HD 1237 B. HD 1237 B is likely a
          low-mass M star, located at 70 AU (projected distance) from the
          primary.  Surprisingly,  HD  27442  B  is most probably a white
          dwarf companion located at about 240 AU (projected distance).

          Cold three-flavor quark matter at large (but not asymptotically
          large)   densities   may   exist   as   a   crystalline   color
          superconductor.  We explore this possibility by calculating the
          gap  parameter  Delta and free energy Omega(Delta) for possible
          crystal  structures  within  a  Ginzburg-Landau  approximation,
          evaluating   Omega(Delta)   to  order  Delta^6.  We  develop  a
          qualitative  understanding  of  what  makes a crystal structure
          stable,  and find two structures with particularly large values
          of Delta and the condensation energy, within a factor of two of
          those   for   the  CFL  phase  known  to  characterize  QCD  at
          asymptotically  large densities. The robustness of these phases
          results  in their being favored over wide ranges of density and
          though  it  also implies that the Ginzburg-Landau approximation
          is  not quantitatively reliable, previous work suggests that it
          can  be  trusted  for  qualitative  comparisons between crystal
          structures. We close with a look ahead at the calculations that
          remain to be done in order to make contact with observed pulsar
          glitches and neutron star cooling.

          Heidelberg 2006)
          Nuclear  activity  in galaxies is closely connected to galactic
          mergers  and  supermassive  black holes (SBH). Galactic mergers
          perturb   substantially   the   dynamics  of  gas  and  stellar
          population  in  the  merging galaxies, and they are expected to
          lead  to  formation of supermassive binary black holes (BBH) in
          the center of mass of the galaxies merged. A scheme is proposed
          here  that  connects the peak magnitude of the nuclear activity
          with  evolution  of a BBH system. The scheme predicts correctly
          the  relative  fractions  of different types of active galactic
          nuclei  (AGN)  and explains the connection between the galactic
          type  and  the  strength of the nuclear activity. It shows that
          most  powerful  AGN  should result from mergers with small mass
          ratios,  while  weaker activity is produced in unequal mergers.
          The scheme explains also the observed lack of galaxies with two
          active  nuclei,  which is attributed to effective disruption of
          accretion disks around the secondary in BBH systems with masses
          of the primary smaller than ~10^10 solar masses.

          Title: On the metallicity dependence of HMXBs
          Authors: L. M. Dray
          Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures, MNRAS accepted
          It  is  commonly  assumed  that  high  mass X-ray binary (HMXB)
          populations  are  little-affected  by metallicity. However, the
          massive  stars  making  up  their  progenitor systems depend on
          metallicity in a number of ways, not least through their winds.
          We  present simulations, well-matched to the observed sample of
          Galactic  HMXBs, which demonstrate that both the number and the
          mean period of HMXB progenitors can vary with metallicity, with
          the  number increasing by about a factor of three between solar
          and  SMC metallicity. However, the SMC population itself cannot
          be  explained  simply  by metallicity effects; it requires both
          that  the HMXBs observed therein primarily sample the older end
          of the HMXB population, and that the star formation rate at the
          time of their formation was very large.

          examining   bremsstrahlung,  cyclotron  emission,  circumbinary
          dust,  and  L/T brown dwarf secondary stars. Bremsstrahlung and
          cyclotron   emission   appear   unlikely   to   be  significant
          contributors  to  the  observed  fluxes.  At  present, the most
          likely  candidate  for  the  excess  emission  is  dust that is
          probably   located   in  a  circumbinary  disk  with  an  inner
          temperature  near  800  K. However, a simple dust disk plus any
          reasonable  low  mass  or  brown  dwarf-like  secondary star is
          unable to fully explain the observed flux densities in the 3--8
          $\mu$m region.

          Title:  The  Cosmological  Evolution  of  the  Average Mass Per
          Baryon
          Authors: Gary Steigman (The Ohio State University)
          Comments: 3 pages; no figures
          Subsequent  to  the  early Universe quark-hadron transition the
          universal  baryon  number  is carried by nucleons: neutrons and
          protons.  The  total  number  of  nucleons  is preserved as the
          Universe  expands,  but as it cools lighter protons are favored
          over  heavier  neutrons  reducing  the average mass per baryon.
          During primordial nucleosynthesis free nucleons are transformed
          into  bound  nuclides,  primarily  hydrogen and helium, and the
          nuclear  binding  energies  are radiated away, further reducing
          the  average  mass  per baryon. In particular, the reduction in
          the   average   mass   per   baryon  resulting  from  Big  Bang
          Nucleosynthesis  modifies  the  numerical  factor  relating the
          baryon  (nucleon)  mass  density to the nucleon number density.
          Here  the  average  mass  per  baryon, m_B, is tracked from the
          early  Universe to the present and the result is used to relate
          the  present  ratio  of  baryons  to photons (by number) to the
          present baryon mass density at a level of accuracy commensurate
          with that of recent cosmological data.

          Title:   Low  Mach  number  modeling  of  Type  I  X-ray  burst
          deflagrations
          Authors: David J. Lin, Alvin Bayliss, Ronald E. Taam
          Comments: 33 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ
          The  Low  Mach  Number  Approximation  (LMNA)  is applied to 2D
          hydrodynamical modeling of Type I X-ray bursts on a rectangular
          patch  on  the  surface of a non-rotating neutron star. Because
          such  phenomena  involve decidedly subsonic flows, the timestep
          increase offered by the LMNA makes routine simulations of these
          deflagrations  feasible  in an environment where strong gravity
          produces   significant   stratification,   while  allowing  for
          potentially  significant lateral differences in temperature and
          density.  The  model is employed to simulate the heating, peak,
          and initial cooling stages of a burst. During the deflagration,
          Benard-like  cells  naturally  fill  up  a vertically expanding
          convective  layer.  The  Mach  number  is always less than 0.10
          throughout  the simulation, thus justifying the low Mach number
          approximation.  While the convective layer is superadiabatic on
          average,  significant fluctuations in adiabaticity occur within
          it   on  subconvective  timescales.  Due  to  convective  layer
          expansion,  significant  compositional mixing naturally occurs,
          but  tracer  particle  penetration through the convective layer
          boundaries  on convective timescales is temporary and spatially
          limited.  Thus,  mixing  occurs  on  the  relatively slow burst
          timescale  through  thermal  expansion  of the convective layer
          rather  than  from  mass  penetration  of  the convective layer
          boundary  through  particle convection. At the convective layer
          boundaries   where   mixing   is  less  efficient,  the  actual
          temperature gradient more closely follows the Ledoux criteria.

          Title:   The   phase  diagram  of  neutral  quark  matter  with
          pseudoscalar condensates in the color-flavor locked phase
          Authors: Harmen J. Warringa
          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures
          We  calculate  the  phase  diagram  of  color  and electrically
          neutral quark matter in weak equilibrium using the NJL model at
          high  baryon  densities.  We extend previous analyses by taking
          into account the possibility of formation of pseudoscalar meson
          condensates  in  the  color-flavor  locked (CFL) phase. We find
          that  the  kaon  condensed phase (CFL-K0) is preferred over the
          CFL  phase  at  low  temperatures.  It is found that the CFL-K0
          phase  contains  no gapless modes. The results we have obtained
          should be of relevance for the modeling of compact stars.

          Nova  outbursts  take place in binary star systems comprising a
          white  dwarf  and either a low-mass Sun-like star or, as in the
          case  of  the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi, a red giant. Although
          the  cause  of  these  outbursts  is  known to be thermonuclear
          explosion  of  matter  transferred  from the companion onto the
          surface  of  the  white  dwarf,  models  of the previous (1985)
          outburst  of  RS  Ophiuchi  failed  to adequately fit the X-ray
          evolution   and  there  was  controversy  over  a  single-epoch
          high-resolution  radio  image, which suggested that the remnant
          was  bipolar  rather than spherical as modelled. Here we report
          the  detection  of  spatially resolved structure in RS Ophiuchi
          from two weeks after its 12 February 2006 outburst. We track an
          expanding  shock  wave as it sweeps through the red giant wind,
          producing  a remnant similar to that of a type II supernova but
          evolving  over  months  rather  than millennia. As in supernova
          remnants,   the  radio  emission  is  non-thermal  (synchrotron
          emission),  but  asymmetries  and  multiple emission components
          clearly   demonstrate  that  contrary  to  the  assumptions  of
          spherical  symmetry  in  models  of  the  1985  explosion,  the
          ejection  is  jet-like,  collimated by the central binary whose
          orientation   on   the   sky   can  be  determined  from  these
          observations.

          We  present  the  results of spectroscopic-- and orbit--sampled
          photometric  observations  of  the  faint  UV-excess  object PG
          2200+085.  The  optical  CCD  photometry  observations  of this
          object   were   performed   by  the  Russian-Turkish  1.5-meter
          telescope  RTT150 at the TUBITAK National Observatory (Turkey).
          The  long-slit  optical  spectroscopy  observations  with 2.6 A
          resolution  were  carried  out  by 6-meter telescope BTA at the
          Special  Astrophysical  Observatory  (Russia).  The photometric
          variations  over  two  nights  are  almost  sinusoidal  with an
          amplitude  \Delta  m_V  =  0.04 m and a period of P = 0.3186 d.
          Such  a  light curve is typical of a detached close binary with
          an  illumination  effect  or  the  ellipsoidal deformation of a
          secondary  star.  The  observed  spectrum  clearly  displays  a
          featureless  blue  continuum  of  a  hot  component  and a rich
          absorption--line  and molecular band K--star spectrum. The CaII
          line profiles with strong emission cores are remarkably similar
          to  those of V471 Tau. We tentatively classify PG 2200+085 as a
          pre-cataclysmic binary of the V471 Tau type.

          Authors: Ehud Behar, Raanan Nordon, Eyal Ben-Bassat, Noam Soker
          (Technion)
          Eta  Carinae (eta Car) is a stellar binary system with a period
          of 5.54 years. It harbors one of the brightest and most massive
          stars in our galaxy. This paper presents spectroscopic evidence
          for a fast (up to 2,000 km/s) X-ray jet of ionized gas launched
          from  eta  Car  just  before  what is believed to be the binary
          periastron  (point  of  smallest binary separation). By analogy
          with  jets  in  other  astrophysical systems, it is possible to
          attribute the jet to the onset of a phase of accretion.

          after incorporating referee comments
          We  report  our  analysis of a Chandra X-ray observation of the
          rich  globular  cluster Terzan 5, in which we detect 50 sources
          to  a  limiting  1.0-6 keV X-ray luminosity of 3*10^{31} ergs/s
          within  the  half-mass  radius  of the cluster. Thirty-three of
          these  have  L_X>10^{32} ergs/s, the largest number yet seen in
          any  globular  cluster.  In  addition to the quiescent low-mass
          X-ray  binary (LMXB, identified by Wijnands et al.), another 12
          relatively  soft sources may be quiescent LMXBs. We compare the
          X-ray  colors of the harder sources in Terzan 5 to the Galactic
          Center  sources studied by Muno and collaborators, and find the
          Galactic Center sources to have harder X-ray colors, indicating
          a  possible  difference  in  the populations. We cannot clearly
          identify   a   metallicity  dependence  in  the  production  of
          low-luminosity  X-ray  binaries  in Galactic globular clusters,
          but a metallicity dependence of the form suggested by Jordan et
          al. for extragalactic LMXBs is consistent with our data.

          We   use   axisymmetric   magnetohydrodynamic   simulations  to
          investigate  the  spinning-down  of  magnetars  rotating in the
          propeller   regime   and   moving  supersonically  through  the
          interstellar  medium.  The  simulations indicate that magnetars
          spin-down  rapidly due to this interaction, faster than for the
          case  of  a  non-moving star. From many simulation runs we have
          derived  an  approximate  scaling laws for the angular momentum
          loss rate, \dot{L} \propto
          \~\eta_m^{0.3}\mu^{0.6}\rho^{0.8}{\cal                M}^{-0.4}
          \Omega_*^{1.5},  where  \rho is the density of the interstellar
          medium,  \cal  M  is  Mach  number,  \mu is the star's magnetic
          moment,  \Omega_*  is  its  angular  velocity,  and  \eta_m  is
          magnetic  diffusivity. A magnetar with a surface magnetic field
          of  10^{13}  -  10^{15} G is found to spin-down to a period P >
          10^5-10^6  s  in  \sim  10^4  -  10^5  years.  There is however
          uncertainty about the value of the magnetic diffusivity so that
          the  time-scale may be longer. We discuss this model in respect
          of  Soft  Gamma  Repeaters (SGRs) and the isolated neutron star
          candidate RXJ1856.5-3754.

          Astrophysics  and  Space  Science  "Close  Binaries in the 21th
          Century,   New   Opportunities   and   Challenges"   conference
          proceeding
          Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) are close binary systems where mass
          is  transferred from a red dwarf star to a white dwarf star via
          an  accretion  disk.  The  flickering is observed as stochastic
          variations  in  the emitted radiation both in the continuum and
          in the emission line profiles. The main goal of our simulations
          is to compare synthetic Doppler maps with observed ones, aiming
          to  constrain  the flickering properties and wind parameters. A
          code  was  developed  which  generates  synthetic emission line
          profiles  of a geometrically thin and optically thick accretion
          disk.   The  simulation  allows  us  to  include  flares  in  a
          particular  disk  region.  The  emission  line  flares  may  be
          integrated  over  arbitrary  ``exposure''  times, producing the
          synthetic  line  profiles.  Flickering Doppler maps are created
          using such synthetic time series. The presence of a wind inside
          the Roche lobe was also implemented. Radiative transfer effects
          in the lines where taken into account in order to reproduce the
          single peaked line profiles frequently seen in nova-like CVs.

          We  present  the  first direct, i.e. not involving intermediate
          steps, distance determination to a detached eclipsing binary in
          M33,  which  was found by the DIRECT Project. Located in the OB
          66 association at coordinates (alpha,
          delta)=(01:33:46.17,+30:44:39.9) for J2000.0, it was one of the
          most  suitable  detached eclipsing binaries found by DIRECT for
          distance   determination,  given  its  apparent  magnitude  and
          orbital   period.   We   obtained   follow-up  BV  time  series
          photometry, JHKs photometry and optical spectroscopy from which
          we  determined the parameters of the system. It contains two O7
          main sequence stars with masses of 33.4+/-3.5 Mo and 30.0+/-3.3
          Mo  and  radii of 12.3+/-0.4 Ro and 8.8+/-0.3 Ro, respectively.
          We  derive  temperatures  of 37000+/-1500 K and 35600+/-1500 K.
          Using  BVRJHKs photometry for the flux calibration, we obtain a
          distance  modulus  of 24.92+/-0.12 mag (964+/-54 kpc), which is
          ~0.3  mag  longer  than  the  Key  Project  distance to M33. We
          discuss  the  implications  of our result and the importance of
          establishing  M33  as  an  independent rung on the cosmological

          Authors: Alexey Goldin, Valeri Makarov
          A  considerable  number of astrometric binaries whose positions
          on  the  sky  do  not obey the standard model of mean position,
          parallax  and  linear  proper  motion,  were  observed  by  the
          Hipparcos  satellite.  Some  of them remain non-discovered, and
          their  observational data have not been properly processed with
          the  more  adequate  astrometric  model that includes nonlinear
          orbital  motion.  We  develop  an  automated algorithm based on
          "genetic  optimization",  to  solve the orbital fitting problem
          with  no  prior  information  about  the  orbital  elements  is
          available  (from,  e.g.,  spectroscopic data or radial velocity
          monitoring).  We test this method on Hipparcos stars with known
          orbital solutions in the catalog, and further apply it to stars
          with stochastic solutions, which may be unresolved binaries. At
          a  confidence  level  of  99%, orbital fits are obtained for 65
          stars,  most  of  which have not been known as binary. A few of
          the  new  probable  binaries with A-type primaries with periods
          444-2015  d  are  chemically  peculiar  stars, including Ap and
          \lambda  Boo  type.  The  anomalous  spectra of these stars are
          explained  as  admixture  of  the  light  from  the unresolved,
          sufficiently  bright  and  massive  companions. We estimate the
          apparent  orbits  of  four  stars which have been identified as
          members  of  the  300 Myr-old UMa kinematic group. Another four
          new  nearby binaries may include low-mass M-type or brown dwarf
          companions.  Similar  astrometric  models and algorithms can be
          used  for  binary  stars  and  planet  hosts  observed  by  SIM
          PlanetQuest and Gaia.

          Title: Unveiling the nature of the highly absorbed X-ray source

          Comments: accepted for publication in A&A
          We  report  on the results of an EPIC XMM-Newton observation of
          the  faint  source  SAXJ1748.2-2808  and the surrounding field.
          This  source was discovered during the BeppoSAX Galactic center
          survey  performed  in 1997-1998. A spatial analysis resulted in
          the  detection  of  31  sources  within the EPIC field of view.
          SAXJ1748.2-2808  is  clearly  resolved  into  2 sources in EPIC
          images with the brighter contributing almost 80% of the 2-10keV
          flux.  Spectral fits to this main source are consistent with an
          absorbed  power-law  with  a  photon  index  of  1.4+/-0.5  and
          absorption  equivalent  to 14E22cm-2 together with an iron line
          at  6.6+/-0.2  keV  with  an  equivalent  width  of ~780eV. The
          significantly  better statistics of the XMM-Newton observation,
          compared  with  BeppoSAX,allows to exclude a thermal nature for
          the  X-ray  emission.  A  comparison with other observations of
          SAXJ1748.2-2808  does  not  reveal any evidence for spectral or
          intensity  long-term  variability. Based on these properties we
          propose  that  the  source  is a low-luminosity high-mass X-ray
          binary located in the Galactic center region.

          the proceedings of the conference "Isolated Neutron Stars: from
          the Interior to the Surface"
          We  discuss  three topics related to the neutron star (NS) mass
          spectrum.  At first we discuss the possibility to form low-mass
          ($  M  \stackrel{<}{\sim}  1  M_{\odot}$)  and  suggest this is
          possible   only   due  to  fragmentation  of  rapidly  rotating
          proto-NSs.  Such  low-mass  NSs  should  have very high spatial
          velocities   which   could  allow  identification.  A  critical
          assessment of this scenario is given. Secondly, we discuss mass
          growth  due  to accretion for NSs in close binary systems. With
          the  help  of  numerical  population  synthesis calculations we
          derive  the mass spectrum of massive ($M > 1.8 M_{\odot}$) NSs.
          Finally, we discuss the role of the mass spectrum in population
          studies  of young cooling NSs. We formulate a kind of {\it mass
          constraint} which can be helpful, in our opinion, in discussing
          different competive models of the thermal evolution of NSs.

          Title: Seismic signatures of strange stars with crust
          Authors: A.I. Chugunov
          Comments:  15  pages,  3  figures,  Accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We  study  acoustic  oscillations  (eigenfrequencies,  velocity
          distributions,  damping  times)  of  normal  crusts  of strange
          stars.  These  oscillations  are  very specific because of huge
          density  jump at the interface between the normal crust and the
          strange  matter  core.  The  oscillation problem is shown to be
          self-similar.  For  a  low  (but  non-zero) multipolarity l the
          fundamental mode (without radial nodes) has a frequency ~300 Hz
          and  mostly  horizontal  oscillation  velocity;  other pressure
          modes  have  frequencies >=20 kHz and almost radial oscillation
          velocities. The latter modes are similar to radial oscillations
          (have  approximately  the  same frequencies and radial velocity
          profiles). The oscillation spectrum of strange stars with crust
          differs  from  the  spectrum  of  neutron  stars.  If detected,
          acoustic  oscillations  would allow one to discriminate between
          strange  stars  with  crust and neutron stars and constrain the
          mass and radius of the star.

          Title:  Discovery of the two wings of the Kookaburra complex in
          VHE gamma -rays with H.E.S.S

          Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Aims.  Search  for  Very  High Energy gamma-ray emission in the
          Kookaburra  complex  through  observations  with  the  H.E.S.S.
          array.   Methods.   Stereoscopic  imaging  of  Cherenkov  light
          emission of the gamma-ray showers in the atmosphere is used for
          the  reconstruction  and  selection of the events to search for
          gamma-ray   signals.   Their   spectrum   is   derived   by   a
          forward-folding  maximum  likelihood fit. Results. Two extended
          gamma-ray  sources with an angular (68%) radius of 3.3-3.4' are
          discovered  at  high  (>13sigma) statistical significance: HESS
          J1420-607  and  HESS J1418-609. They exhibit a flux above 1 TeV
          of   (2.97+/-0.18stat  +/-0.60sys)x10-12  and  (2.17+/-0.17stat
          +/-0.43sys)x10-12  cm-2  s-1,  respectively,  and  similar hard
          photon  indices ~2.2. Multi-wavelength comparisons show spatial
          coincidence  with  the wings of the Kookaburra. Two pulsar wind
          nebulae  candidates,  K3/PSR  J1420-6048 and the Rabbit, lie on
          the  edge  of  the  H.E.S.S.  sources. Conclusions. The two new
          sources confirm the non-thermal nature of at least parts of the
          two  radio  wings which overlap with the gamma-ray emission and
          establish  their  connection  with  the  two  X-ray pulsar wind
          nebulae  candidates.  Given  the large point spread function of
          EGRET, the unidentified source(s) 3EG J1420-6038/GeV J1417-6100
          could  possibly  be related to either or both H.E.S.S. sources.
          The most likely explanation for the Very High Energy gamma-rays
          discovered   by   H.E.S.S.   is  inverse  Compton  emission  of
          accelerated  electrons  on the Cosmic Microwave Background near
          the  two  candidate  pulsar wind nebulae, K3/PSR J1420-6048 and
          the  Rabbit.  Two  scenarios  which  could lead to the observed
          large  (~10  pc)  offset-nebula  type  morphologies are briefly
          discussed.

          We  present 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, 24, and 70 micron images of the
          Crab  Nebula obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC and
          MIPS  cameras,  Low- and High-resolution Spitzer IRS spectra of
          selected  positions  within  the  nebula,  and  a near-infrared
          ground-based  image  made  in the light of [Fe II]1.644 micron.
          The  8.0  micron  image, made with a bandpass that includes [Ar
          II]7.0  micron,  resembles  the  general  morphology of visible
          H-alpha  and  near-IR  [Fe II] line emission, while the 3.6 and
          4.5  micron  images  are  dominated  by  continuum  synchrotron
          emission.  The  24  micron  and  70 micron images show enhanced
          emission  that may be due to line emission or the presence of a
          small  amount  of  warm dust in the nebula on the order of less
          than  1%  of  a solar mass. The ratio of the 3.6 and 4.5 micron
          images reveals a spatial variation in the synchrotron power law
          index  ranging from approximately 0.3 to 0.8 across the nebula.
          Combining  this  information with optical and X-ray synchrotron
          images,  we  derive  a  broadband  spectrum  that  reflects the
          superposition  of  the  flatter spectrum jet and torus with the
          steeper  diffuse nebula, and suggestions of the expected pileup
          of relativistic electrons just before the exponential cutoff in
          the X-ray. The pulsar, and the associated equatorial toroid and
          polar  jet structures seen in Chandra and HST images (Hester et
          al.  2002)  can  be  identified  in  all of the IRAC images. We
          present  the  IR  photometry of the pulsar. The forbidden lines
          identified in the high resolution IR spectra are all double due
          to  Doppler  shifts  from  the  front and back of the expanding
          nebula  and  give  an  expansion velocity of approximately 1264
          km/s.

          Comments: 13 pages, 14 figures, to appear in MNRAS
          We  report  on  the  results  from  a  five-night  campaign  of
          high-speed  spectroscopy  of  the  17-minute  binary  AM  Canum
          Venaticorum, obtained with the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope
          on La Palma.
          We  derive  a  mass  ratio  q=0.18+/-0.01  for AM CVn, which is
          significantly  higher  than  the  value found in previous, less
          direct  measurements.  We discuss the implications for AM CVn's
          evolutionary  history  and  show  that a helium star progenitor
          scenario   is   strongly   favoured.  We  further  discuss  the
          implications  for  the  interpretation  of  AM  CVn's superhump
          behaviour,  and for the detectability of its gravitational-wave
          signal with LISA.
          We  further  test  the  predictions of an eccentric, precessing
          disc  that  are based on AM CVn's observed superhump behaviour.
          We  limit  the  effective eccentricity in the outermost part of
          the  disc, where the resonances that drive the eccentricity are
          thought  to  occur,  to  e=0.04+/-0.01,  which  is smaller than
          previous models indicated.

          details
          The  Laser  Interferometer  Space Antenna (LISA) will produce a
          data  stream  containing  a vast number of overlapping sources:
          from  strong  signals  generated  by the coalescence of massive
          black  hole  binary  systems  to  much  weaker  radiation  form
          sub-stellar   mass  compact  binaries  and  extreme-mass  ratio
          inspirals.  It  has  been  argued  that the observation of weak
          signals could be hampered by the presence of loud ones and that
          they  first need to be removed to allow such observations. Here
          we  consider  a different approach in which sources are studied
          simultaneously  within  the framework of Bayesian inference. We
          investigate  the  simplified case in which the LISA data stream
          contains  radiation  from  a  massive  black hole binary system
          superimposed   over  a  (weaker)  quasi-monochromatic  waveform
          generated  by  a  white  dwarf  binary. We derive the posterior
          probability  density  function of the model parameters using an
          automatic  Reversible  Jump  Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm
          (RJMCMC).  We  show  that the information about the sources and
          noise  are  retrieved at the expected level of accuracy without
          the need of removing the stronger signal. Our analysis suggests
          that  this  approach  is  worth  pursuing further and should be
          considered for the actual analysis of the LISA data.

          We  have  used  the  NICMOS  NIC1  camera  on  the Hubble Space
          Telescope  to  obtain  high  angular  resolution  images  of 51
          ultracool  dwarfs  in  the  immediate Solar Neighbourhood. Nine
          systems are resolved as binary, with component separations from
          1.5  and 15 AU. All of the systems have components with similar
          luminosities,  and,  consequently,  high  mass ratios, q > 0.8.
          Limiting  analysis  to L dwarfs within 20 parsecs, the observed
          binary fraction is 12(+7/-3). Applying Bayesian analysis to our
          dataset,   we  derive  a  mass-ratio  distribution  that  peaks
          strongly  at  unity. Modelling the semi-major axis distribution
          as a logarithmic Gaussian, the best fit is centered at log(a_0)
          =  0.8  AU  (~6.3  AU),  with a (logarithmic) width of 0.3. The

          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, accepted by ApJL
          The  recently discovered RRAT sources are characterized by very
          bright  radio  bursts  which, while being periodically related,
          occur    infrequently.   We   find   bursts   with   the   same
          characteristics  for  the  known  pulsar B0656+14. These bursts
          represent  pulses  from  the  bright  end of an extended smooth
          pulse-energy  distribution  and  are  shown  to be unlike giant
          pulses,  giant micropulses or the pulses of normal pulsars. The
          extreme  peak-fluxes of the brightest of these pulses indicates
          that  PSR  B0656+14,  were it not so near, could only have been
          discovered  as an RRAT source. Longer observations of the RRATs
          may  reveal  that they, like PSR B0656+14, emit weaker emission
          in addition to the bursts.

          Population  synthesis  model  of  the galactic planetary nebula
          population produced by singlestars and binaries
          Authors: Maxwell Moe, Orsola De Marco
          Comments:  52  pages  (referee format), 14 figures. Accepted by
          ApJ
          We  present  a  population  synthesis calculation to derive the
          total  number  of  planetary  nebulae  (PN)  in the Galaxy that
          descend  from  single  stars and stars in binary systems. Using
          the  most  recent  literature  results  on galactic and stellar
          formation  as  well  as stellar evolution, we predict the total
          number  of  galactic  PNe  with radii <0.9 pc to be (46,000 +/-
          13,000).  We  do  not claim this to be the complete population,
          since  there  can  be  visible  PNe with radii larger than this
          limit.  However,  by  taking  this limit, we make our predicted
          population  inherently  comparable to the observationally-based
          value  of  Peimbert,  who determined (7200 +/- 1800) PNe should
          reside  in  the Galaxy today. Our prediction is discrepant with
          the  observations  at the 2.9-sigma level, a disagreement which
          we argue is meaningful in view of our specific treatment of the
          uncertainty.  We  conclude that it is likely that only a subset
          of  the  stars  thought  to  be capable of making a visible PN,
          actually  do.  In  the second paper in this series, an argument
          will  be  presented that the bulk of the galactic PN population
          might be better explained if only binaries produce PNe.
          The  predicted  PN formation rate density from single stars and
          binaries  is (1.1 +/- 0.5) x 10^{-12} PN/yr per cubic pc in the
          local  neighborhood.  This number is lower than the most recent
          PN  birthrate  density  estimates  of  2.1 x 10^{-12} PN/yr per
          cubic  pc,  which  are  based  on  local  PN  counts and the PN
          distance scale, but more in line with the white dwarf birthrate
          densities  determined  by  Liebert  et  al.  ((1.0  +/- 0.25) x
          10^{-12}  WD/yr  per  cubic  pc).  The  predicted  PN birthrate
          density  will  be revised down, if we assume that only binaries
          make  PNe.  This revision will imply that the PN distance scale
          has to be revised to larger values.

          Aims:  We  address  the  issue of the multiplicity of the three
          brightest  early-type  stars  of the young open cluster IC1805,
          namely  HD15570,  HD15629  and  HD15558. Methods: For the three
          stars,  we  measured  the  radial  velocity by fitting Gaussian
          curves  to  line profiles in the optical domain. In the case of
          the   massive   binary   HD15558,   we  also  used  a  spectral
          disentangling method to separate the spectra of the primary and
          of  the  secondary  in order to derive the radial velocities of
          the  two  components.  These  measurements were used to compute
          orbital   solutions  for  HD15558.  Results:  For  HD15570  and
          HD15629,  the  radial velocities do not present any significant
          trend  attributable  to a binary motion on time scales of a few
          days,  nor from one year to the next. In the case of HD15558 we
          obtained  an  improved  SB1  orbital  solution with a period of
          about  442  days,  and  we  report  for  the  first time on the
          detection  of  the spectral signature of its secondary star. We
          derive  spectral  types  O5.5III(f) and O7V for the primary and
          the  secondary  of  HD15558. We tentatively compute a first SB2
          orbital  solution  although  the  radial  velocities  from  the
          secondary  star  should  be  considered  with caution. The mass
          ratio  is  rather high, i.e. about 3, and leads to very extreme
          minimum  masses,  in particular for the primary object. Minimum
          masses  of  the  order  of 150 \pm 50 and 50 \pm 15 M_\odot are
          found   respectively   for   the  primary  and  the  secondary.
          Conclusions:  We propose that HD15558 could be a triple system.
          This  scenario  could  help to reconcile the very large minimum
          mass  derived for the primary object with its spectral type. In
          addition,  considering new and previously published results, we
          find  that  the  binary frequency among O-stars in IC1805 has a
          lower  limit of 20%, and that previously published values (80%)
          are probably overestimated.

          after incorporating referee comments
          We  report  the detection of six discrete, low-luminosity (Lx <
          10^33  erg/s)  X-ray  sources,  located within 12 arcsec of the
          center  of  the collapsed-core globular cluster M30 (NGC 7099),
          and  a  total of 13 sources within the half-mass radius, from a
          50  ksec  Chandra ACIS-S exposure. Three sources lie within the
          very  small  upper  limit of 1.9 arcsec on the core radius. The
          brightest  of  the  three  core  sources has a luminosity of Lx
          (0.5-6  keV)  =  6x10^32  erg/s and a blackbody-like soft X-ray
          spectrum,  which  are both consistent with it being a quiescent
          low-mass  X-ray  binary  (qLMXB).  We  have  identified optical
          counterparts to four of the six central sources and a number of
          the  outlying  sources,  using  deep Hubble Space Telescope and
          ground-based  imaging. While the two proposed counterparts that
          lie  within  the  core may represent chance superpositions, the
          two  identified  central  sources  that lie outside of the core
          have  X-ray  and  optical properties consistent with being CVs.
          Two additional sources outside of the core have possible active
          binary  counterparts. We discuss the X-ray source population of
          M30 in light of its collapsed-core status.

          Title: Color Superconductivity in Dense, but not Asymptotically
          Dense, Quark Matter
          Authors: Mark Alford, Krishna Rajagopal
          Comments:  37  pages,  7  figures.  To  appear  as a Chapter in
          "Pairing  in  Fermionic  Systems:  Basic  Concepts  and  Modern
          Applications", published by World Scientific
          Subj-class:    High    Energy    Physics    -    Phenomenology;
          Superconductivity
          At  ultra-high density, matter is expected to form a degenerate
          Fermi  gas  of  quarks in which there is a condensate of Cooper
          pairs    of    quarks    near    the   Fermi   surface:   color
          superconductivity.  In  this  chapter  we  review  some  of the
          underlying physics, and discuss outstanding questions about the
          phase  structure  of ultra-dense quark matter. We then focus on
          describing    recent   results   on   the   crystalline   color
          superconducting  phase  that may be the preferred form of cold,
          dense  but not asymptotically dense, three-flavor quark matter.
          The  gap parameter and free energy for this phase have recently
          been  evaluated within a Ginzburg-Landau approximation for many
          candidate crystal structures. We describe the two that are most
          favorable.  The  robustness  of  these  phases results in their
          being  favored  over  wide  ranges of density. However, it also
          implies   that   the   Ginzburg-Landau   approximation  is  not
          quantitatively  reliable. We describe qualitative insights into
          what  makes  a crystal structure favorable which can be used to
          winnow  the  possibilities.  We  close with a look ahead at the
          calculations   that   remain  to  be  done  in  order  to  make
          quantitative contact with observations of compact stars.

          We  present new observations of 470 stars using the Fibre Large
          Array  Multi-Element Spectrograph (FLAMES) instrument in fields
          centered  on  the  clusters  NGC  330  and NGC 346 in the Small
          Magellanic  Cloud (SMC), and NGC 2004 and the N11 region in the
          Large  Magellanic Cloud (LMC). A further 14 stars were observed
          in  the N11 and NGC 330 fields using the Ultraviolet and Visual
          Echelle  Spectrograph (UVES) for a separate programme. Spectral
          classifications  and  stellar  radial  velocities are given for
          each  target, with careful attention to checks for binarity. In
          particular  we  have investigated previously unexplored regions
          around  the  central  LH9/LH10  complex of N11, finding ~25 new
          O-type   stars  from  our  spectroscopy.  We  have  observed  a
          relatively large number of Be-type stars that display permitted
          Fe  II  emission  lines. These are primarily not in the cluster
          cores and appear to be associated with classical Be-type stars,
          rather  than  pre main-sequence objects. The presence of the Fe
          II  emission, as compared to the equivalent width of H$\alpha$,
          is  not  obviously  dependent  on  metallicity.  We  have  also
          explored the relative fraction of Be- to normal B-type stars in
          the  field-regions  near  to  NGC  330 and NGC 2004, finding no
          strong  evidence  of  a trend with metallicity when compared to
          Galactic results. A consequence of service observations is that
          we have reasonable time-sampling in three of our FLAMES fields.
          We  find  lower  limits  to the binary fraction of O- and early
          B-type  stars  of 23 to 36%. One of our targets (NGC346-013) is
          especially  interesting with a massive, apparently hotter, less
          luminous secondary component.

          Title: Inverse Compton e-p pair cascade model for the gamma-ray
          production in massive binary LSI +61^o 303
          Authors: W. Bednarek
          Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  apply  an  inverse  Compton  $e^\pm$ pair cascade model for
          $\gamma$-ray  production in massive binary system LSI +61$^{\rm
          o}$  303 assuming that electrons are accelerated already inside
          the  inner  part  of  the  jet  launched by the compact object.
          $\gamma$-ray  spectra,  affected  by  the  cascade process, and
          lower  energy  spectra,  from  the  synchrotron  cooling of the
          highest  energy  electrons  in  the  jet,  are  calculated as a
          function  of  the  phase  of  this  binary system. $\gamma$-ray
          spectra  expected  in such model have different shape than that
          ones  produced  by  electrons  in the jet directly to observer.
          Moreover,  the  model  predicts  clear anti-correlation between
          $\gamma$-ray  fluxes in the GeV (1-10 GeV) and TeV ($>200$ GeV)
          energy  ranges  with  the peak of the TeV emission at the phase
          $\sim$0.5  (the  peak  half  width  ranges  between  the phases
          $\sim$0.4-0.9 for the inclination of the binary system equal to
          $60^{\rm  o}$,  and  $\sim$0.4-0.1  for $30^{\rm o}$). The fine
          features  of  TeV  $\gamma$-ray  emission  (fluxes and spectral
          shapes)  as  a  function  of the phase of the binary system are
          consistent  with  recent  observations  reported  by  the MAGIC
          collaboration.  Future  simultaneous  observations  in  the GeV
          energies  (by  the  GLAST  and AGILE telescopes) and in the TeV
          energies  (by  the  MAGIC  and  VERITAS telescopes) should test
          other   predictions  of  the  considered  model  supporting  or
          disproving the hypothersis of acceleration of electrons already
          in the inner part of the microquasar jets.

          Title:  Capture  Rates of Compact Objects by Supermassive Black
          Holes
          Authors:  José  Antonio  de  Freitas Pacheco, Charline Filloux,
          Tania Regimbau
          Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures; accepted for publication in PRD
          Capture  rates  of  compact  objects were calculated by using a
          recent  solution of the Fokker-Planck equation in energy-space,
          including  two-body  resonant  effects. The fraction of compact
          objects  (white  dwarfs, neutron stars and stellar black holes)
          was  estimated  as  a  function of the luminosity of the galaxy
          from  a new grid of evolutionary models. Stellar mass densities
          at  the  influence  radius  of central supermassive black holes
          were  derived from brightness profiles obtained by Hubble Space
          Telescope  observations.  The  present study indicates that the
          capture  rates  scale as $\propto M_{bh}^{-1.048}$, consequence
          of  the  fact  that  dwarf galaxies have denser central regions
          than luminous objects. If the mass distribution of supermassive
          black  holes  has  a  lower  cutoff  at  $\sim  1.4\times 10^6$
          M$_{\odot}$  (corresponding to the lowest observed supermassive
          black  hole  mass,  located in M32), then 9 inspiral events are
          expected  to  be seen by LISA (7-8 corresponding to white dwarf
          captures  and  1-2  to  neutron  star  and  stellar  black hole
          captures)  after  one  year  of operation. However, if the mass
          distribution  extends  down to $\sim 2\times 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$,
          then  the  total  number of expected events increases up to 579
          (corresponding  to  $\sim$  274  stellar  black  hole captures,
          $\sim$  194  neutron  star  captures and $\sim$ 111 white dwarf
          captures).

          Title: Difficulties for Compact Composite Object Dark Matter
          Authors: Daniel T. Cumberbatch, Joseph Silk, Glenn D. Starkman
          Recently  Zhitnitsky suggested ``that DM particles are strongly
          interacting composite macroscopically large objects ... made of
          well  known  light quarks (or >... antiquarks)." In doing so he
          argued   that   these  compact  composite  objects  (CCOs)  are
          ``natural explanations of many observed data, such as [the] 511
          keV line from the bulge of our galaxy" and the CHANDRA-observed
          excess  of  diffuse  X-ray emission toward the galactic center.
          Here  we  argue that the annihilation of interstellar electrons
          (or positrons) off positrons (or electrons) in the the CCO does
          not  lead  to  the observed narrow 511 keV line, but to a broad
          continuum  due  to  the  high  densities  of  the  CCO-confined
          leptons.  We  argue  further  that  in  order  to  generate the
          observed  flux of X-rays, the CCOs in the galactic centre would
          only  require  a temperature of 1 eV, and therefore unlikely to
          be  the  dominant heat source for the surrounding 8 keV plasma.
          While  these observations do not rule out CCOs as galactic dark
          matter, they do weaken the motivation for them.

          Title:  Massive  perturber-driven  interactions of stars with a
          massive black hole
          Authors:   Hagai   B.  Perets,  Clovis  Hopman,  Tal  Alexander
          (Weizmann)
          Comments: 11 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables. Submitted to ApJ
          We  study  the  role  of massive perturbers (MPs) in deflecting
          stars  and  binaries  to  almost radial (``loss-cone'') orbits,
          where  they  pass  near  the  central massive black hole (MBH),
          interact  with  it at periapse q, and are ultimately destroyed.
          MPs  dominate  dynamical  relaxation  when the ratio of the 2nd
          moments   of  the  MP  and  star  mass  distributions,  mu_2  =
          (N_p*M_p^2)/(N_star*M_star^2),  satisfies mu_2>>1. The observed
          MPs  in  the  nucleus of the Galaxy (giant molecular clouds and
          stellar   clusters),   and  plausibly  in  late  type  galaxies
          generally,   have   10^2<=mu_2<=10^5.   MPs  thus  shorten  the
          relaxation timescale by 10^2-10^5 relative to 2-body relaxation
          by  stars  alone. We show this increases by 10-1000 the rate of
          large-q interactions with the MBH, where loss-cone refilling by
          stellar   2-body  relaxation  is  inefficient.  We  extend  the
          Fokker-Planck  loss-cone formalism to approximately account for
          relaxation by rare encounters with MPs. We show that binary-MBH
          exchanges  driven  by  MPs  may explain the origin of the young
          main  sequence B stars that are observed very near the Galactic
          MBH,  and may increase by orders of magnitude the ejection rate
          of  hyper-velocity  stars. We suggest that MP-driven relaxation
          plays  an  important role in the capture of stars on very tight
          orbits around the MBH, leading to their tidal orbital decay and
          disruption or to inspiral through the emission of gravitational
          waves  from  zero-eccentricity  orbits.  We show that loss-cone
          refilling  by  MPs leads to rapid orbital decay and coalescence
          of binary MBHs, thereby solving the stalling problem.

          Authors:  Simon Johnston, M. Kramer, D. R. Lorimer, A. G. Lyne,
          M. McLaughlin, B. Klein, R. N. Manchester
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS Letters
          We  report the discovery of two highly dispersed pulsars in the
          direction  of  the  Galactic Centre made during a survey at 3.1
          GHz  with  the Parkes radio telescope. Both PSRs J1745-2912 and
          J1746-2856  have an angular separation from the Galactic Centre
          of  less  than 0.3 degrees and dispersion measures in excess of
          1100  cm-3pc, placing them in the top 10 pulsars when ranked on
          this  value. The frequency dependence of the scatter-broadening
          in  PSR  J1746-2856 is much shallower than expected from simple
          theory.  We  believe  it  likely  that  the pulsars are located
          between  150  and  500  pc from the Galactic Centre on the near
          side,  and  are  part  of an excess population of neutron stars
          associated  with the Centre itself. A second survey made at 8.4
          GHz  did not detect any pulsars. This implies either that there
          are not many bright, long-period pulsars at the Galactic Centre
          or  that the scattering is more severe at high frequencies than
          current models would suggest.

          Title: Violent Stellar Merger Model for Transient Events
          Authors:   Noam   Soker  (Technion,  Israel),  Romuald  Tylenda
          (N.Copernicus Ast. Center, Poland)
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS
          We derive the constraints on the mass ratio for a binary system
          to  merge  in  a violent process. We find that the secondary to
          primary  stellar  mass  ratio  should  be  ~0.003 < (M_2/M_1) <
          ~0.15.  A  more  massive  secondary  star will keep the primary
          stellar  envelope  in  synchronized  rotation  with the orbital
          motion  until merger occurs. This implies a very small relative
          velocity  between  the  secondary  star and the primary stellar
          envelope at the moment of merger, and therefore very weak shock
          waves,  and low flash luminosity. A too low mass secondary will
          release  small amount of energy, and will expel small amount of
          mass,  which  is  unable  to  form an inflated envelope. It can
          however produce a quite luminous but short flash when colliding
          with a low mass main sequence star.
          Violent and luminous mergers, which we term mergebursts, can be
          observed   as  V838  Monocerotis  type  events,  where  a  star
          undergoes  a  fast  brightening  lasting days to months, with a
          peak luminosity of up to ~10^6 Lo followed by a slow decline at
          very low effective temperatures.

          Astronomy & Astrophysics
          {\it  Chandra} Galactic Center Survey detected $\sim 800$ X-ray
          point-like  sources  in  the $2^{\circ} \times 0.8^{\circ}$ sky
          region  around the Galactic Center. In this paper, we study the
          spatial and luminosity distributions of these sources according
          to  their spectral properties. Fourteen bright sources detected
          are used to fit jointly an absorbed power-law model, from which
          the  power-law  photon  index  is  determined  to be $\sim$2.5.
          Assuming  that  all other sources have the same power-law form,
          the relation between hardness ratio and HI column density $N_H$
          is  used  to  estimate  the $N_H$ values for all sources. Monte
          Carlo  simulations  show  that  these  sources  are more likely
          concentrated   in  the  Galactic  center  region,  rather  than
          distributed throughout the Galactic disk. We also find that the
          luminosities  of  the  sources  are  positively correlated with
          their  HI  column  densities, i.e. a more luminous source has a
          higher  HI  column density. From this relation, we suggest that
          the  X-ray  luminosity  comes  from  the interaction between an
          isolated old neutron star and interstellar medium (mainly dense
          molecular  clouds).  Using  the standard Bondi accretion theory
          and  the  statistical  information  of  molecular clouds in the
          Galactic  center,  we  confirm  this  positive  correlation and
          calculate  the  luminosity  range  in  this  scenario, which is
          consistent  with  the  observation  ($10^{32}\sim 10^{35}$ ergs
          s$^{-1}$).

          R.L.M. Corradi and U. Munari
          The  planets  capture  model  for  the  eruption of V838 Mon is
          discussed. We used three methods to estimate the location where
          the  planets were consumed. There is a nice consistency for the
          results  of  the  three different methods, and we find that the
          typical stopping / slowing radius for the planets is about 1Ro.
          The  three  peaks  in  the  optical light curve of V838 Mon are
          either   explained  by  the  swallowing  of  three  planets  at
          different  radii  or by three steps in the slowing down process
          of a single planet. We discuss the other models offered for the
          outburst of V838 Mon, and conclude that the binary merger model
          and  the planet/s scenario seem to be the most promising. These
          two  models have several similarities, and the main differences
          are  the  stellar  evolutionary  stage,  and  the  mass  of the
          accreted  material. We show that the energy emitted in the V838
          Mon event is consistent with the planets scenario. We suggest a
          few  explanations  for the trigger for the outburst and for the
          double  structure  of  the  optical peaks in the light curve of
          V838 Mon.

          Title:  The  Recurrent Eclipse of an Unusual Pre--Main-Sequence
          Star in IC 348
          Authors: S. Nordhagen, W. Herbst, E. C. Williams, E. Semkov
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ (Letters)
          The   recurrence  of  a  previously  documented  eclipse  of  a
          solar-like  pre--main-sequence star in the young cluster IC 348
          has  been observed. The recurrence interval is 4.7 $\pm 0.1$ yr
          and  portions  of  4 cycles have now been seen. The duration of
          each  eclipse  is at least 3.5 years, or $\sim 75$% of a cycle,
          verifying  that  this is not an eclipse by a stellar companion.
          The  light  curve  is  generally  symmetric  and  approximately
          flat-bottomed.  Brightness  at  maximum  and  minimum have been
          rather  stable  over  the  years  but  the  light  curve is not
          perfectly  repetitive  or  smooth and small variations exist at
          all  phases.  We  confirm that the star is redder when fainter.
          Models  are  discussed  and it is proposed that this could be a
          system  similar  to KH 15D in NGC 2264. Specifically, it may be
          an  eccentric  binary  in  which  a portion of the orbit of one
          member  is  currently  occulted  during some binary phases by a
          circumbinary  disk.  The  star deserves sustained observational
          attention  for  what  it  may  reveal  about  the circumstellar
          environment of low-mass stars of planet-forming age.

          Title: On the Nature of Part Time Radio Pulsars
          Authors: Xiang-Dong Li
          Comments: 9 pages, accepted to ApJL
          The  recent  discovery  of  rotating  radio  transients and the
          quasi-periodicity  of  pulsar  activity in the radio pulsar PSR
          B1931$+$24  has  challenged  the  conventional  theory of radio
          pulsar  emission. Here we suggest that these phenomena could be
          due  to  the interaction between the neutron star magnetosphere
          and the surrounding debris disk. The pattern of pulsar emission
          depends  on  whether  the disk can penetrate the light cylinder
          and efficiently quench the processes of particle production and
          acceleration  inside  the magnetospheric gap. A precessing disk
          may  naturally  account  for  the switch-on/off behavior in PSR
          B1931$+$24.

          systems where the contact binary is spectrally dominated by its
          companion  (which  itself  is  a  binary  in  V1084  Sco). Five
          additional variables, V872 Ara, BD Cap, HIP 69300, BX Ind, V388

          The conversion of neutron matter to strange matter in a neutron
          star  have  been  studied  as  a two step process. In the first
          step,  the  nuclear  matter gets converted to two flavour quark
          matter.  The conversion of two flavour to three flavour strange
          matter  takes  place  in  the second step. The first process is
          analysed with the help of equations of state and hydrodynamical
          equations,  whereas,  in  the second process, non-leptonic weak
          interaction  plays  the  main  role. Velocities and the time of
          travel  through  the  star  of these two conversion fronts have
          been analysed and compared.

          Subj-class: Materials Science
          Electron diffraction, imaging, and energy loss provide evidence
          for   unlayered   graphene   sheets  in  the  core  of  certain
          interstellar  graphite  onions  (from  the meteorite Murchison)
          whose   isotopes   indicate  formation  in  the  atmosphere  of
          late-stage  asymptotic  giant  branch  stars  (like those which
          nucleo-synthesized  much  of  the earth's carbon). The data are
          compared   to   structural   models   loosely  associated  with
          atom-by-atom,   molecule-by-molecule,   and   dendritic-droplet
          solidification processes. In this context the observed density,
          diffraction peak-shapes, and edge-on sheet patterns, along with
          theoretical  limits  on  time  for  growth  in  the presence of
          outgoing  radiation  pressure,  suggest nucleation of hexagonal
          sheets  from  pentagons, perhaps from a supercooled melt. These
          results warrant a closer examination of specimen structure, the
          energetics of unlayered graphene nucleation, and processes such
          as jets in late star atmospheres.

          It  is  shown  that in strongly magnetized neutron stars, there
          exist upper limits of magnetic field strength, beyond which the
          self energies for both neutron and proton components of neutron
          star  matter  become  complex  in nature. As a consequence they
          decay within the strong interaction time scale. However, in the
          ultra-strong  magnetic field case, when the zeroth Landau level
          is  only  occupied  by protons, the system again becomes stable
          against strong decay.

          Photometric  data  will  be  made available at the CDS once the
          final  version  appears.  The  resolution  in  Fig.  1 has been
          reduced
          Determinations  of  stellar  mass  and  radius  with  realistic
          uncertainties  at the level of 1% provide important constraints
          on  models  of  stellar  structure  and evolution. We present a
          high-precision  light curve of the A0IV star Psi Centauri, from
          the star tracker on board the WIRE satellite and the Solar Mass
          Ejection  Imager  camera  on  the Coriolis spacecraft. The data
          show  that Psi Cen is an eccentric eclipsing binary system with
          a  relatively long orbital period. The WIRE light curve extends
          over  28.7  nights  and contains 41334 observations with 2 mmag
          point-to-point  scatter.  The  eclipse depths are 0.28 and 0.16
          mag, and show that the two eclipsing components of Psi Cen have
          very  different  radii. As a consequence, the secondary eclipse
          is total. We find the eccentricity to be e=0.55 with an orbital
          period  of  38.8  days from combining the WIRE light curve with
          data  taken  over two years from the Solar Mass Ejection Imager
          camera.  We  have  fitted  the  light  curve with EBOP and have
          assessed  the  uncertainties  of the resulting parameters using
          Monte  Carlo simulations. The fractional radii of the stars and
          the  inclination  of  the orbit have random errors of only 0.1%
          and  0.01 degrees, respectively, but the systematic uncertainty
          in  these  quantities  may  be  somewhat  larger.  We have used
          photometric calibrations to estimate the effective temperatures
          of  the components of Psi Cen to be 10450+-300 and 8800+-300 K,
          indicating  masses of about 3.1 and 2.0 Msun. There is evidence
          in  the  WIRE  light curve for g-mode pulsations in the primary
          star.

          Title:   Modelling   the   closest   double  degenerate  system
          RXJ0806.3+1527 and its decreasing period
          Authors: F. D'Antona, P. Ventura, L. Burderi, A. Teodorescu
          Comments: 13 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication on ApJ,
          main journal
          In  the hypothesis that the 5.4m binary RXJ0806.3+1527 consists
          of  a  low  mass  helium  white dwarf (donor) transferring mass
          towards  its  more  massive white dwarf companion (primary), we
          consider  as  possible donors white dwarfs which are the result
          of  common  envelope  evolution  occurring when the helium core
          mass  of the progenitor giant was still very small (~ 0.2Msun),
          so  that  they  are  surrounded  by  a  quite  massive hydrogen
          envelope  (~1/100Msun or larger), and live for a very long time
          supported  by  proton--proton  burning. Mass transfer from such
          low  mass white dwarfs very probably starts during the hydrogen
          burning stage, and the donor structure will remain dominated by
          the  burning shell until it loses all the hydrogen envelope and
          begins  transferring  helium. We model mass transfer from these
          low  mass  white  dwarfs, and show that the radius of the donor
          decreases  while  they  shed the hydrogen envelope. This radius
          behavior,  which is due to the fact that the white dwarf is not
          fully   degenerate,  has  two  important  consequences  on  the
          evolution  of the binary: 1) the orbital period decreases, with
          a  timescale  consistent with the period decrease of the binary
          RXJ0806.3+1527;  2) the mass transfer rate is a factor of about
          10 smaller than from a fully degenerate white dwarf, easing the
          problem  connected  with  the  small  X-ray  luminosity of this
          object.  The  possibility  that  such  evolution  describes the
          system  RXJ0806.3+1527  is  also  consistent  with the possible
          presence of hydrogen in the optical spectrum of the star, whose
          confirmation would become a test of the model.

          Title:  Stability of the Accretion Flows with Stalled Shocks in
          Core-Collapse Supernovae
          Authors: Tatsuya Yamasaki, Shoichi Yamada
          Comments: 37 pages, 15 figures, submitted to ApJ
          Bearing  in mind the application to the theory of core-collapse
          supernovae,  we  performed  a  global  linear  analysis  on the
          stability  of  spherically  symmetric accretion flows through a
          standing  shock  wave onto a proto neutron star. As unperturbed
          flows, we adopted the spherically symmetric steady solutions to
          the  Euler  equations obtained with realistic equation of state
          and  formulae  for  neutrino reaction rates taken into account.
          Then   we   solved   the  equations  for  linear  perturbations
          numerically,  and  obtained  the  eigen  frequencies  and eigen
          functions.  We  found (1) the flows are stable for all modes if
          the  neutrino  luminosity  is lower than $\sim 1\times 10^{52}$
          ergs/s  for  $\dot{M}=1.0M_{\odot}/{\rm  s}$.  (2)  For  larger
          luminosities,   the   non-radial   instabilities  are  induced,
          probably  via the advection-acoustic cycles. Interestingly, the
          modes  with  $\ell=2$  and  3  become  unstable  at  first  for
          relatively  low  neutrino luminosities, e.g. $\gtrsim 2-3\times
          10^{52}$  ergs/s  for  the  same  accretion  rate,  whereas the
          $\ell=1$  mode  is  the  most unstable for higher luminosities,
          $\sim  3-7\times  10^{52}$  ergs/s.  These  are all oscillatory
          modes.   (3)  For  still  larger  luminosities,  $\sim  7\times
          10^{52}$    ergs/s    for    $\dot{M}=1.0M_{\odot}/{\rm    s}$,
          non-oscillatory  modes,  both  radial  and  non-radial,  become
          unstable. These non-radial modes were identified as convection.
          We confirmed the results obtained by numerical simulations that
          the  instabilities induced by the advection-acoustic cycles are
          more   important   than   the  convection  for  lower  neutrino
          luminosities.

          and  momentum  needed  to  drive  pPN and PNe outflows. Angular
          momentum  considerations  lead  to  the  conclusion that single
          stars  may  not be capable of supporting strong fields for long
          times.  Thus  we  take  the working hypothesis that most PN may
          form  via binary stars. We propose that the grand challenge for
          PN   studies   is  fully  understanding  the  diverse  physical
          processes  at work in binary late stage evolution including the
          development of disks, fields and outflows.

          Title:  A  Time  Dependent Leptonic Model for Microquasar Jets:
          Application to LSI 61 303

          figures and 1 table
          he Galactic high-mass X-ray binary and jet source (microquasar)
          LSI  +61  303  has  recently  been  detected  at  TeV gamma-ray
          energies   by   the   MAGIC   telescope.   We  have  applied  a
          time-dependent  leptonic  jet  model  to the broadband spectral
          energy  distribution  and  orbital  modulation of the very high
          energy  gamma-ray emission of this source. Our model takes into
          account time dependent electron injection and acceleration, and
          the  adiabatic  and radiative cooling of non-thermal electrons.
          It  includes  synchrotron,  inverse  Compton (with seed photons
          from   the   companion   star  and  the  accretion  disk),  and
          synchrotron  self-Compton  emission,  as  well  as  gamma-gamma
          absorption  of  gamma-rays  by starlight photons. The model can
          successfully    reproduce    the    available   multiwavelength
          observational  data.  Our  best fit to the SED indicates that a
          magnetic  field  of B_0 ~ 5 X 10^3 G at ~ 10^3 R_g is required,
          and  electrons  need  to  be  accelerated  out  to TeV energies
          (gamma_2  =  10^6)  with a nonthermal injection spectrum with a
          spectral  index  of  q  =  1.7,  indicating  the  operation  of
          acceleration  mechanisms  beyond the standard first-order Fermi
          mechanism  at  relativistic  or  non-relativistic  shocks.  The
          orbital  modulation  of  the  VHE  gamma-ray  emission  can  be
          explained  solely  by  the geometrical effect of changes in the
          relative  orientation  of the stellar companion with respect to
          the compact object and jet as it impacts the position and depth
          of the gamma-gamma absorption trough.

          We  report observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory of a
          field  in  the  gamma$-Cygni  supernova  remnant  (SNR78.2+2.1)
          centered  on the cataloged location of the unidentified, bright
          gamma-ray  source  3EG  J2020+4017. In this search for an X-ray
          counterpart  to  the  gamma-ray  source,  we  detected 30 X-ray
          sources. Of these, we found 17 strong-candidate counterparts in
          optical   (visible  through  near-infrared)  cataloged  and  an
          additional  3  through  our  optical  observations.  Based upon
          colors  and  (for  several objects) optical spectra, nearly all
          the   optically   identified  objects  appear  to  be  reddened
          main-sequence  stars. None of the X-ray sources with an optical
          counterpart  is a plausible X-ray counterpart to 3EG J2020+4017
          --if  that  gamma-ray  source is a spin-powered pulsar. Many of
          the  10  X-ray  sources lacking optical counterparts are likely
          (extragalactic)  active  galactic  nuclei,  based  upon the sky
          density  of  such  sources.  Although  one  of the 10 optically
          unidentified X-ray sources could be the gamma-ray source, there
          is no auxiliary evidence supporting such an identification.

          Title: Radio Spectrum and Distance of the SNR HB9
          Authors: D.A. Leahy, W.W. Tian
          Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, submitted to A&A
          New  images are presented of the supernova remnant HB9 based on
          408  MHz  and  1420 MHz continuum emission and HI-line emission
          data  of  the  Canadian  Galactic  Plane Survey by the Dominion
          Radio  Astrophysical Observatory. Two methods of spectral index
          analysis  for  HB9  are  presented  and  compared:  one removes
          compact  sources  at  both  frequencies  but  is limited to the
          resolution  of  the  408  MHz  image; the other removes compact
          sources  only  in  the 1420 MHz image so is effective at higher
          spatial  resolution.  The  second allows more detailed spectral
          index  variation  studies  than  the  first.  The  two T-T plot
          methods  and  new integrated flux densities give spectral index
          (S$_{\nu}$$\propto$$\nu$$^{-\alpha}$)  for  the whole of HB9 of
          0.484$\pm$0.032;  0.485; and 0.47$\pm$0.06, respectively. These
          are lower than previous spectral index for HB9 ($\alpha$=0.61).
          Spatial  variations  of  spectral  index  are derived using the
          second  method  and  yield  a lower spectral index for interior
          regions  than  for the rim. This can be explained by a standard
          curved  interstellar  electron  energy  spectrum  combined with
          lower  interior  magnetic field compared to that near the outer
          shock,  which  results in a larger proportion of steep spectrum
          emission  for  lines-of-sight  through  the central body of the
          SNR.  HI  observations show structures probably associated with
          the  SNR  in  the  radial  velocity range -22 to -25 km$/$s and
          suggest  a  distance of 1.1 kpc for the SNR. This is consistent
          with  the distance to the radio pulsar 0458+46, offset from the
          center of HB9 by 23$^{\prime}$. However the pulsar spindown and
          kinematic  ages are significantly greater than estimates of the
          SNR  age:  the Sedov age for HB9 is 9500 yr and the evaporative
          cloud model yields ages of 4000-10,000 yr.

          Title:  Extinction  Columns  and Intrinsic X-ray Spectra of the
          Anomalous X-ray Pulsars
          Authors:  Martin  Durant, Marten H. van Kerkwijk (University of
          Toronto)
          Comments: 24 pages, 4 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ
          The X-ray spectra of Anomalous X-ray Pulsars have long been fit
          by  smooth,  empirical  models  such as the sum of a black-body
          plus  a  power  law.  These  reproduce the ~0.5 to 10 keV range
          well,   but   fail   at  lower  and  higher  energies,  grossly
          over-predicting the optical and under-predicting the hard X-ray
          emission.   A  poorly  constrained  source  of  uncertainty  in
          determining the true, intrinsic spectra, in particular at lower
          energies, is the amount of interstellar extinction. In previous
          studies,  extinction  column  densities  with small statistical
          errors  were  derived  as  part  of  the fits of the spectra to
          simple  continuum  models. Different choices of model, however,
          each  produced  statistically acceptable fits, but a wide range
          of  columns.  Here,  we  attempt  to  measure  the interstellar
          extinction   in   a  model-independent  way,  using  individual
          absorption  edges of the elements O, Fe, Ne, Mg and Si in X-ray
          grating  spectra  taken  with  XMM-Newton.  We  find  that  our
          inferred  equivalent  hydrogen column density NH for 4U 0142+61
          is  a  factor of 1.4 lower than the typically quoted value from
          black-body  plus  power-law  fits,  and  is now consistent with
          estimates   based  on  the  dust  scattering  halo  and  visual
          extinction.  For  three other sources, we find column densities
          consistent  with  earlier estimates. We use our measurements to
          recover  the intrinsic spectra of the AXPs empirically, without
          making  assumptions on what the intrinsic spectral shapes ought
          to  be.  We find that the power-law components that dominate at
          higher energies do not extend below the thermal peak.

          application to emission from bare strange stars
          Authors: A.G. Aksenov, M. Milgrom, V.V. Usov

          proceedings of the conference "Isolated Neutron Stars: from the
          Surface to the Interior", London, UK, 24-28 April 2006
          We  present the results of numerical simulations of stationary,
          spherically  outflowing,  electron-positron  pair  winds,  with
          total luminosities in the range 10^{34}- 10^{42} ergs/s. In the
          concrete example described here, the wind injection source is a
          hot,  bare,  strange star, predicted to be a powerful source of
          electron-positron  pairs  created by the Coulomb barrier at the
          quark  surface.  We  find that photons dominate in the emerging
          emission,  and  the emerging photon spectrum is rather hard and
          differs substantially from the thermal spectrum expected from a
          neutron   star  with  the  same  luminosity.  This  might  help
          distinguish the putative bare strange stars from neutron stars.

          We  present results of large-scale numerical simulations of the
          evolution  of  neutrino  and antineutrino flavors in the region
          above   the  late-time  post-supernova-explosion  proto-neutron
          star.  Our  calculations are the first to allow explicit flavor
          evolution  histories  on different neutrino trajectories and to
          self-consistently    couple   flavor   development   on   these
          trajectories   through   forward   scattering-induced   quantum
          entanglement.    Employing   the   atmospheric-scale   neutrino
          mass-squared  difference  and  values  of  theta_13  allowed by
          current   bounds,   we  find  transformation  of  neutrino  and
          antineutrino flavors over broad ranges of energy and luminosity
          in  roughly the ``bi-polar'' collective mode. We find that this
          large-scale  flavor  conversion,  largely  driven by the flavor
          off-diagonal  neutrino-neutrino  forward  scattering potential,
          sets  in  much  closer  to  the  proto-neutron star than simple
          estimates    based    on    flavor-diagonal    potentials   and
          Mikeheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein   evolution  would  indicate.  In
          turn,  this  suggests  that models of r-process nucleosynthesis
          sited   in   the   neutrino-driven   wind   could  be  affected
          substantially  by  active-active  neutrino  flavor mixing, even
          with the small measured neutrino mass-squared differences.

          We  analyse  observations,  spanning 15 years, dedicated to the
          extreme  emission-line  object  Hen3-209.  Our photometric data
          indicate  that  the  luminosity  of  the  star undergoes marked
          variations  with  a  peak-to-peak  amplitude  of 0.65mag. These
          variations  are recurrent, with a period of 16.093+-0.005d. The
          spectrum of Hen3-209 is peculiar with many different lines (HI,
          HeI,  FeII,...) showing P Cygni profiles. The line profiles are
          apparently   changing  in  harmony  with  the  photometry.  The
          spectrum  also  contains  [OIII]  lines  that  display a saddle
          profile  topped  by  three  peaks, with a maximum separation of
          about  600km/s.  Hen3-209  is  most  likely an evolved luminous
          object  suffering from mass ejection events and maybe belonging
          to a binary system.

          Comments:  7  pages, Review Talk, IAU 243, Planetary Nebulae in
          our Galaxy and Beyond
          Hydrodynamical   simulations   played   an  important  role  in
          understanding  the dynamics and shaping of planetary nebulae in
          the past century. However, hydrodynamical simulations were just
          a  first  order  approach.  The new millennium arrived with the
          generalized  understanding  that the effects of magnetic fields
          were  necessary  to  study  the  dynamics of planetary nebulae.
          Thus,  B-fields  introduced  a  whole  new  number  of physical
          possibilities  for  the  modeling.  In  this  paper,  we review
          observational  works done in the last 5 years and several works
          on  magnetohydrodynamics  about  proto-planetary nebulae, since
          all  the  effort  has  been  focused on that stage, and discuss
          different scenarios for the origin of magnetized winds, and the
          relation binary-bipolararity.

          Planets in Close Binaries
          Authors: Eric Pfahl (KITP), Matt Muterspaugh (Caltech/MIT)
          Comments: 4 pages, submitted to ApJL
          Hostile  tidal  forces  may  inhibit  the  formation  of Jovian
          planets  in  binaries  with  semimajor  axes  of  $\la$$50\au$,
          binaries  that might be called ``close'' in this context. As an
          alternative to in situ planet formation, a binary can acquire a
          giant  planet when one of its original members is replaced in a
          dynamical  interaction  with  another star that hosts a planet.
          Simple  scaling  relations  for  the structure and evolution of
          star   clusters,  coupled  with  analytic  arguments  regarding
          binary-single   and  binary-binary  scattering,  indicate  that
          dynamical  processes  can  deposit  Jovian  planets in $<$1% of
          close binaries. If ongoing and future exoplanet surveys measure
          a much larger fraction, it may be that giant planets do somehow
          form frequently in such systems.

          several  orders  of magnitude smaller than that obtained before

          Comments: 17 pages, 2 figures
          Neutrino  emission  caused  by  Cooper  pairing  of  baryons in
          neutron stars is recalculated by accurately taking into account
          for conservation of the vector weak current. The vector current
          contribution  to the neutrino emissivity is found to be several
          orders  of  magnitude  smaller  than  that  obtained  before by
          different authors. Therefore, the neutrino energy losses due to
          singlet-state  pairing  of baryons can in practice be neglected
          in  simulations  of neutron star cooling. This makes negligible
          the neutrino radiation from pairing of protons or hyperons. The
          neutrino  radiation  from  triplet  pairing takes place through
          axial  weak currents. For these states, when the total momentum
          projection  is  $m_{j}=0$,  the  vanishing  of  the vector weak
          current contribution results in the suppression of the neutrino
          energy  losses  by  about  25%.  The neutrino emissivity due to
          triplet  pairing  with  $|  m_{j}| =2$ is suppressed by about a
          factor   of   3,  caused  by  the  collective  contribution  of
          spin-density fluctuations in the condensate.

          Periodic  outbursts  are  observed  in  many  AGNs  and usually
          explained   with  a  supermassive  black  hole  binary  (SMBHB)
          scenario.  However,  multiple periods are observed in some AGNs
          and   cannot   be  explained  with  it.  Here  we  analyze  the
          periodicity  of  the  radio  light  curves  of  AO  0235+164 at
          multi-frequencies  and  report  the  discovery  of  six QPOs in
          integer  ratio  1:2:3:4:5:6  of  QPO  frequencies, of which the
          second  with  period  $P_2  =  (5.46 \pm 0.47) {\rm yr}$ is the
          strongest.  We  fit  the  radio  light curves and show that the
          initial  phases  of  six  QPOs  have  zero or $\pi$ differences
          relative  to  each other. We suggest a harmonic relationship of
          QPOs.  The  centroid  frequency,  relative  strength,  harmonic
          relationship   and   relative   initial   phases  of  QPOs  are
          independent  of  radio  frequency. The harmonic QPOs are likely
          due   to   the  quasi-periodic  injection  of  plasma  from  an
          oscillating  accretion  disk  into  the  jet.  We  estimate the
          supermassive  black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} \simeq (4.72\pm 2.04)
          \times  10^8  M_\odot$  and  the  accretion rate $\dot{m}\simeq
          0.007$.  With  the knowledge of accretion disk, it implies that
          the  inner  region  of  accretion  disk  of  AO  0235+164  is a
          radiatively   inefficient   accretion   flow.  The  oscillation
          accretion  is  due  to the p-mode oscillation of the thick disk
          probably  excited  by  a SMBHB. The theoretical predications of
          fundamental  oscillation  frequency  and the harmonics are well
          consistent with the observations. Harmonic QPOs would be absent
          when  the  thick  disk  becomes  geometrically  thin due to the
          increase  of  accretion rate. We discuss the observations of AO
          0235+164 basing on the SMBHB-thick disk oscillation scenario.

          We  present  an  XMM-Newton observation of the eclipsing binary
          Algol  which  contains  an  X-ray dark B8V primary and an X-ray
          bright  K2IV  secondary.  The  observation  covered the optical
          secondary eclipse and captured an X-ray flare that was eclipsed
          by  the  B  star.  The  EPIC  and  RGS  spectra of Algol in its
          quiescent  state  are  described  by  a  two-temperature plasma
          model.   The   cool   component   has   a   temperature  around
          6.4$\times10^{6}$ K while that of the hot component ranges from
          2  to  4.0$\times10^{7}$  K. Coronal abundances of C, N, O, Ne,
          Mg,  Si  and  Fe  were obtained for each component for both the
          quiescent and the flare phases, with generally upper limits for
          S  and  Ar, and C, N, and O for the hot component. F-tests show
          that  the  abundances need not to be different between the cool
          and  the  hot component and between the quiescent and the flare
          phase with the exception of Fe. Whereas the Fe abundance of the
          cool   component   remains  constant  at  $\sim$0.14,  the  hot
          component  shows an Fe abundance of $\sim$0.28, which increases
          to  $\sim$0.44 during the flare. This increase is expected from
          the  chromospheric  evaporation  model.  The  absorbing  column
          density  $N_H$  of the quiescent emission is 2.5$\times10^{20}$
          cm$^{-2}$,  while that of the flare-only emission is lower than
          1.3$\times10^{20}$    cm$^{-2}$.    Together    with   previous
          observations,  this $N_H$ difference suggests that there exists
          a  belt of cool gas above the corona and the belt runs parallel
          to the equator of the K star.

          to appear in the Proceedings
          The neutrino chirality-flip process under the conditions of the
          supernova  core  is  investigated  in  detail  with  the plasma
          polarization  effects  in  the  photon  propagator  taken  into
          account.  It  is  shown  that  the  contribution  of the proton
          fraction  of  plasma  is  essential.  New  upper  bounds on the
          neutrino  magnetic  moment  are  obtained:  mu_nu < (0.5 - 1.1)
          10^{-12}  mu_B  from the limit on the supernova core luminosity
          for  nu_R  emission, and mu_nu < (0.4 - 0.6) 10^{-12} mu_B from
          the  limit  on the averaged time of the neutrino spin-flip. The
          best  astrophysical upper bound on the neutrino magnetic moment
          is improved by the factor of 3 to 7.

          Title:  Impact  of  Stellar  Dynamics on the Frequency of Giant
          Planets in Close Binaries
          Authors: Eric Pfahl (KITP), Matt Muterspaugh (Caltech/MIT)
          Comments: 4 pages, submitted to ApJL
          Hostile  tidal  forces  may  inhibit  the  formation  of Jovian
          planets  in  binaries  with  semimajor  axes  of  $\la$$50\au$,
          binaries  that might be called ``close'' in this context. As an
          alternative to in situ planet formation, a binary can acquire a
          giant  planet when one of its original members is replaced in a
          dynamical  interaction  with  another star that hosts a planet.
          Simple  scaling  relations  for  the structure and evolution of
          star   clusters,  coupled  with  analytic  arguments  regarding
          binary-single   and  binary-binary  scattering,  indicate  that
          dynamical  processes  can  deposit  Jovian  planets in $<$1% of
          close binaries. If ongoing and future exoplanet surveys measure
          a much larger fraction, it may be that giant planets do somehow
          form frequently in such systems.

          Neutrino  emission  caused by singlet Cooper pairing of baryons
          in  neutron  stars  is  recalculated  by accurately taking into
          account  for  conservation  of  the  vector  weak currents. The
          neutrino emissivity via the vector weak currents is found to be
          several  orders  of magnitude smaller than that obtained before
          by  different  authors.  This  makes  unimportant  the neutrino
          radiation from singlet pairing of protons or hyperons.

          Title: Neutrino emission due to Cooper pairing in neutron stars
          Authors: L.B. Leinson, A. Perez
          Comments: 17 pages, 2 figures
          Neutrino  emission  caused  by  Cooper  pairing  of  baryons in
          neutron stars is recalculated by accurately taking into account
          for conservation of the vector weak current. The vector current
          contribution  to the neutrino emissivity is found to be several
          orders  of  magnitude  smaller  than  that  obtained  before by
          different authors. Therefore, the neutrino energy losses due to
          singlet-state  pairing  of baryons can in practice be neglected
          in  simulations  of neutron star cooling. This makes negligible
          the neutrino radiation from pairing of protons or hyperons. The
          neutrino  radiation  from  triplet  pairing takes place through
          axial  weak currents. For these states, when the total momentum
          projection  is  $m_{j}=0$,  the  vanishing  of  the vector weak
          current contribution results in the suppression of the neutrino
          energy  losses  by  about  25%.  The neutrino emissivity due to
          triplet  pairing  with  $|  m_{j}| =2$ is suppressed by about a
          factor   of   3,  caused  by  the  collective  contribution  of
          spin-density fluctuations in the condensate.

          BL Lac Object AO 0235+164

          Comments:   40   pages,  10  figures,  1  table;  accepted  for
          publication in ApJ
          Periodic  outbursts  are  observed  in  many  AGNs  and usually
          explained   with  a  supermassive  black  hole  binary  (SMBHB)
          scenario.  However,  multiple periods are observed in some AGNs
          and   cannot   be  explained  with  it.  Here  we  analyze  the
          periodicity  of  the  radio  light  curves  of  AO  0235+164 at
          multi-frequencies  and  report  the  discovery  of  six QPOs in
          integer  ratio  1:2:3:4:5:6  of  QPO  frequencies, of which the
          second  with  period  $P_2  =  (5.46 \pm 0.47) {\rm yr}$ is the
          strongest.  We  fit  the  radio  light curves and show that the
          initial  phases  of  six  QPOs  have  zero or $\pi$ differences
          relative  to  each other. We suggest a harmonic relationship of
          QPOs.  The  centroid  frequency,  relative  strength,  harmonic
          relationship   and   relative   initial   phases  of  QPOs  are
          independent  of  radio  frequency. The harmonic QPOs are likely
          due   to   the  quasi-periodic  injection  of  plasma  from  an
          oscillating  accretion  disk  into  the  jet.  We  estimate the
          supermassive  black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} \simeq (4.72\pm 2.04)
          \times  10^8  M_\odot$  and  the  accretion rate $\dot{m}\simeq
          0.007$.  With  the knowledge of accretion disk, it implies that
          the  inner  region  of  accretion  disk  of  AO  0235+164  is a
          radiatively   inefficient   accretion   flow.  The  oscillation
          accretion  is  due  to the p-mode oscillation of the thick disk
          probably  excited  by  a SMBHB. The theoretical predications of
          fundamental  oscillation  frequency  and the harmonics are well
          consistent with the observations. Harmonic QPOs would be absent
          when  the  thick  disk  becomes  geometrically  thin due to the
          increase  of  accretion rate. We discuss the observations of AO
          0235+164 basing on the SMBHB-thick disk oscillation scenario.

          Authors: Alice K. Harding (GSFC), Dong Lai (Cornell)
          Comments:  93  pages.  Reports on Progress in Physics, in press
          (2006)
          There  has  recently been growing evidence for the existence of
          neutron  stars  possessing  magnetic fields with strengths that
          exceed  the  quantum  critical  field  strength  of $4.4 \times
          10^{13}$  G,  at which the cyclotron energy equals the electron
          rest  mass.  Such evidence has been provided by new discoveries
          of  radio  pulsars  having  very  high  spin-down  rates and by
          observations  of  bursting  gamma-ray sources termed magnetars.
          This article will discuss the exotic physics of this high-field
          regime,  where  a  new  array of processes becomes possible and
          even  dominant,  and  where  familiar processes acquire unusual
          properties. We review the physical processes that are important
          in  neutron  star  interiors  and magnetospheres, including the
          behavior  of  free  particles,  atoms,  molecules,  plasma  and
          condensed  matter in strong magnetic fields, photon propagation
          in  magnetized  plasmas, free-particle radiative processes, the
          physics  of  neutron  star  interiors,  and field evolution and
          decay    mechanisms.   Application   of   such   processes   in
          astrophysical   source   models,   including   rotation-powered
          pulsars,  soft gamma-ray repeaters, anomalous X-ray pulsars and
          accreting X-ray pulsars will also be discussed. Throughout this
          review,  we will highlight the observational signatures of high
          magnetic  field  processes,  as  well as the theoretical issues
          that remain to be understood.

          Remnants
          Authors: Zhongxiang Wang, David L. Kaplan, Deepto Chakrabarty
          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  report  on our search for the optical/infrared counterparts
          to   the  central  compact  objects  in  four  young  supernova
          remnants: Puppis A, PKS 1209-52, RCW 103, and Cassiopeia A. The
          X-ray point sources in these supernova remnants, likely members
          of  a  new  class  (or  classes)  of  young  neutron stars, are
          attractive  targets  for  probing  the  existence  of supernova
          ``fallback''  disks. Such disks, which are a general prediction
          of  many  supernova models, can form from supernova ejecta that
          fails  to  reach  escape velocity during the initial explosion.
          Irradiation  of  the disk by a central X-ray source may lead to
          detectable  optical/infrared emission from such a disk. We used
          imaging   observations  from  ground-based  telescopes  in  the
          optical  and  near-infrared  regimes and from the Spitzer Space
          Telescope at 4.5 and 8.0 micron, to search for optical/infrared
          counterparts  at  the  X-ray point source positions measured in
          these  supernova  remnants by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. We
          did not detect any counterparts, and hence find no evidence for
          fallback disks around any of these sources. In RCW 103, a blend
          of  3  faint stars at the X-ray source position prevent us from
          deriving useful limits. For the other targets, the upper limits
          on the infrared/X-ray flux ratios are as deep as (1.0--1.7)e-4.
          Comparing  these  limits  to  the ratio of 6e-5 measured for 4U
          0142+61 (a young pulsar recently found with an X-ray irradiated
          dust  disk),  we  conclude  that the non-detection of any disks
          around the young neutron stars studied here are consistent with
          their  relatively low X-ray luminosities, although we note that
          a  similar dust disk around the neutron star in Puppis A should
          be detectable by deeper infrared observations.

          Short-period binaries represent extreme cases in the generation
          of  stellar  coronae  via  a  rotational dynamo. Such stars are
          important  for  probing the origin and nature of coronae in the
          regimes  of  rapid  rotation  and  activity  saturation. VW Cep
          (P=0.28  d)  is  a  relatively bright, partially eclipsing, and
          very  active  object. Light curves made from Chandra/HETGS data
          show  flaring  and  rotational  modulation,  but  no  eclipses.
          Velocity  modulation  of  emission  lines  indicates  that  one
          component dominates the X-ray emission. The emission measure is
          highly  structured,  having  three  peaks.  Helium-like triplet
          lines  give  electron  densities  of  about  3.0E+10 - 18.0E+10
          /cm^3.  We  conclude  that  the  corona is predominantly on the
          polar regions of the primary star and compact.

          Title:  FUSE observations of HD 5980: The wind structure of the
          eruptor
          Authors:  Gloria  Koenigsberger,  Alexander W. Fullerton, Derck

          Comments: 19 pages, 13 figures
          HD 5980 is a unique system containing one massive star (star A)
          that  is  apparently entering the luminous blue variable phase,
          and  an  eclipsing  companion  (star  B)  that may have already
          evolved  beyond this phase to become a Wolf-Rayet star. In this
          paper we present the results from FUSE observations obtained in
          1999,  2000,  and  2002  and one far-UV observation obtained by
          ORFEUS/BEFS  in  1993  shortly  before the first eruption of HD
          5980. The eight phase-resolved spectra obtained by FUSE in 2002
          are  analyzed  in  the  context  of  a wind-eclipse model. This
          analysis  shows that the wind of the eruptor obeyed a very fast
          velocity law in 2002, which is consistent with the line-driving
          mechanism.  Large  amplitude  line-profile  variations  on  the
          orbital  period are shown to be due to the eclipse of star B by
          the  wind of star A, although the eclipse due to gas flowing in
          the  direction  of star B is absent. This can only be explained

          eclipsed  line radiation is "filled-in" by emission originating
          from  somewhere  else  in  the  system,  e.g., in the wind-wind

          circumbinary  environment  caused by the transition from "fast,
          rarefied  wind"  to  "slow,  dense  wind"  was  observed as the

          A hypothetical time-variation of the gravitational constant $G$
          would   cause   neutron   star   matter  to  depart  from  beta
          equilibrium,  due to the changing hydrostatic equilibrium. This
          forces  non-equilibrium  beta processes to occur, which release
          energy  that is invested partly in neutrino emission and partly
          in  heating  the stellar interior. Eventually, the star arrives
          at  a  stationary state in which the temperature remains nearly
          constant,  as the forcing through the change of $G$ is balanced
          by  the ongoing reactions. Comparing the surface temperature of
          the  nearest  millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715, inferred from
          ultraviolet   observations,   with   our  predicted  stationary
          temperature,  we  estimate two upper limits for this variation:
          (1)  $|\dot  G/G|  <  2 \times 10^{-10}$ yr$^{-1}$, if we allow
          direct  Urca  reactions operating in the neutron star core, and
          (2)  $|\dot  G/G|  <  4 \times 10^{-12}$ yr$^{-1}$, considering
          only modified Urca reactions. Both results are competitive with
          those  obtained by other methods, with (2) being among the most
          restrictive.

          Title:  The  Einstein  Ring  0047-2808  Revisited:  A  Bayesian
          Inversion
          Authors: Brendon J. Brewer, Geraint F. Lewis
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          In  a  previous  paper,  we  outlined a new Bayesian method for
          inferring  the  properties  of  extended  gravitational lenses,
          given  data  in  the form of resolved images. This method holds
          the  most promise for optimally extracting information from the
          observed  image, whilst providing reliable uncertainties in all
          parameters.  Here,  we  apply  the  method  to the well studied
          optical  Einstein  ring  0047-2808.  Our  results  are in broad
          agreement  with  previous  studies,  showing  that  the density
          profile  of  the lensing galaxy is aligned within a few degrees
          of the light profile, and suggesting that the source galaxy (at
          redshift  3.6) is a binary system, although its size is only of
          order  1-2  kpc.  We  also find that the mass of the elliptical
          lensing galaxy enclosed by the image is
          (2.91$\pm$0.01)$\times10^{11}$  M$_{\sun}$.  Our method is able
          to  achieve improved resolution for the source reconstructions,
          although  we  also  find  that  some  of  the uncertainties are
          greater  than  has  been found in previous analyses, due to the
          inclusion of extra pixels and a more general lens model.

          Title: Masses and angular momenta of contact binary stars
          Authors: K. D. Gazeas, P. G. Niarchos
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, accepted in MNRAS
          Results  are  presented  on component masses and system angular
          momenta for over a hundred low-temperature contact binaries. It
          is  found that the secondary components in close binary systems
          are  very  similar in mass. Our observational evidence strongly
          supports  the  argument that the evolutionary process goes from
          near-contact  binaries  to A-type contact binaries, without any
          need   of   mass   loss   from  the  system.  Furthermore,  the
          evolutionary  direction  of  A-type  into W-type systems with a
          simultaneous  mass and angular momentum loss is also discussed.
          The opposite direction of evolution seems to be unlikely, since
          it  requires  an  increase  of  the  total mass and the angular
          momentum of the system.

          Physical  and  wind  properties  of  Galactic B supergiants are
          presented  based upon non-LTE line blanketed model atmospheres,
          including  Sher  25  toward  the  NGC  3603 cluster. We compare
          Halpha  derived  wind  densities  with recent results for SMC B
          supergiants  and generally confirm theoretical expectations for
          stronger  winds  amongst Galactic supergiants. Mid B supergiant
          winds  are  substantially  weaker than predictions from current
          radiatively  driven wind theory, a problem which is exacerbated
          if winds are already clumped in the Halpha line forming region.
          We  find  that  the  so-called `bistability jump' at B1 (Teff ~
          21kK)  from  Lamers  et  al.  is rather a more gradual downward
          trend.  CNO  elemental  abundances,  including  Sher 25, reveal
          partially  processed  material  at  their surfaces. In general,
          these  are  in good agreement with evolutionary predictions for
          blue  supergiants  evolving  redward  accounting for rotational
          mixing.  A few cases, including HD 152236 (zeta^1 Sco), exhibit
          strongly  processed  material which is more typical of Luminous
          Blue  Variables.  Our  derived  photospheric  [N/O]  ratio  for
          Sher~25  agrees  with  that  for  its ejecta nebula, although a
          higher degree of CNO processing would be expected if the nebula
          originated  during  a red supergiant phase, as is suspected for
          the  ring  nebula  ejected by the B supergiant progenitor of SN
          1987A,  Sk-69  202.  Sher  25  has  an inferred age of ~5Myr in
          contrast  with  ~2Myr for HD 97950, the ionizing cluster of NGC
          3603.  Sher  25  may  be  a  foreground  object or close binary
          evolution  could be responsible for its unusual location in the
          H-R diagram.

          HD 5980 is a unique system containing one massive star (star A)
          that  is  apparently entering the luminous blue variable phase,
          and  an  eclipsing  companion  (star  B)  that may have already
          evolved  beyond this phase to become a Wolf-Rayet star. In this
          paper we present the results from FUSE observations obtained in
          1999,  2000,  and  2002  and one far-UV observation obtained by
          ORFEUS/BEFS  in  1993  shortly  before the first eruption of HD
          5980. The eight phase-resolved spectra obtained by FUSE in 2002
          are  analyzed  in  the  context  of  a wind-eclipse model. This
          analysis  shows that the wind of the eruptor obeyed a very fast
          velocity law in 2002, which is consistent with the line-driving
          mechanism.  Large  amplitude  line-profile  variations  on  the
          orbital  period are shown to be due to the eclipse of star B by
          the  wind of star A, although the eclipse due to gas flowing in
          the  direction  of star B is absent. This can only be explained
          if  the  wind of star A is not spherically symmetric, or if the
          eclipsed  line radiation is "filled-in" by emission originating
          from  somewhere  else  in  the  system,  e.g., in the wind-wind
          collision  region.  Except for a slightly lower wind speed, the

          Isolated  Neutron  Stars:  From  the  Interior  to The Surface,
          London, UK, 24-28 April, 2006
          We  investigate  the  effect  of  exotic  matter in particular,
          hyperon  matter  on neutron star properties such as equation of
          state  (EoS), mass-radius relationship and bulk viscosity. Here
          we  construct  equations  of  state  within  the framework of a
          relativistic  field  theoretical  model.  As  large  number  of
          hyperons  may  be  produced  in  dense  matter, hyperon-hyperon
          interaction   is   important   and   included  in  this  model.
          Hyperon-hyperon interaction makes the EoS softer resulting in a
          smaller  maximum  mass  neutron  star  compared  with  the case
          without  the  interaction.  Next  we compute the coefficient of
          bulk  viscosity and the corresponding damping time scale due to
          the  non-leptonic  weak  process  including $\Lambda$ hyperons.
          Further,  we  investigate  the  role  of  the bulk viscosity on
          gravitational radiation driven r-mode instability for a neutron
          star   of   given  mass  and  temperature  and  find  that  the
          instability is effectively suppressed.

          We  report  on detailed spectroscopic studies performed for the
          secondary  star  in  the black hole binary (micro-quasar) V4641
          Sgr in order to examine its surface chemical composition and to
          see  if  its surface shows any signature of pollution by ejecta
          from  a  supernova  explosion. High-resolution spectra of V4641
          Sgr  observed  in the quiescent state in the blue-visual region
          are compared with those of the two bright well-studied B9 stars
          (14  Cyg  and $\nu$ Cap) observed with the same instrument. The
          effective  temperature  of  V4641  Sgr  (10500  $\pm$ 200 K) is
          estimated  from  the  strengths  of He~{\sc i} lines, while its
          rotational  velocity,  $\it  v$  sin  $\it  i$  (95 $\pm$ 10 km
          s${}^{-1}$),  is  estimated from the profile of the Mg~{\sc ii}
          line  at 4481 \AA. We obtain abundances of 10 elements and find
          definite  over-abundances  of N (by 0.8 dex or more) and Na (by
          0.8  dex)  in V4641 Sgr. From line-by-line comparisons of eight
          other elements (C, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ti, Cr, and Fe) between V4641
          Sgr  and  the two reference stars, we conclude that there is no
          apparent difference in the abundances of these elements between
          V4641 Sgr and the two normal late B-type stars, which have been
          reported  to  have solar abundances. An evolutionary model of a
          massive close binary system has been constructed to explain the
          abundances  observed  in V4641 Sgr. The model suggests that the
          progenitor  of  the black hole forming supernova was as massive
          as  ~  35  Msun on the main-sequence and, after becoming a ~ 10
          Msun  He  star, underwent "dark" explosion which ejected only N
          and  Na-rich  outer  layer  of  the He star without radioactive
          $^{56}$Ni.

          Comments:   22  pages,  7  tables,  24  figures,  accepted  for
          publication in The Astrophysical Journal
          We  present  results  from  quantitative  modeling and spectral
          analysis  of  the high mass X-ray binary Vela X-1 obtained with
          the  Chandra  HETGS.  The  spectra  exhibit emission lines from
          H-like  and  He-like ions driven by photoionization, as well as
          fluorescent  emission  lines  from  several  elements  in lower
          charge  states.  In order to interpret and make full use of the
          high-quality   data,  we  have  developed  a  simulator,  which
          calculates  the  ionization  and thermal structure of a stellar
          wind  photoionized by an X-ray source, and performs Monte Carlo
          simulations  of X-ray photons propagating through the wind. The
          emergent spectra are then computed as a function of the viewing
          angle  accurately  accounting  for  photon  transport  in three
          dimensions including dynamics. From comparisons of the observed
          spectra  with  the  simulation results, we are able to find the
          ionization   structure  and  the  geometrical  distribution  of
          material  in  Vela X-1 that can reproduce the observed spectral
          line  intensities  and  continuum  shapes  at different orbital
          phases  remarkably  well.  It is found that a large fraction of
          X-ray emission lines from highly ionized ions are formed in the
          region between the neutron star and the companion star. We also
          find  that  the  fluorescent X-ray lines must be produced in at
          least  three  distinct  regions --(1)the extended stellar wind,
          (2)reflection   off   the  stellar  photosphere,  and  (3)in  a
          distribution  of dense material partially covering and possibly
          trailing  the  neutron  star,  which  may be associated with an
          accretion wake. Finally, from detailed analysis of the emission
          lines,  we  demonstrate  that  the  stellar wind is affected by
          X-ray photoionization.

          Title:  The  induced  turbulence effect on propagation of radio
          emission in pulsar magnetospheres
          Authors: Qinghuan Luo, D. B. Melrose
          Comments:  11  pages,  3  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          The  effect of photon-beam-induced turbulence on propagation of
          radio  emission  in a pulsar magnetosphere is discussed. Beamed
          radio  emission with a high brightness temperature can generate
          low-frequency  plasma  waves  in  the  pulsar magnetosphere and
          these  waves scatter the radio beam. We consider this effect on
          propagation  of  radio  emission  both  in  the open field line
          region  and  in  the  closed  field  line region. The former is
          applicable  to  most  cases  of pulsar radio emission where the
          propagation  is  confined to the polar region; it is shown that
          the  induced  process  is  not  effective for radio emission of
          moderately  high  brightness  temperature but can have a severe
          effect  on giant pulses. For giant pulses not to be affected by
          this  process,  they  must  be  emitted very close to the light
          cylinder.  We show that the induced process is efficient in the
          closed  field  line region, inhibiting propagation of the radio
          emission in this region.

          superconductivity phase
          Authors: X.P. Zheng, X. Zhou, Y.W. Yu
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, to be publication in MNRAS
          Under  the combination effect of the recommencement heating due
          to spin-down of strange stars and the heat perseveration due to
          weak  conduct  heat  of the crust, the Cooper pair breaking and
          formation(PBF) in color superconduction quark matter arises. We
          investigated  the  cooling of the strange stars with a crust in
          color  superconductivity  phase  including  both  decomfinement
          heating and PBF process. We find that deconfinement heating can
          delay  the  thermal  evolution  of  strange  stars  and the PBF
          process suppresses the early temperature rise of the stars. The
          cooling  strange  stars behave within the brightness constraint
          of  young  compact objects when the color superconductivity gap
          is small enough.

          Title:  New  symmetries  in  microphysics,  new stable forms of
          matter around us
          Authors: Maxim Yu. Khlopov
          Comments:  15  pages, Invited contribution to the special issue
          of honorary series of "Annals of Louis de Broglie Foundations",
          dedicated to E.Majorana
          Extension  of  particle  symmetry implies new conserved charges
          and  the lightest particles, possessing such charges, should be
          stable. Created in early Universe, stable charged heavy leptons
          and  quarks  can  exist  and,  hidden in elusive atoms bound by
          Coulomb  attraction,  can  play  the  role  of dark matter. The
          problem  of  this scenario is that in the expanding Universe it
          is  not  possible  to  recombine all the charged particles into
          elusive "atoms", and positively charged particles, which escape
          such  recombination,  bind with electrons in atoms of anomalous
          isotopes   with   pregalactic  abundance,  generally  exceeding
          terrestrial upper limits. Realistic scenarios of composite dark
          matter,    avoiding   this   problem   of   anomalous   isotope
          over-production, inevitably predict the existence of primordial
          "atoms",   in  which  primordial  helium  traps  all  the  free
          negatively  charged heavy constituents with charge -2. Study of
          the  possibility  for such primordial heavy alpha-particle with
          compensated  charge  to  exist  as  well  as the search for the
          stable  charged  constituents  in  cosmic rays and accelerators
          provide crucial test for the new forms of stable matter.

          and  is  accepted  by Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
          Society
          We  calculate  the coefficient of bulk viscosity by considering
          the non-leptonic weak interactions in the cores of hybrid stars
          with   both   hyperons  and  quarks.  We  first  determine  the
          dependence  of  the production rate of neutrons on the reaction
          rate   of   quarks  in  the  non-leptonic  processes,  that  is
          $\Gamma_{n}=K_{s}\Gamma_{s}+\Gamma_{\Lambda}+2\Gamma_{\Sigma^{-
          }}$.  The  conversion  rate,  $K_{s}$  in  our  scenario  is  a
          complicated function of baryon number density. We also consider
          medium  effect  of  quark matter on bulk viscosity. Using these
          results, we estimate the limiting rotation of the hybrid stars,
          which  may  suppress  the  r-mode instability more effectively.
          Hybrid  stars  should be the candidates for the extremely rapid
          rotators .

          Evidence  of  secular  dynamical  evolution for detached active
          binary  orbits  are  presented. First order decreasing rates of
          orbital angular momentum (OAM), systemic mass ($M=M_{1}+M_{2}$)
          and  orbital  period  of  detached  active  binaries  have been
          determined as $\dot J/J = 3.48 \times 10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$, $\dot
          M/M = 1.30 \times 10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$ and $\dot P/P = 3.96\times
          10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$  from  the  kinematical  ages  of  62  field
          detached  systems.  The  ratio  of  $d \log J/ d \log M = 2.68$
          implies  that either there are mechanisms which amplify AM loss
          $\delta=2.68$  times  with  respect  to  isotropic  AM  loss of
          hypothetical  isotropic  winds  or  there exist external causes
          contributing  AM  loss  in  order  to produce this mean rate of
          decrease  for  orbital periods. Various decreasing rates of OAM
          ($d  \log J / dt$) and systemic mass ($d \log M/ dt$) determine
          various  speeds  of  dynamical  evolutions  towards  a  contact
          configuration.  According  to  average dynamical evolution with
          $\delta  =  2.68$,  the  fraction  of 10, 22 and 39 per cent of
          current detached sample is expected to be contact system within
          2, 4 and 6 Gyr respectively.

          parts. In press, Astrophysical Journal, Suppl
          We  present a 1.4-GHz catalog of 810 radio sources (560 sources
          in the complete sample) with 1.8" resolution found within a 17'
          radius  in  the  SSA13  field (RA=13h12m,DEC=42d38'). The radio
          image  from the VLA has an rms noise level of 4.82 microJy/beam
          at  the  field  center,  and  Subaru  optical  images in r-band
          (6300A)   and  z-band  (9200A)  have  a  three-sigma  detection
          magnitude  of  26.1  and  24.9,  respectively. 88% of the radio
          sources  are  identified with an optical counterpart, and there
          is  significantly  more  reddening  for  objects  fainter  than
          24-mag.  The  radio  and  optical parameters are tabulated, and
          source  morphologies are displayed by radio contours overlaying
          optical  false-color images. The radio structures show a wealth
          of  complexity  and these are classified into a small number of
          categories.  About  one-third  of  the radio sources are larger
          than 1.2" and their orientation is often similar to that of the
          associated  galaxy  or  binary-galaxy  system.  The  density of
          sources  in the SSA13 field above 75 microJy is 0.40 per square
          arcmin,  with  a slope of -2.43 in the differential counts. The
          radio  spectral index may steepen for sources below 75 microJy.
          We  estimate  that at most 40% of the microJansky radio sources
          are dominated by AGN processes.

          Title:  CXOU  J121538.2+361921 in the galaxy NGC 4214: a double
          neutron star in the making?
          Authors: J. Dewi
          Comments: MNRAS Lett., accepted
          CXOU  J121538.2+361921  is  the  brightest  X-ray source in the
          galaxy  NGC 4214, with an X-ray luminosity of up to 0.7 x 10^39
          erg/s.  The  observed  periodicity of 3.62 hr is interpreted as
          the  orbital  period  of the system. It has been suggested that
          the  system is a low-mass helium star with a lower-mass compact
          companion.  If this idea is correct, then CXOU J121538.2+361921
          will  evolve into a double neutron star, a binary consisting of
          a  radio  pulsar  and  another  neutron  star. In this study we
          investigate  further  this  possibility. We find that the X-ray
          luminosity  is  consistent  with super-Eddington accretion in a
          helium  star-neutron  star  binary. The binary is in a state of
          mass  transfer  phase  which  is initiated when the helium-star
          donor is on the helium shell burning stage. A donor star with a
          current  mass in the range of around 2.2 - 3.6 Msun is required
          to  explain  the  observed orbital period. Helium stars in this
          mass  range  are  massive  enough  to  collapse  in a supernova
          explosion,   making   CXOU   J121538.2+361921   the   immediate
          progenitor of a double neutron star.

          Title:   Exploring   the  Central  Compact  Object  in  the  RX
          J0852.0-4622 Supernova Remnant with XMM-Newton
          Authors: W.Becker, C.Y.Hui, B.Aschenbach, A.Iyudin
          Comments: submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics
          The  properties  of  the  presumably  young  galactic supernova
          remnant  (SNR)  RX J0852.0-4622, discovered by ROSAT, are still
          uncertain.  The  data  concerning  the distance to the SNR, its
          age,   and   the   presence   of   a   compact  remnant  remain
          controversial.  We  report  the  results  of several XMM-Newton
          observations  of  CXOU  J085201.4-461753,  the  central compact
          source    in    RX   J0852.0-4622.   The   currently   prefered
          interpretation of CXOU J085201.4-461753 being a neutron star is
          in  line  with  our  analysis.  The Chandra candidate pulsation
          periods are not confirmed; actually no period was found down to
          a  3-sigma upper limit for any pulsed fraction. The spectrum of
          CXOU  J085201.4-461753  is  best  described  by  either  a  two
          blackbody  spectrum  or a single blackbody spectrum with a high
          energy  power  law tail. The two blackbody temperatures of 4 MK
          and  6.6  MK  along with the small size of the emitting regions
          with  radii  of  0.36 and 0.06 km invalidate the interpretation
          that  the thermal radiation is cooling emission from the entire
          neutron  star  surface.  The  double  blackbody  model suggests
          emission  from  the  neutron star's hot polar regions. No X-ray
          lines,  including the emission feature previously claimed to be
          present in Chandra data, were found.

          Title:   Mid-Infrared   Emission  from  Dust  around  Quiescent
          Low-Mass X-ray Binaries
          Authors: M. P. Muno, J. Mauerhan
          Comments:  5  pages,  including  two  figures,  one  in  color.
          re-submitted to ApJL after addressing referee's comments
          We  report  the  discovery  of excess 4.5 and 8 micron emission
          from  three  quiescent  black  hole  low-mass X-ray binaries, A
          0620-00,  GS  2023+338,  and  XTE  J1118+480.  The mid-infrared
          emission  from GS 2023+338 probably originates in the accretion
          disk.  However,  the  excess  emission  from  A 0620-00 and XTE
          J1118+480  is  brighter and peaks at longer wavelengths, and so
          probably  originates  from  circumbinary dust that is heated by
          the light of the secondary star. We find that the inner edge of
          the   dust   distribution   lies  near  1.7  times  the  binary
          separation, which is the minimum radius at which a circumbinary
          disk  would  be  stable  against  tidal  disruption. The excess
          infrared  emission  is not detected at 24 micron, which implies
          that  the  dust does not extend beyond about 3 times the binary
          separation.  The  total  masses  of  circumbinary  material are
          between 10^22 and 10^24 g. The material could be the remains of
          fall-back  disks  produced  in supernovae, or material from the
          companions   injected  into  circumbinary  orbits  during  mass
          transfer.

          Title:  New  critical  behavior in unconventional ferromagnetic
          superconductors
          Authors: Dimo I. Uzunov
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          Subj-class:  Superconductivity;  Strongly Correlated Electrons;
          Statistical Mechanics; Chemical Physics
          A  new  critical behavior in unconventional superconductors and
          superfluids  is  established and described by the Wilson-Fisher
          renormalization-group method. For certain symmetries of order a
          new type of fluctuation-driven first order phase transitions at
          finite  and  zero temperature are predicted. The results can be
          applied  to  a  wide class of ferromagnetic superconductive and
          superfluid systems, in particular, to itinerant ferromagnets as
          UGe_2 and URhGe.

          Title:    High    Energy   Neutrinos   and   Cosmic-Rays   from
          Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts?

          The  recently discovered gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060218/SN 2006aj
          is  classified as an X-ray Flash with very long duration driven
          possibly  by  a neutron star. Since GRB 060218 is very near 140
          Mpc  and  very dim, one-year observation by Swift suggests that
          the  true  rate of GRB 060218-like events might be very high so
          that  such low luminosity GRBs (LL-GRBs) might form a different
          population  of  GRBs from the cosmological high luminosity GRBs
          (HL-GRBs).  We  found  that the high energy neutrino background
          from  such LL-GRBs could be comparable with or larger than that
          from  HL-GRBs.  If  each neutrino event is detected by IceCube,
          later optical-infrared follow-up observations such as by Subaru
          could  identify  a  Type Ibc supernova associated with LL-GRBs,
          even if gamma- and X-rays are not observed by Swift. This is in
          a  sense  a  new  window  from  neutrino astronomy, which might
          enable  us  to  confirm  the existence of LL-GRBs and to obtain
          information  about their rate and origin. We also argue LL-GRBs
          as high energy gamma-ray and cosmic-ray sources.

          We  investigate  the damping of neutron star r-modes due to the
          presence  of  a viscous boundary (Ekman) layer at the interface
          between  the  crust and the core. Our study is motivated by the
          possibility  that  the gravitational-wave driven instability of
          the  inertial  r-modes  may  become  active in rapidly spinning
          neutron  stars,  eg.  in  low-mass X-ray binaries, and the fact
          that a viscous Ekman layer at the core-crust interface provides
          an  efficient  damping  mechanism  for  these  oscillations. We
          review  various  approaches  to  the  problem  and carry out an
          analytic  calculation of the effects due to the Ekman layer for
          a   rigid   crust.  Our  analytic  estimates  support  previous
          numerical   results,  and  provide  further  insight  into  the
          intricacies  of  the  problem.  We  add  to  previous  work  by
          discussing  the  effect  that  compressibility  and composition
          stratification  have  on  the  boundary  layer damping. We show
          that,  while  stratification  is  unimportant  for  the  r-mode
          problem,  composition  suppresses  the  damping rate by about a
          factor of two (depending on the detailed equation of state).

          Title:  The  superflares  of  soft  Gamma-ray  repeatres: giant
          quakes in solid quark stars?
          Authors: R. X. Xu (PKU), D. J. Tao (PKU), Y. Yang (PKU)
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          Three   times  of  supergiant  flares  from  soft  $\gamma$-ray
          repeatres  are  observed, with typical released energy of $\sim
          10^{44-47}$  erg.  A  conventional  model  (i.e.,  the magnetar
          model)   for  such  events  is  catastrophic  magnetism-powered
          instability  through  magnetohydrodynamic  process,  in which a
          significant  part  of short-hard $\gamma$-ray bursts could also
          be  the  results  of  magnetars. Based on various observational
          features  (e.g.,  precession,  glitch, thermal photon emission)
          and  the  underlying  theory  of  strong  interaction  (quantum
          chromodynamics,  QCD),  it  could  not  be  ruled  out yet that
          pulsar-like  stars  might be actually solid quark stars. Strain
          energy  develops  during  a  solid  star's life, and starquakes
          could  occur when stellar stresses reach a critical value, with
          huge  energy  released.  An  alternative  model  for supergiant
          flares  of  soft  $\gamma$-ray repeatres is presented, in which
          energy  release  during  a  star  quake of solid quark stars is
          calculated.  Numerical results for spherically asymmetric solid
          stars  show  that  the  released  gravitational energy during a
          giant quake could be as high as $10^{48}$ erg if the tangential
          pressure is slightly higher than the radial one.

          (to appear in the proceedings)
          We  review  the  main  proposals  of  particle  physics for the
          composition  of  the  cold  dark matter in the universe. Strong
          axion  contribution  to  cold dark matter is not favored if the
          Peccei-Quinn  field  emerges  with non-zero value at the end of
          inflation and the inflationary scale is superheavy since, under
          these   circumstances,   it   leads   to   unacceptably   large
          isocurvature perturbations. The lightest neutralino is the most
          popular  candidate  constituent  of cold dark matter. Its relic
          abundance  in  the  constrained minimal supersymmetric standard
          model  can be reduced to acceptable values by pole annihilation
          of  neutralinos  or  neutralino-stau coannihilation. Axinos can
          also  contribute  to  cold dark matter provided that the reheat
          temperature  is  adequately  low. Gravitinos can constitute the
          cold  dark  matter  only  in  limited  regions of the parameter
          space.  We present a supersymmetric grand unified model leading
          to  violation  of  Yukawa  unification  and,  thus, allowing an
          acceptable   b-quark   mass   within  the  constrained  minimal
          supersymmetric  standard model with mu>0. The model possesses a
          wide  range  of parameters consistent with the data on the cold
          dark   matter  abundance  as  well  as  other  phenomenological
          constraints.  Also, it leads to a new version of shifted hybrid
          inflation.

          Spectral  state  transitions  in neutron star LMXB systems have
          been widely observed yet not well understood. Here we report an
          abrupt  spectral  change in 4U 1608-52, a typical atoll source,
          during  its  decay  phase  of  the 2004 outburst. The source is
          found  to  undergo  sudden changes in its spectral hardness and
          other  properties.  The transition occurred when its luminosity
          is  between  (3.3-5.3)  E36  ergs/s, assuming a distance of 3.6
          kpc.  Interpreting this event in terms of the propeller effect,
          we  infer  the neutron star surface magnetic field as (1.4-1.8)
          E8  Gauss. We also briefly discuss similarities and differences
          between  the  spectral  states  of  neutron star and black hole
          binary systems.

          Mitigation" workhop, Colorado, June 2006
          The  number  of binary asteroids in the near-Earth region might
          be  significantly higher than expected. While Bottke and Melosh
          (1996)  suggested  that  about 15% of the NEAs are binaries, as
          indicated  from the frequency of double craters, and Pravec and
          Harris (2000) suggested that half of the fast-rotating NEAs are
          binaries,  our  recent study of Aten NEA lightcurves shows that
          the  fraction  of binary NEAs might be even higher than 50%. We
          found  two  asteroids  with asynchronous binary characteristics
          such  as  two additive periods and fast rotation of the primary
          fragment.  We  also identified three asteroids with synchronous
          binary  characteristics  such  as  amplitude  higher  than  one
          magnitude,  U-shaped  lightcurve maxima and V-shaped lightcurve
          minima.  These  five  binaries were detected out of a sample of
          eight  asteroids  observed,  implying a 63% binarity frequency.
          Confirmation  of this high binary population requires the study
          of  a  larger  representative  sample.  However, any mitigation
          program  that  requires the deflection or demise of a potential
          impactor will have to factor in the possibility that the target
          is a binary or multiple asteroid system.

          Title:  Mass  Determination  and  Detection  of  the  Onset  of

          Comments: 49 pages, 12 figures Accepted to ApJ (Main journal)
          EF  Eri  is  a magnetic cataclysmic variable that has been in a
          low  accretion state for the past nine years. Low state optical
          spectra   reveal   the   underlying  Zeeman-split  white  dwarf
          absorption  lines. These features are used to determine a value
          of  13-14  MG  as the white dwarf field strength. Recently, 5-7
          years  into the low state, Balmer and other emission lines have
          appeared  in the optical. An analysis of the H$\alpha$ emission
          line  yields  the  first  radial  velocity solution for EF Eri,
          leading  to a spectroscopic ephemeris for the binary and, using
          the  best  available  white dwarf mass of 0.6M${\odot}$, a mass
          estimate  for  the  secondary  of  0.055M${\odot}$. For a white
          dwarf  mass  of  0.95M${\odot}$, the average for magnetic white
          dwarfs,  the secondary mass increases to 0.087M${\odot}$. At EF
          Eri's  orbital period of 81 minutes, this higher mass secondary
          could not be a normal star and still fit within the Roche lobe.
          The  source of the Balmer and other emission lines is confirmed
          to  be  from  the sub-stellar secondary and we argue that it is
          due  to  stellar  activity.  We  compare EF Eri's emission line
          spectrum  and activity behavior to that recently observed in AM
          Her  and  VV Pup and attributed to stellar activity. We explore
          observations  and models originally developed for V471 Tau, for
          the  RS  CVn binaries, and for extra-solar planets. We conclude
          that irradiation of the secondary in EF Eri and similar systems
          is  unlikely  and,  in  polars,  the magnetic field interaction
          between  the  two  stars (with a possible tidal component) is a
          probable   mechanism   which  would  concentrate  chromospheric
          activity  on  the  secondary  near the sub-stellar point of the
          white dwarf.

          We present first results of a campaign to find and identify new
          compact  objects  in  the Galactic Center. Selecting candidates
          from  a combination of Chandra and 2MASS survey data, we search
          for  accretion  disk  signatures  via infrared spectroscopy. We
          have  found  the infrared counterpart to the Chandra source CXO
          J174536.1-285638, the spectrum of which has strong Br-gamma and
          HeI  emission.  The presence of CIII, NIII, and HeII indicate a
          binary  system.  We  suspect  that  the  system is some form of
          high-mass  binary  system, either a high-mass X-ray binary or a
          colliding wind binary.

          We present near-infrared $JHK_s$ photometry and light curves of
          the  candidate  magnetic  white  dwarf+brown  dwarf binary SDSS
          J121209.31+013627.7    and   report   on   the   detection   of
          near-infrared  excess  and  variability  in the $K_s-$band. The
          observed  near-infrared excess can be explained by the presence
          of  an L7 brown dwarf and an extra emission source. The $J$ and
          $H$  light  curves appear flat, which rules out eclipses deeper
          than  0.2  mag and the presence of an accretion hot spot on the
          white  dwarf.  From  the  variable  $K_s$  lightcurve, we get a
          refined period for the system of 88$\pm$1 minutes. We show that
          the  observed  variability  in  $K_s-$band  can be explained by
          cyclotron emission, which can be modeled by a small spot on the
          surface  of the white dwarf. SDSS 1212 exhibits similarities to
          the  ultra-short  period  polar EF Eridani, however the lack of
          evidence for Roche-lobe overflow accretion suggests it may be a
          pre-polar.

          Comments: In press in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
          Society
          The  classical  nova V4743 Sgr was observed with XMM-Newton for
          about  10  hours  on  April  4  2003,  6.5 months after optical
          maximum.  At  this  time,  this  nova  had become the brightest
          supersoft X-ray source ever observed. We present the results of
          a  time  series  analysis  performed  on  the X-ray light curve
          obtained  in  this  observation,  and  in  a  previous  shorter
          observation   done   with  Chandra  16  days  earlier.  Intense
          variability,  with amplitude as large as 40% of the total flux,
          was  observed both times. Similarities can be found between the
          two  observations  in  the structure of the variations. Most of
          the  variability  is  well  represented  as  a  combination  of
          oscillations  at  a  set of discrete frequencies lower than 1.7
          mHz.  At  least  five  frequencies are constant over the 16 day
          time  interval  between the two observations. We suggest that a
          periods  in  the  power  spectrum  of  both light curves at the
          frequency of 0.75 mHz and its first harmonic are related to the
          spin  period  of  the white dwarf in the system, and that other
          observed  frequencies  are  signatures of nonradial white dwarf
          pulsations.  A  possible signal with a 24000 sec period is also
          found  in  the  XMM-Newton  light curve: a cycle and a half are
          clearly  identified. This period is consistent with the 24278 s
          periodicity discovered in the optical light curve of the source
          and thought to be the orbital period of the nova binary system.

          We  investigate the global transition from a turbulent state of
          superfluid vorticity to a laminar state, and vice versa, in the
          outer  core  of  a  neutron  star.  By  solving numerically the

          most  of  the  outer core, exciting unstable Kelvin waves which
          disrupt the rectilinear vortex array, creating a vortex tangle.
          In  the  turbulent  state,  the  torque  exerted  on  the crust
          oscillates,  and  the crust-core coupling is weaker than in the
          laminar  state. This leads to a new scenario for the rotational
          glitches   observed  in  radio  pulsars:  a  vortex  tangle  is
          sustained  in  the  differentially  rotating  outer core by the
          meridional counterflow, a sudden spin-up event brings the crust
          and  core  into corotation, the vortex tangle relaxes back to a
          rectilinear   vortex   array,   then   the   crust  spins  down
          electromagnetically  until enough meridional counterflow builds
          up  to reform a vortex tangle. The turbulent-laminar transition
          can  occur  uniformly or in patches; the associated time-scales
          are   estimated  from  vortex  filament  theory.  We  calculate
          numerically  the  global structure of the flow with and without
          an   inviscid   superfluid   component,   for   Hall-Vinen  and
          Gorter-Mellink  forms of the mutual friction. We also calculate
          the  post-glitch evolution of the angular velocity of the crust
          and  its  time  derivative,  and compare the results with radio
          pulse  timing  data,  predicting  a  correlation between glitch
          activity and Reynolds number.

          Title:  Density-Functional-Theory  Calculations  of  Matter  in
          Strong Magnetic Fields: I. Atoms and Molecules
          Authors: Zach Medin, Dong Lai (Cornell)
          Comments: 19 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. A
          We  present  new  ab  initio  calculations  of  the  electronic
          structure  of  various  atoms  and molecules in strong magnetic
          fields  ranging  from  B=10^12  G to 2x10^15 G, appropriate for
          radio  pulsars  and  magnetars.  For these field strengths, the
          magnetic  forces  on  the  electrons  dominate over the Coulomb
          forces,  and to a good approximation the electrons are confined
          to  the  ground Landau level. Our calculations are based on the
          density   functional   theory,   and   use   a  local  magnetic
          exchange-correlation function which is tested to be reliable in
          the  strong field regime. Numerical results of the ground-state
          energies  are given for H_N (up to N=10), He_N (up to N=8), C_N
          (up  to  N=5)  and  Fe_N  (up  to  N=3), as well as for various
          ionized  atoms.  Fitting  formulae  for the B-dependence of the
          energies  are  also  given.  In  general,  as  N increases, the
          binding  energy  per atom in a molecule, |E_N|/N, increases and
          approaches  a  constant  value.  For  all  the  field strengths
          considered   in   this  paper,  hydrogen,  helium,  and  carbon
          molecules  are  found  to be bound relative to individual atoms
          (although for B less than a few x 10^12 G, the relative binding
          between  C  and  C_2 is small). Iron molecules are not bound at
          B<10^13   G,  but  become  energetically  more  favorable  than
          individual atoms at larger field strengths.

          MNRAS
          We  report the serendipitous discovery of the Sloan Digital Sky
          Survey  star,  SDSS  J160043.6+074802.9  to  be  a  very  rapid
          pulsator.  The  variation is dominated by a frequency near 8380
          microHz  (period  = 119.33 s) with a large amplitude (0.04 mag)
          and  its  first harmonic at 16760 microHz (59.66 s; 0.005 mag).
          In  between  these  frequencies,  we  find  at  least another 8
          variations   with  periods  between  62  and  118  seconds  and
          amplitudes   between   about   0.007   and  0.003  mag;  weaker
          oscillations  might  also  be present. Preliminary spectrograms
          from the performance verification phase of the Southern African
          Large  Telescope  indicate  that  SDSS  J160043.6+074802.9 is a
          spectroscopic  binary consisting of an sdO star and a late-type
          main-sequence  companion.  This  makes it the first unambiguous
          detection  of  such  an  sdO star to pulsate, and certainly the
          first found to exhibit multi-frequency variations.

          X-ray  source  at  the  centre  of the 2,000-year-old supernova
          remnant RCW 103. No fast pulsations are visible. If genetically
          tied  to  the  supernova remnant, the source could either be an
          X-ray  binary,  comprising a compact object and a low-mass star
          in  an  eccentric  orbit,  or  an isolated neutron star. In the
          latter  case,  its  age-period  combination  would  point  to a
          peculiar  magnetar,  dramatically  slowed-down,  possibly  by a
          supernova  debris  disc.  Both  scenarios  require non-standard

          in supernova explosions.

          Title:  Modelling  spectral  line  profiles  of wind-wind shock
          emissions from massive binary systems
          Authors:  D. Falceta-Goncalves (IAG/USP), Z. Abraham (IAG/USP),
          V. Jatenco-Pereira (IAG/USP)
          Comments: To appear in the MNRAS
          One of the most intriguing spectral features of WR binary stars
          is  the  presence  of  time-dependent  line profiles. Long term
          observations  of  several  systems  revealed the periodicity of
          this  variability,  synchronized  with  the  orbital  movement.
          Several  partially  successful  models  have  been  proposed to
          reproduce the observed data. The most promising assume that the
          origin  of  the  emission is the wind-wind interaction zone. In
          this  scenario,  two  high  velocity  and dense winds produce a
          strong shock layer, responsible for most of the X-rays observed
          from  these  systems.  As  the  secondary  star moves along its
          orbital  path,  the  shock region of conical shape, changes its
          position  with relation to the line of sight. As a consequence,
          the  stream  measured  Doppler  shift  presents time variations
          resulting  in  position  changes  of  the spectral line. In our
          work,  we  present an alternative model, introducing turbulence
          in  the  shock  layer  to  account  for the line broadening and
          opacity  effects  for  the  asymmetry  in the line profiles. We
          showed   that   the  gas  turbulence  avoids  the  need  of  an
          unnaturally  large  contact  layer  thickness to reproduce line
          broadening. Also, we demonstrated that if the emission from the
          opposing  cone  surface  is  absorbed,  the  result is a single
          peaked  profile.  This  result  fully satisfies the recent data
          obtained  from  massive  binary  systems,  and  can help on the
          determination   of   both  winds  and  orbital  parameters.  We
          successfully   applied  this  model  to  the  Br22  system  and
          determined its orbital parameters.

          Title: The Origin of Primordial Magnetic Fields
          Authors: Rafael S. de Souza, Reuven Opher
          Comments: 23 pages, 5 figures
          (abridged) We suggest here that the large scale coherent fields
          $\sim  \mu$G,  observed  in galaxies at high and low redshifts,
          have  their  origin  in  the  electromagnetic fluctuations that
          naturally  occur  in  the dense hot plasmas that existed in the
          early  Universe.  This  scenario  avoids the general problem of
          primordial  MF  generation,  which  creates  small MFs on small
          comoving   scales  at  low  redshifts.  Dense  hot  plasmas  in
          equilibrium  create  large  fluctuations of the magnetic field,
          $\sim  10^{16}$  G,  immediately  after  the quark-hadron phase
          transition  (QHPT), as predicted by the Fluctuation-Dissipation
          Theorem.  We  evolve  the predicted fields to the present time.
          The  size  of  the  coherent region increases due to the fusion
          (polymerization)  of  smaller  regions. It is found that MFs of
          much  stronger intensity are obtained over much larger comoving
          regions  than  previous suggested by mechanisms whose origin is
          the QHPT. We obtain $\sim 0.1 \mu G$ over a comoving $\sim 0.1$
          pc  region.  A statistical average is made over a protogalactic
          $\sim  1$ Mpc comoving region. Magnetic fields $\sim$ $10^{-8}$
          $\mu$G  -  $10^{-1}$ $\mu$G are obtained at a redshift z $\sim$
          10.  In  the  collapse to a galaxy at this redsihft, the fields
          are  amplified  to  $10^{-5}  \mu G - 10 \mu G$. This indicates
          that  the  MFs created immediately after the QHPT, predicted by
          the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, could be the origin of the
          $\sim  \mu G$ fields observed today in galaxies at high and low
          redshifts.

          Ivashchenko, G.; Simon, A
          We  present  analysis  of  extensive monitoring of SS433 by the
          RXTE  observatory  collected  over  the  period  1996-2005. The
          difference   between   energy   spectra   taken   at  different
          precessional  and orbital phases shows the presence of a strong
          photoabsorption  near  the  optical  star,  probably due to its
          powerful  dense wind. Assuming that a precessing accretion disk
          is  thick,  we  recover  the  temperature  profile in the X-ray
          emitting   jet   that   best  fits  the  observed  precessional
          variations  of  the  X-ray  emission  temperature.  The hottest
          visible  part  of  the  X-ray  jet  is located at a distance of
          $l_0/a\sim0.06-0.09$,   or  $\sim2-3\times10^{11}$cm  from  the
          central  compact  object and has a temperature of about $T_{\rm
          max}\sim30$   keV.  We  discovered  appreciable  orbital  X-ray
          eclipses  at the ``crossover'' precessional phases (jets are in
          the  plane of the sky, disk is edge-on) which put a lower limit
          on  the  size of the optical component $R/a\ga0.5$ and an upper
          limit  on a mass ratio of binary companions $q=M_{\rm x}/M_{\rm
          opt}\la0.3-0.35$.  The  size  of  the  eclipsing  region can be
          larger  than  secondary's  Roche  lobe  because  of substantial
          photoabsorption  by dense stellar wind. This must be taken into
          account  when  evaluating the mass ratio from analysis of X-ray
          eclipses.

          Title: 3.9 day orbital modulation in the TeV gamma-ray flux and
          spectrum from the X-ray binary LS 5039
          Authors: The H.E.S.S. Collaboration: F.A. Aharonian, et al
          Comments:   8  pages,  8  figures,  submitted  to  Astronomy  &
          Astrophysics
          New   observations  of  LS  5039,  a  High  Mass  X-ray  Binary
          comprising  a massive star and compact object, were carried out
          with   the   High   Energy  Stereoscopic  System  of  Cherenkov
          Telescopes  (H.E.S.S.)  in  2005  at  very  high  energy  (VHE)
          gamma-ray energies. These observations reveal that its flux and
          energy  spectrum  are modulated with the 3.9 day orbital period
          of  the  binary  system.  This  is  the first time in gamma-ray
          astronomy  that  orbital  modulation  has  been  observed,  and
          periodicity  clearly  established  using ground-based gamma-ray
          detectors.  The  VHE  gamma-ray emission is largely confined to
          half  of  the  orbit,  peaking  around the inferior conjunction
          epoch  of  the  compact object. For this epoch, there is also a
          hardening  of  the  energy spectrum in the energy range between
          0.2  TeV  and  a  few  TeV.  The flux vs. orbital phase profile
          provides the first clear indication of gamma-ray absorption via
          pair production within an astrophysical source, a process which
          is  expected  to  occur  if  the  gamma-ray  production site is
          situated  within  ~1  AU  of  the  compact object. Moreover the
          production  region  size must be not significantly greater than
          the  binary  separation  (~0.15 AU). Notably, these constraints
          are  also  considerably smaller than the collimated outflows or
          jets  (extending  out  to  ~1000  AU)  observed in LS 5039. The
          spectral  hardening  could  arise from variations with phase in
          the   maximum   electron  energies,  and/or  the  dominant  VHE
          gamma-ray production mechanism.

          Title: Helium-rich thermonuclear bursts and the distance to the
          accretion-powered millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658
          Authors:   Duncan   Galloway   (1),  Andrew  Cumming  (2)  ((1)

          Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures, accepted by ApJ
          We  analysed  Rossi  X-ray  Timing Explorer observations of the
          accretion-powered  401  Hz pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658, in order to
          precisely determine the source distance. While the fluences for
          the  five  transient outbursts observed from 1996 were constant
          to  within  the  uncertainties,  the  outburst  interval varied
          signficantly,  so  that  the  time-averaged flux (and accretion
          rate)  decreased  by  around 40%. By equating the time-averaged
          X-ray   flux   with   the  expected  mass  transfer  rate  from
          gravitational  radiation,  we  derived  a  lower  limit  on the
          distance of 3.4 kpc. Combined with an upper limit from assuming
          that  the  four  radius-expansion thermonuclear bursts observed
          during  the 2002 October outburst reached at most the Eddington
          limit  for  a  pure  He  atmosphere, we found that the probable
          distance  range  for  the  source  is  3.4-3.6 kpc. The implied
          inclination,   based   on  the  optical/IR  properties  of  the
          counterpart, is i<~30 degrees.
          We  compared  the  properties  of  the  bursts with an ignition
          model.  The  time  between  bursts  was long enough for hot CNO
          burning to significantly deplete the accreted hydrogen, so that
          ignition  occurred  in  a pure helium layer underlying a stable
          hydrogen  burning  shell.  This  is  the  first  time that this
          burning  regime  has  been securely observationally identified.
          The  observed  energetics  of  the  bursts give a mean hydrogen
          fraction  at  ignition of <X> approx. 0.1, and require that the
          accreted  hydrogen  fraction  X_0 and the CNO metallicity Z_CNO
          are  related  by Z_CNO approx. 0.03(X_0/0.7)^2. We show that in
          this burning regime, a measurement of the burst recurrence time
          and energetics allows the local accretion rate onto the star to
          be determined independently of the accreted composition, giving
          a  new  method  for  estimating the source distance which is in
          good agreement with our other estimates.

          oscillations in thermonuclear X-ray bursts

          Matter  accreting  onto  the  magnetic  poles of a neutron star
          spreads under gravity towards the magnetic equator, burying the
          polar   magnetic   field  and  compressing  it  into  a  narrow
          equatorial belt. Steady-state, Grad-Shafranov calculations with
          a     self-consistent    mass-flux    distribution    (and    a
          semi-quantitative  treatment of Ohmic diffusion) show that, for
          $\Ma  \gtrsim  10^{-5}\Msun$,  the  maximum  field strength and
          latitudinal  half-width  of  the  equatorial  magnetic belt are
          $B_{\rm  max}  = 5.6\times 10^{15} (\Ma/10^{-4}\Msun)^{0.32}$ G
          and $\Delta\theta = \max[3^{\circ}
          (\Ma/10^{-4}\Msun)^{-1.5},3^{\circ}
          (\Ma/10^{-4}\Msun)^{0.5}(\dot{M}_{\rm    a}/10^{-8}\Msun   {\rm
          yr}^{-1})^{-0.5}]$  respectively,  where  $\Ma$  is  the  total
          accreted  mass  and $\dot{M}_{\rm a}$ is the accretion rate. It
          is  shown  that the belt prevents north-south heat transport by
          conduction, convection, radiation, and ageostrophic shear. This
          may  explain why millisecond oscillations observed in the tails
          of  thermonuclear  (type  I)  X-ray  bursts  in  low-mass X-ray
          binaries  are  highly  sinusoidal:  the  thermonuclear flame is
          sequestered in the magnetic hemisphere which ignites first. The
          model  is  also  consistent  with  the occasional occurrence of
          closely     spaced    pairs    of    bursts.    Time-dependent,
          ideal-magnetohydrodynamic    simulations   confirm   that   the
          equatorial  belt  is  not  disrupted  by Parker and interchange
          instabilities.

          Most  population  I  Wolf-Rayet  (WR)  stars  are  the  He-rich
          descendants  of  the most massive stars (M_i = 25 - 100 M_sun).
          Evidence  has  been  accumulating over the years that among all
          pop  I  WR  stars, those of the relatively cool, N-rich subtype
          "WN8" are among the most peculiar: 1. They tend to be runaways,
          with  large  space  velocity  and/or  avoid clusters. 2. Unlike
          their  equally luminous WN6,7 cousins, only a very small number
          of  WN8  stars are known to belong to a close binary with an OB
          companion.   3.   They   are  the  systematically  most  highly
          stochastically  variable  among  all  (single)  WR stars. Taken
          together, these suggest that many WN8 stars may originally have
          been  in  close binaries (like half of all stars), in which the
          original primary exploded as a supernova, leaving behind a very
          close   binary   containing  a  massive  star  with  a  neutron
          star/black  hole  companion  (like  Cyg  X-3). When the massive
          remaining  star  evolved  in  turn,  it engulfed and eventually
          swallowed  the  compact  companion,  leading  to  the presently
          puffed-up,  variable  WN8  star.  Such  stars could fall in the
          realm of the exotic Thorne-Zytkow objects.

          Title:  Terrestrial  Planet  Formation Surrounding Close Binary

          Disk  material has been observed around both components of some
          young  close  binary  star  systems.  It has been shown that if
          planets  form  at  the right places within such disks, they can
          remain  dynamically  stable  for  very  long  times. Herein, we
          numerically  simulate  the  late  stages  of terrestrial planet
          growth in circumbinary disks around 'close' binary star systems
          with  stellar separations between 0.05 AU and 0.4 AU and binary
          eccentricities  up  to  0.8. In each simulation, the sum of the
          masses  of the two stars is 1 solar mass, and giant planets are
          included.  Our  results  are statistically compared to a set of
          planet  formation  simulations in the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system
          that   begin   with   essentially  the  same  initial  disk  of
          protoplanets. The planetary systems formed around binaries with
          apastron distances less than ~ 0.2 AU are very similar to those
          around   single   stars,  whereas  those  with  larger  maximum
          separations  tend to be sparcer, with fewer planets, especially
          interior  to 1 AU. We also provide formulae that can be used to
          scale  results  of  planetary  accretion simulations to various
          systems  with  different  total  stellar  mass, disk sizes, and
          planetesimal masses and densities.

          Title:  Gravitational  Radiation  from Standing Accretion Shock
          Instability in Core-Collapse Supernovae
          Authors: Kei Kotake, Naofumi Ohnishi, Shoichi Yamada
          Comments: 21 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  perform  long-term two dimensional axisymmetric simulations
          in  the  postbounce  phase of core-collapse supernovae to study
          how  the  asphericities  induced  by the growth of the standing
          accretion  shock  instability  (SASI) produce the gravitational
          waveforms.   To   obtain  the  neutrino-driven  explosions,  we
          parameterize  the  neutrino  fluxes  emitted  from  the central
          protoneutron  star  and  approximate the neutrino transfer by a
          light-bulb  scheme.  We  find  that  the  waveforms  due to the
          anisotropic neutrino emissions show the monotonic increase with
          time, whose amplitudes are up to two order-of-magnitudes larger
          than  the  ones  from the convective matter motions outside the
          protoneutron stars.
          We  point  out  that the amplitudes begin to become larger when
          the growth of the SASI enters the nonlinear phase, in which the
          deformation  of  the  shocks and the neutrino anisotropy become
          large.
          From  the  spectrum analysis of the waveforms, we find that the
          amplitudes  from  the neutrinos are dominant over the ones from
          the  matter motions at the frequency below $\sim 100$ Hz, which
          are  suggested  to  be  within  the  detection  limits  of  the
          detectors  in the next generation such as LCGT and the advanced
          LIGO for a supernova at 10 kpc.
          As a contribution to the gravitational wave background, we show
          that  the  amplitudes  from  this source could be larger at the
          frequency  above  $\sim$ 1 Hz than the primordial gravitational
          wave  backgrounds, but unfortunately, invisible to the proposed
          space-based detectors.

          Title: Spectroscopic binaries with components of similar mass
          Authors: L.B.Lucy (Astrophysics Group, Imperial College)
          Comments:   8   pages,  8  figures.  Accepted  by  Astronomy  &
          astrophysics
          The  assertion  that  there  is an intrinsic excess of binaries
          with  mass  ratios  q  \simeq  1  -  the  twin  hypothesis - is
          investigated. A strong version of this hypothesis (H_s), due to
          Lucy  &  Ricco  (1979) and Tokovinin (2000), refers to a narrow
          peak in the distribution function psi(q) for q \ga 0.95. A weak
          version  (H_w),  due  to  Halbwachs  et al. (2003), refers to a
          broad peak for q \ga 0.8. Current data on SB2's is analysed and
          H_s  is  found  to  be  statistically  significant for a sample
          restricted  to orbits of high precision. But claims that H_s is
          significant  for  binaries with special characteristics are not
          confirmed  since  the  sample  sizes are well below the minimum
          required  for  a  reliable test. With regard to H_w, additional
          observational  evidence  is  not presented, but evidence to the
          contrary  in  the  form  of  Hogeveen's (1992b) model of biased
          sampling  with  psi \propto q^{-2} is criticized. Specifically,
          his   success  in  thus  fitting  catalogued  data  depends  on
          implausible  assumptions  about  the  research methodologies of
          binary-star spectroscopists.

          measured  by the RXTE/PCA and the combined Swift/XRT, RXTE/PCA,
          and  INTEGRAL/ISGRI  (0.5-100 keV) energy spectrum suggest that
          the  system  is  a  neutron-star  low-mass  X-ray  binary  or a
          black-hole    candidate    at   low   accretion   levels.   The
          non-simultaneous  spectra are consistent with the same spectral
          shape  and  flux, suggesting little variability over the period
          July  to  October  2005,  but the analysis of archival INTEGRAL
          data  shows  that  the  source  was  not detected in 2003-2004,
          suggesting a transient or strongly variable behavior.

          The  Local  Group galaxies constitute a fundamental step in the
          definition  of  cosmic  distance  scale.  Therefore,  obtaining
          accurate  distance  determinations to the galaxies in the Local
          Group,  and notably to the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), is essential
          to determining the age and evolution of the Universe. With this
          ultimate  goal  in  mind, we started a project to use eclipsing
          binaries as distance indicators to M31. Eclipsing binaries have
          been  proved  to  yield  direct  and precise distances that are
          essentially assumption free. To do so, high-quality photometric
          and  spectroscopic  data  are  needed.  As  a first step in the
          project,  broad  band  photometry (in Johnson B and V) has been
          obtained in a region (34'x34') at the North-Eastern quadrant of
          the  galaxy  over  5  years. The data, containing more than 250
          observations  per  filter,  have  been  reduced by means of the
          so-called  difference  image analysis technique and the DAOPHOT
          program.  A catalog with 236238 objects with photometry in both
          B and V passbands has been obtained. The catalog is the deepest
          (V<25.5 mag) obtained so far in the studied region and contains
          3964 identified variable stars, with 437 eclipsing binaries and
          416 Cepheids. The most suitable eclipsing binary candidates for
          distance  determination  have  been selected according to their
          brightness and from the modelling of the obtained light curves.
          The  resulting  sample  includes  24  targets  with photometric
          errors   around   0.01   mag.   Detailed   analysis  (including
          spectroscopy)  of  some  5-10 of these eclipsing systems should
          result  in  a  distance  determination  to  M31 with a relative
          uncertainty  of  2-3%  and  essentially  free  from  systematic
          errors,  thus  representing  the  most  accurate  and  reliable
          determination to date.

          We  carried  out numerical experiments on the evaluation of the
          possibilities  of  obtaining  the  information about brightness
          distributions  for  the  components of eclipsing variables from
          the  data  of  high-precision  photometry  expected for planned
          satellites  COROT and Kepler. We examined a simple model of the
          eclipsing  binary  with  the  spherical  components on circular
          orbits  and the linear law of the limb darkening. The solutions
          of  light  curves  have  been  obtained  as  by  fitting of the
          nonlinear  model,  into  the  number  of  parameters  of  which
          included  the  limb  darkening  coefficients,  so  also  by the
          solution  of  the  ill-posed  inverse problem of restoration of
          brightness  distributions  across  the  disks  of stars without
          rigid  model  constraints  on  the form of these functions. The
          obtained  estimations  show  that if the observational accuracy
          amounts  to  0.0001 then the limb darkening coefficients can be
          found   with  the  relative  error  approximately  0.01  .  The
          brightness  distributions across the disks of components can be
          restored also nearly with the same accuracy.

          We have analyzed 5.5 years of timing observations of 7 'slowly'
          rotating  radio  pulsars,  made  with  the Westerbork Synthesis
          Radio  Telescope.  We present improved timing solutions and 30,
          mostly  small,  new  glitches. Particularly interesting are our
          results  on  PSR  J1814-1744,  which is one of the pulsars with
          similar  rotation parameters and magnetic field strength to the
          Anomalous  X-ray  Pulsars  (AXPs).  Although  the  high-B radio
          pulsars  do  not  show X-ray emission, and no radio emission is
          detected  for  AXPs,  the  roughly  similar  glitch  parameters
          provide  us  with  another  tool  to  compare  these classes of
          neutron stars. Furthermore, we were able to detect glitches one
          to  two orders of magnitude smaller than before, for example in
          our  well-sampled  observations  of PSR B0355+54. We double the
          total  number  of  known  glitches in PSR B1737-30, and improve
          statistics  on  glitch  sizes  for this pulsar individually and
          pulsars  in  general.  We  detect  no significant variations in
          dispersion  measure for PSRs B1951+32 and B2224+65, two pulsars
          located  in high-density surroundings. We discuss the effect of
          small  glitches  on  timing  noise,  and show it is possible to
          resolve timing-noise looking structures in the residuals of PSR
          B1951+32 by using a set of small glitches.

          Southern  African  Large Telescope (SALT), along with its first
          light imager SALTICAM. Using this instrument, we present 4.3 hr

          eclipsing polar SDSSJ015543.40+002807.2 with time resolution as
          short  as 112 ms, the highest quality observations of this kind
          of  any  polar to date. The system was observed during its high
          luminosity  state.  Two accreting poles are clearly seen in the
          eclipse  light  curve.  The  binary system parameters have been
          constrained:  the  white  dwarf  mass  is at the low end of the
          range  expected for cataclysmic variables. Correlations between
          the  positions  of the accretion regions on or near the surface
          of  the  white  dwarf  and  the  binary  system parameters were
          established.  The  sizes  of  the  accretion  regions and their
          relative  movement from eclipse to eclipse were estimated: they
          are typically 4-7 deg depending on the mass of the white dwarf.
          The potential of these observations will only fully be realised
          when  low  state  data  of  the  same kind are obtained and the
          contact phases of the eclipse of the white dwarf are measured.

          production  probing  the  saturation  regime. In particular, we
          show  that  the  ep  HERA  data  presents a scaling on \tau_c =
          (Q^2+\mu_c^2)/Q_{sat}^2.  We derive our results considering the
          dipole  picture and the Color Glass Condensate formalism, which
          one  shows to be able to describe the heavy quark production in
          photon-proton and proton-proton collisions. Nuclear effects are
          considered  in  computation of cross sections for scattering on
          air  nuclei.  Implications on the flux of prompt leptons at the
          earth are analyzed and a large suppression is predicted.

          Title:  Density-Functional-Theory  Calculations  of  Matter  in
          Strong  Magnetic  Fields:  II.  Infinite  Chains  and Condensed
          Matter
          Authors: Zach Medin, Dong Lai (Cornell)
          Comments: 35 pages, 24 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. A
          We  present  new,  ab  initio  calculations  of  the electronic
          structure    of    one-dimensional    infinite    chains    and
          three-dimensional  condensed  matter  in strong magnetic fields
          ranging  from  B=10^12 G to 2x10^15 G, appropriate for observed
          magnetic  neutron stars. At these field strengths, the magnetic
          forces  on  the electrons dominate over the Coulomb forces, and
          to  a  good  approximation  the  electrons  are confined to the
          ground  Landau level. Our calculations are based on the density
          functional     theory,     and    use    a    local    magnetic
          exchange-correlation  function  appropriate in the strong field
          regime.  The  band  structures of electrons in different Landau
          orbitals  are  computed self-consistently. Numerical results of
          the ground-state energies and electron work functions are given
          for  one-dimensional  chains  of  H,  He,  C,  and  Fe. Fitting
          formulae   for  the  B-dependence  of  the  energies  are  also
          provided. For all the field strengths considered in this paper,
          hydrogen,  helium,  and  carbon  chains  are  found to be bound
          relative  to individual atoms (although for B less than a few x
          10^12  G,  the  relative  binding  between  C and C_infinity is
          small).  Iron  chains are significantly bound for B>10^14 G and
          are  weakly  bound  if  at  all at B<10^13 G. We also study the
          cohesive  property  of three-dimensional condensed matter of H,
          He,  C,  and  Fe at zero pressure, constructed from interacting
          chains    in   a   body-centered   tetragonal   lattice.   Such
          three-dimensional   condensed  matter  is  found  to  be  bound
          relative   to   individual  atoms,  with  the  cohesive  energy
          increasing rapidly with increasing B.

          Comments: 13 pages, 7 figures, accepted in A&A
          We  consider  the production of positrons in microquasars, i.e.
          X-ray  binary  systems  that  exhibit  jets frequently, but not
          continuously.  We  estimate the production rate of positrons in
          microquasars,  both  by simple energy considerations and in the
          framework  of  various  proposed  models.  We then evaluate the
          collective emissivity of the annihilation radiation produced by
          Galactic  microquasars  and  we find that it might constitute a
          substantial  contribution  to the annihilation flux measured by
          INTEGRAL/SPI. We also discuss the possible spatial distribution
          of   Galactic  microquasars,  on  the  basis  of  the  (scarce)
          available  data  and  the  resulting  morphology  of  the  flux
          received  on  Earth.  Finally,  we consider nearby 'misaligned'
          microquasars,  with jets occasionally hitting the atmosphere of
          the  companion  star;  these  would represent interesting point
          sources,  for  which we determine the annihilation flux and the
          corresponding  light  curve,  as  well  as  the line's spectral
          profile.  We discuss the possibility of detection of such point
          sources by future instruments.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          The  results  of  27  hours  of  time series photometry of SDSS
          121209.31+013627.7 are presented. The binary period established
          from spectroscopy is confirmed and refined to 0.061412 d (88.43
          minutes).   The  photometric  variations  are  dominated  by  a
          brightening of about 16 mmag, lasting a little less than half a
          binary  cycle.  The amplitude is approximately the same in V, R
          and  white  light. A secondary small brightness increase during
          each  cycle  may  also  be  present.  We  speculate  that  SDSS
          121209.31+013627.7 may be a polar in a low state.

          because  of  the  relatively  small number of observations (6 -
          12),  a  circumstance  which  is partly compensated by the good

          Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures, to appear Astrophysics and Space
          Science,  in  the  proceedings of "Isolated Neutron Stars: from
          the Interior to the Surface", edited by D. Page, R. Turolla and
          S. Zane
          We present timing measurements, astrometry, and high-resolution
          spectra  of  a  number  of nearby, thermally emitting, isolated
          neutron  stars.  We use these to infer magnetic field strengths
          and  distances,  but  also  encounter  a  number of puzzles. We
          discuss  three specific ones in detail: (i) For RX J0720.4-3125
          and  RX  J1308.6+2127, the characteristic ages are in excess of
          1~Myr,  while  their  temperatures  and kinematic ages indicate
          that  they  are  much  younger;  (ii)  For RX J1856.5-3754, the
          brightness temperature for the optical emission is in excess of
          that  measured at X-ray wavelengths for reasonable neutron-star
          radii;  (iii) For RX J0720.4-3125, the spectrum changed from an
          initially  featureless state to one with an absorption feature,
          yet  there  was  only  a  relatively  small change in effective
          temperature. Furthermore, we attempt to see whether the spectra
          of  all seven sourced, in six of which absorption features have
          now  been  found,  can be understood in the context of strongly
          magnetised  hydrogen  atmospheres. We find that the energies of
          the  absorption  features  can  be  reproduced,  but  that  the
          featureless  spectra  of some sources, especially the Wien-like
          high-energy tails, remain puzzling.

          Astronomy Letters
          Giant  pulses  (GPs)  have  been  detected  from the pulsar PSR
          B0656+14.  A  pulse that is more intense than the average pulse
          by  a  factor  of 120 is encountered approximately once in 3000
          observed  periods  of  the pulsar. The peak flux density of the
          strongest pulse, 120 Jy, is a factor of 630 higher than that of
          the  average  pulse.  The  GP  energy exceeds the energy of the
          average  pulse by up to a factor of 110, which is comparable to
          that  for  other  known  pulsars  with  GPs, including the Crab
          pulsar  and  the  millisecond  pulsar  PSR  B1937+21. The giant
          pulses  are  a  factor of 6 narrower than the average pulse and
          are  clustered  at  the head of the average pulse. PSR B0656+14
          along  with  PSR  B0031-07,  PSR  B1112+50,  and PSR J1752+2359
          belong  to a group of pulsars that differ from previously known
          ones  in  which  GPs  have  been detected without any extremely
          strong magnetic field on the light cylinder.

          Authors: A.I. Bogomazov, V.M. Lipunov, A.V. Tutukov
          Comments: 18 pages, 3 figures
          We  analyze  here  late  evolutionary  stages  of massive (with
          initial  mass  higher  than  8  masses of the Sun) close binary
          stars.  Our  purposes are to study possible mechanisms of gamma
          ray  bursts  (GRBs)  origin.  We suppose in this paper that GRB
          phenomenon  require  formation  of  massive  (approx.  1 M_sun)
          compact (approx. 10 km) accretion disks around Kerr black holes
          and  neutron  stars.  Such  Kerr  black  holes  are products of
          collapse  of  Wolf-Rayet  stars in extremely close binaries and
          merging  of  neutron  stars  with black holes and neutron stars
          with  neutron stars in close binary systems. Required accretion
          disks also can be formed around neutron stars which were formed
          during  collapse of accreting oxygen-neon white dwarfs. We have
          estimated  frequencies  of  events  which  lead to a rotational
          collapse   concerned   with   formation   of  rapidly  rotating
          relativistic  objects  in  the Galaxy. We made our calculations
          using the "Scenario Machine".

          Title:  Introducing  Powell's  Direction  Set Method to a Fully
          Automated Analysis of Eclipsing Binary Stars
          Authors: A. Prsa, T. Zwitter
          Comments:  6 pages, 2 Figures, 1 Table; to appear in the "Solar
          and Stellar Physics through Eclipses" Proceedings (accepted)
          With  recent observational advancements, substantial amounts of
          photometric  and  spectroscopic eclipsing binary data have been
          acquired.  As  part of an ongoing effort to assemble a reliable
          pipeline  for  fully  automatic  data analysis, we put Powell's
          direction set method to the test. The method does not depend on
          numerical  derivatives,  only  on  function evaluations, and as
          such  it  cannot  diverge. Compared to differential corrections
          (DC)  and  Nelder  &  Mead's  downhill  simplex  (NMS)  method,
          Powell's  method  proves  to  be  more  efficient  in  terms of
          solution  determination  and the required number of iterations.
          However,  its application is still not optimal in terms of time
          cost.  Causes  for this deficiency are identified and two steps
          toward  the  solution  are  proposed:  non-ortogonality  of the
          parameter  set  should be removed and better initial directions
          should be determined before the minimization is initiated. Once
          these  setbacks  are  worked out, Powell's method will probably
          replace  DC  and  NMS  as  the  default minimizing algorithm in
          PHOEBE modeling package.

          Astrophysical Journal
          In  order  to  provide  a  firm  identification  of  the  newly
          discovered Galactic TeV sources, a search for counterparts in a
          broad  band  from  soft  X-ray to soft gamma-rays is crucial as
          data  in  these  wavebands  allow  us  to  distinguish  between
          different  types  of  suggested  models  (for  example leptonic
          versus  hadronic) and, in turn, to disentangle their nature. In
          this  paper,  we  report  the  results  of  a  set of follow-up
          observations  performed  by  the Swift/X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on
          seven  sources  recently  discovered by HESS, in the range from
          few hundred GeV to about 10 TeV, during the inner Galaxy survey
          (Aharonian  et al. 2006). In all, but one case, we detect X-ray
          sources  inside  or  close-by the extended TeV emitting region.
          All  these putative X-ray counterparts have accurate arc-second
          location  and are consistent with being point sources. The main
          result  of  our  search is the discovery that three of them are
          located  at  the  center  of  the diffuse radio emission of the
          supernova  remnants,  which  have  been spatially associated to
          these  TeV  objects.  HESS  J1640-465,  HESS J1834-087 and HESS
          J1813-178  show  this evidence, suggestive of a possible Pulsar
          Wind Nebula association.

          Title: Spin-down Rate of Pinned Superfluid
          Authors: M Jahan-Miri
          Comments: to appear in ApJ (vol. 649 ?)
          The  spinning  down  (up)  of a superfluid is associated with a
          radial  motion  of  its  quantized vortices. In the presence of
          pinning   barriers  against  the  motion  of  the  vortices,  a
          spin-down  may  be  still realized through ``random unpinning''
          and ``vortex motion,'' as two physically separate processes, as
          suggested  recently.  The spin-down rate of a pinned superfluid
          is  calculated,  in  this  framework,  by  directly solving the
          equation  of  motion  applicable  to  only  the unpinned moving
          vortices,  at  any  given  time.  The results indicate that the
          pinned  superfluid  in  the crust of a neutron star may as well
          spin  down  at  the  same  steady-state rate as the rest of the
          star, through random unpinning events, while pinning conditions
          prevail  and  the superfluid rotational lag is smaller than the
          critical lag value.

          Title: On the angular momentum evolution of merged white dwarfs
          Authors: K.N. Gourgouliatos, C.S. Jeffery
          Comments: 11 pages, 11 figures, MNRAS in press
          We  study the angular momentum evolution of binaries containing
          two  white  dwarfs  which  merge  and  become  cool helium-rich
          supergiants.  Our  object  is  to  compare  predicted  rotation
          velocities  with  observations of highly evolved stars believed
          to  have  formed from such a merger, including RCrB and extreme
          helium  stars. The principal study involves a binary containing
          a  0.6 solar mass CO white dwarf, and a 0.3 solar mass He white
          dwarf.   The   initial   condition  for  the  angular  momentum
          distribution  is  defined  where  the secondary fills its Roche
          Lobe. We assume conservation of angular momentum to compute the
          angular  momentum  distribution  in  a  collisionless  disk and
          subsequently  in the giant envelope. At the end of shell-helium
          burning,  the  giant contracts to form a white dwarf. We derive
          the  surface  rotation  velocity  during  this contraction. The
          calculation is repeated for a range of initial mass ratios, and
          also  for  the case of mergers between two helium white dwarfs;
          the  latter  will  contract  to the helium main-sequence rather
          than  the  white dwarf sequence. Assuming complete conservation
          of  angular  momentum,  we  predict acceptable angular rotation
          rates  for  cool  giants  and  during  the  initial  subsequent
          contraction.  However  such  stars will only survive spin-up to
          reach  the  white  dwarf sequence (CO+He merger) if the initial
          mass  ratio  is close to unity. He+He merger products must lose
          angular  momentum  in  order to reach the helium main sequence.
          Minimum  observed  rotation  velocities in extreme helium stars
          are lower than our predictions by at least one half, indicating
          that CO+He mergers must lose at least one half of their angular
          momentum.

          The  first  phase-resolved  JHK  light  curves of the eclipsing
          polar   (AM  Herculis  binary)  V1309  Ori  are  presented  and
          interpreted.  We  separate the contributions from the secondary
          star  and  from  other  sources  with  the aim of determining a
          photometric  distance.  Simple model calculations show that the
          accretion  stream  and  the  cyclotron  source on the accreting
          white  dwarf  are  minor  contributors  to  the infrared light,
          allowing   an  accurate  determination  of  spectral  type  and
          absolute flux of the secondary star. The unilluminated backside
          of  the secondary star as seen in eclipse has spectral type dM0
          to dM0+. Its dereddened magnitude is K = 13.58 at orbital phase
          phi  =  0 (eclipse). Using the calibrated surface brightness of
          M-stars  and  the  published  mass  of the secondary, M2 = 0.46
          Msun,  we  obtain  a distance d = 600 +/- 25 pc which scales as
          M2^(1/2).  The  radius  of  the  Roche-lobe  filling  secondary
          exceeds  the main-sequence radius of an M0 star by 21 +11/-6 %.
          The  debated origin of the infrared light of V1309 Ori has been
          settled  in favor of the secondary star as the main contributor
          and  an  accurate  distance  has  been  derived that will place
          estimates of the luminosity and synchronization time scale on a
          more secure basis.

          Title:  First  broad  band  study  of  the mysterious source 1E
          1743.1-2843

          In  the  last  years,  the persistent source 1E 1743.1-2843 has
          been  observed  in  the  X-rays,  but  never  above  20 keV. In
          previous  works,  it  was  stressed that a possible high energy
          emission could give further indications on the accreting object
          nature  which  remains still unknown. We present here more than
          two  years  of  1E 1743.1-2843 monitoring with INTEGRAL/IBIS as
          well  as  public XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray observations. The
          temporal  study  in  the 20-40 keV band shows a rather constant
          flux  on  few  months  time scale. Based on this result we have
          performed  the broad-band spectral analysis using EPIC/IBIS non
          simultaneous  data  and ACIS-I/IBIS data collected during 2004.
          In  ~2 Ms, we report a detection of 6 sigma in the energy range
          35-70  keV. The first broad-band study (2-70 keV) shows a steep
          slope  (~3)  and a black body temperature of 1.7 keV. Combining
          spectral   parameters   and  discussion  about  the  luminosity
          evaluations  for  different possible distances, our conclusions
          are  in favour of a LMXB system with a neutron star at distance
          higher  than the Galactic Centre, even though a firm conclusion
          can not be stated.

          Optical  time  series  photometry  of the short period magnetic
          white    dwarf    +    probable   brown   dwarf   binary   SDSS
          121209.31+013627.7  reveals pulse-like variability in all bands
          from i' to u', peaking at u'. These modulations are most likely
          due  to a self-eclipsing accretion hot spot on the white dwarf,
          rotating   into  view  every  88.43  minutes.  This  period  is
          commensurate  with  the  radial  velocity  period determined by
          Schmidt  et  al.  2005  of ~90 minutes, and consistent with the
          rotation  period  of  the  accretor  being  equal to the binary
          orbital period. We combine our observations with those recently
          published  by  Koen  and  Maxted  2006  to  provide an accurate
          ephemeris.  We also detect the system in X-rays with Swift, and
          estimate  the  accretion  rate  at  ~1x10^-13Msun  per year. We
          suggest  that  SDSS1212  is  most likely a magnetic cataclysmic
          variable in an extended state of very low accretion, similar to
          the  well-studied  Polar  EF  Eri.  Alternatively, the putative
          brown  dwarf  is not filling its Roche Lobe and the system is a
          detached  binary  in  which  the  white  dwarf  is  efficiently
          accreting  from the wind of the secondary. Six such post-common
          envelope,  ``pre-Polar''  systems - termed ``low accretion rate
          Polars  (LARPs)'' by Schwope et al. 2002 - have previously been
          identified  through optical cyclotron emission lines. Cyclotron
          emission  from  SDSS1212  has  recently  been  detected  in the
          near-IR  Debes  et  al.  2006 but, if detached, it would be the
          first  ``LARP''  with  a  probably sub-stellar secondary. It is
          unclear whether an L-dwarf wind is strong enough to provide the
          measured  accretion  rate.  We  suggest further observations to
          distinguish between the Roche Lobe over-flow and wind accretion
          scenarios.

          Comments: Accepted by Astrophysical Journal Letters
          Following  the  recent outburst of the recurrent nova RS Oph on
          2006 Feb 12, we measured its near-infrared size using the IOTA,
          Keck,   and   PTI   Interferometers  at  multiple  epochs.  The
          characteristic  size  of ~3 milliarcseconds hardly changed over
          the first 60 days of the outburst, ruling out currently-popular
          models  whereby  the near-infrared emission arises from hot gas
          in  the  expanding  shock.  The  emission  was also found to be
          significantly  asymmetric, evidenced by non-zero closure phases
          detected  by  IOTA.  The  physical interpretation of these data
          depend strongly on the adopted distance to RS Oph. Our data can
          be  interpreted as the first direct detection of the underlying
          RS  Oph  binary,  lending  support  to  the recent ``reborn red
          giant''  models  of Hachisu & Kato. However, this result hinges
          on an RS Oph distance of ~< 540 pc, in strong disagreement with
          the  widely-adopted  distance  of  ~1.6  kpc.  At  the  farther
          distance,  our  observations  imply  instead the existence of a
          non-expanding,  dense  and ionized circumbinary gaseous disk or
          reservoir   responsible  for  the  bulk  of  the  near-infrared
          emission.  Longer-baseline  infrared interferometry is uniquely
          suited  to  distinguish  between these models and to ultimately
          determine  the distance, binary orbit, and component masses for
          RS  Oph,  one  of the closest-known (candidate) SNIa progenitor
          systems.

          Comments:  14  pages,  16  figures;  accepted  by Astronomy and
          Astrophysics
          We  present  a  multicomponent model to explain the features of
          the  pulsed  emission  and  spectrum of the Crab Pulsar, on the
          basis  of  X and gamma-ray observations obtained with BeppoSAX,
          INTEGRAL  and  CGRO.  This  model explains the evolution of the
          pulse shape and of the phase-resolved spectra, ranging from the
          optical/UV  to  the GeV energy band, on the assumption that the
          observed   emission  is  due  to  more  components.  The  first
          component,  C_O,  is  assumed  to have the pulsed double-peaked
          profile  observed  at the optical frequencies, while the second
          component,  C_X,  is  dominant in the interpeak and second peak
          phase  regions.  The  spectra  of these components are modelled
          with log-parabolic laws and their spectral energy distributions
          have  peak  energies  at  12.2  and  178  keV, respectively. To
          explain  the  properties  of the pulsed emission in the MeV-GeV
          band,  we introduce two more components, C_Ogamma and C_Xgamma,
          with  phase  distributions  similar to those of C_O and C_X and
          log-parabolic spectra with the same curvature but peak energies
          at  about  300 MeV and 2 GeV. This multicomponent model is able
          to   reproduce   both  the  broadband  phase-resolved  spectral
          behaviour  and  the  changes of the pulse shape with energy. We
          also  propose  some  possible physical interpretations in which
          C_O  and  C_X  are emitted by secondary pairs via a synchrotron
          mechanism while C_Ogamma and C_Xgamma can originate either from
          Compton scattered or primary curvature photons.

          Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  present  the results of a high spectral resolution study of
          the eclipsing binary AR Aur. AR Aur is the only known eclipsing
          binary  with  a  HgMn  primary  star  exactly on the ZAMS and a
          secondary  star  still  contracting towards the ZAMS. We detect
          for  the first time in the spectra of the primary star that for
          many  elements the line profiles are variable over the rotation
          period.  The  strongest  profile  variations  are found for the
          elements  Pt, Hg, Sr, Y, Zr, He and Nd, while the line profiles
          of  O,  Na,  Mg,  Si, Ca, Ti, and Fe show only weak distortions
          over the rotation period. The slight variability of He and Y is
          also  confirmed  by  the  study  of  high resolution spectra of
          another  HgMn  star:  alpha And. A preliminary modelling of the
          inhomogeneous  distribution  has been carried out for Sr and Y.
          Our   analysis  shows  that  these  elements  are  very  likely
          concentrated  in a fractured ring along the rotational equator.
          It  may  be an essential clue for the explanation of the origin
          of  the  chemical  anomalies  in  HgMn  stars  (which  are very
          frequently found in binary and multiple systems) that one large
          fraction  of  the  ring  is missing exactly on the surface area
          which  is  permanently  facing the secondary, and another small
          one  on  the  almost opposite side. The results presented about
          the  inhomogeneous  distribution  of  various chemical elements
          over  the stellar surface of the primary suggest new directions
          for  investigations  to  solve  the  question  of the origin of
          abundance anomalies in B-type stars with HgMn peculiarity.

          Title:  The  energy  dependence  of burst oscillations from the
          accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338
          Authors: Anna L. Watts (MPA), Tod E. Strohmayer (NASA GSFC)
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS
          The  nature  of  the  asymmetry that gives rise to Type I X-ray
          burst  oscillations on accreting neutron stars remains a matter
          of   debate.  Of  particular  interest  is  whether  the  burst
          oscillation  mechanism differs between the bursting millisecond
          pulsars and the non-pulsing systems. One means to diagnose this
          is  to  study  the energy dependence of the burst oscillations:
          here  we  present  an  analysis  of oscillations from 28 bursts
          observed  during the 2003 outburst of the accreting millisecond
          pulsar  XTE J1814-338. We find that the fractional amplitude of
          the  burst  oscillations  falls with energy, in contrast to the
          behaviour found by Muno et al. (2003) in the burst oscillations
          from a set of non-pulsing systems. The drop with energy mirrors
          that  seen in the accretion-powered pulsations; in this respect
          XTE  J1814-338  behaves  like  the  other accreting millisecond
          pulsars.  The  burst  oscillations  show no evidence for either
          hard  or  soft  lags, in contrast to the persistent pulsations,
          which  show soft lags of up to 50 $\mu$s. The fall in amplitude
          with  energy  is  inconsistent  with  current  surface mode and
          simple  hot  spot  models  of  burst  oscillations.  We discuss
          improvements  to  the  models  and uncertainties in the physics
          that might resolve these issues.

          Title: From progenitor to afterlife
          Authors: Roger A. Chevalier
          Comments:  10 pages, Proceedings of 2006 STScI May Symposium on
          Massive Stars
          The sequence of massive star supernova types IIP (plateau light
          curve),  IIL  (linear light curve), IIb, IIn (narrow line), Ib,
          and  Ic  roughly  represents a sequence of increasing mass loss
          during  the  stellar  evolution.  The  mass  loss  affects  the
          velocity distribution of the ejecta composition; in particular,
          only  the IIP's typically end up with H moving at low velocity.
          Radio  and  X-ray observations of extragalactic supernovae show
          varying mass loss properties that are in line with expectations
          for  the progenitor stars. For young supernova remnants, pulsar
          wind  nebulae  and  circumstellar interaction provide probes of
          the  inner  ejecta  and  higher  velocity ejecta, respectively.
          Among the young remnants, there is evidence for supernovae over
          a  range  of  types, including those that exploded with much of
          the H envelope present (Crab Nebula, 3C 58, 0540--69) and those
          that  exploded  after having lost most of their H envelope (Cas
          A, G292.0+1.8).

          Title: Merger of Compact Objects
          Authors: C.-H. Lee, G.E. Brown, E. Park
          Comments: 11 pages
          Bethe  and  Brown  (1998)  suggested  that mergers resulting in
          short-hard  gamma-ray  bursts would be mainly those of low-mass
          black-hole(LMBH),  neutron-star  (NS)  binaries,  with those of
          NS-NS  binaries  down  by an order of magnitude from these. The
          lower number of the latter resulted from the necessity that the
          two  giant  progenitors be within 4% of each other in ZAMS mass
          so  that  they  burned He at the same time. Otherwise the first
          born  pulsar would find itself in the red giant envelope of the
          companion  giant  as it evolved and accrete enough matter to go
          into a black hole (BH).
          Using  a flat distribution in mass (constant dn/dm), favored by
          Duquennoy  and  Mayer  (1991), we calculated a ratio of LMBH-NS
          and NS-NS systems to be about 5, in agreement with Pinsonneault
          and  Stanek  (2006).  These authors emphasize the importance of
          "twins",  which  we discuss. The two NS's in the twins would be
          close in mass and further increase the number of mergings.

          We  report  the  detection with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
          (RXTE)  Proportional  Counter  Array  (PCA)  of  530  Hz  burst
          oscillations  in  a  thermonuclear  (type  I)  burst  from  the
          transient X-ray source A1744-361. This is only the second burst
          ever observed from this source, and the first to be seen in any
          detail.  Our results confirm that A1744-361 is a low mass X-ray
          binary (LMXB) system harboring a rapidly rotating neutron star.
          The  oscillations  are  first detected along the rising edge of
          the  burst, and they show evidence for frequency evolution of a
          magnitude  similar  to  that  seen  in other burst sources. The
          modulation  amplitude  and  its increase with photon energy are
          also  typical  of  burst  oscillations.  The lack of any strong
          indication  of  photospheric  radius expansion during the burst
          suggests  a  9  kpc upper limit of the source distance. We also
          find  energy  dependent  dips, establishing A1744-361 as a high
          inclination,  dipping  LMXB.  The  timescale  between  the  two
          episodes  of  observed  dips suggests an orbital period of ~ 97
          minutes.    We    have    also    detected   a   2   -   4   Hz
          quasi-periodic-oscillation  (QPO)  for the first time from this
          source.  This QPO appears consistent with ~ 1 Hz QPOs seen from
          other high-inclination systems. We searched for kilohertz QPOs,
          and  found  a  suggestive  2.3  sigma  feature at 800 Hz in one
          observation.  The  frequency,  strength, and quality factor are
          consistent  with  that  of a lower frequency kilohertz QPO, but
          the  relatively  low  significance  argues  for  caution, so we
          consider this a tentative detection requiring confirmation.

          The nucleus of 208Pb -- a system that is 18 order of magnitudes
          smaller  and 55 orders of magnitude lighter than a neutron star
          --  may be used as a miniature surrogate to establish important
          correlations  between its neutron skin and several neutron-star
          properties.  Indeed,  a  nearly  model-independent  correlation
          develops   between   the   neutron   skin   of  208Pb  and  the
          liquid-to-solid  transition density in a neutron star. Further,
          we  illustrate  how  a measurement of the neutron skin in 208Pb
          may  be  used  to  place  important  constraints on the cooling
          mechanism operating in neutron stars and may help elucidate the
          existence of quarks stars.

          Title:  Ejection  of  Hyper-Velocity  Stars  from  the Galactic
          Centre by Intermediate-Mass Black Holes
          Authors:  Holger Baumgardt, Alessia Gualandris, Simon Portegies

          Comments: 10 pages, 10 figures, MNRAS in press
          We  have  performed  N-body  simulations  of  the  formation of
          hyper-velocity  stars  (HVS) in the centre of the Milky Way due
          to  inspiralling  intermediate-mass  black  holes  (IMBHs).  We
          considered   IMBHs  of  different  masses,  all  starting  from
          circular orbits at an initial distance of 0.1 pc.
          We  find that the IMBHs sink to the centre of the Galaxy due to
          dynamical  friction,  where  they  deplete  the central cusp of
          stars.  Some  of  these  stars  become HVS and are ejected with
          velocities  sufficiently  high  to escape the Galaxy. Since the
          HVS   carry  with  them  information  about  their  origin,  in
          particular in the moment of ejection, the velocity distribution
          and  the direction in which they escape the Galaxy, detecting a
          population   of  HVS  will  provide  insight  in  the  ejection
          processes and could therefore provide indirect evidence for the
          existence of IMBHs.
          Our  simulations  show  that  HVS are generated in short bursts
          which  last  only a few Myrs until the IMBH is swallowed by the
          supermassive   black   hole  (SMBH).  HVS  are  ejected  almost
          isotropically,  which  makes  IMBH  induced  ejections  hard to
          distinguish   from  ejections  due  to  encounters  of  stellar
          binaries  with  a SMBH. After the HVS have reached the galactic
          halo,  their escape velocities correlate with the distance from
          the  Galactic  centre  in the sense that the fastest HVS can be
          found  furthest away from the centre. The velocity distribution
          of   HVS   generated  by  inspiralling  IMBHs  is  also  nearly
          independent  of  the mass of the IMBH and can be quite distinct
          from one generated by binary encounters.
          Finally,  our  simulations show that the presence of an IMBH in
          the  Galactic  centre  changes the stellar density distribution
          inside  r<0.02 pc into a core profile, which takes at least 100
          Myrs to replenish.

          We   report   high   angular   resolution,   multi-epoch  radio
          observations  of the young pulsar PSR B1800-21. Using two pairs
          of  data  sets,  each  pair  spanning  approximately a ten year
          period, we calculate the proper motion of the pulsar. We obtain
          a  proper  motion of mu_alpha=11.6 +- 1.8 mas/yr, mu_delta=14.8
          +-  2.3  mas/yr which clearly indicates a birth position at the
          extreme  edge  of the W30 supernova remnant. Although this does
          not  definitively  rule  out  an  association  of  W30  and PSR
          B1800-21, it does not support an association.

          Title:  Star  Cluster Ecology: VII The evolution of young dense
          star clusters containing primordial binaries
          Authors:  Simon Portegies Zwart (UVA), Steve McMillan (Drexel),
          Jun Makino (Tokyo)
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS
          We  study  the  first  100Myr of the evolution of isolated star
          clusters  initially  containing  144179  stars, including 13107
          (10%)  primordial  hard  binaries. Our calculations include the
          effects  of  both  stellar  and binary evolution. Gravitational
          interactions  among  the  stars  are  computed by direct N-body
          integration   using   high   precision  GRAPE-6  hardware.  The
          evolution  of  the core radii and central concentrations of our
          simulated  clusters  are  compared  with the observed sample of
          young  (about  100Myr)  star  clusters  in the large Magellanic
          cloud. Even though our simulations start with a rich population
          of primordial binaries, core collapse during the early phase of
          the   cluster   evolution  is  not  prevented.  Throughout  the
          simulations,  the fraction of binaries remains roughly constant
          (about  10%).  Due  to the effects of mass segregation the mass
          function  of  intermediate-mass  main-sequence stars becomes as
          flat as $\alpha=-1.8$ in the central part of the cluster (where
          the  initial  Salpeter mass function had $\alpha=-2.35$). About
          6--12%  of  the neutron stars were retained in our simulations;
          the  fraction  of  retained  black  holes  is  40--70%. In each
          simulation  about  three  neutron stars become members of close
          binaries  with  a  main-sequence  companion. Such a binary will
          eventually  become an x-ray binary, when the main-sequence star
          starts  to  fill  its  Roche  lobe.  Black holes are found more
          frequently in binaries; in each simulated cluster we find about
          11  potential  x-ray binaries containing a black hole. Abstract

          We present a two-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamic simulation
          of a thin, viscous, locally-isothermal corotating disk orbiting
          an  equal-mass  Newtonian binary point mass on a fixed circular
          orbit.  We  study  the  structure  of  the  disk after multiple
          viscous  times.  The  binary  maintains  a  central hole in the
          viscously-relaxed  disk  with  radius  equal to about twice the
          binary  semimajor axis. Disk surface density within the hole is
          reduced  by  orders of magnitude relative to the density in the
          disk  bulk.  The  inner  truncation  of  the disk resembles the
          clearing  of  a  gap  in  a  protoplanetary  disk. An initially
          circular   disk   becomes   elliptical   and   then  eccentric.
          Disturbances in the disk contain a component that is stationary
          in  the  rotating  frame  in  which the binary is at rest; this
          component  is  a  two-armed spiral density wave. We measure the
          distribution of the binary torque in the disk and find that the
          strongest   positive  torque  is  exerted  inside  the  central
          low-density  hole.  We  offer a tentative interpretation of the
          binary-disk  torque  coupling  in  the simulation in terms of a
          mean-motion  resonance  experienced by the low-density fluid in
          the  central  hole  in  the  disk.  The  fluid  inside the hole
          mediates  the  binary-disk  torque.  We  also  measure the time
          dependence  of  the  rate at which gas accretes across the hole
          and  find  quasiperiodic structure. We discuss implications for
          variability  and detection of active galactic nuclei containing
          a binary massive black hole.

          Title:  The  Chandra  X-ray  Spectrum  of  the 10.6 s Pulsar in
          Westerlund 1: Testing the Magnetar Hypothesis
          Authors: S.L. Skinner, R. Perna, S.A. Zhekov
          Comments: 14 pages, 5 figures; to appear in ApJ
          Two    sensitive    Chandra    X-ray    observations   of   the
          heavily-reddened galactic starburst cluster Westerlund 1 in May
          and  June  2005 detected a previously unknown X-ray pulsar (CXO
          J164710.20-455217).  Its slow 10.6 s pulsations, moderate X-ray
          temperature  kT  $\approx$  0.5  keV,  and  apparent  lack of a
          massive  companion  tentatively suggest that it is an Anomalous
          X-ray  Pulsar  (AXP).  An  isothermal blackbody model yields an
          acceptable  spectral fit but the inferred source radius is much
          less  than  that of a neutron star, a result that has also been
          found  for  other  AXPs. We analyze the X-ray spectra with more
          complex  models  including a model that assumes the pulsar is a
          strongly  magnetized  neutron  star (``magnetar'') with a light
          element   atmosphere.  We  conclude  that  the  observed  X-ray
          emission cannot be explained as global surface emission arising
          from  the  surface  of  a cooling neutron star or magnetar. The
          emission  likely arises in one or more localized regions (``hot

          Title:  The  Chandra  X-ray  Spectrum  of  the 10.6 s Pulsar in
          Westerlund 1: Testing the Magnetar Hypothesis
          Authors: S.L. Skinner, R. Perna, S.A. Zhekov
          Comments: 14 pages, 5 figures; to appear in ApJ
          Two    sensitive    Chandra    X-ray    observations   of   the
          heavily-reddened galactic starburst cluster Westerlund 1 in May
          and  June  2005 detected a previously unknown X-ray pulsar (CXO
          J164710.20-455217).  Its slow 10.6 s pulsations, moderate X-ray
          temperature  kT  $\approx$  0.5  keV,  and  apparent  lack of a
          massive  companion  tentatively suggest that it is an Anomalous
          X-ray  Pulsar  (AXP).  An  isothermal blackbody model yields an
          acceptable  spectral fit but the inferred source radius is much
          less  than  that of a neutron star, a result that has also been
          found  for  other  AXPs. We analyze the X-ray spectra with more
          complex  models  including a model that assumes the pulsar is a
          strongly  magnetized  neutron  star (``magnetar'') with a light
          element   atmosphere.  We  conclude  that  the  observed  X-ray
          emission cannot be explained as global surface emission arising
          from  the  surface  of  a cooling neutron star or magnetar. The
          emission  likely arises in one or more localized regions (``hot
          spots'')  covering  a small fraction of the surface. We discuss
          these new results in the context of both accretion and magnetar
          interpretations for the X-ray emission.

          Decay
          Authors: J.A. Pons, B. Link, J.A. Miralles, U. Geppert
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
          We  show  the  existence of a strong trend between neutron star
          surface  temperature  and the dipolar component of the magnetic
          field extending through four orders of field magnitude, a range
          that includes magnetars, X-ray pulsars, and many ordinary radio
          pulsars.  We show that this trend can be explained by the ohmic
          decay of currents in the crust over a time scale of $\sim 10^6$
          yr. We predict the minimum temperature that a neutron star with
          a given magnetic field can reach.

          We  studied  and compared the long term average hard X-ray (>20
          keV)  spectra  of  a  sample  of  twelve  bright low-mass X-ray
          binaries  hosting a neutron star (NS). Our sample comprises the
          six well studied Galactic Z sources and six Atoll sources, four
          of  which  are bright ("GX") bulge sources while two are weaker
          ones  in the 2-10 keV range (H 1750-440 and H 1608-55). For all
          the  sources  of  our sample, we analysed available public data
          and  extracted  average spectra from the IBIS/ISGRI detector on
          board  INTEGRAL. The two low-dim Atoll spectra are dominated by
          photons  upscattered  presumably  due  to dynamical and thermal
          Comptonization  in an optically thin, hot plasma. For the first
          time,  we extend the detection of H 1750-440 up to 150 keV. The
          Z and bright "GX" Atoll source spectra are very similar and are
          dominated  by  Comptonized  blackbody radiation of seed photons
          presumably  coming  from the accretion disc and NS surface. The
          seed  photons  radiation  is Comptonized in the optically thick
          cloud  with  plasma  temperature in the range of 2.5-3 keV. Six
          sources  show  a  hard  tail in their average spectrum: Cyg X-2
          (Z),  GX  340+0 (Z), GX 17+2 (Z), GX 5-1 (Z), Sco X-1(Z) and GX
          13+1 (Atoll). This is the first detection of a hard tail in the
          X-ray  spectrum  of  the  peculiar  GX 13+1 that we discover to
          behave  like  a  Z source not only in its variability and radio
          properties,  but  also  from  the spectral point of view. Using
          radio  data  from  the literature we find, in all Z sources and
          bright  "GX"  Atolls, a systematic positive correlation between
          the X-ray hard tail (40-100 keV) and the radio luminosity. This
          suggests  that  hard  tails and energetic electrons causing the
          radio  emission  may  have  the  same  origin,  most likely the
          Compton cloud located inside the NS magnetosphere.

          Authors: Pawel Lachowicz, Bozena Czerny, Marek A. Abramowicz
          Comments: 10 pages, 11 figures (9 in color), submitted to MNRAS
          Following  our  previous  work of Lachowicz & Czerny (2005), we
          explore  further  the  application  of  the  continuous wavelet
          transform  to  X-ray  astronomical  signals.  Using  the public
          archive  of  the XMM-Newton satellite, we analyze all available
          EPIC-pn  observations for nearby Seyfert 1 galaxies MCG-6-30-15
          and  NGC  4051.  We  confine  our  analysis  to  0.002-0.007 Hz
          frequency  band in which, on the way of theoretically motivated
          premises,  some quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are expected
          to  be  found.  We  find  that  indeed  wavelet power histogram
          analysis  reveals  such  QPOs  centered  at  two frequencies of
          ~2.5E-3  Hz  and  4-6E-3  Hz,  respectively. We show that these
          quasi-periodic  features  can  be disentangled from the Poisson
          noise  contamination  level  what is hardly to achieve with the
          standard  Fourier analysis. Interestingly, we find some of them
          to  be  in  2:1  or  3:2  ratio.  If  real,  our finding may be
          considered  as a link between QPOs observed in AGN and kHz QPOs
          seen in X-ray binary systems.

          The  nonextensivity  in a non-isothermal plasma system with the
          Coulombian  long-range interactions is studied in the framework
          of Tsallis statistics. We present for first time a mathematical
          expression  of  the  nonextensive  parameter  q  based  on  the
          mathematical  theory  about  the generalized Boltzmann equation
          and the q-H theorem and the Maxwellian q-velocity distribution.
          We  obtain  a  new  physical  explanation  for q concerning the
          nature  of non-isothermal configurations in plasma systems with
          Coulombian   long-range   interactions.  We  also  provide  one
          illustration  for Almeida theorem (Physica A 300(2001)424) from
          the  kinetic  analyses  of  plasma  systems,  which  means that
          Tsallis  statistics  might  be  a  suitable  statistics for the
          description  of  a  nonequilibrium  system  with  a temperature
          gradient in it.

          The  properties of the nonextensive parameter q and the Tsallis
          distribution   for  self-gravitating  systems  are  studied.  A
          mathematical   expression   of   q  is  deduced  based  on  the
          generalized   Boltzmann  equation,  the  q-H  theorem  and  the
          generalized Maxwellian q-velocity distribution in the framework
          of  Tsallis  statistics. We obtain a clear understanding of the
          physics   of   q  different  from  unity  with  regard  to  the
          temperature  gradient  and  the  gravitational potential of the
          self-gravitating  systems.  It  is  suggested  that the Tsallis
          statistics  could  be  statistics  suitable  for describing the
          nonequilibrium  systems  with inhomogeneous temperature and the
          long-range interactions.

          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          To check the validity of the theory of nonextensive statistical
          mechanics,  we have investigated the nonextensive degree of the
          solar interior and have tried to find the experimental evidence
          by  helioseismological  measurements  that  q is different from
          unity.  We are able to derive a parameter for providing a lower
          limit  to  the  nonextensive  degree inside the sun that can be
          uniquely  determined  by  the  solar  sound  speeds measured by
          helioseismology.  After  calculating the parameter by using the
          solar sound speeds, we get the lower limit of(1-q)not less than
          0.1902  for  all  solar radii between 0.15R(sun) and 0.95R(sun)
          and   (1-q)approximately  equal  to  0.4  for  the  out  layers
          extending  from  0.75R(sun)to  0.95R(sun).Thus, the result that
          the  nonextensive  parameter  q is significantly different from
          unity  has  received the support by the experiment measurements
          for the solar sound speeds in the helioseismology.

          theory   for   the  systems  with  self-gravitating  long-range
          interactions
          Authors: Du Jiulin
          Comments: 20 pages,40 references
          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          On  the  basis of q-kinetic theory based on Tsallis entropy, we
          propose  an  approach  to  derive  the  nonextensive  power law
          distributions  for  the many-body systems with self-gravitating
          long-range    interactions.    The   nonextensive   power   law
          distribution  is shown to represent the long-range interactions
          and  the  non-local  correlations  within  the self-gravitating
          system  with  inhomogeneous velocity dispersion when being at a
          nonequilibrium   stationary   state.   An   expression  of  the
          corresponding  nonextensive  parameter q is uniquely determined
          from  the  microscopic  dynamical  equation  and  the  physical
          interpretation  of q different from unity is clearly presented.
          We establish a relation between the nonextensive parameter q to
          deviate  from unity and the measurable quantities: the velocity
          dispersion   gradient   and  the  mass  density.  We  derive  a
          second-order  nonlinear  differential  equation  for the radial
          density  dependence  of  the system with inhomogeneous velocity
          dispersion  and correctly connect with the density profiles for
          dark  matter.  We also study the cases for the self-gravitating
          collisionless and gaseous dynamical system, respectively.

          This  chapter  provides  a  review  of  microscopic theories of

          is  given  to  the  mean-field BCS theory and its extensions to
          include  effects  of polarization of the medium and retardation
          of  the  interactions.  Superfluidity  in  nuclear systems that
          exhibit  isospin  asymmetry  is studied. We further address the
          crossover   from  the  weak-coupling  BCS  description  to  the
          strong-coupling  BEC  limit in dilute nuclear systems. Finally,
          within  the  observational  context  of rotational anomalies of
          pulsars,  we  discuss  models of the vortex state in superfluid
          neutron stars and of the mutual friction between superfluid and
          normal   components,  along  with  the  possibility  of  type-I
          superconductivity of the proton subsystem.

          Comments: Accepted to MNRAS
          We  present multi-epoch observations of the radio nebula around
          the  neutron star X-ray binary Circinus X-1 made at 1.4 and 2.5
          GHz  with the Australia Telescope Compact Array between October
          2000  and September 2004. The nebula can be seen as a result of
          the  interaction  between  the  jet  from  the  system  and the
          interstellar  medium  and  it  is  likely  that we are actually
          looking  toward  the  central  X-ray  binary system through the
          jet-powered  radio  lobe. The study of the nebula thus offers a
          unique  opportunity  to  estimate  for  the  first  time  using
          calorimetry  the  energetics  of  a  jet from an object clearly
          identified  as  a  neutron star. An extensive discussion on the
          energetics  of  the  complex  is presented: a first approach is
          based  on  the  minimum  energy  estimation, while a second one
          employs  a  self-similar  model  of the interaction between the
          jets and the surrounding medium. The results suggest an age for
          the nebula of \leq 10^5 years and a corresponding time-averaged
          jet  power  \geq  10^{35}  erg  s^{-1}. During periodic flaring
          episodes,  the  instantaneous  jet  power  may  reach values of
          similar magnitude to the X-ray luminosity.

          Model  atmosphere  fits  to  high-resolution optical spectra of
          Wray 977 confirm the B hypergiant classification of the massive
          companion to the X-ray pulsar GX301-2. The models give a radius
          of  62  Rsun,  an  effective  temperature  of  18,100  K  and a
          luminosity  of  5  x 10^^5 Lsun. The deduced mass-loss rate and
          terminal  velocity  of  the stellar wind are 10^^-5 Msun/yr and
          305  km/s,  respectively.  The  interstellar  Na I D absorption
          indicates   that   Wray   977   is  located  behind  the  first
          intersection with the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm (1-2.5 kpc)
          and  probably  belongs  to  the stellar population of the Norma
          spiral  arm at a distance of 3-4 kpc. The spectra obtained with
          UVES  on  the  Very Large Telescope (VLT) cover a full orbit of
          the  system, including periastron passage, from which we derive
          the  radial-velocity  curve  of  the B hypergiant. The measured
          radial-velocity amplitude is 10 +/-3 km/s yielding a mass ratio
          q = 0.046 +/- 0.014. The absence of an X-ray eclipse results in
          a  lower  limit  to  the  mass of Wray 977 of 39 Msun. An upper
          limit of 53 Msun is derived for the mass of Wray 977 adopting a
          maximum  neutron  star  mass of 2.5 Msun. The ``spectroscopic''
          mass  of  Wray 977 is 43 +/- 10 Msun, consistent with the range
          in  mass derived from the binarity constraints. The mass of the
          neutron  star  is  1.85  +/-  0.6 Msun. Time series of spectral
          lines formed in the dense stellar wind indicate the presence of
          a  gas  stream  trailing  the  neutron  star  in its orbit. The
          long-term  behaviour  of  the H alpha equivalent width exhibits
          strong variations in wind strength; the sampling of the data is
          insufficient to conclude whether a relation exists between wind
          mass-loss rate and pulsar spin period.

          Title:  Search  for  radio  pulsations  in four Anomalous X-ray
          Pulsars and discovery of two new pulsars

          We  report  on  observations  of  four southern Anomalous X-ray
          Pulsars,  (1RXS  J170849.0-400910,  1E 1048.1-5937, 1E 1841-045
          and  AX J1845-0258), obtained at 1.4 GHz using the Parkes radio
          telescope.  Radio  pulsations  from  these  sources  have  been
          searched (i) by directly folding the time series at a number of
          trial  periods  centered on the value of the spin rate obtained
          from the X-ray observations; (ii) by performing a blind search;
          (iii)  using  a code sensitive to single dedispersed pulses, in
          the  aim  to  detect  signals  similar to those of the recently
          discovered  Rotating  RAdio  Transients.  No evidence for radio
          pulsations  with an upper limit of ~0.1 mJy for any of the four
          targets   has   been   found.  The  blind  search  led  to  the
          serendipitous  discovery  of  two  new pulsars, rotating with a
          spin  period  of  about 0.7 s and of 92 ms respectively, and to
          the  further  detection  of 18 known pulsars, two of which were
          also detected in the single-pulse search.

          publication in MNRAS
          [ABRIDGED]  We present the discovery and follow-up observations
          of  142  pulsars  found  in  the  Parkes 20-cm multibeam pulsar
          survey  of  the Galactic plane. These new discoveries bring the
          total number of pulsars found by the survey to 742. In addition
          to tabulating spin and astrometric parameters, along with pulse
          width   and   flux  density  information,  we  present  orbital
          characteristics  for  13  binary pulsars which form part of the
          new  sample. Combining these results from another recent Parkes
          multibeam  survey  at high Galactic latitudes, we have a sample
          of   1008   normal   pulsars  which  we  use  to  carry  out  a
          determination of their Galactic distribution and birth rate. We
          infer a total Galactic population of 30000 +/- 1100 potentially
          detectable  pulsars  (i.e.  those  beaming  towards  us) having
          1.4-GHz  luminosities above 0.1 mJy kpc squared. Using a pulsar
          current  analysis,  we derive the birth rate of this population
          to  be 1.4 +/- 0.2 pulsars per century. An important conclusion
          from  our  work is that the inferred radial density function of
          pulsars  depends  strongly  on the assumed distribution of free
          electrons  in  the  Galaxy. As a result, any analyses using the
          most  recent  electron model of Cordes & Lazio predict a dearth
          of  pulsars  in  the  inner Galaxy. We show that this model can
          also  bias the inferred pulsar scale height with respect to the
          Galactic   plane.  Combining  our  results  with  other  Parkes
          multibeam surveys we find that the population is best described
          by an exponential distribution with a scale height of 330 pc.

          Two-flavor quark matter
          Authors: Basil A. Sa'd, Igor A. Shovkovy, Dirk H. Rischke
          Comments: 9 pages, 6 figures
          We  consider the contribution of the Urca-type processes to the
          bulk viscosity of several spin-one color-superconducting phases
          of  dense  two-flavor quark matter. In the so-called transverse
          phases  which  are  suggested  to be energetically favorable at
          asymptotic  densities,  the  presence of ungapped quasiparticle
          modes  prevents  that  spin-one  color  superconductivity has a
          large  effect on the bulk viscosity. When all modes are gapped,
          as  for  one  particular color-spin-locked phase, the effect on
          the  viscosity  can  be  quite  large, which may have important
          phenomenological implications.

          The  binary X-ray pulsar A0535+262 was observed with the Suzaku
          X-ray  observatory,  on 2005 September 14 for a net exposure of
          22  ksec.  The  source  was  in  a  declining  phase of a minor
          outburst,  exhibiting 3--50 keV luminosity of about $3.7 \times
          10^{35}$  ergs  s$^{-1}$  at  an  assumed distance of 2 kpc. In
          spite  of  the  very low source intensity (about 30 mCrab at 20
          keV),  its  electron  cyclotron  resonance was detected clearly
          with  the Suzaku Hard X-ray Detector, in absorption at about 45
          keV.  The  resonance energy is found to be essentially the same
          as  those  measured  when  the  source  is almost two orders of
          magnitude  more  luminous.  These results are compared with the
          luminosity-dependent changes in the cyclotron resonance energy,
          observed from 4U 0115+63 and X 0331+53.

          Authors: R. T. Edwards, G. B. Hobbs, R. N. Manchester
          Comments:  30  pages,  3  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          Tempo2  is  a  new  software package for the analysis of pulsar
          pulse times of arrival. In this paper we describe in detail the
          timing  model  used  by  tempo2, and discuss limitations on the
          attainable  precision.  In  addition to the intrinsic slow-down
          behaviour  of  the pulsar, tempo2 accounts for the effects of a
          binary  orbital  motion,  the  secular  motion of the pulsar or
          binary  system,  interstellar,  Solar  system  and  ionospheric
          dispersion,   observatory  motion  (including  Earth  rotation,
          precession,   nutation,   polar  motion  and  orbital  motion),
          tropospheric propagation delay, and gravitational time dilation
          due  to  binary  companions and Solar system bodies. We believe
          the  timing model is accurate in its description of predictable
          systematic timing effects to better than one nanosecond, except
          in  the  case  of  relativistic  binary  systems  where further
          theoretical   development  is  needed.  The  largest  remaining
          sources  of potential error are measurement error, interstellar
          scattering,   Solar   system  ephemeris  errors,  atomic  clock
          instability and gravitational waves.

          Conditions and Implications
          Authors: Chen Wang; Dong Lai; JinLin Han
          Comments:  17  pages,  8  figures. Submitted to ApJ on July 30,
          2006
          Recent   observations   of   pulsar   wind  nebulae  and  radio
          polarization  profiles  revealed  a  tendency  of the alignment
          between  the  spin and velocity directions in neutron stars. We
          study  the condition for spin-kick alignment using a toy model,
          in    which   the   kick   consists   of   many   off-centered,
          randomly-oriented  thrusts.  Both analytical considerations and
          numerical  simulations indicate that spin-kick alignment cannot
          be  easily  achieved if the proto-neutron star does not possess
          some initial angular momentum. To obtain the observed spin-kick
          misalignment angle distribution, the initial spin period of the
          neutron   star   must  be  smaller  than  the  kick  timescale.
          Typically,  an initial period of a hundred milliseconds or less
          is required.

          Comments: 20 pages
          We  report on a high-spatial-resolution survey for binary stars
          in  the periphery of the Orion Nebula Cluster, at 5 - 15 arcmin
          (0.65  -  2  pc) from the cluster center. We observed 228 stars
          with  adaptive  optics  systems, in order to find companions at
          separations of 0.13" - 1.12" (60 - 500 AU), and detected 13 new
          binaries.  Combined  with the results of Petr (1998), we have a
          sample of 275 objects, about half of which have masses from the
          literature  and  high  probabilities  to be cluster members. We
          used  an  improved  method to derive the completeness limits of
          the  observations, which takes into account the elongated point
          spread function of stars at relatively large distances from the
          adaptive  optics  guide  star.  The  multiplicity of stars with
          masses  >2  M_sun is found to be significantly larger than that
          of  low-mass  stars.  The  companion star frequency of low-mass
          stars  is  comparable  to  that of main-sequence M-dwarfs, less
          than  half that of solar-type main-sequence stars, and 3.5 to 5
          times  lower  than  in the Taurus-Auriga and Scorpius-Centaurus
          star-forming  regions. We find the binary frequency of low-mass
          stars  in  the  periphery of the cluster to be the same or only
          slightly  higher  than for stars in the cluster core (<3 arcmin
          from theta1C Ori). This is in contrast to the prediction of the
          theory  that  the low binary frequency in the cluster is caused
          by  the  disruption  of binaries due to dynamical interactions.
          There  are  two  ways  out  of this dilemma: Either the initial
          binary  frequency in the Orion Nebula Cluster was lower than in
          Taurus-Auriga,  or the Orion Nebula Cluster was originally much
          denser and dynamically more active.

          The  general  principles  needed  to  compute  the  effect of a
          stationary   gravitational   field   on   the   quasistationary
          electromagnetic    phenomena    in    normal   conductors   and
          superconductors  are formulated from general relativistic point
          of view. Generalization of the skin effect, that is the general
          relativistic  modification  of  the  penetration  depth (of the
          time-dependent  magnetic  field  in  the  conductor) due to its
          relativistic  coupling  to the gravitational field is obtained.
          The  effect  of  the gravitational field on the penetration and
          coherence  depths  in  superconductors  is  also studied. As an
          illustration of the foregoing general results, we discuss their
          application  to  superconducting  systems  in the outer core of
          neutron    stars.   The   relevance   of   these   effects   to
          electrodynamics of magnetized neutron stars has been shown.

          Comments: ApJ, accepted for publication. 17 pages, 11 figures
          We  compute  the  type  Ia, Ib/c and II supernova (SN) rates as
          functions   of  the  cosmic  time  for  galaxies  of  different
          morphological  types.  We use four different chemical evolution
          models,  each  one  reproducing  the  features  of a particular
          morphological  type:  E/S0,  S0a/b,  Sbc/d and Irr galaxies. We
          essentially describe the Hubble sequence by means of decreasing
          efficiency  of  star formation and increasing infall timescale.
          These  models  are  used to study the evolution of the SN rates
          per  unit  luminosity  and per unit mass as functions of cosmic
          time  and as functions of the Hubble type. Our results indicate
          that:  (i)  the  observed  increase  of  the  SN  rate per unit
          luminosity  and  unit  mass  from early to late galaxy types is
          accounted  for by our models. Our explanation of this effect is
          related  to  the  fact  that  the  latest Hubble types have the
          highest  star  formation rate per unit mass; (ii) By adopting a
          Scalo  (1986)  initial  mass  function in spiral disks, we find
          that  massive  single  stars  ending  their lives as Wolf-Rayet
          objects  are  not  sufficient  to account for the observed type
          Ib/c  SN rate per unit mass. Less massive stars in close binary
          systems  can  give  instead  a  significant contribution to the
          local  Ib/c SN rates. On the other hand, with the assumption of
          a  Salpeter  (1955) IMF for all galaxy types, single massive WR
          stars  are  sufficient to account for the observed type Ib/c SN
          rate.  (iii) Our models allow us to reproduce the observed type
          Ia SN rate density up to redshift z~1. We predict an increasing
          type  Ia  SN  rate  density  with  redshift, reaching a peak at
          redshift  z  >=  3,  because  of  the  contribution  of massive
          spheroids.

          Title: Hall Magnetohydrodynamics of weakly-ionized plasma
          Authors: B. P. Pandey, Mark Wardle
          Comments: 4 page, submitted to Physical Review Letters
          We  show that the Hall scale in a weakly ionized plasma depends
          on  the  fractional  ionization  of  the  medium  and, Hall MHD
          description   becomes   important   whenever   the  ion-neutral
          collision   frequency   is   comparable   to  the  ion-gyration
          frequency,  or,  the  ion-neutral collisional mean free path is
          smaller   than  the  ion  gyro-radius.  Wave  properties  of  a
          weakly-ionized plasma also depends on the fractional ionization
          and  plasma  Hall  parameters,  and  whistler  mode is the most
          dominant  mode in such a medium. Thus Hall MHD description will
          be  important  in  astrophysical  disks, dark molecular clouds,
          neutron star crusts, and, solar and planetary atmosphere.

          Title:   The   globular  cluster  mass/low  mass  X-ray  binary
          correlation:implications  for  kick velocity distributions from
          supernovae
          Authors:  M.  Smits  (Amsterdam), T.J. Maccarone (Southampton &
          Amsterdam), A. Kundu, S.E. Zepf (Michigan State)
          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted to A&A
          Optical  and X-ray studies of six nearby galaxies show that the
          probability  a  globular  cluster  will  be  an X-ray source is
          consistent  with  being  linearly  proportional to its mass. We
          show  that this result is consistent with some recent estimates
          of  the  velocity kick distributions for isolated radio pulsars
          --  those which are the sum of two Maxwellians, with the slower
          distribution at about 100 km/sec -- so long as a large fraction
          of  the  retained  binaries  are  in  binary systems with other
          massive stars. We confirm that over a large sample of galaxies,
          metallicity  is  clearly  a  factor  in  determining  whether a
          globular  cluster will contain an X-ray binary, and we estimate
          the  transformations  between color and metallicity for a large
          number  of  optical  filter combinations. We also show that the
          core  interaction  rate is roughly linearly proportional to the
          stellar  mass  of a globular cluster for the Milky Way when one
          bins the clusters by mass.

          Title: Eclipsing Binary Stars in Open Clusters
          Authors: John Southworth, J V Clausen
          Comments:  6  pages,  4  figures, proceedings of the conference
          Close  Binaries in the 21st Century (Syros, Greece, June 2005),
          to appear in Ap+SS
          The  study  of detached eclipsing binaries in open clusters can
          provide  stringent  tests  of  theoretical stellar evolutionary
          models,  which  must  simultaneously fit the masses, radii, and
          luminosities   of   the   eclipsing  stars  and  the  radiative
          properties of every other star in the cluster. We review recent
          progress  in such studies and discuss two unusually interesting
          objects  currently  under  analysis. GV Carinae is an A0m + A8m
          binary  in  the  Southern  open  cluster  NGC 3532; its eclipse
          depths   have  changed  by  0.1  mag  between  1990  and  2001,
          suggesting  that  its  orbit is being perturbed by a relatively
          close third body. DW Carinae is a high-mass unevolved B1V + B1V
          binary  in  the  very  young  open  cluster  Collinder 228, and
          displays  double-peaked  emission  in  the centre of the Halpha
          line  which  is  characteristic  of  Be  stars.  We conclude by
          pointing  out  that  the great promise of eclipsing binaries in
          open  clusters can only be satisfied when both the binaries and
          their  parent  clusters are well-observed, a situation which is
          less common than we would like.

          Title: Accurate stellar masses in the multiple system T Tau

          Comments:  5  pages,  1  figure,  accepted  for  publication in
          Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters
          The  goal of this study is to obtain accurate estimates for the
          individual  masses of the components of the tight binary system
          T  Tau S in order to settle the ongoing debate on the nature of
          T  Tau Sa, a so-called infrared companion. We take advantage of
          the  fact  that  T Tau S belongs to a triple system composed of
          two hierarchical orbits to simultaneously analyze the motion of
          T  Tau Sb in the rest frames of T Tau Sa and T Tau N. With this
          method,  it  is possible to pinpoint the location of the center
          of mass of T Tau S and, thereby, to determine individual masses
          for  T  Tau  Sa and T Tau Sb with no prior assumption about the
          mass/flux  ratio  of the system. This improvement over previous
          studies  of  the  system  results in much better constraints on
          orbital  parameters.  We  find individual masses of 2.73+/-0.31
          Msun  for  T  Tau  Sa  and of 0.61+/-0.17 Msun for T Tau Sb (in
          agreement  with  its  early-M  spectral  type),  including  the
          uncertainty  on the distance to the system. These are among the
          most  precise  estimates  of  the mass of any Pre-Main Sequence
          star,  a  remarkable  result  since this is the first system in
          which individual masses of T Tauri stars can be determined from
          astrometry  only. This model-independent analysis confirms that
          T  Tau Sa is an intermediate-mass star, presumably a very young
          Herbig Ae star, that may possess an almost edge-on disk.

          Title: Hybrid protoneutron stars with the MIT bag model
          Authors: O. E. Nicotra, M. Baldo, G. F. Burgio, H.-J. Schulze
          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures submitted to Phys. Rev. D
          We  study  the hadron-quark phase transition in the interior of
          protoneutron   stars.   For  the  hadronic  sector,  we  use  a
          microscopic  equation  of state involving nucleons and hyperons
          derived within the finite-temperature Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone
          many-body   theory,  with  realistic  two-body  and  three-body
          forces.  For the description of quark matter, we employ the MIT
          bag  model  both  with  a  constant and a density-dependent bag
          parameter.  We  calculate  the structure of protostars with the
          equation  of  state  comprising  both  phases  and find maximum
          masses   below   1.6  solar  masses.  Metastable  heavy  hybrid
          protostars are not found.

          Rankin
          Comments: 17 pages, 18 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          We  present  a detailed study of the single radio pulses of PSR
          B0656+14,  a  pulsar also known to be a strong pulsed source of
          high-energy   emission.   Despite   the  extensive  studies  at
          high-energy  wavelengths,  there is little or no published work
          on its single-pulse behaviour in the radio band. In this report
          we  rectify  this omission. We have found that the shape of the
          pulse  profile  of  PSR  B0656+14  requires  an  unusually long
          timescale to achieve stability (over 25,000 pulses at 327 MHz).
          This  instability  is  caused  by very bright and narrow pulses
          with  widths  and luminosities comparable to those observed for
          the  RRATs.  Many pulses are bright enough to qualify as "giant
          pulses", but are broader than those usually meant by this term.
          At  327  MHz  the  brightest pulse was about 116 times brighter
          than  the average pulse. Although the most powerful pulses peak
          near the centre of the profile, occasional sudden strong pulses
          are  also found on the extreme leading edge of the profile. One
          of them has a peak flux of about 2000 times the average flux at
          that   pulse   longitude.   No   "break"  in  the  pulse-energy
          distributions  is  observed, but nevertheless there is evidence
          of  two  separate  populations  of pulses: bright pulses have a
          narrow  "spiky"  appearance  consisting of short quasi-periodic
          bursts  of  emission  with  microstructure,  in contrast to the
          underlying  weaker  broad pulses. Furthermore, the spiky pulses
          tend to appear in clusters which arise and dissipate over about
          10  periods.  We  demonstrate  that the spiky emission builds a
          narrow and peaked profile, whereas the weak emission produces a
          broad  hump,  which is largely responsible for the shoulders in
          the total emission profiles at both high and low frequencies.

          In  the  last  years, optical studies of Isolated Neutron Stars
          (INSs)  have  expanded from the more classical rotation-powered
          ones  to  other  categories,  like  the Anomalous X-ray Pulsars
          (AXPs)  and  the Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs), which make up
          the  class  of  the  magnetars, the radio-quiet INSs with X-ray
          thermal  emission  and,  more  recently,  the enigmatic Compact
          Central  Objects  (CCOs)  in  supernova remnants. Apart from 10
          rotation-powered  pulsars,  so far optical/IR counterparts have
          been  found  for  5  magnetars  and for 4 INSs. In this work we
          present  some of the latest observational results obtained from
          optical/IR observations of different types of INSs.

          The  stability  of  neutron stars (NS) with a quark matter core
          has  been  studied  within the Nambu - Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model
          with  a  momentum  cut-off  which  depends on the density. This
          procedure,  which  improves  the  agreement between QCD and NJL
          model  at  large density, modifies the standard NJL equation of
          state,  and  then  it is potentially relevant for the stability
          analysis.  We show that also with the density dependent cut-off
          procedure,  the  NS  instability  still  persists, and that the
          vacuum  pressure,  as  a  signal  of  quark  confinement, has a
          fundamental  role  for  the  NS stability. In this respect, our
          conclusions  point to a relationship between confinement and NS
          stability.

          Authors: O. E. Nicotra
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table
          To  investigate  the stability of the protoneutron stars in its
          early   evolution,  the  minimum  gravitational  mass  plays  a
          fundamental   role.  This  quantity  depends  upon  temperature
          profile   assumed.  We  study  within  a  static  approach  the
          stability  of  a protoneutron star. In particular we focus on a
          suitable    temperature    profile   suggested   by   dynamical
          calculations.   We  indeed  consider  a  protoneutron  star  as
          composed by an isothermal core and an isentropic outer part. To
          describe  physical  properties  of  the  interior  we  employ a
          microscopically  derived  equation of state for nuclear matter.
          For  the  outer  part we employ the Lattimer-Swesty equation of
          state. The global structure is studied. The assumed temperature
          profile  turns  out to give a range of stability which supports
          temperature  values  in  line  with those coming from dynamical
          calculations.  The  maximum  mass instead depends only upon the
          equation of state employed.

          We   explore   semi-complete  self-similar  solutions  for  the
          polytropic  gas dynamics involving self-gravity under spherical
          symmetry,  examine  behaviours of the sonic critical curve, and
          present   new   asymptotic  collapse  solutions  that  describe
          `quasi-static'  asymptotic  behaviours at small radii and large
          times.  These  new `quasi-static' solutions with divergent mass
          density    approaching   the   core   can   have   self-similar
          oscillations.  Earlier  known solutions are summarized. Various
          semi-complete   self-similar  solutions  involving  such  novel
          asymptotic  solutions are constructed, either with or without a
          shock.  In  contexts  of  stellar  core  collapse and supernova
          explosion,  a  hydrodynamic  model of a rebound shock initiated
          around the stellar degenerate core of a massive progenitor star
          is  presented. With this dynamic model framework, we attempt to
          relate  progenitor  stars and the corresponding remnant compact
          stars: neutron stars, black holes, and white dwarfs.

          We  present new Near-Infrared (J,K) magnitudes for 114 RR Lyrae
          stars  in  the  globular  cluster Omega Cen (NGC 5139) which we
          combine  with data from the literature to construct a sample of
          180  RR  Lyrae  stars  with J and K mean magnitudes on a common
          photometric  system.  This is presently the largest such sample
          in  any stellar system. We also present updated predictions for
          J,K-band  Period-Luminosity  relations for both fundamental and
          first-overtone  RR  Lyrae  stars, based on synthetic horizontal
          branch  models  with  metal  abundance ranging from Z=0.0001 to
          Z=0.004.  By adopting for the Omega Cen variables with measured
          metal  abundances an alpha-element enhancement of a factor of 3
          (about  0.5  dex)  with respect to iron we find a true distance
          modulus  of 13.70 (with a random error of 0.06 and a systematic
          error  of  0.06),  corresponding  to a distance d=5.5 Kpc (with
          both  random  and  systematic  errors  equal  to 0.03 Kpc). Our
          estimate  is  in excellent agreement with the distance inferred
          for  the  eclipsing  binary OGLEGC-17, but differ significantly
          from  the  recent  distance estimates based on cluster dynamics

          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Almost  all  pulsars  with  anomalous  positive $\ddot \Omega $
          measurements (corresponding to anomalous braking indices in the
          range 5$<n<$100), including all the pulsars with observed large
          glitches  ($\Delta\Omega/\Omega$ $>$ 10$^{-7}$) as well as post
          glitch  or  interglitch  $\ddot  \Omega$  measurements obey the
          scaling between $\ddot \Omega$ and glitch parameters originally
          noted in the Vela pulsar. Negative second derivative values can
          be understood in terms of glitches that were missed or remained
          unresolved.   We   discuss   the  glitch  rates  and  a  priori
          probabilities   of   positive   and  negative  braking  indices
          according  to  the  model  developed  for the Vela pulsar. This
          behavior  supports  the  universal  occurrence  of  a nonlinear
          dynamical  coupling  between  the  neutron  star  crust  and an
          interior  superfluid  component.  The  implied  lower  limit to
          dynamical  energy  dissipation  in a neutron star with spindown
          rate  $\dot \Omega$ is $\dot E_{diss}> 1.7 \times 10 ^{-6} \dot
          E_{rot}$.  Thermal luminosities and surface temperatures due to
          dynamical  energy  dissipation  are  estimated  for old neutron
          stars  which  are  spinning  down  as rotating magnetic dipoles
          beyond the pulsar death line.

          Goldreich-Julian  Current  with  Ion  Emission from the Neutron
          Star Surface
          Authors: Kouichi Hirotani
          Comments: 36 pages, 14 figures, accepted to Astroph. J
          We  investigate the self-consistent electrodynamic structure of
          a  particle accelerator in the Crab pulsar magnetosphere on the
          two-dimensional  poloidal  plane,  solving the Poisson equation
          for  the  electrostatic  potential  together with the Boltzmann
          equations  for  electrons,  positrons  and  gamma-rays.  If the
          trans-field  thickness  of the gap is thin, the created current
          density  becomes  sub-Goldreich-Julian,  giving the traditional
          outer-gap solution but with negligible gamma-ray luminosity. As
          the  thickness  increases,  the  created  current  increases to
          become  super-Goldreich-Julian,  giving a new gap solution with
          substantially screened acceleration electric field in the inner
          part.  In  this  case, the gap extends towards the neutron star
          with  a small-amplitude positive acceleration field, extracting
          ions  from  the stellar surface as a space-charge-limited flow.
          The  acceleration  field  is  highly  unscreened  in  the outer
          magnetosphere, resulting in a gamma-ray spectral shape which is
          consistent with the observations.

          Title:  On  the  Physics  of  Type  I X-ray Bursts on Accreting
          Neutron Stars at High Accretion Rates
          Authors: Randall L. Cooper, Ramesh Narayan (Harvard/CfA)
          Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure, accepted by ApJL
          We  investigate  the  effect  of  the  hot  CNO  cycle breakout
          reaction 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne on the occurrence of type I X-ray
          bursts  on accreting neutron stars. For f_rp <~ 0.1, where f_rp
          is   a   dimensionless   factor   by   which  we  multiply  the
          15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne reaction rate of Caughlan & Fowler (1988),
          our  model predicts that bursts should occur only for accretion
          rates  below  a  critical  value of approximately 0.3 times the
          Eddington  limit.  This  agrees  with  observations. For larger
          values  of  f_rp,  including  the standard choice f_rp = 1, the
          model  switches  to  a new regime in which bursts occur all the
          way  up to roughly the Eddington limit. Since the latter regime
          disagrees   with   observations,   we  suggest  that  the  true
          15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne   reaction  rate  is  lower  than  usually
          assumed.

          Title: Stellar Encounters with Massive Star-Disk Systems
          Authors: Nickolas Moeckel, John Bally
          Comments: 11 pages, 10 figures, accepted to ApJ
          The  dense,  clustered  environment in which massive stars form
          can  lead  to  interactions with neighboring stars. It has been
          hypothesized  that collisions and mergers may contribute to the
          growth  of  the most massive stars. In this paper we extend the
          study of star-disk interactions to explore encounters between a
          massive  protostar and a less massive cluster sibling using the
          publicly  available  SPH code GADGET-2. Collisions do not occur
          in  the  parameter  space  studied,  but  the end state of many
          encounters  is an eccentric binary with a semi-major axis ~ 100
          AU.  Disk  material is sometimes captured by the impactor. Most
          encounters  result in disruption and destruction of the initial
          disk,  and  periodic  torquing of the remnant disk. We consider
          the  effect  of  the  changing  orientation  of  the disk on an
          accretion  driven  jet, and the evolution of the systems in the
          presence of on-going accretion from the parent core.

          Journal
          We  report  the discovery with the RXTE/PCA of twin kHz QPOs in
          Cir  X-1.  Eleven  cases  of simultaneous double QPOs occurred,
          with  significances  of  up  to  6.3 and 5.5 sigma and centroid
          frequencies ranging between approximately 56-225 and 230-500 Hz
          for the two QPO peaks, respectively, i.e., for the most part at
          frequencies   well  below  those  of  other  sources.  The  QPO
          properties clearly indicate that these double peaks are the kHz
          QPOs  known  from  low  magnetic  field  neutron stars, and not
          black-hole  high-frequency  QPOs,  confirming that Cir X-1 is a
          neutron  star.  The  kHz QPO peak separation varies over a wide
          range,  ~175-340  Hz, and increases with QPO frequency. This is
          contrary  to  what  is  seen  in  other sources but agrees with
          predictions  of  the  relativistic  precession model and Alfven
          wave  models;  beat-frequency  models  require  modification to
          accommodate  this. In other observations single kHz QPOs can be
          seen  down to frequencies as low as ~12 Hz, as well as a strong
          low-frequency  (LF)  QPO  between  1  and  30 Hz. The relations
          between  the  frequencies of the kHz QPOs and the LF QPO are in
          good  agreement  with  those  found  previously  in  Z sources,
          confirming  that Cir X-1 may be a peculiar Z source. We suggest
          that  the  low  frequencies of the kHz QPOs in Cir X-1 and to a
          lesser extent in (other) Z sources might be due to a relatively
          stronger  radial  inflow  to the neutron star than in other kHz
          QPO sources.

          Title:  Accurate M Dwarf Metallicities from Spectral Synthesis:
          A Critical Test of Model Atmospheres
          Authors:   Jacob   L.   Bean,   Christopher  Sneden,  Peter  H.
          Hauschildt, Christopher M. Johns-Krull, G. Fritz Benedict
          Comments: 39 pages, 6 tables, 8 figures, accepted to ApJ
          We  describe  a  method  for  accurately  determining  M  dwarf
          metallicities   with  spectral  synthesis  based  on  abundance
          analyses  of  visual binary stars. We obtained high resolution,
          high  signal-to-noise  spectra of each component of five visual
          binary pairs at McDonald Observatory. The spectral types of the
          components  range from F7 to K3 V for the primaries and M0.5 to
          M3.5   V   for   the   secondaries.   We  have  determined  the
          metallicities  of  the primaries differentially with respect to
          the  Sun  by  fitting  synthetic  spectra to Fe \textsc{i} line
          profiles in the observed spectra. In the course of our analysis
          of   the   M   dwarf   secondaries  we  have  made  significant
          improvements to the PHOENIX cool-star model atmospheres and the
          spectrum   analysis  code  MOOG.  Our  analysis  yields  a  RMS
          deviation  of 0.11 dex in metallicity values between the binary
          pairs.  We  estimate  the  uncertainties in the derived stellar
          parameters  for  the  M  dwarfs to be 48 K, 0.10 dex, 0.12 dex,
          0.15  km  s$^{-1}$,  and  0.20 km s$^{-1}$ for {T}$_{eff}$, log
          \textsl{g},  [M/H],  $\xi$,  and  $\eta$ respectively. Accurate
          stellar  evolutionary  models are needed to progress further in
          the  analysis  of  cool-star spectra; the new model atmospheres
          warrant recalculation of the evolutionary models.

          Title: Detecting sterile dark matter in space
          Authors: Alexander Kusenko

          Quantum  to  Cosmos:  fundametal  physics  research  in space",
          Washington, DC, May 22-24, 2006
          Space-based  instruments provide new and, in some cases, unique
          opportunities to search for dark matter. In particular, if dark
          matter  comprises  sterile  neutrinos,  the  x ray detection of
          their  decay  line  is  by  far the most promising strategy for
          discovery. Sterile neutrinos with masses in the keV range could
          solve   several   long-standing   astrophysical  puzzles,  from
          supernova  asymmetries  and the pulsar kicks to star formation,
          reionization,  and  baryogenesis.  The  best  current limits on
          sterile  neutrinos  come  from  Chandra  and XMM-Newton. Future
          advances   can   be   achieved  with  a  high-resolution  x-ray
          spectrometry in space.

          Title:  2MASS  J05162881+2607387:  A  New Low-Mass Double-Lined
          Eclipsing Binary
          Authors:  Amanda  J.  Bayless, Jerome A. Orosz (San Diego State
          University)
          Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures (Figure 1 has degraded quality),
          to appear in ApJ
          We   show  that  the  star  known  as  2MASS  J05162881+2607387
          (hereafter  J0516)  is  a  double-lined  eclipsing  binary with
          nearly   identical   low-mass   components.  The  spectroscopic
          elements  derived  from  18  spectra  obtained  with  the  High
          Resolution  Spectrograph  on  the Hobby-Eberly Telescope during
          the  Fall of 2005 are K_1=88.45 +/- 0.48 km/s and K_2=90.43 +/-
          0.60  km/s,  resulting in a mass ratio of$q=K_1/K_2 = 0.978 +/-
          0.018  and minimum masses of M_1 sin^{3}i=0.775 +/- 0.016 solar
          masses   and   M_2   sin^{3}i=0.759  +/-  0.012  solar  masses,
          respectively.  We  have  extensive  differential  photometry of
          J0516  obtained  over several nights between 2004 January-March
          (epoch  1)  and  2004  October-2005  January  plus 2006 January
          (epoch   2)   using  the  1m  telescope  at  the  Mount  Laguna
          Observatory.  The  source  was  roughly 0.1 mag brighter in all
          three bandpasses during epoch 1 when compared to epoch 2. Also,
          phased   light   curves   from   epoch   1   show  considerable
          out-of-eclipse  variability,  presumably due to bright spots on
          one  or  both  stars. In contrast, the phased light curves from
          epoch  2  show  little  out-of-eclipse  variability.  The light
          curves  from  epoch  2  and  the  radial  velocity  curves were
          analyzed  using our ELC code with updated model atmospheres for
          low-mass  stars.  We  find  the  following: M_1=0.787 +/- 0.012
          solar  masses,  R_1=0.788  +/- 0.015 solar radii, M_2=0.770 +/-
          0.009  solar  masses,  and R_2=0.817 +/- 0.010 solar radii. The
          stars  in  J0516  have radii that are significantly larger than
          model  predictions for their masses, similar to what is seen in
          a handful of other well-studied low-mass double-lined eclipsing
          binaries. We compiled all recent mass and radius determinations
          from  low-mass  binaries and determine an empirical mass-radius
          relation  of  the  form R = 0.0324 + 0.9343M + 0.0374M^2, where
          the quantities are in solar units.

          The  Isaac  Newton Telescope Photometric H-alpha Survey (IPHAS)
          is  currently  mapping  the Northern Galactic plane reaching to
          r'=20  mag  with typically 1" resolution. Hundreds of Planetary
          Nebulae (PNe), both point-like and resolved, are expected to be
          discovered. We report on the discovery of the first new PN from
          this  survey:  it  is  an  unusual  object  located  at a large
          galactocentric  distance  and  has a very low oxygen abundance.
          The  nebula  shows  an  intricate morphology: there is an inner
          ring  surrounding  the central star, bright inner lobes with an
          enhanced  waist,  and very faint lobular extensions reaching up
          to more than 100". We classify it as a quadrupolar PN, a rather
          unusual  class  of  planetary  showing  two pairs of misaligned
          lobes.   From   long-slit   spectroscopy   we   derive  Te[NII]
          =12800+-1000K,  Ne  =  390+-40  cm-3,  and  chemical abundances
          typical  of  Peimbert's  Type  I nebulae (He/H =0.13, N/O =1.8)
          with  an  oxygen  abundance  of  12  +  log(O/H)=8.17+-0.15.  A
          kinematic distance of 7.0 kpc is derived, implying an unusually
          large  size  of  >4  pc  for  the nebula. The photometry of the
          central  star  indicates  the  presence  of  a  relatively cool
          companion.  This,  and  the  evidence for a dense circumstellar
          disk  and  quadrupolar  morphology, all of which are rare among
          PNe,  support the hypothesis that this morphology is related to
          binary interaction.

          Title:  The  Unusual  Cataclysmic  Binary Star RBS 0490 and the
          Space Density of Cataclysmics
          Authors: John R. Thorstensen, Sebastien Lepine, Michael Shara
          Comments: 14 pages, 3 figures; Publications of the Astronomical
          Society of the Pacific, in press
          RBS  (Rosat  Bright Source) 0490 is a cataclysmic variable star
          (CV)  with unusually strong emission lines. The strength of the
          emission   lines  led  to  a  suggestion  that  the  object  is
          intrinsically faint and correspondingly nearby (approx. 33 pc),
          which, if true, would strongly affect estimates of the CV space
          density.  Here  we  report  astrometry,  filter photometry, and
          time-series  spectroscopy  of this object. The astrometry gives
          an  absolute  parallax  pi(abs) = 4.5 +- 1.5 mas and a relative
          proper  motion of 102 mas/yr. A Bayesian procedure gives a very
          uncertain  distance estimate of d approx. 300 pc, and the small
          parallax alone implies d > 133 pc (at two standard deviations).
          The  mean V magnitude is 17.4, which implies M_V = 10.9 - 5 log
          (d/200  pc),  neglecting  extinction.  At  200  pc,  the  space
          velocity  would  be  over  90 km/s with respect to the LSR. The
          time-series   spectroscopy   shows   a  possible  emission-line
          radial-velocity  period  near  46  min. This would be unusually
          short  for  an  orbital  period and it may represent some other
          clock in the system.

          From  high-resolution VLT/UVES spectra (R~43,000), we determine
          abundances or upper limits for Li, C, N, O, and other important
          elements,  as  well  as 12C/13C isotopic ratio for three Carbon
          enhanced metal poor stars. All three stars have -3.30 <= [Fe/H]
          <=  -2.85  and moderate to high CNO abundances. CS 22958-042 is
          one  of  the most carbon-rich CEMP stars known ([C/Fe] = +3.2),
          while  CS 29528-041 (one of the few N-enhanced metal-poor stars
          known) is one of the most nitrogen rich ([N/Fe] = +3.0). Oxygen
          is  very  high  in  CS  31080-095  ([O/Fe]  =  +2.35) and in CS
          22958-042  ([O/Fe]  = +1.35). All three stars exhibit [Sr/Fe] <
          0; Ba is not detected in CS 22958-042 ([Ba/Fe] < -0.53), but it
          is moderately enhanced ([Ba/Fe] ~ 1) in the other two stars. CS
          22958-042 displays one of the largest sodium overabundances yet
          found  in CEMP stars ([Na/Fe] = +2.8). CS 22958-042 has 12C/13C
          =  9,  similar  to  most  other  CEMP  stars  without  enhanced
          neutron-capture  elements, while 12C/13C <= 40 in CS 31080-095.
          CS 31080-095 and CS 29528-041 have A(Li) ~ 1.7, below the Spite
          Plateau, while Li is not detected in CS 22958-042. CS 22958-042
          is  a  CEMP-no  star,  but  the other two stars are in no known
          class  of  CEMP  star and thus either constitute a new class or
          are  a  link  between  the  CEMP-no  and CEMP-s classes, adding
          complexity  to  the  abundance  patterns  for  CEMP  stars.  We
          interpret  the  abundance  patterns  in our stars to imply that
          current  models for the presumed AGB binary progenitors lack an
          extra-mixing  process, similar to those apparently operating in
          RGB stars.

          Title:  Resolved  Spectroscopy of M Dwarf/L Dwarf Binaries. II.
          2MASS J 17072343-0558249AB
          Authors: Michael W. McElwain, Adam J. Burgasser
          We  present  IRTF  SpeX  observations  of the M/L binary system
          2MASS  J17072343-0558249. SpeX imaging resolves the system into
          a  1"01+/-0.17  visual binary in which both components have red
          near  infrared  colors. Resolved low-resolution (R~150) 0.8-2.5
          micron  spectroscopy  reveals  strong H2O, CO and FeH bands and
          alkali  lines in the spectra of both components, characteristic
          of  late-type  M  and  L  dwarfs.  A  comparison to a sample of
          late-type  field  dwarf spectra indicates spectral types M9 and
          L3.   Despite   the   small   proper   motion   of  the  system
          (0"100+/-0"009  yr^{-1}),  imaging  observations  over  2.5  yr
          provide  strong  evidence  that the two components share common
          proper  motion.  Physical association is also likely due to the
          small  spatial  volume occupied by the two components (based on
          spectrophotometric   distances   estimates  of  15+/-1  pc)  as
          compared  to  the  relatively  low  spatial density of low mass
          field  stars.  The projected separation of the system is 15+/-3
          AU,  similar  to  other  late-type M and L binaries. Assuming a
          system  age  of 0.5-5 Gyr, we estimate the masses of the binary
          components  to  be  0.072-0.083  and 0.064-0.077 M_sun, with an
          orbital  period  of roughly 150-300 yr. While this is nominally
          too  long  a  baseline  for  astrometric mass measurements, the
          proximity  and  relatively wide angular separation of the 2MASS
          J1707-0558AB  pair  makes it an ideal system for studying the M
          dwarf/L dwarf transition at a fixed age and metallicity.

          Title:  An  Observational  Study  of  Tidal  Synchronization in

          We present rotation periods for the solar-type primary stars in
          13  close (a \~< 5 AU) single-lined spectroscopic binaries with
          known  orbital periods (P) and eccentricities (e). All binaries
          are members of the open clusters M35 (150Myr) and M34 (250Myr).
          The  binary  orbital parameters and the rotation periods of the
          primary stars were determined from time-series spectroscopy and
          time-series  photometry,  respectively.  Knowledge of the ages,
          orbital  periods, and eccentricities of these binaries combined
          with  the  rotation  periods  and masses of their primary stars
          makes  them  particularly  interesting systems for studying the
          rates  of tidal circularization and synchronization. Our sample
          of  13  binaries includes six with orbital periods shortward of
          13  days  (a  ~<  0.12  AU).  The stars in these binaries orbit
          sufficiently  close  that  their  spins and orbits have evolved
          toward   synchronization   and  circularization  due  to  tidal
          interactions.    We    investigate    the   degree   of   tidal
          synchronization   in  each  binary  by  comparing  the  angular
          rotation  velocity of the primary stars to the angular velocity
          expected  if the primary star was synchronized (e=0) or pseudo-
          synchronized  (e>0) with the orbital motion. Of the six closest
          binaries  two  with  circular  orbits are not synchronized, one
          being  subsynchronous  and  one being supersynchronous, and the
          primary  stars  in  two  binaries  with  eccentric  orbits  are
          rotating  more slowly than pseudosynchronism. The remaining two
          binaries   have   reached  the  equilibrium  state  of  both  a
          circularized orbit and synchronized rotation. As a set, the six
          binaries  present  a challenging case study for tidal evolution
          theory,  which  in  particular  does not predict subsynchronous
          rotation in such close systems.

          Title: A Study of Giant Pulses from PSR J1824-2452A
          Authors: H. S. Knight, M. Bailes, R. N. Manchester, S. M. Ord
          Comments: Accepted by ApJ
          We  have  searched  for  microsecond  bursts  of  emission from
          millisecond  pulsars  in  the  globular  cluster  M28 using the
          Parkes  radio telescope. We detected a total of 27 giant pulses
          from  the  known emitter PSR J1824-2452A. At wavelengths around
          20  cm  the  giant  pulses  are  scatter-broadened to widths of
          around  2  microseconds  and  follow  power-law statistics. The
          pulses  occur  in  two  narrow phase-windows which correlate in
          phase with X-ray emission and trail the peaks of the integrated
          radio  pulse-components. Notably, the integrated radio emission
          at  these phase windows has a steeper spectral index than other
          emission.   The   giant   pulses   exhibit  a  high  degree  of
          polarization,  with  many  being  100%  elliptically polarized.
          Their  position  angles  appear random. Although the integrated
          emission  of  PSR  J1824-2452A  is  relatively  stable  for the
          frequencies   and   bandwidths  observed,  the  intensities  of
          individual giant pulses vary considerably across our bands. Two
          pulses were detected at both 2700 and 3500 MHz. The narrower of
          the  two  pulses  is  20  ns wide at 3500 MHz. At 2700 MHz this
          pulse  has an inferred brightness temperature at maximum of 5 x
          10^37  K.  Our  observations  suggest  the  giant pulses of PSR
          J1824-2452A are generated in the same part of the magnetosphere
          as  X-ray emission through a different emission process to that
          of ordinary pulses.

          The  disruption of binary stars by the tidal field of the black
          hole in the Galactic Center can produce the hypervelocity stars
          observed  in  the halo. We use numerical models to simulate the
          full  spectrum  of  observable velocities of stars ejected into
          the  halo by this binary disruption process. Our model includes
          a  range of parameters for binaries with 3-4 M_Solar primaries,
          consideration  of radial orbits of the ejected stars through an
          approximate mass distribution for the Galaxy, and the impact of
          stellar  lifetimes.  We  calculate  the  spectrum  of  ejection
          velocities and reproduce previous results for the mean ejection
          velocity  at  the  Galactic center. The model predicts that the
          full   population   of   ejected   stars   includes   both  the
          hypervelocity stars with velocities large enough to escape from
          the Galaxy and a comparable number of ejected, but bound, stars
          of  the  same  stellar type. The predicted median speeds of the
          population  of  ejected  stars as a function of distance in the
          halo  are  consistent  with current observations. Combining the
          model  with the data also shows that interesting constraints on
          the  properties  of  binaries in the Galactic Center and on the
          mass  distribution  in  the  Galaxy  can  be obtained even with
          modest samples of ejected stars.

          We  report  on  the  first  census  of INTEGRAL/IBIS detections
          ($\gtrsim  4\sigma$  significance)  above  100 keV based on the
          Core  Program  and  public  Open  time observations up to April
          2005.  There are 49 sources detected in the 100-150 keV band of
          which 14 are also seen in the 150-300 keV range. The low energy
          sample  is  dominated  by  X-ray binary systems of both low and
          high  mass, but also includes 10 active galaxies. Of the binary
          systems  that  are  detected  above  150 keV, more than 50% are
          associated  with  black  hole  candidates,  often  reported  as
          microquasars.  The  present  survey  results  are  then used to
          construct  LogN-LogS  curves  for  galactic  and  extragalactic
          objects  in  the  100-150 keV band: above a 1 mCrab sensitivity
          limit we expect that around 200 galactic sources and almost 350
          active  galaxies  populate  the  sky  above  100 keV. While the
          contribution  of individual point sources to the total Galactic
          emission has been estimated to be around 70-80% between 100-300
          keV,  we  find  that  active  galaxies  detected  above 1 mCrab
          account  for  only about 3% of the cosmic hard X-ray background
          in the 100-150 keV band.

          Title:  Gravitational  Dynamics of an Infinite Shuffled Lattice
          of Particles
          Authors: Thierry Baertschiger, Michael Joyce, Andrea Gabrielli,
          Francesco Sylos Labini
          Comments: 21 pages, 16 figures
          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          We  study, using numerical simulations, the dynamical evolution
          of  self-gravitating point particles in static euclidean space,
          starting  from  a simple class of infinite ``shuffled lattice''
          initial    conditions.   These   are   obtained   by   applying
          independently to each particle on an infinite perfect lattice a
          small  random  displacement,  and  are characterized by a power
          spectrum  (structure  factor)  of density fluctuations which is
          quadratic  in  the  wave  number k, at small k. For a specified
          form   of   the   probability   distribution  function  of  the
          ``shuffling''  applied  to  each  particle,  and  zero  initial
          velocities, these initial configurations are characterized by a
          single  relevant  parameter:  the  variance  $\delta^2$  of the
          ``shuffling''  normalized  in  units  of  the  lattice  spacing
          $\ell$.  The  clustering,  which develops in time starting from
          scales  around  $\ell$,  is  qualitatively very similar to that
          seen  in  cosmological  simulations,  which begin from lattices
          with   applied  correlated  displacements  and  incorporate  an
          expanding   spatial   background.  From  very  soon  after  the
          formation of the first non-linear structures, a spatio-temporal
          scaling  relation describes well the evolution of the two-point
          correlations.   At   larger   times   the   dynamics  of  these
          correlations  converges  to  what  is  termed  ``self-similar''
          evolution  in  cosmology,  in  which the time dependence in the
          scaling   relation   is  specified  entirely  by  that  of  the
          linearized  fluid  theory. Comparing simulations with different
          $\delta$,  different  resolution,  but  identical  large  scale
          fluctuations, we are able to identify and study features of the
          dynamics  of  the system in the transient phase leading to this
          behavior.  In  this  phase,  the  discrete nature of the system
          explicitly plays an essential role.

          Title:  Spin-one  color superconductivity in compact stars?- an
          analysis within NJL-type models
          Authors: D.N. Aguilera
          Comments:  7  pages,  7 figures, contribution to the Conference
          Proceedings  of  "Isolated  Neutron Stars: from the Interior to
          the Surface", London, 24-28. April 2006
          We  present results of a microscopic calculation using NJL-type
          model  of possible spin-one pairings in two flavor quark matter
          for applications in compact star phenomenology. We focus on the
          color-spin  locking  phase  (CSL) in which all quarks pair in a
          symmetric  way,  in which color and spin states are locked. The
          CSL  condensate  is  particularly  interesting for compact star
          applications  since  it  is  flavor  symmetric and could easily
          satisfy  charge  neutrality.  Moreover,  the  fact that in this
          phase  all  quarks are gapped might help to suppress the direct
          Urca  process,  consistent  with  cooling  models. The order of
          magnitude  of  these small gaps (~1 MeV) will not influence the
          EoS,  but their also small critical temperatures (T_c ~800 keV)
          could  be  relevant  in the late stages neutron star evolution,
          when  the  temperature  falls  below this value and a CSL quark
          core could form.

          Title: Bulk viscosity in 2SC quark matter
          Authors: Mark G. Alford, Andreas Schmitt
          Comments: 18 pages + appendices (28 pages total), 8 figures
          The  bulk viscosity of three-flavor color-superconducting quark
          matter  originating  from the nonleptonic process u+s -> u+d is
          computed.  It  is  assumed  that up and down quarks form Cooper
          pairs  while  the strange quark remains unpaired (2SC phase). A
          general  derivation  of  the  rate of strangeness production is
          presented,   involving   contributions   from  a  multitude  of
          different  subprocesses,  including  subprocesses  that involve
          different  numbers  of  gapped  quarks  as well as creation and
          annihilation  of  particles in the condensate. The rate is then
          used  to  compute  the  bulk  viscosity  as  a  function of the
          temperature, for an external oscillation frequency typical of a
          compact  star  r-mode. We find that, for temperatures far below
          the   critical  temperature  T_c  for  2SC  pairing,  the  bulk
          viscosity  of  color-superconducting quark matter is suppressed
          relative  to that of unpaired quark matter, but for T >~ T_c/30
          the  color-superconducting  quark  matter  has  a  higher  bulk
          viscosity.  This is potentially relevant for the suppression of
          r-mode instabilities early in the life of a compact star.

          Comments:  10  pages,  7  figures,  Accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We  numerically  study the long-term evolution of the accretion
          disc around the neutron star in a coplanar Be/X-ray binary with
          a   short  period  and  a  moderate  eccentricity.  From  three
          dimensional  Smoothed  Particle  Hydrodynamics  simulations, we
          find  that the disc evolves through three distinct phases, each
          characterized  by  different  mass  accretion  patterns. In the
          first  "developing  phase",  the  disc  is  formed and develops
          towards  a  nearly  Keplerian  disc. It has a relatively large,
          double-peaked  mass-accretion  rate with the higher peak by the
          direct  accretion at periastron, which is followed by the lower
          peak  by  the  accretion induced by a one-armed spiral wave. In
          the  second  "transition  phase",  the  disc  is  approximately
          Keplerian   and   grows  with  time.  The  mass-accretion  rate
          increases  as  the  disc grows. In the second phase, there is a
          transition in the mass accretion rate from a double peaked to a
          single  peaked  pattern.  In  the final quasi-steady state, the
          mass-accretion   rate   is   on   average   balanced  with  the
          mass-transfer  rate  from  the  Be  disc and exhibits a regular
          orbital    modulation.   In   the   quasi-steady   state,   the
          mass-accretion  rate  has  a  single  peak  by the wave-induced
          accretion  as  in  a  later  stage of the transition phase. The
          orbital  modulation  of  X-ray  maxima could provide not only a
          circumstantial  evidence  for  the  persistent disc but also an
          observational diagnosis of the disc evolutionary state.

          An  X-ray  compact  source  was  discovered  with  Chandra in a
          supernova  remnant  (SNR)  N23, located in the Large Magellanic
          Cloud.  The  compact  source (CXOU J050552.3-680141) is seen in
          only  the hard band (> 2 keV) image of N23, while the soft band
          image  (<  2  keV)  shows  diffuse emission of the SNR, with an
          extent  of  ~60  arcsec times ~80 arcsec. The compact source is
          located   at  almost  the  center  of  N23,  and  there  is  no
          identifiable  object  for the source from previous observations
          at  any other wavelength. The source spectrum is best explained
          by  a  power-law model with a photon index of 2.2 (1.9-2.7) and
          an  absorption-corrected luminosity of 1.0 x 10^34 ergs s^-1 in
          the  0.5--10  keV  band  for  a  distance  of  50  kpc. Neither
          pulsation  nor time variability of the source was detected with
          this  observation  with  a  time  resolution  of 3.2 sec. These
          results  correspond  with  those  of  Hughes  et al. (2006) who
          carried  out analysis independently around the same time as our
          work.  Based  on information from the best-fit power-law model,
          we  suggest  that  the  source  emission  is most likely from a
          rotation-powered  pulsar  and/or  a  pulsar  wind nebula. It is
          generally   inferred   that   the   progenitor   of  N23  is  a
          core-collapsed massive star.

          Astrophys. (ChJAA)
          An  algorithm  of  the ensemble pulsar time based on the Wiener
          filtration  method  has  been  constructed.  This algorithm has
          allowed  the separation of the contributions of an atomic clock
          and  a  pulsar  itself to the post-fit pulsar timing residuals.
          The  method  has  been  applied  to  the  timing  data  of  the
          millisecond  pulsars  PSR B1855+09 and PSR B1937+21 and allowed
          the filtering out of the atomic scale component from the pulsar
          phase  variations.  Direct  comparison  of the terrestrial time
          TT(BIPM96)  and  the  ensemble  pulsar  time PT$_{\rm ens}$ has
          displayed  that  the difference TT(BIPM96) -- PT$_{\rm ens}$ is
          within  $\pm0.4  \mu$s range. A new limit of gravitational wave
          background based on the difference TT(BIPM96) -- PT$_{\rm ens}$
          was established to be $\Omega_g {\rm h}^2\sim 10^{-10}$.

          We study the dipolar magnetic field configuration in dependence
          on  brane tension and present solutions of Maxwell equations in
          the  internal and external background spacetime of a magnetized
          spherical  star  in  a  Randall-Sundrum II type braneworld. The
          star  is  modelled  as  sphere  consisting  of  perfect  highly
          magnetized  fluid  with  infinite  conductivity  and  frozen-in
          dipolar  magnetic field. With respect to solutions for magnetic
          fields  found  in  the  Schwarzschild  spacetime  brane tension
          introduces  enhancing  corrections both to the interior and the
          exterior  magnetic  field.  These corrections could be relevant
          for  the  magnetic  fields  of  magnetized  compact  objects as
          pulsars   and  magnetars  and  may  provide  the  observational
          evidence  for  the  brane  tension  through the modification of
          formula  for magneto-dipolar emission which gives amplification
          of  electromagnetic  energy  loss up to few orders depending on
          the value of the brane tension.

          Title: Studying Millisecond Pulsars in X-rays
          Authors: Vyacheslav E. Zavlin (NASA/MSFC)
          Comments:   To   appear  in  Astrophysics  and  Space  Science,
          Proceedings  of  "Isolated  Neutron Stars: from the Interior to
          the  Surface",  eds. D. Page, R. Turolla and S. Zane; 10 pages,
          12 figures (four of them are color)
          Millisecond  pulsars represent an evolutionarily distinct group
          among  rotation-powered  pulsars.  Outside  the radio band, the
          soft  X-ray  range  ($\sim  0.1$--10  keV) is most suitable for
          studying  radiative  mechanisms  operating in these fascinating
          objects.  X-ray  observations  revealed  diverse  properties of
          emission  from  millisecond  pulsars. For the most of them, the
          bulk  of  radiation  is of a thermal origin, emitted from small
          spots  (polar  caps)  on  the  neutron  star  surface heated by
          relativistic  particles  produced in pulsar acceleration zones.
          On  the  other  hand,  a  few  other very fast rotating pulsars
          exhibit   almost   pure  nonthermal  emission  generated,  most
          probably,  in pulsar magnetospheres. There are also examples of
          nonthermal  emission  detected  from  X-ray  nebulae powered by
          millisecond  pulsars,  as  well as from pulsar winds shocked in
          binary  systems  with  millisecond pulsars as companions. These
          and   other   most   important   results  obtained  from  X-ray
          observations of millisecond pulsars are reviewed in this paper,
          as  well  as results from the search for millisecond pulsations
          in
          X-ray flux of the radio-quite neutron star RX J1856.5-3754.

          We  report  on  the  spectroscopic  monitoring of GCIRS16SW, an
          Ofpe/WN9  star  and  LBV candidate in the central parsec of the
          Galaxy.  SINFONI  observations  show strong daily spectroscopic
          changes  in  the K band. Radial velocities are derived from the
          HeI  2.112  um line complex and vary regularly with a period of
          19.45  days,  indicating  that  the  star  is  most  likely  an
          eclipsing  binary.  Under  various  assumptions, we are able to
          derive a mass of ~ 50 Msun for each component.

          Palma, Spain, May 16-19 2006, to appear in ASP Conf. Ser., eds.
          R.L.M. Corradi and U. Munari
          During  a  program  of spectroscopic monitoring of V838 Mon, we
          serendipitously  discovered that a neighboring 16th-mag star is
          of  type B. We then carried out a spectroscopic survey of other
          stars  in  the  vicinity,  revealing two more B-type stars, all
          within 45" of V838 Mon. We have determined the distance to this
          sparse,  young  cluster,  based  on spectral classification and
          photometric  main-sequence  fitting  of  the three B stars. The
          distance  is  found  to be 6.2+-1.2 kpc, in excellent agreement
          with  the  geometric  distance  to V838 Mon of 5.9 kpc obtained
          from  Hubble  Space  Telescope polarimetry of the light echoes.
          The cluster's age is less than 25 Myr.
          The  absolute luminosity of V838 Mon during its outburst, based
          on  our  distance  measurement, was very similar to that of M31
          RV,  an  object  in  the  bulge  of  M31  that  was also a cool
          supergiant  throughout  its eruption in 1988. However, there is
          no young population at the site of M31 RV.
          It  does  not  appear  possible to form a nova-like cataclysmic
          binary system within the young age of the V838 Mon cluster, and
          the lack of a young population surrounding M31 RV suggests that
          the  outburst  mechanism does not require a massive progenitor.
          These  considerations  appear  to  leave  stellar-collision  or
          merger  scenarios  as  one of the remaining viable explanations
          for the outbursts of V838 Mon and M31 RV.

          Title:  Quark  Deconfinement inside Compact Stars and Gamma Ray
          Bursts Inner Engine

          International  Conference on Perspectives in Hadronic Physics",
          Trieste 2006
          The  temporal  structure of Gamma Ray Bursts can be interpreted
          assuming  as  a  inner  engine a neutron star which undergoes a
          progressive  compactification  via  production  of  strangeness
          (hyperons  and  kaons)  and quarks. We will propose a tentative
          identification  of  various  emission periods of the burst with
          specific   structural  changes  of  the  star.  Each  of  these
          modifications  of  the  composition  of  the compact star takes
          place  as a deflagration and not as a detonation, so the energy
          released in the transition goes mainly into heat and not into a
          mechanical  wave.  This  is  important  in  order  to  avoid an
          excessive  baryonic contamination of the region surrounding the
          compact  star.  In  this  way  a  ultrarelativistic  plasma  of
          electron-positron   pairs  and  of  photons  can  be  obtained,
          powering the Gamma Ray Burst.

          Title:  A Survey of 56 Mid-latitude EGRET Error Boxes for Radio

          for publication in ApJ
          We  have  conducted  a  radio  pulsar survey of 56 unidentified
          gamma-ray  sources  from  the  3rd  EGRET  catalog which are at
          intermediate  Galactic  latitudes (5 deg. < |b| < 73 deg.). For
          each  source,  four  interleaved  35-minute pointings were made
          with  the  13-beam,  1400-MHz  multibeam receiver on the Parkes
          64-m  radio  telescope.  This covered the 95% error box of each
          source  at  a  limiting  sensitivity of about 0.2 mJy to pulsed
          radio  emission for periods P > 10 ms and dispersion measures <
          50  pc cm-3. Roughly half of the unidentified gamma-ray sources
          at  |b|  >  5  deg.  with  no  proposed active galactic nucleus
          counterpart  were  covered  in  this  survey.  We detected nine
          isolated  pulsars  and four recycled binary pulsars, with three
          from  each  class  being  new. Timing observations suggest that
          only  one  of  the  pulsars has a spin-down luminosity which is
          even  marginally consistent with the inferred luminosity of its
          coincident  EGRET  source.  Our results suggest that population
          models,   which   include   the  Gould  belt  as  a  component,
          overestimate   the   number   of  isolated  pulsars  among  the
          mid-latitude Galactic gamma-ray sources and that it is unlikely
          that  Gould belt pulsars make up the majority of these sources.
          However,  the possibility of steep pulsar radio spectra and the
          confusion  of  terrestrial  radio interference with long-period
          pulsars  (P > 200 ms) having very low dispersion measures (< 10
          pc  cm-3, expected for sources at a distance of less than about
          1 kpc) prevent us from strongly ruling out this hypothesis. Our
          results  also  do  not  support the hypothesis that millisecond
          pulsars  make  up  the  majority  of  these sources. Non-pulsar
          source  classes  should  therefore  be  further investigated as
          possible  counterparts  to  the  unidentified  EGRET sources at
          intermediate Galactic latitudes.

          Title:  The X-ray binary 2S0114+650=LSI+65 010:A slow pulsar or
          tidally-induced pulsations?

          Comments: 12 pages, 14 figures
          The  X-ray  source  2S0114+650=LSI+65  010  is  a binary system
          containing  a  B-type primary and a low mass companion believed
          to   be   a   neutron  star.  The  system  has  three  reported
          periodicities: the orbital period, P{orb}~11.6 d, X-ray flaring
          with  P{flare}~2.7  hr,  and a "superorbital" X-ray periodicity
          P{super}~30.7  d.  The  objective of this paper is to show that
          the  puzzling  periodicities  in the system may be explained in
          the  context  of  scenarios  in  which tidal interactions drive
          oscillations   in  the  B-supergiant  star.  We  calculate  the
          solution  of  the  equations  of  motion for one layer of small
          surface  elements distributed along the equator of the star, as
          they  respond  to  the forces due to gas pressure, centrifugal,
          coriolis,  viscous forces, and the gravitational forces of both
          stars.  This  calculation  provides variability timescales that
          can  be  compared  with  the  observations. In addition, we use
          observational  data  obtained at the Observatorio Astron\'omico
          Nacional  en  San Pedro M\'artir (OAN/SPM) between 1993-2004 to
          determine  which  of  the  periodicities  may be present in the
          optical  region. We suggest that the tidal oscillations lead to
          a  structured stellar wind which, when fed to the neutron star,
          produces  the  X-ray  modulations.  The  connection between the
          stellar  oscillations  and  the modulation of the mass ejection
          may  lie  in  the  shear  energy  dissipation  generated by the
          tangential  motions that are produced by the tidal interaction,
          particularly  in  the tidal bulge region. The tidal oscillation
          scenario  weakens the case for 2S0114+650 containing a magnetar
          descendent.

          Over  the  past  decade our physical understanding of gamma-ray
          bursts  (GRBs)  has  progressed rapidly thanks to the discovery
          and   observation   of  their  long-lived  afterglow  emission.
          Long-duration  (T < 2 s) GRBs are associated with the explosive
          deaths   of   massive  stars  (``collapsars''),  which  produce
          accompanying  supernovae,  while  the  short-duration (T > 2 s)
          GRBs arise from a different origin, which has been argued to be
          the  merger  of  two  compact  objects, either neutron stars or
          black holes. Here we present observations of GRB060614, a 100-s
          long burst discovered by the Swift satellite, which require the
          invocation  of  a  new  explosive  process:  either  a  massive
          ``collapsar''   that   powers  a  GRB  without  any  associated
          supernova,  or  a  new  type  of  engine,  as long-lived as the
          collapsar  but  without  any such massive stellar host. We also
          discuss  the  properties  of this burst's redshift z=0.125 host
          galaxy,  which distinguish it from other long-duration GRBs and
          suggest  that  an  entirely  new  type of GRB progenitor may be
          required.

          The  recent  development  of numerical schemes for Relativistic
          MHD  (RMHD)  allows  us  to  model the acceleration and outflow
          properties  of  winds  from compact sources. Theoretical models
          suggest  that  acceleration  and  collimation  of  the flow are
          extremely  inefficient  when  the  speed  is  close  to $c$, in
          contrast  with  many  observations.  Numerical  results  for an
          axisymmetric rotator, both in the case of monopolar and dipolar
          magnetic field will be presented, suggesting that in ideal RMHD
          acceleration   is  indeed  inefficient.  I  will  also  mention
          numerical   challenges   and   stability  problems  of  present
          simulations. Finally I will discuss the interaction of a pulsar
          wind  with  the  surrounding  SNR. I will present emission maps
          based  on  numerical  simulations of the flow inside the nebula
          and  how  they  can  be used in comparison with observations to
          derive  informations  about  the properties of pulsar winds far
          away from the source.

          We present a sample of 1035 thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts
          from  observations  of  45 accreting neutron stars by the Rossi
          X-ray  Timing  Explorer  (RXTE), spanning more than nine years.
          This  sample  contains for the first time confirmed examples of
          burst   ignition  in  each  of  the  three  regimes  identified
          theoretically:  H-ignition  of  mixed H/He fuel, He-ignition in
          pure He, and He-ignition in mixed H/He fuel. We combined bursts
          from multiple sources to investigate the variation of the burst
          rate,  energetics,  and  time  scale as a function of accretion
          rate. We found a peak burst rate of 0.2-0.3/hr for a normalised
          peak flux of gamma approx. 0.02-0.06, corresponding to a source
          luminosity of (0.3-2)e37 ergs/cm^2/s.
          For    35   sources   with   bursts   exhibiting   photospheric
          radius-expansion,   we  estimated  the  likely  distance  range
          arising  from  the  possible  range  of the Eddington limit. We
          found  that in general the peak flux of radius-expansion bursts
          from  individual  sources  is  not  constant,  varying  with  a
          fractional  standard  deviation  of  14%  in  the mean. We also
          examined  the  bursts  with  very  short  (<~30 min) recurrence
          times.  We  found evidence for two distinct populations of such
          bursts,  one of faint bursts following a much stronger burst by
          6-18   min,   and  another  with  comparable  intensity  bursts
          separated  by  7  min  or  more.  We describe the properties of
          bursts observed from 5 new bursters discovered by RXTE, as well
          as  two  new  transient  outbursts of previously known sources.
          Finally,  we  searched  for  burst  oscillations  at  the known
          oscillation   frequencies   in  14  sources.  We  describe  the
          distribution  of  the  oscillation  amplitudes  as  well as the
          stages of each burst in which the oscillations are detected.

          Title:  Monte  Carlo Simulations of Globular Cluster Evolution.
          IV. Direct Integration of Strong Interactions
          Authors:  John  M.  Fregeau,  Frederic  A.  Rasio (Northwestern

          Comments: Submitted to ApJ. 16 pages, 18 figures, in emulateapj
          We   study   the   dynamical  evolution  of  globular  clusters
          containing  populations of primordial binaries, using our newly
          updated  Monte  Carlo cluster evolution code with the inclusion
          of  direct  integration  of  binary scattering interactions. We
          describe the modifications we have made to the code, as well as
          improvements  we  have  made to the core Monte Carlo method. We
          present several test calculations to verify the validity of the
          new code, and perform many comparisons with previous analytical
          and numerical work in the literature. We simulate the evolution
          of a large grid of models, with a wide range of initial cluster
          profiles,  and  with  binary fractions ranging from 0 to 1, and
          compare  with  observations  of  Galactic globular clusters. We
          find  that  our  code  yields  excellent  agreement with direct
          N-body  simulations  of  clusters with primordial binaries, but
          yields  some  results  that  differ  significantly  from  other
          approximate  methods. Our results for the structural parameters
          of  clusters  during  the  binary-burning phase are outside the
          range of parameters for observed clusters, implying that either
          clusters   are   born  significantly  more  or  less  centrally
          concentrated than has been previously considered, or that there
          are  additional  physical  processes beyond two-body relaxation
          and    binary   interactions   that   affect   the   structural
          characteristics of clusters.

          Three  binaries are now established sources of emission at very
          high  energies  (>1e11 eV). They are composed of a massive star
          and   a  compact  object.  The  emission  can  be  due  to  the
          interaction  of  the  relativistic  wind from a young ms pulsar
          with the stellar wind of the companion, by which rotation-power
          ends  up  as  non-thermal  flux. Variations at VHE energies are
          explained  as  due  to gamma-gamma absorption and/or changes in
          shock  location along the orbit. Resolved radio emission is due
          to cooling particles trailing the pulsar.

          Identifying  binaries  among runaway O- and B-type stars offers
          valuable  insight into the evolution of open clusters and close
          binary  stars. Here we present a spectroscopic investigation of
          12  known  or  suspected  binaries  among  field and runaway OB
          stars.  We  find  new  orbital  solutions for five single-lined
          spectroscopic  binaries (HD 1976, HD 14633, HD 15137, HD 37737,
          and HD 52533), and we classify two stars thought to be binaries
          (HD  30614  and  HD  188001)  as  single stars. In addition, we
          reinvestigate   their  runaway  status  using  our  new  radial
          velocity  data  with  the  UCAC2  proper motion catalogs. Seven
          stars  in  our  study  appear  to  have been ejected from their
          birthplaces,   and   at  least  three  of  these  runaways  are
          spectroscopic  binaries  and  are  of great interest for future
          study.

          Color  confinement  is  only  a supposition, which has not been
          proved  in  QCD yet. It is proposed here that macroscopic quark
          gluon  plasma  in  astrophysics could hardly maintain colorless
          because  of  causality. The authors expected that the existence
          of   chromatic   strange  quark  stars  as  well  as  chromatic
          strangelets  preserved  from  the  QCD  phase transition in the
          early   universe   could  be  unavoidable  if  their  colorless

          Authors: M. Campanelli, C. O. Lousto, Y. Zlochower
          Comments: 9 pages, revtex4
          We  perform  numerical  simulations  of  black-hole binaries to
          study  the exchange of spin and orbital angular momentum during
          the  last, highly nonlinear, stages of the coalescence process.
          To  calculate  the transfer of angular momentum from orbital to
          spin,  we  start with a configuration of initially non-spinning
          holes  in  a  quasicircular orbit. We find that each individual
          black  hole horizon acquires a non-vanishing spin and that this
          spin  is two orders of magnitude smaller than what is needed to
          tidally  lock the binary into a corotation state. We also study
          the  converse  transfer  from spin into orbital motion. In this
          case,  we  start the simulations with parallel, highly-spinning
          non-boosted  black holes. As the collision proceeds, the system
          acquires  a  non-head-on  orbital  motion,  due  to  spin-orbit
          coupling,  that  leads to the radiation of angular momentum. We
          are  able to accurately measure the energy and angular momentum
          losses and model their dependence on the initial spins.

          Implications for GW Detection
          Authors: Chunglee Kim, Vicky Kalogera, Duncan R. Lorimer
          Comments:  9  pages,  2 figures, To appear in proceedings of "A
          life  with  stars", a conference in honour of Ed van den Heuvel
          (Amsterdam, August 2005), New Ast. Rev
          We present the current estimates of the Galactic merger rate of
          double-neutron-star (DNS) systems. Using a statistical analysis
          method,  we  calculate  the  probability  distribution function
          (PDF)  of  the  rate  estimates,  which  allows  us  to  assign
          confidence  intervals  to  the rate estimates. We calculate the
          Galactic  DNS  merger  rate  based  on  the three known systems
          B1913+16, B1534+12, and J0737-3039. The discovery of J0737-3039
          increases  the  estimated  DNS  merger rate by a factor ~6 than
          what  is previously known. The most likely values of DNS merger
          rate  lie  in  the  range  3-190 per Myr depending on different
          pulsar  models.  Motivated  by a strong correlation between the
          peak  rate  estimates  and  a  pulsar  luminosity  function, we
          calculate  a  'global'  probability  distribution  as  a single
          representation  of  the  parameter  space  covered by different
          pulsar  population  models.  We compare the global PDF with the
          observed  supernova Ib/c rate, which sets an upper limit on the
          DNS  merger  rate.  Finally,  we  remark on implications of new
          discoveries  such as of J1756-2251, the 4th DNS in the Galactic
          disk, and J1906+0746, a possible DNS system.

          Comments: 12 pages, accepted for publication in ApJ Letters
          We  show  that  the irradiated accretion disk model can account
          for  all the optical and infrared observations of the anomalous
          X-ray  pulsars  in  the  persistent  state.  Model  fits do not
          constrain the outer disk radii, while placing an upper limit to
          the  inner  disk  radii, and thus to the strength of the dipole
          component  of the stellar magnetic field. While magnetar fields
          (B_*  > 10^{14} G) in higher multipoles are compatible with the
          irradiated  disk  model, magnetic dipole components of magnetar
          strength are not consistent with optical data.

          Title:  Measuring  coalescing  massive  binary black holes with
          gravitational waves: The impact of spin-induced precession
          Authors: Ryan N. Lang, Scott A. Hughes
          Comments: 22 pages, 10 figures
          The  coalescence of massive black holes generates gravitational
          waves  (GWs)  that  will be measurable by space-based detectors
          such  as LISA to large redshifts. The spins of a binary's black
          holes  have  an important impact on its waveform. Specifically,
          geodetic   and  gravitomagnetic  effects  cause  the  spins  to
          precess;  this  precession  then modulates the waveform, adding
          periodic  structure  which encodes useful information about the
          binary's  members.  Following  pioneering  work  by Vecchio, we
          examine  the  impact  upon  GW  measurements of including these
          precession-induced  modulations  in the waveform model. We find
          that  the  additional periodicity due to spin precession breaks
          degeneracies  among  certain  parameters, greatly improving the
          accuracy  with  which they may be measured. In particular, mass
          measurements  are  improved  tremendously,  by  one  to several
          orders  of  magnitude. Localization of the source on the sky is
          also  improved,  though not as much -- low redshift systems can
          be localized to an ellipse which is roughly $10- {a few} \times
          10$  arcminutes  in  the  long direction and a factor of 2 -- 5
          smaller   in   the   short  direction.  Though  not  a  drastic
          improvement relative to analyses which neglect spin precession,
          even   modest   gains   in  source  localization  will  greatly
          facilitate  searches  for  electromagnetic  counterparts  to GW
          events.  Determination  of  distance  to the source is likewise
          improved:  We  find  that relative error in measured luminosity
          distance  is  commonly  $\sim 0.1-0.4%$ at $z \sim 1$. Finally,
          with the inclusion of precession, we find that the magnitude of
          the  spins  themselves  can  typically  be  determined  for low
          redshift   systems  with  an  accuracy  of  about  $0.1-10  %$,
          depending  on the spin value, allowing accurate surveys of mass
          and spin evolution over cosmic time.

          Title: Limits on Neutron Lorentz Violation from Pulsar Timing
          Authors: B. Altschul
          Comments: 9 pages
          Pulsars  are  the most accurate naturally occurring clocks, and
          data  about  them  can  be used to set bounds on neutron-sector
          Lorentz  violations.  If  SO(3) rotation symmetry is completely
          broken  for  neutrons,  then pulsars' rotation speeds will vary
          periodically.   Pulsar   timing   data   limits   the  relevant
          Lorentz-violating coefficients to be smaller than 1.7 x 10^(-8)
          at at least 90% confidence.

          Title:   Optical   Intensity  Interferometry  with  Atmospheric
          Cherenkov Telescope Arrays
          Authors: S. Le Bohec, J. Holder
          Comments: Accepted for publicaion in ApJ
          In the 1970s, the Narrabri intensity interferometer was used to
          measure   32   stellar   diameters;   some   as  small  as  0.4
          milli-arc-seconds (mas). The interferometer consisted of a pair
          of  6.5m  telescopes  with  relatively crude optics, similar to
          those  currently  in  use  as  Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
          (ACT).  We  explore  the  possibility  of implementing a modern
          intensity  interferometer on an ACT array. Developments in fast
          digital  signal  processing  technology  now make such a system
          relatively easy to implement, and provide improved sensitivity.
          Allowing  measurements  at short wavelength (<400nm), with long
          baselines  (>  100m), which are still challenging for Michelson
          interferometers,  present  ACT  arrays  could  be used to probe
          angular  structures as small as ~0.2mas, and smaller with large
          array  projects  already  being  discussed.  This would provide
          measurements    of    stellar    diameters,   binary   systems,
          circumstellar   environments  and,  possibly,  stellar  surface
          features. ACT arrays could be used as intensity interferometers
          during  bright  moon  periods,  providing  valuable  scientific
          output  for  little  expense  and  no  impact  on the gamma-ray
          observing schedule.

          astronomical  phenomenon,  characterised  by  occasional  brief
          radio  bursts,  with  average  intervals between bursts ranging
          from  minutes to hours. The burst spacings allow identification
          of periodicities, which fall in the range 0.4 to 7 seconds. The
          RRATs  thus  seem  to  be  rotating  neutron stars, albeit with
          properties  very  different from the rest of the population. We
          here present the serendipitous detection with the Chandra X-ray

          one  of  the  RRATs.  We  discuss  the  temporal  and  spectral

          Title: Neutron star binaries and long duration gamma-ray bursts
          Authors: Andrew J. Levan, Melvyn B. Davies, Andrew R. King
          Comments: 7 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Cosmological long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are thought
          to  originate from the core collapse to black holes of stripped
          massive   stars.   Those   with   sufficient  rotation  form  a
          centrifugally-supported torus whose collapse powers the GRB. We
          investigate  the role of tidal locking within a tight binary as
          a  source  of  the necessary angular momentum. We find that the
          binary  orbit  must  be  no  wider than a few solar radii for a
          torus  to  form upon core collapse. Comparing this criterion to
          the  observed  population  of  binaries  containing two compact
          objects  suggests  that rotation may have been important in the
          formation  of  up  to  50%  of  the  observed systems. As these
          systems  created  a  neutron  star  and  not  a black hole they
          presumably  did  not  produce  highly luminous GRBs. We suggest
          instead  that  they  make  the subset of GRBs in the relatively
          local universe which have much lower luminosity.

          with creeping neutron vortices
          Authors: Bennett Link
          Comments: 4 pages
          Aims:  To  determine whether ``vortex creep'' in neutron stars,
          the  slow  motion  of  neutron vortices with respect to pinning
          sites   in   the  core  or  inner  crust,  is  consistent  with
          observations  of  long-period  precession.  Methods:  Using the
          concept  of vortex drag, I discuss the precession dynamics of a
          star  with  imperfectly-pinned  (i.e.,  "creeping'')  vortices.
          Results:  The  precession  frequency  is  far  too  high  to be
          consistent  with  observations,  indicating  that  the standard
          picture  of the inner core (superfluid neutrons in co-existence
          with  type II, superconducting protons) should be reconsidered.
          There  is  a slow precession mode, but it is highly over-damped
          and cannot complete even a single cycle. Moreover, the vortices
          of the inner crust must be able to move with little dissipation
          with respect to the solid.

          Letters
          The   formation   of   brown   dwarfs  via  encounters  between
          proto-stars  has  been confirmed with high-resolution numerical
          simulations   with   a  restricted  treatment  of  the  thermal
          conditions.  The  new  results indicate that young brown dwarfs
          (BDs)  formed  this  way  are  disk-like  and  often  reside in
          multiple systems. The newly-formed proto-BDs disks are up to 18
          AU   in  size  and  spin  rapidly  making  small-scale  bipolar
          outflows, fragmentation and the possible formation of planetary
          companions  likely  as have recently been observed for BDs. The
          object masses range from 2 to 73 Jupiter masses, distributed in
          a  manner consistent with the observed sub-stellar initial mass
          function.   The   simulations  usually  form  multiple  BDs  on
          eccentric   orbits   about   a   star.   One  such  system  was
          hierarchical,  a  BD  binary  in orbit around a star, which may
          explain  recently  observed  hierarchical systems. One third of
          the   BDs   were   unbound  after  a  few  thousand  years  and
          interactions  among  orbiting  BDs may eject more or add to the
          number  of  binaries.  Improvements  over  prior  work  include
          resolution  down  to  a Jupiter mass, self-consistent models of
          the  vertical  structure  of  the  initial  disks  and  careful
          attention to avoid artificial fragmentation.

          between  140  Mo  and  200  Mo which produce a relatively small
          amount  of  Fe, and those with a mass between 200 Mo and 260 Mo
          where  the  Fe-yield  ejected during the supernova explosion is
          enormous. We first demonstrate that the inclusion of the second
          group   into  a  chemical  evolutionary  model  for  the  Solar
          Neighbourhood  predicts an early temporal evolution of Fe which
          is at variance with observations whereas it can not be excluded
          that the first group could have been present. We then show that
          a  low  metallicity binary with very massive components (with a
          mass corresponding to the first group) can be an efficient site
          of  primary  14N  production  through the explosion of a binary
          component  that  has  been  polluted  by  the  pair instability
          supernova  ejecta  of  its  companion.  When we implement these
          massive  binary  14N  yields  in a chemical evolution model, we
          conclude  that  very  massive  close  binaries may be important
          sites  of  14N  enrichment  during  the  early evolution of the
          Galaxy.

          Title: Quark Matter in Neutron Stars: An apercu
          Authors: Prashanth Jaikumar, Sanjay Reddy, Andrew W. Steiner
          Comments: 15 pages, 1 figure. Invited review for Modern Physics
          Letters A
          The  existence  of  deconfined  quark  matter in the superdense
          interior  of  neutron  stars  is  a key question that has drawn
          considerable  attention over the past few decades. Quark matter
          can  comprise  an  arbitrary fraction of the star, from 0 for a
          pure  neutron star to 1 for a pure quark star, depending on the
          equation   of   state  of  matter  at  high  density.  From  an
          astrophysical  viewpoint, these two extreme cases are generally
          expected  to  manifest  different  observational signatures. An
          intermediate fraction implies a hybrid star, where the interior
          consists  of  mixed  or homogeneous phases of quark and nuclear
          matter,  depending on surface and Coulomb energy costs, as well
          as  other  finite  size  and  screening  effects. In this brief
          review  article,  we  discuss  what  we  can deduce about quark
          matter   in   neutron   stars   in  light  of  recent  exciting
          developments   in  neutron  star  observations.  We  state  the
          theoretical  ideas  underlying  the  equation of state of dense
          quark  matter, including color superconducting quark matter. We
          also  highlight recent advances stemming from re-examination of
          an  old  paradigm  for the surface structure of quark stars and
          discuss  possible  evolutionary scenarios from neutron stars to
          quark stars, with emphasis on astrophysical observations.

          Comments: Accepted by ApJ. 13 pages, 10 figures
          We  have carried out a sensitive high-resolution imaging survey
          of stars in the young (6-8 Myr), nearby (97 pc) compact cluster
          around  eta Chamaeleontis to search for stellar and sub-stellar
          companions.  Given  its  youth  and  proximity, any sub-stellar
          companions  are expected to be luminous, especially in the near
          infrared, and thus easier to detect next to their parent stars.
          Here,   we   present  VLT/NACO  adaptive  optics  imaging  with
          companion  detection limits for 17 eta Cha cluster members, and
          follow-up  VLT/ISAAC  near-infrared  spectroscopy for companion
          candidates.  The widest binary detected is ~0.2", corresponding
          to  the  projected  separation  20 AU, despite our survey being
          sensitive  down  to  sub-stellar  companions  outside 0.3", and
          planetary  mass  objects  outside  0.5".  This implies that the
          stellar  companion probability outside 0.3" and the brown dwarf
          companion  probability outside 0.5" are less than 0.16 with 95%
          confidence.  We compare the wide binary frequency of eta Cha to
          that  of the similarly aged TW Hydrae association, and estimate
          the  statistical likelihood that the wide binary probability is
          equal  in  both  groups  to  be < 2e-4. Even though the eta Cha
          cluster  is relatively dense, stellar encounters in its present
          configuration  cannot  account for the relative deficit of wide
          binaries.  We  thus conclude that the difference in wide binary
          probability  in  these  two groups provides strong evidence for
          multiplicity  properties being dependent on environment. In two
          appendices  we  derive  the  projected  separation  probability
          distribution   for   binaries,   used   to  constrain  physical
          separations  from observed projected separations, and summarize

          We  report  the discovery of an eclipsing X-ray binary in M101,
          the first such system to be discovered outside the Local Group.
          Based  on  a  sequence of 25 Chandra observations that sample a
          wide  range of orbital phases, we find a period of 32.688 $\pm$
          0.002  hours,  which  we  interpret  as  an orbital period. The
          folded  light  curve exhibits an eclipse lasting about 8 hours,
          suggesting  a compact orbit in an nearly edge-on configuration.
          The  X-ray  binary has an average luminosity of $L_X(0.3-8 {\rm
          keV})  \approx  1.3\times10^{38}$ erg/sec, with only one out of
          the  25  observations  significantly  lower  in  flux  than the
          average  light curve.The presence of the eclipse and the $\sim$
          1.4-day  orbital  period suggests that this source is an analog
          of  the  well studied eclipsing X-ray binary pulsars Her X-1 or
          LMC X-4. Combining the Chandra data and the HST ACS/WFC images,
          we  have  identified  several  possible  optical  counterparts,
          including  an  O5-O3  star  with  V  =  25.0. Follow-up optical
          monitoring  observations  should  be able to identify the donor
          and further constrain the orbital properties.

          imaging  together  with follow up spectroscopy reveals four new
          WR stars, of which three were independently identified recently

          classification  scheme for WR stars is presented and applied to
          members  of  Westerlund  1. Late subtypes are dominant, with no
          subtypes  earlier  than  WN5 or WC8 for the nitrogen and carbon
          sequences,  respectively.  A  qualitative  inspection of the WN
          stars  suggests  that most (75%) are highly H-deficient. The WR
          binary  fraction  is high (>62%), on the basis of dust emission
          from  WC stars, in addition to a significant WN binary fraction
          from hard X-ray detections according to Clark et al. We exploit
          the  large  WN  population  of  Westerlund  1  to  reassess its

          observed  ratio  of  WR  stars  to  red and yellow hypergiants,

          individual  WR stars descended from progenitors of initial mass
          ~  40-55  Msun.  Qualitative  estimates  of  current masses for
          non-dusty, H-free WR stars are presented, revealing 10-18 Msun,
          such that ~75% of the initial stellar mass has been removed via
          stellar  winds or close binary evolution. We present a revision
          to  the  cluster  turn-off mass for other Milky Way clusters in
          which  WR  stars  are  known, based upon the latest temperature
          calibration  for  OB  stars.  Finally,  comparisons between the

          We  calculate the thermal conductivity of electrons produced by
          electron-electron  Coulomb  scattering in a strongly degenerate
          electron   gas  taking  into  account  the  Landau  damping  of
          transverse  plasmons.  The Landau damping strongly reduces this
          conductivity  in  the  domain of ultrarelativistic electrons at
          temperatures  below  the  electron  plasma  temperature. In the
          inner  crust  of  a neutron star at temperatures T < 1e7 K this
          thermal  conductivity  completely  dominates  over the electron
          conductivity  due  to electron-ion (electron-phonon) scattering
          and  becomes competitive with the the electron conductivity due
          to scattering of electrons by impurity ions.

          Title: Magnetar Corona
          Authors: A. M. Beloborodov, C. Thompson
          Comments:  9 pages, 6 figures; talk at "Isolated Neutron Stars:
          from the Interior to the Surface," London, April 2006
          Persistent  high-energy  emission of magnetars is produced by a
          plasma corona around the neutron star, with total energy output
          of  ~10^{36}erg/s.  The  corona forms as a result of occasional
          starquakes  that  twist the external magnetic field of the star
          and  induce electric currents in the closed magnetosphere. Once
          twisted,  the  magnetosphere cannot untwist immediately because
          of  its self-induction. The self-induction electric field lifts
          particles  from  the  stellar  surface,  accelerates  them, and
          initiates avalanches of pair creation in the magnetosphere. The
          created  plasma  corona maintains the electric current demanded
          by   curl(B)   and   regulates  the  self-induction  e.m.f.  by
          screening.  This  corona persists in dynamic equilibrium: it is
          continually  lost  to the stellar surface on the light-crossing
          time  and  replenished  with  new  particles.  In  essence, the
          twisted  magnetosphere acts as an accelerator that converts the
          toroidal  field  energy to particle kinetic energy. The voltage
          along the magnetic field lines is maintained near threshold for
          ignition  of  pair  production, in the regime of self-organized
          criticality. The voltage is found to be about 1 GeV which is in
          agreement  with  the  observed dissipation rate \~10^{36}erg/s.
          The  coronal  particles  impact  the  solid  crust,  knock  out
          protons,  and  regulate  the  column density of the hydrostatic
          atmosphere  of  the  star.  The  transition  layer  between the
          atmosphere  and the corona is the likely source of the observed
          100-keV   emission   from  magnetars.  The  corona  also  emits
          curvature radiation up to 10^{14}Hz and can supply the observed
          IR-optical luminosity.

          between degenerate electrons

          We  calculate the thermal conductivity of electrons produced by
          electron-electron  Coulomb  scattering in a strongly degenerate
          electron   gas  taking  into  account  the  Landau  damping  of
          transverse  plasmons.  The Landau damping strongly reduces this
          conductivity  in  the  domain of ultrarelativistic electrons at
          temperatures  below  the  electron  plasma  temperature. In the
          inner  crust  of  a neutron star at temperatures T < 1e7 K this
          thermal  conductivity  completely  dominates  over the electron
          conductivity  due  to electron-ion (electron-phonon) scattering
          and  becomes competitive with the the electron conductivity due
          to scattering of electrons by impurity ions.

          Title: Magnetar Corona
          Authors: A. M. Beloborodov, C. Thompson
          Comments:  9 pages, 6 figures; talk at "Isolated Neutron Stars:
          from the Interior to the Surface," London, April 2006
          Persistent  high-energy  emission of magnetars is produced by a
          plasma corona around the neutron star, with total energy output
          of  ~10^{36}erg/s.  The  corona forms as a result of occasional
          starquakes  that  twist the external magnetic field of the star
          and  induce electric currents in the closed magnetosphere. Once
          twisted,  the  magnetosphere cannot untwist immediately because
          of  its self-induction. The self-induction electric field lifts
          particles  from  the  stellar  surface,  accelerates  them, and
          initiates avalanches of pair creation in the magnetosphere. The
          created  plasma  corona maintains the electric current demanded
          by   curl(B)   and   regulates  the  self-induction  e.m.f.  by
          screening.  This  corona persists in dynamic equilibrium: it is
          continually  lost  to the stellar surface on the light-crossing
          time  and  replenished  with  new  particles.  In  essence, the
          twisted  magnetosphere acts as an accelerator that converts the
          toroidal  field  energy to particle kinetic energy. The voltage
          along the magnetic field lines is maintained near threshold for
          ignition  of  pair  production, in the regime of self-organized
          criticality. The voltage is found to be about 1 GeV which is in
          agreement  with  the  observed dissipation rate \~10^{36}erg/s.
          The  coronal  particles  impact  the  solid  crust,  knock  out
          protons,  and  regulate  the  column density of the hydrostatic
          atmosphere  of  the  star.  The  transition  layer  between the
          atmosphere  and the corona is the likely source of the observed
          100-keV   emission   from  magnetars.  The  corona  also  emits
          curvature radiation up to 10^{14}Hz and can supply the observed
          IR-optical luminosity.

          Title: X-ray Variability in the Young Massive Triple theta2 Ori
          A
          Authors: Norbert S. Schulz, Paola Testa, David P. Huenemoerder,
          Kazunori  Ishibashi,  Claude  R. Canizares (Kavli Institute for
          Astrophysics  and  Space  Research,  Massachusetts Institute of

          Astrophysical Main Journal
          Massive stars rarely show intrinsic X-ray variability. The only
          O-stars  credited to be intrinsically variable are theta1 Ori C
          due  to  effects  from  magnetic  confinement  of its wind, and
          theta2  Ori  A  suspected  of  similar  activity. Early Chandra
          observations  have  shown  that the most massive star system in
          the   Orion  Trapezium  Cluster,  theta2  Ori  A,  shows  rapid
          variability  on time scales of hours. We determine X-ray fluxes
          and  find  that the star shows very strong variability over the
          last  5  years.  We  observed  a second large X-ray outburst in
          November  2004  with  the  high resolution transmission grating
          spectrometer   on-board   Chandra.   In  the  low  state  X-ray
          emissivities  indicate  temperatures  well  above 25 MK. In the
          high  state  we  find  an extended emissivity distribution with
          high  emissivities  in  the range from 3 MK to over 100 MK. The
          outburst  event  in  stellar  terms is one of the most powerful
          ever  observed  and  the  most  energetic one in the ONC with a
          lower   total   energy   limit  of  1.5x10^37  ergs.  The  line
          diagnostics  show  that  under  the  assumption  that  the line
          emitting  regions in the low states are as close as within 1 --
          2 stellar radii from the O-star's photosphere, whereas the hard
          states  suggest  a  distance  of  3 -- 5 stellar radii. The two
          outbursts  are  very  close  to  the  periastron passage of the
          stars.  We  argue  that  the high X-ray states are possibly the
          result of reconnection events from magnetic interactions of the
          primary  and  secondary  stars  of  the  spectroscopic  binary.
          Effects from wind collisions seem unlikely for this system. The
          low  state  emissivity  and R-ratios strengthen the predicament
          that  the X-ray emission is enhanced by magnetic confinement of
          the  primary wind. We also detect Fe fluorescence indicative of
          the  existence  of  substantial  amounts  of  neutral Fe in the
          vicinity of the X-ray emission.

          The  five  enigmatic  Cocoon  stars  after which the Quintuplet
          cluster  was  christened  have  puzzled astronomers since their
          discovery.   Their   extraordinary  cool,  featureless  thermal
          spectra  have  been  attributed  to  various stellar types from
          young  to  highly  evolved,  while  their absolute luminosities
          places    them    among    the    supergiants.    We    present
          diffraction-limited  images  from  the  Keck  1 telescope which
          resolves  this  debate  with  the  discovery of rotating spiral
          plumes   characteristic  of  colliding-wind  binary  "pinwheel"
          nebulae.   Such   elegant   spiral   structures,  found  around
          high-luminosity Wolf-Rayet stars, have recently been implicated
          in  the  behavior  of  supernovae  lightcurves in the radio and
          optical.

          Title:  The  Turn-On  of  Mass  Transfer  in  AM  CVn Binaries:
          Implications for RX J0806+1527 and RX J1914+2456
          Authors:   Christopher  J.  Deloye  (Northwestern  University),
          Ronald E. Taam (Northwestern University)
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, accepted to ApJL
          We  report  on  evolutionary  calculations of the onset of mass
          transfer  in AM CVn binaries, treating the donor's evolution in
          detail.  We show that during the early contact phase, while the
          mass  transfer  rate, $\Mdot$, is increasing, gravity wave (GW)
          emission  continues  to  drive  the  binary  to shorter orbital
          period,  $\Porb$. We argue that the phase where $\Mdot > 0$ and
          $\nudot  >  0$  ($\nu  =  1/\Porb$) can last between $10^3$ and
          $10^6$  yrs,  significantly  longer  than previously estimated.
          These  results  are  applied to RX J0806+1527 ($\Porb = 321$ s)
          and  RX  J914+2456 ($\Porb=569$ s), both of which have measured
          $\nudot  >  0$.  \emph{Thus,  a  $\nudot  >  0$ does not select
          between  the  unipolar  inductor  and  accretion  driven models
          proposed  as  the  source  of X-rays in these systems}. For the
          accretion  model,  we  predict  for  RX  J0806 that $\ddot{\nu}
          \approx  \ee{1.0-1.5}{-28}$  Hz  s$^{-2}$ and argue that timing
          observations  can probe $\ddot{\nu}$ at this level with a total
          $\approx  20$  yr  baseline.  We also place constraints on each
          system's initial parameters given current observational data.

          Kolev, P. Simeon, D. Toback, P. Wagner
          Comments: 14 pages, 6 figures, and 1 table
          We  study  the  prospects  for  the  measurement  of the stau -
          lightest  neutralino  mass  difference (dM) and the gluino mass
          (Mg)  in  the  supersymmetric co-annihilation region at the LHC
          using  tau  leptons.  Recent WMAP measurements of the amount of
          cold  dark matter and previous accelerator experiments indicate
          that  the allowed parameter space of mSUGRA is characterized by
          a  small dM (5-15 GeV). Focusing on taus from N2 -> tau stau ->
          tau  tau N1 decays in gluino and squark production, we consider
          inclusive  3 tau+jet+missing Et production, with two taus above
          a  high  Et  threshold and a third tau above a lower threshold.
          Two  observables, the number of opposite-signed tau pairs minus
          the  number  of like-signed tau pairs and the peak of the ditau
          invariant   mass   distribution,  allow  for  the  simultaneous
          determination  of  dM,  and Mg. For dM = 9 GeV and Mg = 850 GeV
          and  with  30 fb^-1 of data, we can measure dM to 15% and Mg to
          6%.

          Title: Astrophysics of extreme mass ratio inspiral sources
          Authors: Clovis Hopman (Leiden Observatory)
          Comments:  Invited  contribution  to the 6th International LISA
          Symposium
          Compact  remnants  on  orbits  with  peri-apses  close  to  the
          Schwarzschild radius of a massive black hole (MBH) lose orbital
          energy  by  emitting  gravitational  waves (GWs) and spiral in.
          Scattering  with other stars allows successful inspiral of such
          extreme  mass  ratio inspiral sources (EMRIs) only within small
          distances,  a < few \times 0.01 pc from the MBH. The event rate
          of  EMRIs  is  therefore  dominated by the stellar dynamics and
          content in the inner few \times 0.01 pc. I discuss the relevant
          dynamical aspects and resulting estimated event rates of EMRIs.
          Subjects considered include the loss-cone treatment of inspiral
          sources; mass segregation; resonant relaxation; and alternative
          routes  to  EMRI  formation  such  as tidal binary disruptions,
          stellar  formation  in  disks and tidal capture of massive main
          sequence stars. The EMRI event rate is estimated to be of order
          few  \times  10^2/Gyr  per  MBH, giving excellent prospects for
          observation by LISA.

          for Global Torsional Vibrations
          Authors: Tod E. Strohmayer, Anna L. Watts
          Comments:   27   pages,   10   figures,  AASTeX.  Accepted  for
          Publication in the Astrophysical Journal
          We  report  an  analysis  of  the  archival  Rossi X-ray Timing
          Explorer (RXTE) data from the December 2004 hyperflare from SGR
          1806-20.  In  addition  to  the  90  Hz QPO first discovered by
          Israel  et  al.,  we  report  the detection of higher frequency
          oscillations  at  150,  625, and 1,840 Hz. In addition, we also
          find indications of oscillations at 720, and 2,384 Hz, but with
          lower significances. The 150 Hz QPO has a width (FWHM) of about
          17  Hz, an average amplitude (rms) of 6.8 %, and is detected in
          average  power  spectra centered on the rotational phase of the
          strongest peak in the pulse profile. This is approximately half
          a  cycle from the phase at which the 90 Hz QPO is detected. The
          625  Hz  oscillation  was detected in an average power spectrum
          from nine successive cycles beginning approximately 180 s after
          the  initial  hard  spike. It has a width (FWHM) of 2 Hz and an
          average  amplitude (rms) during this interval of 8.5 %. We find
          a  strong  detection  of  the  625  Hz oscillation in a pair of
          successive rotation cycles begining about 230 s after the start
          of  the flare. In these cycles we also detect the 1,840 Hz QPO.
          When   the   625  Hz  QPO  is  detected  we  also  confirm  the
          simultaneous  presence  of  30  and  92  Hz  QPOs. The centroid
          frequency  of  the 625 Hz QPO detected with RXTE is within 1 Hz
          of  the  626  Hz oscillation recently found in RHESSI data from
          this  hyperflare by Watts & Strohmayer. We argue that these new
          findings  provide  further  evidence  for a connection of these
          oscillations with global oscillation modes of neutron stars, in
          particular,  the  high frequency signals may represent toroidal
          modes  with  at  least one radial node in the crust. We discuss
          their  implications in the context of this model, in particular
          for the depth of neutron star crusts

          The  population  of  clearly identified anomalous X-ray pulsars
          has  recently  grown to seven, however, one candidate anomalous
          X-ray  pulsar  (AXP)  still  eludes  re-confirmation.  Here, we
          present  a  set  of  seven  Chandra  ACIS-S observations of the
          transient  pulsar  AX  J1845.0-0258,  obtained during 2003. Our
          observations  reveal a faint X-ray point source within the ASCA
          error circle of AX J1845.0-0258's discovery, which we designate
          CXOU J184454.6-025653 and tentatively identify as the quiescent
          AXP.   Its   spectrum   is   well   described  by  an  absorbed
          single-component   blackbody   (kT~2.0   keV)   or   power  law
          (Gamma~1.0)  that  is  steady in flux on timescales of at least
          months,  but  fainter  than AX J1845.0-0258 was during its 1993
          period  of  X-ray  enhancement  by  at  least  a  factor of 13.
          Compared  to  the  outburst  spectrum  of AX J1845.0-0258, CXOU
          J184454.6-025653   is   considerably   harder:   if  truly  the
          counterpart,  then  its  spectral behaviour is contrary to that
          seen  in  the  established  transient  AXP XTE J1810-197, which
          softened  from  kT~0.67  keV  to  ~0.18 keV in quiescence. This
          unexpected result prompts us to examine the possibility that we
          have   observed   an  unrelated  source,  and  we  discuss  the
          implications for AXPs, and magnetars in general.

          Title:  A  three  stage model for the inner engine of Gamma Ray
          Burst: Prompt emission and early afterglow
          Authors: Jan Staff, Rachid Ouyed, Manjari Bagchi
          Comments: submitted to ApJ
          We  propose  a  new model within the ``Quark-nova'' scenario to
          interpret  the  recent observations of early afterglows of long
          Gamma-Ray  Bursts  (GRB)  with  the  Swift satellite. This is a
          three-stage   model  within  the  context  of  a  core-collapse
          supernova.  Stage  1  is  an  accreting  (proto-)  neutron star
          leading  to  a possible delay between the core collapse and the
          GRB.  Stage 2 is an accreting quark-star, generating the prompt
          GRB.  Stage 3, which occurs only if the quark-star collapses to
          form a black-hole, consists of an accreting black-hole. The jet
          launched  in  this  accretion process interacts with the ejecta
          from  stage 2, and can generate the flaring activity frequently
          seen  in  X-ray afterglows. This model can account for both the
          energies  and  the timescales of GRBs, in addition to the newly
          discovered early X-ray afterglow features.

          Science, in press
          We  present  the  latest  results from a multi-epoch timing and
          spectral  study  of  the  Transient  Anomalous X-ray Pulsar XTE
          J1810-197.  We  have acquired seven observations of this pulsar
          with  the  Newton  X-ray Multi-mirror Mission (XMM-Newton) over
          the  course  of  two  and  a half years, to follow the spectral
          evolution  as  the  source fades from outburst. The spectrum is
          arguably  best  characterized  by  a  two-temperature blackbody
          whose  luminosities  are  decreasing exponentially with tau_1 =
          870  days  and tau_2 = 280 days, respectively. The temperatures
          of  these components are currently cooling at a rate of 22% per
          year from a nearly constant value recorded at earlier epochs of
          kT_1 = 0.25 keV and kT_2 = 0.67 keV, respectively. The new data
          show  that the temperature T_1 and luminosity of that component
          have  nearly  returned  to  their historic quiescent levels and
          that  its  pulsed  fraction,  which has steadily decreased with
          time,  is  now  consistent  with  the previous lack of detected
          pulsations  in  quiescence. We also summarize the detections of
          radio  emission from XTE J1810-197, the first confirmed for any
          AXP.  We consider possible models for the emission geometry and
          mechanisms of XTE J1810-197.

          The  recent  discovery  of  high  frequency oscillations during
          giant  flares from the Soft Gamma Repeaters SGR 1806-20 and SGR
          1900+14  may  be  the first direct detection of vibrations in a
          neutron star crust. If this interpretation is correct it offers
          a  novel  means  of testing the neutron star equation of state,
          crustal  breaking  strain, and magnetic field configuration. We
          review  the  observational  data  on the magnetar oscillations,
          including  new  timing  analysis of the SGR 1806-20 giant flare
          using  data  from  the  Ramaty  High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
          Imager  (RHESSI) and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). We
          discuss   the  implications  for  the  study  of  neutron  star
          structure  and  crust  thickness,  and outline areas for future
          investigation.

          Comments:   8   pages,  4  figures.  To  be  published  in  the

          S. Zane
          Unique  among  neutron stars, 1E 1207.4-5209 is an X-ray pulsar
          with  a spin period of 424 ms that contains at least two strong
          absorption  features  in its energy spectrum. This neutron star
          has  been  identified  as  a  member of the radio-quiet compact
          central  objects  in supernova remnants. It has been found that
          1E  1207.4-5209  is  not spinning down monotonically suggesting
          that  this  neutron  star  undergoes strong, frequent glitches,
          contains a fall-back disk, or possess a binary companion. Here,
          we  report on a sequence of seven XMM-Newton observations of 1E
          1207.4-5209 performed during a 40 day window in June/July 2005.
          Due  to unanticipated variance in the phase measurements beyond
          the  statistical  uncertainties, we could not identify a unique
          phase-coherent  timing solution. The three most probable timing
          solutions  give  frequency  time derivatives of +0.9, -2.6, and
          +1.6   X   10^(-12)   Hz/s   (listed  in  descending  order  of
          significance).  We conclude that the local frequency derivative
          during  our  XMM-Newton  observing  campaign  differs  from the
          long-term  spin-down  rate  by more than an order of magnitude,
          effectively ruling out glitch models for 1E 1207.4-5209. If the
          long-term spin frequency variations are caused by timing noise,
          the  strength  of  the  timing  noise in 1E 1207.4-5209 is much
          stronger than in other pulsars with similar period derivatives.
          Therefore,  it  is highly unlikely that the spin variations are
          caused by the same physical process that causes timing noise in
          other  isolated  pulsars.  The  most plausible scenario for the
          observed  spin  irregularities  is  the  presence  of  a binary
          companion  to 1E 1207.4-5209. We identified a family of orbital
          solutions  that  are consistent with our phase-connected timing
          solution,  archival  frequency measurements, and constraints on
          the   companions   mass   imposed   by   deep  IR  and  optical
          observations.

          Title: Faint X-ray Structure in the Crab Pulsar-Wind Nebula
          Authors: F. D. Seward, W. H. Tucker, R. A. Fesen
          Comments: accepted by ApJ, 26 pages including 12 figures
          We  report  on  a  Chandra  observation of the Crab Nebula that
          gives  the first clear view of the faint boundary of the Crab's
          X-ray-emitting Pulsar Wind Nebula, or PWN.
          There is structure in all directions. Fingers, loops, bays, and
          the  South  Pulsar  Jet  all  indicate  that either filamentary
          material or the magnetic field are controlling the relativistic
          electrons.  In  general,  spectra  soften  as distance from the
          pulsar  increases  but  do  not  change  rapidly  along  linear
          features.  This  is  particularly  true for the Pulsar Jet. The
          termination  of the Jet is abrupt; the E side is close to an [O
          {\small   III}]   optical   filament   which  may  be  blocking
          propagation  on  this  side. We argue that linear features have
          ordered magnetic fields and that the structure is determined by
          the  synchrotron  lifetime of particles diffusing perpendicular
          and  parallel  to  the  magnetic  field. We find no significant
          evidence for thermal X-rays inside the filamentary envelope.

          Greenbelt, Maryland
          Based  on  a high resolution cosmological n-body simulation, we
          track the hierarchical growth of black holes in galaxy clusters
          from  z=20  to  z=0.  We  present  a  census  of black holes as
          function  of  redshift  and  will determine their mass assembly
          history under a variety of assumptions regarding the importance
          of gas accretion in black hole growth, from early supercritical
          Eddington   accretion   to   gas-poor   hierarchical  assembly.
          Following  a  galaxy  merger, black holes are expected to form,
          inspiral   and   merge  after  strongly  radiating  energy  via
          gravitational  waves.  For  each binary black hole inspiral and
          merger, we determine the expected gravitational wave signal for
          the  Laser  Interferometer  Space Antenna (LISA), and calculate
          the  LISA  event  rate as a function of time. We will calculate
          the  black  hole  mass  assembly history for several black hole
          growth  scenerios, so that we can explore tests to characterize
          each  model  observationally.  In particular, we will study how
          well  LISA  observations  will  be  able to distinguish between
          these very different assembly scenarios.

          We  present an analysis of the accreting X-ray pulsar system 4U
          1907+09 based on INTEGRAL data. The main focus of this analysis
          is  a  study of the timing behavior of this source. In addition
          we  also  show  an  analysis of the 5-90 keV spectrum. The data
          were  extracted  using  the official INTEGRAL software OSA 5.1.
          Timing  analysis  was  performed using epoch folding and pulsar
          pulse phasing. We have measured 12 individual pulse periods for
          the  years  2003  to 2005. We confirm earlier RXTE results that
          during  2003  the  spin down became slower and show furthermore
          that  after this phase 4U 1907+09 started to spin up with dP/dt
          =  -0.158  s/yr  in  2004.  The  similarity of the pulse period
          histories  of 4U 1907+09 and 4U 1626-26 suggests that accretion
          onto  an oblique rotator, as recently proposed by Perna et al.,
          is a possible explanation for this change.

          results  show  that  at  4600-7000  AA  the  spectrum is almost
          featureless  and  flat  with a spectral index $\alpha_nu ~ -0.2

          The  degenerate  shell case with applications to SGRs, AXPs and
          XDINs
          Authors: Rachid Ouyed, Denis Leahy, Brian Niebergal
          Comments: submitted to ApJ
          We explore the formation and evolution of debris ejected around
          quark  stars in the Quark Nova scenario, and the application to
          Soft  Gamma-ray  Repeaters  (SGRs)  and Anomolous X-ray Pulsars
          (AXPs).  If  an isolated neutron star explodes as a Quark Nova,
          an  Iron-rich  shell  of  degenerate  matter  forms  out of the
          fall-back  (crust)  material. Our model can account for many of
          the  observed  features  of  SGRs and AXPs such as: (i) the two
          types  of  bursts  (giant  and  regular);  (ii) the spin-up and
          spin-down   episodes  during  and  following  the  bursts  with
          associated   persistant   increases  in  $\dot{P}$;  (iii)  the
          energetics  of  the  boxing  day  burst, SGR1806$+$20; (iv) the
          presence  of  an Iron line as observed in SGR1900$+$14; (v) the
          correlation  between  the  far-Infrared  and  the  X-ray fluxes
          during  the  bursting episode and the quiescent phase; (vi) the
          hard  X-ray component observed in SGRs during the giant bursts,
          and  (vii)  the  discrepancy  between the ages of SGRs/AXPs and
          their  supernova  remnants. We also find a natural evolutionary
          relationship  between SGRs and AXPs in our model which predicts
          that  only  the  youngest  SGRs/AXPs are most likely to exhibit
          strong  bursting.  Many  features of X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron
          stars  (XDINs) are also accounted for in our model such as, (i)
          the  two-component blackbody spectra; (ii) the absorption lines
          around 300 eV; and (iii) the excess optical emission.

          Title:  The  r-Process  in  the  Proto-Neutron-Star  Winds with
          Anisotropic Neutrino Emission
          Authors: Shinya Wanajo
          Comments:  8  pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          Letters
          The  astrophysical  origin  of  the  r-process  nuclei is still
          unknown.  Even the most promising scenario, the neutrino-driven
          winds   from   a   nascent   neutron  star,  encounters  severe
          difficulties  in  obtaining requisite entropy and short dynamic
          timescale  for  the  r-process.  In  this  study, the effect of
          anisotropy  in  neutrino  emission  from  a  proto-neutron star
          surface  is  examined  with  semi-analytic neutrino-driven wind
          models.  The  increase  of  neutrino number density in the wind
          owing  to  the anisotropy is modeled schematically by enhancing
          the  effective  neutrino  luminosity.  It  is  shown  that  the
          neutrino   heating   rate   from   neutrino-antineutrino   pair
          annihilation  into  electron-positron  pairs  can significantly
          increase  owing  to the anisotropy and play a dominant role for
          the  heating of wind material. A factor of five increase in the
          effective neutrino luminosity results in 50% higher entropy and
          a  factor  of  ten  shorter  dynamic  timescale  owing  to this
          enhanced  neutrino  heating.  The  nucleosynthesis calculations
          show  that  this  change  is  enough  for the robust r-process,
          producing  the  third abundance peak A = 195 and beyond. Future
          multi-dimensional studies with accurate neutrino transport will
          be  needed if such anisotropy relevant for the current scenario
          (more than a factor of a few) is realized during the wind phase
          (~1-10 s).

          Millisecond X-ray pulsars consist of a rapidly-spinning neutron
          star  accreting  from a low-mass stellar companion, and are the
          long-sought   evolutionary  progenitors  of  millisecond  radio
          pulsars,   as   well   as   promising   candidate  sources  for
          gravitational  radiation.  The  population of these sources has
          grown  significantly  over  the  last  three  years,  with  the
          discovery  of  six  new  examples  to bring the total sample to
          seven.  Three sources are ultracompact binaries with H-depleted
          donors  and  orbital periods of approx. 40 min, like the 185 Hz
          pulsar  XTE  J0929-314. Three more have orbital periods of 2 hr
          or  longer,  similar  to  IGR  J00291+5934,  first  detected in
          outburst by INTEGRAL in December 2004. The neutron star in this
          2.46 hr binary has the most rapid spin of the accreting pulsars
          at   599   Hz.   The   most  recently-discovered  pulsar,  HETE
          J1900.1-2455  (377  Hz),  has an intermediate orbital period of
          83.3  min,  and has been active for more than 1 yr, much longer
          than  the  typical transient outburst. Pulsations were detected
          only  in  the first few months of the outburst; this source has
          since  resembled a faint, persistent non-pulsing low-mass X-ray
          binary,   typical   of   the   broader  low-mass  X-ray  binary
          population.

          We  review  the  current  state  of  observational  work on the
          formation  of  brown  dwarfs,  focusing  on  their initial mass
          function,   velocity   and   spatial  distributions  at  birth,
          multiplicity, accretion, and circumstellar disks. The available
          measurements  of these various properties are consistent with a
          common  formation  mechanism  for  brown  dwarfs  and stars. In
          particular,  the  existence  of  widely  separated binary brown
          dwarfs  and a probable isolated proto-brown dwarf indicate that
          some  substellar objects are able to form in the same manner as
          stars   through  unperturbed  cloud  fragmentation.  Additional
          mechanisms  such  as  ejection  and photoevaporation may play a
          role  in  the  birth  of  some  brown  dwarfs,  but there is no
          observational evidence to date to suggest that they are the key
          elements that make it possible for substellar bodies to form.

          Comments: 22 pages, 4 figures; submitted to ApJ
          We  study  hard  states of the black-hole binary XTE J1550--564
          during  its  2000 outburst. In order to explain those states at
          their  highest  luminosities,  $L\sim  10%$  of  the  Eddington
          luminosity,  $L_{\rm  E}$,  we propose a specific hot accretion
          flow model. We point out that $L$ is substantially more than an
          advection-dominated  accretion  flow  (ADAF) can produce, $\sim
          0.4\alpha^2 L_{\rm E}$, which is only $\sim (3$--$4)%L_{\rm E}$
          even  for  $\alpha$  as  high  as  0.3.  On  the other hand, we
          successfully  explain the hard states with $L\simeq (4$--$10)%$
          using   the  luminous  hot  accretion  flow  (LHAF)  model.  As
          $10%L_{\rm  E}$  is also roughly the highest luminosity an LHAF
          can  produce,  such  an  agreement  between  the  predicted and
          observed highest luminosities provides by itself strong support
          for   this   model.  Then,  we  study  multi-waveband  spectral
          variability  during  the  2000  outburst.  In  addition  to the
          primary  maxima  in  the optical light curves, secondary maxima
          were  detected after the transition from the very high state to
          the  hard  state.  We  show  that the secondary maxima are well
          modeled  by  synchrotron  emission from a jet formed during the
          state   transition.   We   argue   that   the  absence  of  the
          corresponding secondary peak in the X-ray light curve indicates
          that  the  X-ray  jet  emission,  regardless  of  its radiative
          process, synchrotron or its Comptonization, is not important in
          the  hard  state  compared  to  the emission from the accretion
          flow.

          effect  of  magnetic  fields above the quantum critical value -
          can  only  be  measured  using  compact  astrophysical objects:
          neutron  stars and black holes. The Extreme Physics Explorer is
          a  modest  sized  (~500  kg)  mission  that  would carry a high
          resolution  (R  ~300)  X-ray spectrometer and a sensitive X-ray

          at  the  focus of a large area (~5 sq.m), low resolution (HPD~1

          classes of tests of fundamental physics using neutron stars and
          black holes as cosmic laboratories.

          Title:  QED  can explain the non-thermal emission from SGRs and
          AXPs : Variability
          Authors: Jeremy S. Heyl (UBC)
          Comments:  7  pages, 5 figures, to appear in the proceedings of
          the  conference  "Isolated  Neutron Stars: from the Interior to
          the  Surface" (April 2006, London), eds. D. Page, R. Turolla, &
          S. Zane, Astrophysics & Space Science
          Owing  to  effects  arising from quantum electrodynamics (QED),
          magnetohydrodynamical  fast  modes  of sufficient strength will
          break down to form electron-positron pairs while traversing the
          magnetospheres  of  strongly magnetised neutron stars. The bulk
          of  the  energy  of  the  fast mode fuels the development of an
          electron-positron  fireball.  However, a small, but potentially
          observable,  fraction  of  the energy ($\sim 10^{33}$ ergs) can
          generate  a non-thermal distribution of electrons and positrons
          far  from  the  star.  This  paper  examines  the  cooling  and
          radiative  output  of  these  particles.  Small-scale waves may
          produce  only  the non-thermal emission. The properties of this
          non-thermal  emission  in the absence of a fireball match those
          of  the  quiescent,  non-thermal  radiation  recently  observed
          non-thermal  emission  from several anomalous X-ray pulsars and
          soft-gamma  repeaters.  Initial  estimates of the emission as a
          function of angle indicate that the non-thermal emission should
          be  beamed  and  therefore one would expect this emission to be
          pulsed  as  well.  According to this model the pulsation of the
          non-thermal  emission  should be between 90 and 180 degrees out
          of phase from the thermal emission from the stellar surface.

          Journal
          We imaged five objects considered by Allers et al. (2006) to be
          of  low-mass  and associated with the young star-forming clouds
          in  Ophiuchus.  We resolved their #11 (2MASS J16222521-2405139)
          and #16 (2MASS J16233609-2402209) into binaries. The #16 binary
          is  an  unusually  wide  (212  AU), very low-mass (VLM), binary
          composed  of  a  ~100  Mjup  primary (16A) and a ~73 MJup (16B)
          secondary.  The  #11  object  is  even more unusual. The binary
          nature  of  11  was  independently discovered by Jayawardhana &
          Ivanov  (2006b)  who  call  it  Oph  162225-240515. The Oph #11
          projected  separation,  243  AU, is the largest known for a VLM
          binary  and  an  order  of  magnitude larger than that of older
          field  VLM  binaries.  We  have  obtained  the  first spatially
          resolved  near-infrared  (J & K) spectra and Mid-IR photometry.
          We  estimate  for  11A  and  11B  gravities (log(g)>3.75), ages
          (5+/-2     Myr),    luminosities    (log(L)=-2.77+/-0.10    and
          -2.96+/-0.10), and temperatures (Teff=2375+/-175 and 2175+/-175
          K).  We find self-consistent DUSTY evolutionary model (Chabrier
          et  al.  2000)  masses  of 17.5+/-2.5 MJup and 15.5+/-2.5 MJup,
          respectively.   Our  masses  are  higher  than  the  previously
          reported  13-15  MJup  and  7-8  MJup  masses  for  11A and 11B
          (Jayawardhana  &  Ivanov  2006b).  Hence, we find the system is
          unlikely  a  ``planetary  mass  binary'',  but it is the second
          lowest   mass   binary   known.  Moreover,  due  to  its  large
          separation,  Oph 11 appears to have a binding energy lower than
          any  other known binary. The formation (and survival) of such a
          weakly  bound  system  with  Vesc~0.5  km/s  may pose a serious
          challenge  to  brown dwarf/star formation theories. Oph #11 and
          Oph  #16  belong  to a new population of wide (>200 AU), young,
          roughly  equal  mass, VLM stellar and brown dwarf binaries that
          may become unbound over time.

          from  the  Interior  to  the  Surface",  edited  by D. Page, R.
          Turolla and S. Zane
          The  excellent  spatial  resolution  of the Chandra observatory
          offers  the unprecedented possibility to measure proper motions
          at  X-ray  wavelength  with  relatively  high accuracy using as
          reference  the  background  of extragalactic or remote galactic
          X-ray   sources.  We  took  advantage  of  this  capability  to
          constrain   the   proper  motion  of  RX  J0806.4-4123  and  RX
          J0420.0-5022, two X-ray bright and radio quiet isolated neutron
          stars  (INSs)  discovered  by  ROSAT  and  lacking  an  optical
          counterpart.   In   this  paper,  we  present  results  from  a
          preliminary  analysis from which we derive 2 sigma upper limits
          of  76  mas/yr  and  138  mas/yr  on  the  proper motions of RX
          J0806.4-4123  and  RX  J0420.0-5022  respectively. We use these
          values  together  with  those of other ROSAT discovered INSs to
          constrain  the origin, distance and evolutionary status of this
          particular  group  of  objects.  We  find  that  the tangential
          velocities  of  radio  quiet  ROSAT  neutron stars are probably
          consistent  with  those of 'normal' pulsars. Their distribution
          on  the  sky  and,  for  those  having  accurate  proper motion
          vectors,  their  possible  birth  places,  all point to a local
          population,  probably  created  in  the  part of the Gould Belt
          nearest to the earth.

          We  study  the 4-200 keV spectral and temporal behaviour of the
          low   mass   X-ray  binary  4U  1820-30  with  INTEGRAL  during
          2003-2005.  This  source  as  been  observed  in  both the soft
          (banana) and hard (island) spectral states. A high energy tail,
          above 50 keV, in the hard state has been observed for the first
          time.  This places the source in the category of X-ray bursters
          showing high-energy emission. The tail can be modeled as a soft
          power  law  component, with the photon index of ~2.4, on top of
          thermal Comptonization emission from a plasma with the electron
          temperature   of  kT_e~6  keV  and  optical  depth  of  \tau~4.
          Alternatively,  but  at  a  lower  goodness  of  the  fit,  the
          hard-state broad band spectrum can be accounted for by emission
          from   a   hybrid,   thermal-nonthermal,  plasma.  During  this
          monitoring the source spent most of the time in the soft state,
          usual  for this source, and the >~4 keV spectra are represented
          by thermal Comptonization with kT_e~3 keV and \tau~6-7.

          Title:  Gravitational Recoil from Binary Black Hole Mergers:the
          Close-Limit Approximation
          Authors:  Carlos F. Sopuerta, Nicolas Yunes, Pablo Laguna (Penn
          State)
          Comments: RevTeX, 27 pages, 11 figures
          [abridged] The coalescence of a binary black hole system is one
          of  the  main  sources  of gravitational waves that present and
          future  detectors will study. Apart from the energy and angular
          momentum  that  these  waves  carry,  for unequal-mass binaries
          there  is  also  a  net  flux of linear momentum that implies a
          recoil  velocity  of  the  resulting  final  black  hole in the
          opposite  direction.  We  present  a  computation of the recoil
          velocity  based  on the close-limit approximation scheme, which
          gives  excellent  results for head-on and grazing collisions of
          black  holes  when  compared  to  full  numerical  relativistic
          calculations.  We obtain a maximum recoil velocity of ~ 57 km/s
          for a symmetric mass ratio eta = M_1 M_2/(M_1+M_2)^2 ~ 0.19 and
          an  initial  proper separation of 4 M, where M is the total ADM
          mass of the system. This separation is the maximum at which the
          close-limit  approximation  is  expected  to  provide  accurate
          results. If we supplement this estimate with PN calculations up
          to the innermost stable circular orbit, we obtain a lower bound
          for the recoil velocity, with a maximum around 80 km/s. This is
          a  lower bound because it neglects the initial merger phase. We
          can  however obtain a rough estimate by using PN methods or the
          close-limit  approximation.  Since  both  methods  are known to
          overestimate  the amount of radiation, we obtain in this way an
          upper  bound for the recoil with maxima in the range of 214-240
          km/s.  We also provide non-linear fits to these estimated upper
          and  lower bounds. These estimates are subject to uncertainties
          related to issues such as the choice of initial data and higher
          effects  in perturbation theory. Nonetheless, our estimates are
          consistent  with previous results in the literature and suggest
          a narrower range of possible recoil velocities.

          Title:  A  Hard-to-Soft  State  Transition  during A Luminosity
          Decline of Aquila X-1
          Authors: Wenfei Yu, Joshua Dolence
          Comments:   12   pages  including  3  figures,  AASTEX  format,
          submitted to ApJ
          Contrary  to  the  idea  that  the  X-ray  spectral  states  of
          accreting  black  holes and neutron stars are determined by the
          mass  accretion  rate  and  that a transition from the low/hard
          (LH)  state  to  the high/soft (HS) state is associated with an
          increase of luminosity, we have discovered a hard-to-soft state
          transition  during  a  luminosity  decay of Aquila X$-$1 in the
          observations  made  with  the  {\it Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
          (RXTE)}.  The  2--60 keV energy flux corresponding to the state
          transition  is $9.3\times{10}^{-10} {\rm ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}}$,
          an  order  of  magnitude lower than the maximum observed in the
          past.  The  2--60  keV  peak  flux of the following HS state is
          $1.5\times{10}^{-9}  {\rm  ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}}$. This confirms
          the  correlation  between  the  luminosity  of the hard-to-soft
          state  transition  and  the peak luminosity of the following HS
          state   previously   found.   The  relation  derived  from  the
          observations  of  four  outbursts  is  consistent with a linear
          relation over a luminosity range of an order of magnitude. This
          implies   that   the   luminosity  of  the  hard-to-soft  state
          transition is not determined solely by the mass accretion rate,
          but  appears  determined  by  the peak luminosities of the soft
          X-ray  outbursts.  The  time  lag  of  the peak of the HS state
          relative to the occurrence of the hard-to-soft state transition
          varied  from  about  5 days to 11 days, showing a weak trend of
          increasing  time  lag with increasing peak luminosity of the HS
          state.  These results provide additional evidence that the mass
          in the accretion disk probably determines the luminosity of the
          hard-to-soft state transition.

          Letters
          We  present  a period-luminosity-amplitude analysis of 5899 red
          giant  and  binary  stars  in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using
          publicly  available observations of the MACHO project. For each
          star,  we  determined new periods, which were double-checked in
          order    to    exclude   aliases   and   false   periods.   The
          period-luminosity   relations   confirm   the  existence  of  a
          short-period, small-amplitude P-L sequence at periods shortward
          of  Seq.  A.  We point out that the widely accepted sequence of
          eclipsing binaries between Seqs. C and D, known as Seq. E, does
          not  exist.  The  correct  position  for Seq. E is at periods a
          factor  of  two  greater,  and  the  few  stars genuinely lying
          between  Seq.  C  and  D  are  under-luminous  Mira  variables,
          presumably  enshrouded  in  dust. The true Seq. E overlaps with
          the  sequence  of Long Secondary Periods (Seq. D) and their P-L
          relation  is  well  described  by a simple model assuming Roche
          geometry.  The  amplitudes  of  LSPs  have  properties that are
          different   from   both  the  pulsations  and  the  ellipsoidal
          variations,  but  they  are more similar to the former than the
          latter,  arguing  for  pulsation  rather  than  binarity as the
          origin of the LSP phenomenon.

          Comments: 18 pages,5 figures, accepted by ApJ
          We  have  investigated the relation between the orbital periods
          ($\pb$)  and the spin periods ($\ps$) of wind-fed X-ray pulsars
          in  high-mass  X-ray  binaries  (HMXBs),  based  on  population
          synthesis  calculations  of the spin evolution of neutron stars
          during  the  pre-HMXB  stage.  We show that most of the neutron
          stars either have steady accretion or still reside in the radio
          pulsar  phase  when the donor star starts evolving off the main
          sequence.  In  the  former  case  the  values  of  $\ps$ can be
          decelerated  to  be  $\sim  10^2-10^3$ s depending on $\pb$. We
          briefly   discuss   the   possible   origin  of  the  $\ps-\pb$
          correlation  in  Be/X-ray  binaries, and the existence of HMXBs
          with  main  sequence  donors.  We  have  also  investigated the
          evolution  of  the  inclination  angle between the magnetic and
          spin  axes  of  neutron  stars  in a massive binary, suggesting
          secular  alignment  of  the magnetic and spin axes during their
          evolution.

          The  X-ray  spectra  of the magnetar candidates are customarily
          fitted  with  an  empirical,  two  component model: an absorbed
          blackbody and a power-law. However, the physical interpretation
          of  these  two  spectral components is rarely discussed. It has
          been recently proposed that the presence of a hot plasma in the
          magnetosphere of highly magnetized neutron stars might distort,
          through  efficient  resonant  cyclotron scattering, the thermal
          emission  from  the  neutron  star  surface,  resulting  in the
          production of non-thermal spectra. Here we discuss the Resonant
          Cyclotron   Scattering  (RCS)  model,  and  present  its  XSPEC
          implementation,   as   well   as  preliminary  results  of  its
          application  to  Anomalous  X-ray  Pulsars  and  Soft Gamma-ray
          Repeaters.

          SAX J2103.5+4545 had been continously monitored for $\sim $ 900
          days  by  Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) since its outburst
          at  July  2002.  Using these observations and previous archival
          RXTE  observations  of  SAX J2103.5+4545, we refined the binary
          orbital  parameters  and  find  the  new  orbital  period as P=
          (12.66536   $\pm   $  0.00088)  days  and  the  eccentricty  as
          0.4055$\pm$  0.0032.  With  these  new  orbital  parameters, we
          constructed  the pulse frequency and pulse frequency derivative
          histories  of  the pulsar and confirmed the correlation between
          X-ray  flux and pulse frequency derivative presented by Baykal,
          Stark  and  Swank  (2002). We constructed the power spectra for
          the  fluctuations of pulse frequency derivatives and found that
          the  power  law  index of the noise spectra 2.13 $\pm$ 0.6. The
          power  law  index  is  consistent  with  random  walk  in pulse
          frequency  derivative  and is the steepest power law index seen
          among the HMXRBs.
          X-ray  spectra analysis confirmed the inverse correlation trend
          between  power  law index and X-ray flux found by Baykal, Stark
          and Swank (2002).

          Approximate  analytical  formulae  are  derived  for  the pulse
          profile  produced  by  small  hot  spots  on a rapidly rotating
          neutron star. Its Fourier amplitudes and phases are calculated.
          The proposed formalism takes into account gravitational bending
          of  light,  Doppler  effect,  anisotropy  of emission, and time
          delays.   Its   accuracy   is   checked  with  exact  numerical
          calculations.

          Title: A Search for Nitrogen-Enhanced Metal-Poor Stars
          Authors: Jennifer A. Johnson (DAO/HIA/NRC), Falk Herwig (LANL),
          Timothy C. Beers (MSU/JINA), Norbert Christlieb (Hamburg)
          Comments: 14 pages, 7 figures, to be published in ApJ
          Theoretical   models   of   very  metal-poor  intermediate-mass
          Asymptotic   Giant   Branch   (AGB)   stars   predict  a  large
          overabundance   of   primary  nitrogen.  The  very  metal-poor,
          carbon-enhanced,  s-process-rich stars, which are thought to be
          the  polluted  companions  of  now-extinct  AGB  stars, provide
          direct tests of the predictions of these models. Recent studies
          of  the carbon and nitrogen abundances in metal-poor stars have
          focused  on  the most carbon-rich stars, leading to a potential
          selection  bias  against  stars  that have been polluted by AGB
          stars  that  produced large amounts of nitrogen, and hence have
          small  [C/N]  ratios.  We  call  these  stars Nitrogen-Enhanced
          Metal-Poor  (NEMP)  stars,  and  define them as having [N/Fe] >
          +0.5  and  [C/N]  < -0.5. In this paper, we report on the [C/N]
          abundances  of  a  sample  of 21 carbon-enhanced stars, all but
          three  of  which have [C/Fe] < +2.0. If NEMP stars were made as
          easily  as  Carbon-Enhanced  Metal-Poor  (CEMP)  stars, then we
          expected  to find between two and seven NEMP stars. Instead, we
          found   no   NEMP   stars   in   our  sample.  Therefore,  this
          observational  bias  is  not  an  important  contributor to the
          apparent  dearth  of  N-rich stars. Our [C/N] values are in the
          same  range  as  values  reported  previously in the literature
          (-0.5  to  +2.0),  and  all  stars are in disagreement with the
          predicted  [C/N]  ratios  for  both  low-mass and high-mass AGB
          stars.  We suggest that the decrease in [C/N] from the low-mass
          AGB  models  is due to enhanced extra-mixing, while the lack of
          NEMP stars may be caused by unfavorable mass ratios in binaries
          or the difficulty of mass transfer in binary systems with large
          mass ratios.

          We  present a review of some of the current major challenges in
          stellar  cluster  research,  including young clusters, globular
          clusters,  and  galactic  nuclei.  Topics  considered  include:
          primordial  mass  segregation and runaway mergers, expulsion of
          gas  from  clusters,  the production of stellar exotica seen in
          some    clusters    (eg    blue    stragglers    and    extreme
          horizontal--branch  stars), binary populations within clusters,
          the  black--hole  population within stellar clusters, the final
          parsec  problem,  stellar dynamics around a massive black hole,
          and stellar collisions. The Modest Questions posed here are the
          outcome  of  discussions  which  took  place  at  the Modest-6A
          workshop held in Lund, Sweden, in December, 2005. Modest-6A was
          organised as part of the activities of the Modest Collaboration

          UK)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  argue  on  the  basis of astrometric and spectroscopic data
          that  the  ultramassive white dwarf GD50 is associated with the
          star  formation event that created the Pleiades and is possibly
          a  former  member of this cluster. Its cooling age (~60Myrs) is
          consistent  with it having evolved essentially as a single star
          from  a  progenitor  with  a mass M>6Msun so we find no need to
          invoke  a  white  dwarf-white  dwarf  binary merger scenario to
          account  for its existence. This result may represent the first
          direct  observational  evidence  that single star evolution can
          produce  white  dwarfs  with  M>1.1Msun,  as  predicted by some
          stellar  evolutionary  theories. On the basis of its tangential
          velocity   we  also  provisionally  identify  the  ultramassive
          (M~1.2Msun)  white  dwarf  PG0136+251  as  being related to the
          Pleiades. These findings may help to alleviate the difficulties
          in  reconciling  the observed number of hot nearby ultramassive
          white  dwarfs  with  the  smaller  number  predicted  by binary
          evolution  models  under  the  assumption  that  they  are  the
          products of white dwarf mergers.

          Title:  Proto-Neutron  Star  Winds  with  Magnetic  Fields  and
          Rotation
          Authors: Brian D. Metzger, Todd A. Thompson, Eliot Quataert
          Comments: 21 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  solve  the  1D  neutrino-heated  non-relativistic  MHD wind
          problem  for  conditions  that range from slowly rotating (spin
          period  P > 10 ms) protoneutron stars (PNSs) with surface field
          strengths   typical   of  radio  pulsars  (B  <  10^13  G),  to
          "proto-magnetars"  with B ~ 10^14-10^15 G in their hypothesized
          rapidly  rotating  initial  states  (P  ~  1  ms).  We  use the
          simulations  of  Bucciantini  et al. (2006) to map our monopole
          results  onto  a  more physical dipole geometry and to estimate
          the spindown of PNSs when their winds are relativistic. We then
          quantify  the  effects  of  rotation and magnetic fields on the
          mass  loss,  energy  loss, and r-process nucleosynthesis in PNS
          winds.  We  describe  the  evolution  of  PNS winds through the
          Kelvin-Helmholtz  cooling  epoch,  emphasizing  the  transition
          between   (1)  thermal  neutrino-driven,  (2)  non-relativistic
          magnetically-dominated,        and       (3)       relativistic
          magnetically-dominated  outflows.  We find that proto-magnetars
          with  P  ~  1  ms and B > 10^15 G drive relativistic winds with
          luminosities,  energies,  and  Lorentz  factors  (magnetization
          sigma  ~ 1-1000) consistent with those required to produce long
          duration gamma-ray bursts and hyper-energetic supernovae (SNe).
          A   significant  fraction  of  the  rotational  energy  may  be
          extracted  in only a few seconds, sufficiently rapidly to alter
          the  asymptotic  energy of the SN remnant, its morphology, and,
          potentially,  its  nucleosynthetic  yield. Winds from PNSs with
          more   modest   rotation   periods   (2   -  10  ms)  and  with
          magnetar-strength  fields produce conditions significantly more
          favorable  for  the  r-process  than winds from slowly rotating
          PNSs.  Lastly,  we  show that energy and momentum deposition by
          convectively-excited  waves  further increase the likelihood of
          successful r-process in PNS winds.

          Special Issue: Isolated Neutron Stars
          The  aim of this article is to draw attention to the importance
          of  the  electric  current  loss  in the energy output of radio
          pulsars.  We  remind  that  even  the  losses attributed to the
          magneto-dipole  radiation  of a pulsar in vacuum can be written
          as  a  result of an Ampere force action of the electric currens
          flowing  over the neutron star surface (Michel, 1991, Beskin et
          al.,  1993).  It  is  this  force  that  is responsible for the
          transfer  of  angular momentum of a neutron star to an outgoing
          magneto-dipole  wave.  If a pulsar is surrounded by plasma, and
          there is no longitudinal current in its magnetosphere, there is
          no  energy  loss (Beskin et al., 1993, Mestel et al., 1999). It
          is the longitudinal current closing within the pulsar polar cap
          that  exerts the retardation torque acting on the neutron star.
          This  torque can be determined if the structure of longitudinal
          current  is  known.  Here  we remind of the solution by Beskin,
          Gurevitch  & Istomin (1993) and discuss the validity of such an
          assumption.  The  behavior  of the recently observed "part-time
          job"  pulsar  B1931+24  can  be  naturally explained within the
          model  of  current  loss  while  the magneto-dipole model faces
          difficulties.

          transfer  of  angular momentum of a neutron star to an outgoing
          magneto-dipole  wave.  If a pulsar is surrounded by plasma, and
          there is no longitudinal current in its magnetosphere, there is
          no  energy  loss (Beskin et al., 1993, Mestel et al., 1999). It
          is the longitudinal current closing within the pulsar polar cap
          that  exerts the retardation torque acting on the neutron star.
          This  torque can be determined if the structure of longitudinal
          current  is  known.  Here  we remind of the solution by Beskin,
          Gurevitch  & Istomin (1993) and discuss the validity of such an
          assumption.  The  behavior  of the recently observed "part-time
          job"  pulsar  B1931+24  can  be  naturally explained within the
          model  of  current  loss  while  the magneto-dipole model faces
          difficulties.

          Title:  Production  of  Hypervelocity  Stars through Encounters
          with Stellar-Mass Black Holes in the Galactic Centre
          Authors: Ryan M. O'Leary, Abraham Loeb (Harvard University)
          Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          Stars  within  0.1  pc of the supermassive black hole Sgr A* at
          the  Galactic  centre  are  expected  to encounter a cluster of
          stellar-mass  black  holes  (BHs)  that have segregated to that
          region. Some of these stars will scatter off an orbiting BH and
          be  kicked  out  of  the  Galactic centre with velocities up to
          \~2000  km/s.  We  calculate  the  resulting  ejection  rate of
          hypervelocity  stars  (HVSs) by this process under a variety of
          assumptions,  and  find  it  to  be  comparable  to  the  tidal
          disruption  rate  of binary stars by Sgr A*, first discussed by
          Hills  (1998).  Under  some  conditions,  this novel process is
          sufficient  to  account for all the B-type HVSs observed in the
          halo,  and  to  dominate  the  production rate of all HVSs with
          lifetimes  much  less  than  the  relaxation  time-scale  at  a
          distance  ~2  pc from Sgr A* (>~2 Gyr). Since HVSs are produced
          by  at  least two unavoidable processes, the statistics of HVSs
          could  reveal  bimodal velocity and mass distributions, and can
          constrain  the  distribution  of BHs and stars in the innermost
          0.1 pc around Sgr A*.

          Title:  Magnetar-Driven Magnetic Tower as a Model for Gamma-Ray
          Bursts and Asymmetric Supernovae
          Authors:  Dmitri  A.  Uzdensky (Princeton University and CMSO),
          Andrew I. MacFadyen (IAS)
          Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures; submitted to ApJ
          We  consider a newly-born millisecond magnetar, focusing on its
          interaction  with  the  dense  stellar  plasma  in  which it is
          initially  embedded.  We  argue that the confining pressure and
          inertia  of  the  surrounding  plasma  acts  to  collimate  the
          magnetar's  Poynting-flux-dominated outflow into tightly beamed
          jets  and  increases  its  magnetic luminosity. We propose this
          process  as  an  essential ingredient in the magnetar model for
          gamma-ray  burst  and  asymmetric supernova central engines. We
          introduce  the  ``pulsar-in-a-cavity''  as  an  important model
          problem  representing a magnetized rotating neutron star inside
          a  collapsing  star.  We  describe its essential properties and
          derive simple estimates for the evolution of the magnetic field
          and  the  resulting spin-down power. We find that the infalling
          stellar  mantle  confines the magnetosphere, enabling a gradual
          build-up  of  the  toroidal  magnetic  field  due to continuous
          twisting.  The  growing  magnetic  pressure  eventually becomes
          dominant,  resulting  in  a  magnetically-driven explosion. The
          initial  phase of the explosion is quasi-isotropic, potentially
          exposing a sufficient amount of material to $^{56}$Ni-producing
          temperatures  to  result  in  a  bright  supernova. However, if
          significant   expansion   of  the  star  occurs  prior  to  the
          explosion,  then  very  little  $^{56}$Ni  is  produced  and no
          supernova is expected. In either case, hoop stress subsequently
          collimates  the  magnetically-dominated outflow, leading to the
          formation  of  a  magnetic  tower. After the star explodes, the
          decrease  in  bounding  pressure causes the magnetic outflow to
          become  less  beamed.  However,  episodes  of late fallback can
          reform  the  beamed  outflow, which may be responsible for late
          X-ray flares.

          Comments:  10  pages,  5  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We  present  the results of a radial velocity (RV) survey of 14
          brown  dwarfs  (BDs) and very low-mass (VLM) stars in the Upper
          Scorpius OB association (UScoOB) and 3 BD candidates in the rho
          Ophiuchi  dark  cloud core. We obtained high-resolution echelle
          spectra  at  the  Very  Large  Telescope  using Ultraviolet and
          Visual  Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) at two different epochs for
          each  object,  and measured the shifts in their RVs to identify
          candidates  for  binary/multiple  systems  in  the  sample. The
          average  time  separation  of the RV measurements is 21.6d, and
          our  survey  is sensitive to the binaries with separation < 0.1
          au.  We  found  that 4 out of 17 objects (or 24^{+16}_{-13} per
          cent  by  fraction)  show a significant RV change in 4-33d time
          scale,  and  are considered as binary/multiple `candidates.' We
          found  no  double-lined  spectroscopic  binaries in our sample,
          based   on  the  shape  of  cross-correlation  curves.  The  RV
          dispersion of the objects in UScoOB is found to be very similar
          to  that  of  the  BD and VLM stars in Chamaeleon I (Cha I). We
          also  found  the distribution of the mean rotational velocities
          (v  sin  i) of the UScoOB objects is similar to that of the Cha
          I,  but  the  dispersion of v sin i is much larger than that of
          the Cha I objects.

          GAMMA-RAY SOURCES, Espagne (2006)
          Recent  observations  of the binary system LS5039 with the High
          Energy  Stereoscopic  System  (H.E.S.S.) revealed that its Very
          High  Energy  (VHE)  gamma-ray emission is modulated at the 3.9
          days  orbital period of the system. The bulk of the emission is
          largely  confined  to  half  of  the  orbit, peaking around the
          inferior  conjunction  epoch  of  the  compact object. The flux
          modulation   provides   the   first   indication  of  gamma-ray
          absorption  by  pair  production  on the intense stellar photon
          field. This implies that the production region size must be not
          significantly greater than the gamma-gamma photosphere size (~1
          AU), thus excluding the large scale collimated outflows or jets
          (extending  out  to  ~1000  AU). A hardening of the spectrum is
          also observed at the same epoch between 0.2 and a few TeV which
          is unexpected under a pure absorption scenario and could rather
          arise  from variation with phase in the maximum electron energy
          and/or  the  dominant  VHE gamma-ray production mechanism. This
          first-time  observation  of modulated gamma-ray emission allows
          precise tests of the acceleration and emission models in binary
          systems.

          Title:  The evolution of binary star clusters and the nature of
          NGC2136/NGC2137
          Authors: Simon Portegies Zwart (UVA), Stephanie Rusli (Leiden)
          Comments: submitted to MNRAS
          We study the evolution of bound pairs of star clusters by means
          of direct N-body simulations. Our simulations include mass loss
          by  stellar  evolution.  The initial conditions are selected to
          mimic the observed binary star cluster NGC 2136 and NGC 2137 in
          the Large Magellanic Cloud. Based on the rather old ages ($\sim
          100$  Myr),  masses,  sizes  of  the  two  clusters  and  their
          projected  separation,  we  conclude that the cluster pair must
          have  been  born  with  an  initial  separation  of  15--20 pc.
          Clusters  with  a  smaller  initial separation tend to merge in
          $\aplt  60$  Myr  due to loss of angular momentum from escaping
          stars. Clusters with a larger initial separation tend to become
          even  more  widely separated due to mass loss from the evolving
          stellar  populations.  The  early orbital evolution of a binary
          cluster  is  governed  by  mass  loss from the evolving stellar
          population and by loss of angular momentum from escaping stars.
          Mass  loss  by  stellar  winds and supernovae explosions in the
          first  $\sim  30$ Myr causes the binary to expand and the orbit
          to become eccentric. The initially less massive cluster expands
          more  quickly  than  the  binary  separation  increases, and is
          therefore  bound  to initiate mass transfer to the more massive
          cluster.  This process is quite contrary to stellar binaries in
          which  the  more  massive star tends to initiate mass transfer.
          Since  mass  transfer  proceeds on a thermal timescale from the
          less  massive  to  the more massive cluster, this semi-detached
          phase  is  quite  stable,  even in an eccentric orbit until the
          orbital  separation  reaches  the  gyration  radius  of the two
          clusters, at which point both clusters merge to one.

          from  the  Interior  to  the  Surface",  edited  by D. Page, R.
          Turolla and S. Zane
          Presently  seven  nearby  radio-quiet  isolated  neutron  stars
          discovered  in  ROSAT  data  and characterized by thermal X-ray
          spectra  are  known.  They  exhibit very similar properties and
          despite intensive searches their number remained constant since
          2001 which led to their name ``The Magnificent Seven''. Five of
          the  stars  exhibit pulsations in their X-ray flux with periods
          in  the  range  of  3.4  s  to  11.4 s. XMM-Newton observations
          revealed  broad absorption lines in the X-ray spectra which are
          interpreted  as cyclotron resonance absorption lines by protons
          or  heavy  ions  and  /  or atomic transitions shifted to X-ray
          energies by strong magnetic fields of the order of 10^13 G. New
          XMM-Newton  observations  indicate  more  complex X-ray spectra
          with multiple absorption lines. Pulse-phase spectroscopy of the
          best  studied  pulsars  RX  J0720.4-3125  and  RBS 1223 reveals
          variations  in derived emission temperature and absorption line
          depth   with  pulse  phase.  Moreover,  RX  J0720.4-3125  shows
          long-term spectral changes which are interpreted as due to free
          precession  of the neutron star. Modeling of the pulse profiles
          of  RX J0720.4-3125 and RBS 1223 provides information about the
          surface   temperature   distribution   of   the  neutron  stars
          indicating  hot  polar  caps which have different temperatures,
          different  sizes  and  are  probably  not  located in antipodal
          positions.

          We follow up on our (Radhakrishnan & Deshpande, 2001) radically
          different interpretation of the arcs in the nebular X-radiation
          from  Vela  observed  by  Pavlov et al. (2000) & Helfand et al.
          (2001)  with  the  Chandra  Observatory, and interpreted by the
          latter  as  an  equatorial  wind. The bright arcs, the jet-like
          feature and the diffuse components in the Vela X-ray nebula can
          be  explained together in detail by our model in which the arcs
          are  understood  as  traces  of the particle beams from the two
          magnetic  poles  at  the  shock  front.  We  consider  this  as
          important  evidence for collimated particle beams from pulsars'
          magnetic  poles.  In  this paper, we discuss the variability in
          the features in the Vela X-ray nebula observed by Pavlov et al.
          (2003),  and  assess the relevance and implication of our model
          to  the  observations on the Crab and other remnants. Our basic
          picture  after  incorporating the signatures of free precession
          of  the  central  compact  object  can  readily account for the
          variability  and  significant  asymmetries,  including the bent
          jet-like   features,   in   the   observed   morphologies.  The
          implications of these findings are discussed.

          Title: On the lambda Bootis spectroscopic binary hypothesis
          Authors: Christian Stuetz, Ernst Paunzen
          Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure, accepted as an A&A Letter
          It is still a matter of debate if the group of lambda Bootis
          stars is homogeneously defined. A widely discussed working
          hypothesis formulates that two apparent solar abundant stars of
          an undetected spectroscopic binary system mimic a single
          metal-weak spectrum preventing any reliable analysis of the
          group characteristics. Is the proposed spectroscopic binary
          model able to explain the observed abundance pattern and
          photometric metallicity indices for the group members? What is
          the percentage of undetected spectroscopic binary systems? We
          have used the newest available stellar atmospheres to
          synthesize 105 hypothetical binary systems in the relevant
          astrophysical parameter range. These models were used to derive
          photometric indices. As a test, values for single stellar
          atmospheres, Vega and two typical lambda Bootis stars, HD
          107233 and HD 204041, were generated. The synthesized indices
          fit the standard lines and the observations of the three stars
          excellently. For about 90% of the group members, the
          spectroscopic inary hypothesis can not explain the
          observations. A carefully preselection of lambda Bootis stars
          results in a homogeneous group of objects which can be used to
          investigate the group characteristics.

          Title: Constraints on the Geometry of the VHE Emission in LS
          5039 from Photon-Photon Deabsorption
          Authors: Markus Boettcher
          Comments: Submitted to Astroparticle Physics. 16 pages,
          including 7 color eps figures and 2 tables
          A detailed parameter study of the gamma-gamma absorption
          effects in LS 5039 is presented. For a range of plausible
          locations of the VHE gamma-ray emission region and the
          allowable range of viewing angles, the de-absorbed, intrinsic
          VHE gamma-ray spectra and total VHE photon fluxes and
          luminosities are calculated and compared to luminosity
          constraints based on wind accretion onto the compact object in
          LS 5039. It is found that (1) it is impossible to choose the
          viewing angle and location of the VHE emission region in a way
          that the intrinsic (deabsorbed) fluxes and spectra in superior
          and inferior conjunction are identical; consequently, the
          intrinsic VHE luminosities and spectral shapes must be
          fundamentally different in different orbital phases, (2) if the
          VHE luminosity is limited by wind accretion from the companion
          star and the system is viewed at an inclination angle of i > 40
          deg., the emission is most likely beamed by a larger Doppler
          factor than inferred from the dynamics of the large-scale radio
          outflows, (3) the still poorly constrained viewing angle
          between the line of sight and the jet axis is most likely
          substantially smaller than the maximum of ~ 64 deg. inferred
          from the lack of eclipses.(4) Consequently, the compact object
          is more likely to be a black hole rather than a neutron star.
          (5) There is a limited range of allowed configurations for
          which the expected > 1 TeV neutrino flux would actually
          anti-correlate with the observed VHE gamma-ray emission.

          We study the accretion flows from the circumbinary disks onto
          the supermassive binary black holes in a subparsec scale of the
          galactic center, using a smoothed particles hydrodynamics (SPH)
          code. Simulation models are presented in four cases of a
          circular binary with equal masses and unequal masses, and of an
          eccentric binary with equal masses and unequal masses. We find
          that the circumblack-hole disks are formed around each black
          holes regardless of simulation parameters. There are two-stage
          mechanisms to cause an accretion flow from the circumbinary
          disk onto supermassive binary black holes: First, the tidally
          induced elongation of the circumbinary disk triggers mass
          inflow towards two points on the semi-minor axis of
          circumbinary disk. Then, the gas is increasingly accumulated on
          these two points owing to the gravitational attraction of black
          holes. Second, when the gas can pass across the maximum loci of
          the binary potential, it starts to overflow via their two
          points and freely infalls to each black hole. In circular
          binaries, the gas continues to be supplied from the
          circumbinary disk (i.e. the gap between the circumbinary disk
          and the binary black hole is always closed.) In eccentric
          binaries, there is the mass supply with the periodic on/off
          transitions during one orbital period because of the
          time-dependent, periodic potential. The gap starts to close
          after the apastron and to open again after the next periastron
          passage. Due to this gap closing/opening cycles, the
          mass-capture rates are eventually strongly phase dependent.
          This could provide observable diagnosis for the presence of
          supermassive binary black holes in merged galactic nuclei.

          respectively) with the value of the proper motion of the entire

          Comments: 8 pages, 2 sets of figures, submitted to the
          proceedings of the 6th LISA symposium
          We demonstrate the use of automatic Bayesian inference for the
          analysis of LISA data sets. In particular we describe a new
          automatic Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to
          evaluate the posterior probability density functions of the a
          priori unknown number of parameters that describe the
          gravitational wave signals present in the data. We apply the
          algorithm to a simulated LISA data set containing overlapping
          signals from white dwarf binary systems (DWD) and to a separate
          data set containing a signal from an extreme mass ratio
          inspiral (EMRI). We demonstrate that the approach works well in
          both cases and can be regarded as a viable approach to tackle
          LISA data analysis challenges.

          Title: On the lambda Bootis spectroscopic binary hypothesis
          Authors: Christian Stuetz, Ernst Paunzen
          Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure, accepted as an A&A Letter
          It is still a matter of debate if the group of lambda Bootis
          stars is homogeneously defined. A widely discussed working
          hypothesis formulates that two apparent solar abundant stars of
          an undetected spectroscopic binary system mimic a single
          metal-weak spectrum preventing any reliable analysis of the
          group characteristics. Is the proposed spectroscopic binary
          model able to explain the observed abundance pattern and
          photometric metallicity indices for the group members? What is
          the percentage of undetected spectroscopic binary systems? We
          have used the newest available stellar atmospheres to
          synthesize 105 hypothetical binary systems in the relevant
          astrophysical parameter range. These models were used to derive
          photometric indices. As a test, values for single stellar
          atmospheres, Vega and two typical lambda Bootis stars, HD
          107233 and HD 204041, were generated. The synthesized indices
          fit the standard lines and the observations of the three stars
          excellently. For about 90% of the group members, the
          spectroscopic inary hypothesis can not explain the
          observations. A carefully preselection of lambda Bootis stars
          results in a homogeneous group of objects which can be used to
          investigate the group characteristics.

          Title: Constraints on the Geometry of the VHE Emission in LS
          5039 from Photon-Photon Deabsorption
          Authors: Markus Boettcher
          Comments: Submitted to Astroparticle Physics. 16 pages,
          including 7 color eps figures and 2 tables
          A detailed parameter study of the gamma-gamma absorption
          effects in LS 5039 is presented. For a range of plausible
          locations of the VHE gamma-ray emission region and the
          allowable range of viewing angles, the de-absorbed, intrinsic
          VHE gamma-ray spectra and total VHE photon fluxes and
          luminosities are calculated and compared to luminosity
          constraints based on wind accretion onto the compact object in
          LS 5039. It is found that (1) it is impossible to choose the
          viewing angle and location of the VHE emission region in a way
          that the intrinsic (deabsorbed) fluxes and spectra in superior
          and inferior conjunction are identical; consequently, the
          intrinsic VHE luminosities and spectral shapes must be
          fundamentally different in different orbital phases, (2) if the
          VHE luminosity is limited by wind accretion from the companion
          star and the system is viewed at an inclination angle of i > 40
          deg., the emission is most likely beamed by a larger Doppler
          factor than inferred from the dynamics of the large-scale radio
          outflows, (3) the still poorly constrained viewing angle
          between the line of sight and the jet axis is most likely
          substantially smaller than the maximum of ~ 64 deg. inferred
          from the lack of eclipses.(4) Consequently, the compact object
          is more likely to be a black hole rather than a neutron star.
          (5) There is a limited range of allowed configurations for
          which the expected > 1 TeV neutrino flux would actually
          anti-correlate with the observed VHE gamma-ray emission.

          We study the accretion flows from the circumbinary disks onto
          the supermassive binary black holes in a subparsec scale of the
          galactic center, using a smoothed particles hydrodynamics (SPH)
          code. Simulation models are presented in four cases of a
          circular binary with equal masses and unequal masses, and of an
          eccentric binary with equal masses and unequal masses. We find
          that the circumblack-hole disks are formed around each black
          holes regardless of simulation parameters. There are two-stage
          mechanisms to cause an accretion flow from the circumbinary
          disk onto supermassive binary black holes: First, the tidally
          induced elongation of the circumbinary disk triggers mass
          inflow towards two points on the semi-minor axis of
          circumbinary disk. Then, the gas is increasingly accumulated on
          these two points owing to the gravitational attraction of black
          holes. Second, when the gas can pass across the maximum loci of
          the binary potential, it starts to overflow via their two
          points and freely infalls to each black hole. In circular
          binaries, the gas continues to be supplied from the
          circumbinary disk (i.e. the gap between the circumbinary disk
          and the binary black hole is always closed.) In eccentric
          binaries, there is the mass supply with the periodic on/off
          transitions during one orbital period because of the
          time-dependent, periodic potential. The gap starts to close
          after the apastron and to open again after the next periastron
          passage. Due to this gap closing/opening cycles, the
          mass-capture rates are eventually strongly phase dependent.
          This could provide observable diagnosis for the presence of
          supermassive binary black holes in merged galactic nuclei.

          We performed spectral line observations of CO J=2-1, 13CO
          J=1-0, and C18O J=1-0 and polarimetric observations in the 1.3
          mm continuum and CO J=2-1 toward a multiple protostar system,
          L1448 IRS 3, in the Perseus molecular complex at a distance of
          ~250 pc, using the BIMA array. In the 1.3 mm continuum, two
          sources (IRS 3A and 3B) were clearly detected with estimated
          envelope masses of 0.21 and 1.15 solar masses, and one source
          (IRS 3C) was marginally detected with an upper mass limit of
          0.03 solar masses. In CO J=2-1, we revealed two outflows
          originating from IRS 3A and 3B. The masses, mean number
          densities, momentums, and kinetic energies of outflow lobes
          were estimated. Based on those estimates and outflow features,
          we concluded that the two outflows are interacting and that the
          IRS 3A outflow is nearly perpendicular to the line of sight. In
          addition, we estimated the velocity, inclination, and opening
          of the IRS 3B outflow using Bayesian statistics. When the
          opening angle is ~20 arcdeg, we constrain the velocity to ~45
          km/s and the inclination angle to ~57 arcdeg. Linear
          polarization was detected in both the 1.3 mm continuum and CO
          J=2-1. The linear polarization in the continuum shows a
          magnetic field at the central source (IRS 3B) perpendicular to
          the outflow direction, and the linear polarization in the CO
          J=2-1 was detected in the outflow regions, parallel or
          perpendicular to the outflow direction. Moreover, we
          comprehensively discuss whether the binary system of IRS 3A and
          3B is gravitationally bound, based on the velocity differences
          detected in 13CO J=1-0 and C18O J=1-0 observations and on the
          outflow features. The specific angular momentum of the system
          was estimated as ~3e20 cm^2/s, comparable to the values
          obtained from previous studies on binaries and molecular clouds
          in Taurus.

          models of the formation of Sun-like stars in magnetized
          molecular clouds at scales of a few hundred astronomical units;
          gravity has overcome magnetic support, and the magnetic field
          traces a clear hourglass shape. The magnetic field is
          substantially more important than turbulence in the evolution
          of the system, and the initial misalignment of the magnetic and

          The cooling and reheating histories of dim isolated neutron
          stars(DINs) are discussed. Energy dissipation due to dipole
          spindown with ordinary and magnetar fields, and due to torques
          from a fallback disk are considered as alternative sources of
          reheating which would set the temperature of the neutron star
          after the initial cooling era. Cooling or thermal ages are
          related to the numbers and formation rates of the DINs and
          therefore to their relations with other isolated neutron star
          populations. Interaction with a fallback disk, higher multipole
          fields and activity of the neutron star are briefly discussed.

          Pulsar "standard model", that considers a pulsar as a rotating
          magnetized conducting sphere surrounded by plasma, is
          generalized to the case of oscillating star. We developed an
          algorithm for calculation of the Goldreich-Julian charge
          density for this case. We consider distortion of the
          accelerating zone in the polar cap of pulsar by neutron star
          oscillations. It is shown that for oscillation modes with high
          harmonic numbers (l,m) changes in the Goldreich-Julian charge
          density caused by pulsations of neutron star could lead to
          significant altering of an accelerating electric field in the
          polar cap of pulsar. In the moderately optimistic scenario,
          that assumes excitation of the neutron star oscillations by
          glitches, it could be possible to detect altering of the pulsar
          radioemission due to modulation of the accelerating field.

          Comments: Astrophysical Journal, in press
          During an imaging survey of the Chamaeleon I star-forming
          region with the ACS aboard HST, we have discovered a candidate
          substellar companion to the young low-mass star CHXR 73 (~2
          Myr, M=0.35 Msun). We measure a projected separation of
          1.3+/-0.03" for the companion, CHXR 73 B, which corresponds to
          210 AU at the distance of the cluster. A near-infrared spectrum
          of this source obtained with CorMASS at the Magellan II
          telescope exhibits strong steam absorption that confirms its
          late-type nature (>=M9.5). In addition, the gravity-sensitive
          shapes of the H- and K-band continua demonstrate that CHXR 73 B
          is a young, pre-main-sequence object rather than a field star.
          The probability that CHXR 73A and B are unrelated members of
          Chamaeleon I is ~0.001. We estimate the masses of CHXR 73 B and
          other known substellar companions in young clusters with a
          method that is consistent with the dynamical measurements of
          the eclipsing binary brown dwarf 2M 0535-0546, which consists
          of a comparison of the bolometric luminosities of the
          companions to the values predicted by the evolutionary models
          of Chabrier & coworkers and Burrows & coworkers. We arrive at
          mass estimates of 0.003-0.004, 0.024+/-0.012,
          0.011+0.01/-0.003, and 0.012+0.008/-0.005 Msun for 2M 1207-3932
          B, GQ Lup B, DH Tau B, and CHXR 73 B, respectively. Thus, DH
          Tau B and CHXR 73 B appear to be the least massive companions
          to stars outside the solar system that have been detected in
          direct images, and may have masses that are within the range
          observed for extrasolar planetary companions (M<=0.015 Msun).
          However, because these two objects (as well as 2M 1207-3932 B)
          probably did not form within circumstellar disks around their
          primaries, we suggest that they should be viewed as brown dwarf
          companions rather than planets.

          Title: Electrodynamics for Nuclear Matter in Bulk
          Authors: Remo Ruffini, Michael Rotondo, She-Sheng Xue
          Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures
          A general approach to analyze the electrodynamics of nuclear
          matter in bulk is presented using the relativistic Thomas-Fermi
          equation generalizing to the case of $N \simeq (m_{\rm
          Planck}/m_n)^3$ nucleons of mass $m_n$ the approach well tested
          in very heavy nuclei ($Z \simeq 10^6$). Particular attention is
          given to implement the condition of charge neutrality globally
          on the entire configuration, versus the one usually adopted on
          a microscopic scale. As the limit $N \simeq (m_{\rm
          Planck}/m_n)^3$ is approached the penetration of electrons
          inside the core increases and a relatively small tail of
          electrons persists leading to a significant electron density
          outside the core. Within a region of $10^2$ electron Compton
          wavelength near the core surface electric fields close to the
          critical value for pair creation by vacuum polarization effect

          understanding of physical process in neutron stars structures
          as well as on the initial conditions leading to the process of
          gravitational collapse to a black hole.

          Title: Critical Mass Transfer in Double-Degenerate Type Ia
          Supernovae
          Authors: Rebecca G. Martin, Christopher A. Tout, Pierre
          Lesaffre
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Doubly-degenerate binary systems consisting of two white dwarfs
          both composed of carbon and oxygen and close enough that mass
          is transferred from the less massive to the more massive are
          possible progenitors of type Ia supernovae. If the mass
          transfer rate is slow enough that the accreting white dwarf can
          reach 1.38 solar masses then it can ignite carbon degenerately
          at its centre. This can lead to a thermonuclear runaway and
          thence a supernova explosion. However if the accretion rate is
          too high the outer layers of the white dwarf heat up too much
          and carbon ignites there non-degenerately. A series of mild
          carbon flashes can then propagate inwards and convert the
          carbon to neon relatively gently. There is no thermonuclear
          runaway and no supernova. We have determined the critical rate
          for accretion and find it to be generally about two-fifths of
          the Eddington rate. In the case of actual bianry stars the mass
          transfer rate falls off as mass is transferred so we find that
          this rate can be very much exceeded at the onset of mass
          transfer. We determine combinations of white dwarf masses that
          can lead to central degenerate carbon ignition.

          Title: Unbinned maximum-likelihood estimators for low-count
          data: Applications to faint X-ray spectra in the Taurus
          Molecular Cloud

          Comments: accepted for publication in A&A
          Traditional binned statistics such as $\chi^2$ suffer from
          information loss and arbitrariness of the binning procedure. We
          point out that the underlying statistical quantity (the log
          likelihood $L$) does not require any binning beyond the one
          implied by instrumental readout channels, and we propose to use
          it for low-count data. The performance of $L$ in the model
          classification and point estimation problems is explored by
          Monte-Carlo simulations of Chandra and XMM X-ray spectra, and
          is compared to the performances of the binned Poisson statistic
          ($C$), Pearson's $\chi^2$ and Neyman's $\chi^2_N$, the
          Kolmogorov- Smirnov, and Kuiper' statistics. It is found that
          the unbinned log likelihood $L$ performs best with regard to
          the expected chi-square distance between true and estimated
          spectra, the chance of a successful identification among
          discrete candidate models, the area under the receiver-operator
          curve of reduced (two-model) binary classification problems,
          and generally also with regard to the mean square errors of
          individual spectrum parameters. The $\chi^2$ ($\chi^2_{\rm N}$)
          statistics should only be used if more than 10 (15) predicted
          counts per bin are available. From the practical point of view,
          the computational cost of evaluating $L$ is smaller than for
          any of the alternative methods if the forward model is
          specified in terms of a Poisson intensity and normalization is
          a free parameter. The maximum-$L$ method is applied to 14
          observations from the Taurus Molecular Cloud, and the unbinned
          results are compared to binned XSPEC results, and found to
          generally agree, with exceptions explained by instability under
          re-binning and by background fine structures. The maximum-$L$
          method has no lower limit on the available counts, and allows
          to treat weak sources which are beyond the means of binned
          methods.

          Blank field sources (BFS) are good candidates for hosting dim
          isolated neutron stars (DINS). The results of a search of BFS
          in the ROSAT HRI images are revised. We then focus on transient
          BFS, arguing that they belong to a rather large population. The
          perspectives of future research on DINS are then discussed.

          Title: Constraints on RRAT Emission Mechanisms from RXTE/PCA
          Observations of RRAT J1819-1458
          Authors: Robert E. Rutledge (McGill)
          Comments: 10 pages, ApJL, submitted
          We derive the second and most stringent limit to date of the
          X-ray/radio flux ratio (F_x/F_R) for the radio bursts
          associated with the recently identified source class, the
          Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs). We analyze 20.1 hr of
          \rxte/PCA observations of RRAT J1819-1458 -- a period during
          which 350\ppm23 RRAT radio bursts occurred, based on the
          previously observed average radio burst rate. No X-ray bursts
          were detected, implying an upper-limit on the X-ray flux for
          RRAT-bursts of <1.5e-8 ergs cm-2 s-1 (2-10 keV) or a luminosity
          <2.3e37 (d/3.6\kpc)^2 ergs s-1. The time-average burst flux is
          <2e-13 ergs cm-2 s-1 (0.5-8 keV) -- a factor of 10 below that
          of the previously identified persistent X-ray counterpart.
          Thus, X-ray bursts from the RRAT are energetically unimportant
          compared with the persistent X-ray emission. From the
          previously observed burst radio flux, we derive an upper-limit
          F_x/F_R< 4.2e-12 erg cm-2 s-1 mJy-1 for the radio bursts from
          this RRAT, the most stringent to date, due to the high radio
          flux of bursts from this source. The F_x/F_R ratio is a factor
          approximately 80 larger than that of the millisecond pulsar PSR
          B1821-24; thus emission processes of X-ray/radio efficiency
          comparable to MSP pulses cannot be ruled out. However, if the
          RRAT burst emission mechanism is identical to the msec bursts
          of magnetars, then the msec bursts of magnetars should be
          easily detected with radio instrumentation; yet none have been
          reported to date.

          We present recent measurements of the orbital motion in the
          binaries, DF Tau and ZZ Tau, and in the triples, Elias 12, T
          Tau, and V853 Oph. We observed these systems with the Fine
          Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope and with
          adaptive optics imaging at the W. M. Keck and Gemini North
          Observatories. Based on our measurements and those presented in
          the literature, we perform preliminary orbital analyses for DF
          Tau, ZZ Tau, Elias 12 Na-Nb, and T Tau Sa-Sb. Because the
          orbital coverage in most of these systems does not yet span a
          sufficient portion of the orbit, we are not able to find
          definitive orbit solutions. By using a Monte Carlo search
          technique, we explored the orbital parameter space allowed by
          the current set of data available for each binary. We
          constructed weighted distributions for the total mass of the
          binaries derived from a large sample of possible orbits that
          fit the data. These mass distributions show that the total mass
          is already well-defined. We compute total mass estimates of
          0.78 (+0.25/-0.15) Msun, 0.66 (+0.15/-0.11) Msun, 1.13
          (+0.36/-0.09) Msun, and 4.13 (+1.58/-0.97) Msun for DF Tau, ZZ
          Tau, Elias 12 Na-Nb, and T Tau Sa-Sb respectively, using a
          distance of 140 pc. For Elias 12 Na-Nb, where the orbital
          coverage spans ~ 164 deg, we compute a preliminary orbit
          solution with a period of ~ 9-12 years. By including an earlier
          lunar occultation measurement, we also find a likely orbit
          solution for ZZ Tau, with a period of ~ 32 years. With
          additional measurements to continue mapping the orbits, the
          derived dynamical masses will be useful in constraining the
          theoretical tracks of pre-main sequence evolution.

          Astrophysical Journal
          We report on an X-ray flare detected on the active binary
          system II~Pegasi with the Swift telescope. The trigger had a
          10-200 keV luminosity of 2.2$\times10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$-- a
          superflare, by comparison with energies of typical stellar
          flares on active binary systems. The trigger spectrum indicates
          a hot thermal plasma with T$\sim$180 $\times10^{6}$K. X-ray
          spectral analysis from 0.8--200 keV with the X-Ray Telescope
          and BAT in the next two orbits reveals evidence for a thermal
          component (T$>$80 $\times10^{6}$K) and Fe K 6.4 keV emission. A
          tail of emission out to 200 keV can be fit with either an
          extremely high temperature thermal plasma
          (T$\sim3\times10^{8}$K) or power-law emission. Based on
          analogies with solar flares, we attribute the excess continuum
          emission to nonthermal thick-target bremsstrahlung emission
          from a population of accelerated electrons. We estimate the
          radiated energy from 0.01--200 keV to be $\sim6\times10^{36}$
          erg, the total radiated energy over all wavelengths
          $\sim10^{38}$ erg, the energy in nonthermal electrons above 20
          keV $\sim3\times10^{40}$ erg, and conducted energy
          $<5\times10^{43}$ erg. The nonthermal interpretation gives a
          reasonable value for the total energy in electrons $>$ 20 keV
          when compared to the upper and lower bounds on the thermal
          energy content of the flare. This marks the first occasion in
          which evidence exists for nonthermal hard X-ray emission from a
          stellar flare. We investigate the emission mechanism
          responsible for producing the 6.4 keV feature, and find that
          collisional ionization from nonthermal electrons appears to be
          more plausible than the photoionization mechanism usually
          invoked on the Sun and pre-main sequence stars.

          The X-ray burster 4U1850-087, located in the Galactic globular
          cluster NGC6712, is an ultracompact binary (orbital period~21
          min),likely harbouring a degenerate companion.The source has
          been observed at soft gamma-rays several times with the
          INTEGRAL satellite,during the monitoring of the Galactic plane,
          with an unprecedented exposure time.We analysed all available
          INTEGRAL observations, with the main aim of studying the
          long-term behaviour of this Galactic bulge X-ray burster.The
          spectral results are based on the systematic analysis of all
          INTEGRAL observations covering the source position performed
          between March 2003 and November 2005.The source X-ray emission
          is hard and is observed, for the first time, up to 100keV.A
          broad-band spectrum obtained combining the INTEGRAL spectrum
          together with a quasi-simultaneous XMM-Newton observation
          performed in September 2003 is well modeled with a
          disk-blackbody emission (with kTin=0.8keV) together with a
          power-law (photon index=2.1).The 2-100keV luminosity is 1.5E36

          August 2006
          We present the analysis of simultaneous multicolour $uvyI_{\rm
          C}$ photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy for the rapidly
          rotating $\beta$ Cephei star SY Equ. From the photometric time
          series, we confirm the dominant pulsation frequency, $f_1$ =
          6.029 d$^{-1}$, and we find an evidence for two additional
          modes. In spectroscopy, the highest peak occurs at $f_{\rm a}$
          = 0.197 d$^{-1}$ or its alias 0.803 d$^{-1}$. It can be
          interpreted either in terms of a binary motion or as the
          $g$-mode pulsation. In addition, we reveal the pulsation mode
          with frequency of about 6.029 d$^{-1}$, i.e. the same which
          dominates photometric variations, and a few new candidates. For
          the dominant frequency we obtain mode identification from the
          combined photometric and spectroscopic observations. From
          non-adiabatic pulsation calculations, we show that the
          frequency of the dominant mode in SY Equ is consistent with the
          stellar models of much lower effective temperatures than used
          in many papers.

          Systems in Six Nearby Molecular Clouds
          Authors: Karl E. Haisch Jr., Mary Barsony, Michael E. Ressler,

          Comments: 31 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables
          We have obtained new mid-infrared observations of 65 Class
          I/Flat-Spectrum (F.S.) objects in the Perseus, Taurus,
          Chamaeleon I/II, Rho Ophiuchi, and Serpens dark clouds. We
          detected 45/48 (94%) of the single sources, 16/16 (100%) of the
          primary components, and 12/16 (75%) of the secondary/triple
          components of the binary/multiple objects surveyed. The
          composite spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all of our
          sample sources are either Class I or F.S., and, in 15/16
          multiple systems, at least one of the individual components
          displays a Class I or F.S. spectral index. However, the
          occurrence of mixed pairings, such as F.S. with Class I, F.S.
          with Class II, and, in one case, F.S. with Class III, is
          surprisingly frequent. Such behaviour is not consistent with
          that of multiple systems among T Tauri stars (TTS), where the
          companion of a classical TTS also tends to be a classical TTS,
          although other mixed pairings have been previously observed
          among Class II objects. Based on an analysis of the spectral
          indices of the individual binary components, there appears to
          be a higher proportion of mixed Class I/F.S. systems (65-80%)
          than that of mixed Classical/Weak-Lined TTS (25-40%),
          demonstrating that the envelopes of Class I/ F.S. systems are
          rapidly evolving during this evolutionary phase. We report the
          discovery of a steep spectral index secondary companion to
          ISO-ChaI 97, detected for the first time via our mid-infrared
          observations. In our previous near- infrared imaging survey of
          binary/multiple Class I/F.S. sources, ISO-ChaI 97 appeared to
          be single. With a spectral index of Alpha >= 3.9, the secondary
          component of this system is a member of a rare class of very
          steep spectral index objects, those with Alpha > 3. Only three
          such objects have previously been reported, all of which are
          either Class 0 or Class I.

          the gravitational self-force responsible of the inspiral of
          these binary systems. We also discuss the perspectives of
          transferring this technology to the more astrophysically
          relevant case of a central rotating massive black hole.

          We present narrow-band images of the Red Rectangle (RR) nebula
          which reveal the distinct morphologies of this intriguing
          nebula in different optical emission bands. The morphology of
          the RR nebula in blue luminescence (BL) and extended red
          emission (ERE) are almost mutually exclusive. We also present
          the optical detection of the circum-binary disk of the RR in
          the light of the BL. The total intensities from the two optical
          band emissions (BL and ERE) when summed over the nebula are of
          comparable magnitude. Their spatial distributions with respect
          to the embedded illumination sources lead us to suggest that
          they may be attributed to different ionization stages of the
          same family of carriers.

          Authors: Scott A. Hughes
          Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures, for the Proceedings of the Sixth
          International LISA Symposium
          LISA is a planned space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detector
          that would be sensitive to waves from low-frequency sources, in
          the band of roughly $(0.03 - 0.1) {\rm mHz} \lesssim f \lesssim
          0.1 {\rm Hz}$. This is expected to be an extremely rich chunk
          of the GW spectrum -- observing these waves will provide a
          unique view of dynamical processes in astrophysics. Here we
          give a quick survey of some key LISA sources and what GWs can
          uniquely teach us about these sources. Particularly noteworthy
          science which is highlighted here is the potential for LISA to
          track the moderate to high redshift evolution of black hole
          masses and spins through the measurement of GWs generated from
          massive black hole binaries (which in turn form by the merger
          of galaxies and protogalaxies). Measurement of these binary
          black hole waves has the potential to determine the masses and
          spins of the constituent black holes with percent-level
          accuracy or better, providing a unique high-precision probe of
          an aspect of early structure growth. This article is based on
          the ``Astrophysics Tutorial'' talk given by the author at the
          Sixth International LISA Symposium.

          The fine structure and the variations of the optical pulse
          shape and phase of the Crab pulsar are studied on various time
          scales. The observations have been carried out on 4-m William
          Hershel and 6-m BTA telescopes with APD photon counter,
          photomultiplier based 4-channel photometer and PSD based
          panoramic spectrophotopolarimeter with 1$\mu$s time resolution
          in 1994, 1999, 2003 and 2005-2006 years. The upper limit on the
          pulsar precession on Dec 2, 1999 is placed in the 10 s - 2
          hours time range. The evidence of a varying from set to set
          fine structure of the main pulse is found in the 1999 and 2003
          years data. No such fine structure is detected in the integral
          pulse shape of 1994, 1999 and 2003 years.
          The drastic change of the pulse shape in the 2005-2006 years
          set is detected along with the pulse shape variability and
          quasi-periodic phase shifts.

          Title: Neutron Star Asteroseismology. Axial Crust Oscillations
          in the Cowling Approximation
          Authors: Lars Samuelsson, Nils Andersson
          Comments: 14 pages, 1 table, 4 figures
          Recent observations of quasi-periodic oscillations in the
          aftermath of giant flares in soft gamma-ray repeaters suggest a
          close coupling between the seismic motion of the crust after a
          major quake and the modes of oscillations in a magnetar. In
          this paper we consider the purely elastic modes of oscillation
          in the crust of a neutron star in the relativistic Cowling
          approximation (disregarding any magnetic field). We determine
          the axial crust modes for a large set of stellar models, using
          a state-of-the-art crust equation of state and a wide range of
          core masses and radii. We also devise useful approximate
          formulae for the mode-frequencies. We show that the relative
          crust thickness is well described by a function of the
          compactness of the star and a parameter describing the
          compressibility of the crust only. Considering the
          observational data for SGR 1900+14 and SGR 1806-20, we
          demonstrate how our results can be used to constrain the mass
          and radius of an oscillating neutron star.

          Letters
          We calculate the thermal and dynamical evolution of the surface
          layers of an accreting neutron star during the rise of a
          superburst. For the first few hours following unstable 12C
          ignition, the nuclear energy release is transported by
          convection. However, as the base temperature rises, the heating
          time becomes shorter than the eddy turnover time and convection
          becomes inefficient. This results in a hydrodynamic nuclear
          runaway, in which the heating time becomes shorter than the
          local dynamical time. Such hydrodynamic burning can drive shock
          waves into the surrounding layers and may be the trigger for
          the normal X-ray burst found to immediately precede the onset
          of the superburst in both cases where the Rossi X-Ray Timing
          Explorer was observing.

          D. Page, R. Turolla, & S. Zane
          We present a short general overview of the main features of
          exotic models of neutron stars, focusing on the structural and
          dynamical predictions derived from them. In particular, we
          discuss the presence of ``normal'' quark matter and
          Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) states, including their possible
          self-bound versions, and mention some different proposals
          emerging from the study of QCD microphysics. A connection with
          actual observed data is the main goal to be addressed at this
          talk and along the meeting. It is demonstrated that exotic
          equations of state are {\it not} soft if the vacuum
          contributions are large enough, and argued that recent
          measurements of high pulsar masses ($M \geq 2 M_{\odot}$)
          create problems for {\it hadronic} models in which hyperons
          should be present.

          from the Interior to the Surface", edited by D. Page, R.
          Turolla and S. Zane
          The Magnificent Seven have all been discovered by their
          exceptional soft X-ray spectra and high ratios of X-ray to
          optical flux. They all are considered to be nearby sources.
          Searching for similar neutron stars with larger distances, one
          expects larger interstellar absorption resulting in harder
          X-ray counterparts. Current interstellar absorption treatment
          depends on chosen abundances and scattering cross-sections of
          the elements as well as on the 3D distribution of the
          interstellar medium. After a discussion of these factors we use
          the comprehensive 3D measurements of the Local Bubble by
          Lallement et al. 2003 to construct two simple models of the 3D
          distribution of the hydrogen column density. We test these
          models by using a set of soft X-ray sources with known
          distances. Finally, we discuss possible applications for
          distance estimations and population synthesis studies.

          velocities in models with a Higgs singlet
          Authors: Alexander Kusenko
          Comments: 4 pages, one figure
          We identify the range of parameters for which the sterile
          neutrinos can simultaneously explain the cosmological dark
          matter and the observed velocities of pulsars. To satisfy all
          cosmological bounds, the relic sterile neutrinos must be
          produced sufficiently cold. This is possible in a class of
          models with a gauge-singlet Higgs boson, coupled to the
          neutrinos as a singlet Majoron. Sterile dark matter can be
          detected by the x-ray telescopes. The presence of the singlet
          Majoron in the Higgs sector can be tested at the LHC.

          Title: A Statistical Stability Analysis of Earth-like Planetary
          Orbits in Binary Systems
          Authors: M. Fatuzzo, F. C. Adams, R. Gauvin, E. M. Proszkow
          Comments: accepted for publication in PASP
          This paper explores the stability of an Earth-like planet
          orbiting a solar-mass star in the presence of a stellar
          companion using ~ 400,000 numerical integrations. Given the
          chaotic nature of the systems being considered, we perform a
          statistical analysis of the ensuing dynamics for ~500 orbital
          configurations defined by the following set of orbital
          parameters: the companion mass; the companion eccentricity; the
          companion periastron; and the planet's inclination angle
          relative to the stellar binary plane. Specifically, we generate
          a large sample of survival times for each orbital configuration
          through the numerical integration of N >> 1 equivalent
          experiments (e.g., with the same orbital parameters but
          randomly selected initial orbital phases). We then construct
          distributions of survival time using the variable mu_s = log
          tau_s (where tau_s is in years) for each orbital configuration.
          The primary objective of this work is twofold. First, we use
          the mean of the distributions to gain a better understanding of
          what orbital configurations, while unstable, have sufficiently
          long survival times to make them interesting to the study of
          planet habitability. Second, we calculate the width, skew, and
          kurtosis of each mu_s distribution and look for general
          features that may aid further understanding and numerical
          exploration of these chaotic systems.

          Title: A Shell of Thermal X-ray Emission Associated with the

          To appear in the Astrophysical Journal
          Deep X-ray imaging spectroscopy of the bright pulsar wind
          nebula 3C58 confirms the existence of an embedded thermal X-ray
          shell surrounding the pulsar PSR J0205+6449. Radially resolved
          spectra obtained with the XMM-Newton telescope are
          well-characterized by a power-law model with the addition of a
          soft thermal emission component in varying proportions. These
          fits reproduce the well-studied increase in the spectral index
          with radius attributed to synchrotron burn-off of high energy
          electrons. Most interestingly, a radially resolved thermal
          component is shown to map out a shell-like structure ~6' in
          diameter. The presence of a strong emission line corresponding
          to the Ne IX He-like transition requires an overabundance of ~3
          x [Ne/Ne(sun)] in the Raymond-Smith plasma model. The best-fit
          temperature kT ~ 0.23 keV is essentially independent of radius
          for the derived column density of N_H = (4.2 +/- 0.1)E21 per cm
          squared. Our result suggests that thermal shells can be
          obscured in the early evolution of a supernova remnant by
          non-thermal pulsar wind nebulae emission; the luminosity of the
          3C58 shell is more than an order of magnitude below the upper
          limit on a similar shell in the Crab Nebula. We find the shell
          centroid to be offset from the pulsar location. If this neutron
          star has a velocity similar to that of the Crab pulsar, we
          derive an age of 3700 yr and a velocity vector aligned with the
          long axis of the PWN. The shell parameters and pulsar offset
          add to the accumulating evidence that 3C58 is not the remnant
          of the supernova of CE 1181.

          Comments: Accepted by the Astrophysical Journal. 13 pages & 7

          We present raytracing computations for light emitted from the
          surface of a rapidly-rotating neutron star in order to
          construct light curves for X-ray pulsars and bursters. These
          calculations are for realistic models of rapidly-rotating
          neutron stars which take into account both the correct exterior
          metric and the oblate shape of the star. We find that the most
          important effect arising from rotation comes from the oblate
          shape of the rotating star. We find that approximating a
          rotating neutron star as a sphere introduces serious errors in
          fitted values of the star's radius and mass if the rotation
          rate is very large. However, in most cases acceptable fits to
          the ratio M/R can be obtained with the spherical approximation.

          Authors: R.H.D. Corbet, C.B. Markwardt, J. Tueller
          Comments: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal
          Observations of the high-mass X-ray binary 4U 2206+54 with the
          Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) do not show modulation at the
          previously reported period of 9.6 days found from observations
          made with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) All-Sky
          Monitor (ASM). Instead, the strongest peak in the power
          spectrum of the BAT light curve occurs at a period of 19.25 +/-
          0.08 days, twice the period found with the RXTE ASM. The
          maximum of the folded BAT light curve is also delayed compared
          to the maximum of the folded ASM light curve. The most recent
          ASM data folded on twice the 9.6 day period show similar
          morphology to the folded BAT light curve. This suggests that
          the apparent period doubling is a recent secular change rather
          than an energy-dependent effect. The 9.6 day period is thus not
          a permanent strong feature of the light curve. We suggest that
          the orbital period of 4U 2206+54 may be twice the previously
          proposed value.

          Comments: To appear in the January 1, 2007 issue of the
          Astrophysical Journal, 12 pages, 13 figures
          We present results of a high-resolution, near-infrared survey
          of 41 nearby, young (<~300 Myr) M0-M5.0 dwarfs using the Altair
          natural guide star adaptive optics system at the Gemini North
          telescope. Twelve of the objects appear to be binaries, 7 of
          which are reported here for the first time. One triple system
          was discovered. Statistical properties are studied and compared
          with earlier (F to K) and later (>= M6 very low-mass, VLM)
          populations. We find that the separation distribution of the
          binaries in this sample peaks at 13+14-9 AU, which is
          consistent with previous measurements of early-M binaries.
          Hence, early-M binaries seem to occur in--on average--tighter
          systems than G binaries. At the same time they are
          significantly wider than field VLM binary stars. The
          distribution of mass ratios q of primary and secondary stars
          was found to show an intermediate distribution between the
          strongly q-->1 peaked distribution of field VLM systems and the
          almost flat distribution of earlier-type stars. Consequently,
          we show evidence for relatively young, early-M binaries
          representing a transition between the well known earlier star
          distributions and the recently examined field VLM population
          characteristics. Despite the fact that this survey was
          dedicated to the search for faint brown dwarf and planetary
          mass companions, all planetary mass candidates were background
          objects. We exclude the existence of physical companions with
          masses greater than 10 Jupiter masses (M_Jup) at separations of
          >~40 AU and masses greater than 24 M_Jup for separations >~10
          AU around 37 of the 41 observed objects.

          'The multi-messenger approach to high-energy gamma-ray
          sources', Barcelona, July 2006
          Population synthesis is used to study the contribution from
          undetected sources to the Galactic ridge emission measured by
          EGRET. Synthesized source counts are compared with the 3rd
          EGRET catalogue at low and high latitudes. For pulsar-like
          populations, 5-10% of the emission >100 MeV comes from sources
          below the EGRET threshold. A steeper luminosity function can
          increase this to 20% without violating EGRET source statistics.
          Less luminous populations can produce much higher values
          without being detected. Since the unresolved source spectrum is
          different from the interstellar spectrum, it could provide an
          explanation of the observed MeV and GeV excesses above the
          predictions, and we give an explicit example of how this could
          work.

          Authors: Anna L. Watts (MPA), Sanjay Reddy (LANL)
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, to be submitted to PRL
          High frequency oscillations have now been detected in giant
          flares from two magnetars (highly magnetized neutron stars). In
          the most promising model, a crustquake associated with the
          flare triggers global seismic vibrations. Attention has focused
          on toroidal shear modes of the neutron star crust, which are a
          good match to the observed frequencies. In this Letter we
          consider the possibility that magnetars are strange stars
          rather than neutron stars, and compute toroidal shear mode
          frequencies for strange star crust models. The frequencies
          differ significantly from those of neutron star crusts, and
          cannot be reconciled with the observations for reasonable
          magnetar parameters.

          We present a near-infrared spectrum of the close, detached
          white dwarf + brown dwarf binary WD0137-349 (Maxted et al
          2006), that directly reveals the substellar companion through
          an excess of flux longwards of 1.95 microns. We best match the
          data with a white dwarf + L8 composite model. For ages ~1 Gyr,
          the spectral type of the cool secondary is in agreement with
          the mass determined by Maxted et al. (2006) from radial
          velocity measurements (0.053 +/- 0.006Msun), and supports an
          evolutionary scenario in which the brown dwarf survived a
          previous phase of common envelope evolution which resulted in
          the formation of this close binary. The brown dwarf is the
          lowest mass companion to a white dwarf yet found, and the
          lowest mass object known to have survived a common envelope
          phase. At 1300 < T < 1400K WD0137-349B is also the coolest
          known companion to a white dwarf. At a separation a = 0.65Rsun
          the hemisphere of the brown dwarf facing the 16,500K white
          dwarf is being heated through irradiation. We discuss the
          possible effects of this additional heating, with particular
          relevance to those other close binaries with substellar
          companions, the hot Jupiters. We propose future observations to
          investigate the likely temperature differences between the
          ``day'' and ``night'' sides of the brown dwarf.

          Astronomy and Astrophysics
          We present our analysis of the extensive monitoring of SS433 by
          the RXTE observatory collected over the period 1996-2005. The
          difference between energy spectra taken at different
          precessional and orbital phases shows the presence of strong
          photoabsorption (N_H>10^{23}cm^{-2}) near the optical star,
          probably due to its powerful, dense wind. Therefore the size of
          the secondary deduced from analysis of X-ray orbital eclipses
          might be significantly larger than its Roche lobe size, which
          must be taken into account when evaluating the mass ratio from
          analysis of X-ray eclipses. Assuming that a precessing
          accretion disk is geometrically thick, we recover the
          temperature profile in the X-ray emitting jet that best fits
          the observed precessional variations in the X-ray emission
          temperature. The hottest visible part of the X-ray jet is
          located at a distance of l_0/a~0.06-0.09, or ~2-3*10^{11}cm
          from the central compact object, and has a temperature of about
          T_{max}~30 keV. We discovered appreciable orbital X-ray
          eclipses at the ``crossover'' precessional phases (jets are in
          the plane of the sky, disk is edge-on), which under model
          assumptions put a lower limit on the size of the optical
          component R/a>0.5 and an upper limit on a mass ratio of binary
          companions q=M_x/M_{opt}<0.3-0.35, if the X-ray opaque size of
          the star is not larger than 1.2R_{Roche, secondary}.

          Using small automated telescopes in Arizona and Hawaii, the
          HATNet project has detected an object transiting one member of
          the double star system ADS 16402 AB. This system is a pair of
          G0 main-sequence stars with age about 3 Gyr at a distance of
          ~139 pc and projected separation of ~1550 AU. The transit
          signal has a period of 4.46529 days and depth of 0.015 mag.
          From follow-up photometry and spectroscopy, we find that the
          object is a "hot Jupiter" planet with mass about 0.53 M_jup and
          radius ~1.36 R_jup traveling in an orbit with semimajor axis
          0.055 AU and inclination about 85.9 deg, thus transiting the
          star at impact parameter 0.74 of the stellar radius. Based on a
          data set spanning three years, ephemerides for the transit
          center are: T_C = 2453984.397 + N_tr * 4.46529. The planet,
          designated HAT-P-1b, appears to be at least as large in radius,
          and smaller in mean density, than any previously-known planet.

          Title: Sterile dark matter and reionization
          Authors: Alexander Kusenko
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, to appear in proceedings of 7th
          UCLA Symposium on sources and detection of dark matter and dark
          energy in the universe, 22-24 Feb 2006, Marina de Rey,
          California
          Sterile neutrinos with masses in the keV range can be the dark
          matter, and their emission from a supernova can explain the
          observed velocities of pulsars. The sterile neutrino decays
          could produce the x-ray radiation in the early universe, which
          could have an important effect on the formation of the first
          stars. X-rays could ionize gas and could catalyze the
          production of molecular hydrogen during the ``dark ages''. The
          increased fraction of molecular hydrogen could facilitate the
          cooling and collapse of the primordial gas clouds in which the
          first stars were formed.

          Title: The Effect of Orbital Eccentricity on Gravitational Wave
          Background Radiation from Cosmological Binaries
          Authors: Motohiro Enoki, Masahiro Nagashima
          Comments: 15 pages, 12 figures, submitted to Progress of
          Theoretical Physics
          A compact binary on an eccentric orbit radiates gravitational
          waves (GWs) at all integer harmonics of its orbital frequency.
          Thus, the spectral energy distribution, the power and the
          timescale of GW radiation of a binary on an eccentric orbit are
          different from those of a binary on a circular orbit.
          Therefore, in order to predict spectra of gravitational wave
          background radiation (GWBR) from compact binaries, it is
          important to include the effect of orbital eccentricity of
          binaries. In this study, we investigate the effect of orbital
          eccentricity on expected GWBR from extragalactic compact
          binaries. For this purpose, we formulate the power spectrum of
          GWBR from cosmological evolving eccentric binaries. Then we
          apply this formulation to the case of the GWBR from
          supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in galaxy nuclei. The
          key to do this is correctly estimating the number density of
          coalescing SMBH binaries. In this study, we use a semi-analytic
          model of galaxy and SMBH formation. We find that the power
          spectrum of the GWBR from SMBH binaires on eccentric orbits is
          suppressed for frequencies $\lesssim 1 {\rm nHz}$ dependent on
          an assumed initial eccentricity. Our model predicts that while
          the overall shape and amplitude of the power spectrum depend
          largely on galaxy formation processes, eccentricity of binaries
          can affect the shape of the power spectrum for lower
          frequencies $\lesssim 1 {\rm nHz}$. Pulsar timing measurements,
          which can detect GW at this frequency range, would be able to
          constrain the effect of eccentricity on the power spectrum of
          the GWBR from SMBH binaries.

          We obtained BV time series photometry for 12 variable stars
          from the field of the old open cluster NGC 2243. The sample
          includes 3 newly identified detached/semi-detached binaries.
          There are now four detached eclipsing binaries which are likely
          members of the cluster. Determination of the absolute
          parameters of the components would provide a valuable check on
          evolutionary models of low-mass stars. An accurate ephemeris
          and orbital period analysis are presented for the
          previously-known detached binary NV CMa. We also provide
          ephemerides for 7 other periodic variables. We show that 3
          contact binaries are likely members of the cluster.

          Absolute properties of NV CMa
          Authors: J. Kaluzny, W. Pych, S.M. Rucinski, I.B. Thompson
          Comments: 15 pages, 9 figures, Acta Astronomica, in press
          We present echelle spectroscopic data for five eclipsing binary
          stars and two giant stars in the field of the open cluster NGC
          2243. The average cluster velocity is determined to be +60.4 +-
          0.6 km/s. Four of the eclipsing binaries are very likely
          members of the cluster based on their observed radial
          velocities. The absolute parameters of cluster member NV CMa
          are determined by analysing photometric and radial velocity
          data. We obtain 1.089+-0.010 Msun and 1.221+-0.031 Rsun for the
          primary, and 1.069+-0.010 Msun and 178+-0.037 Rsun for the
          secondary. Both components of the binary are located on the
          Main Sequence, about 1 mag. below the turn-off point on the
          cluster color-magnitude diagram. Using model age-luminosity and
          age-radius relations we obtain 4.35+-0.25 Gyr for the age of NV
          CMa. The derived age is, however, very sensitive to the adopted
          metallicity of the cluster. We demonstrate that a meaningful
          determination of the ages of objects like NV CMa based on
          evolutionary models is possible only if their metallicity is
          know with a relative accuracy of a few percent. The distance
          moduli calculated for the components of NV CMa agree closely
          with each other, and imply an apparent distance modulus of the
          cluster of (m-M)_V=13.25+-0.08.

          Observations of the inner radian of the Galactic disk at very
          high energy (VHE) gamma-rays have revealed at least 16 new
          sources. Besides shell type super-nova remnants, pulsar wind
          nebulae (PWN) appear to be a dominant source population in the
          catalogue of VHE gamma-ray sources. Except for the Crab nebula,
          the newly discovered PWN are resolved at VHE gamma-rays to be
          spatially extended (5-20 pc). Currently, at least 3 middle aged
          ($t>10$ kyrs) PWN (Vela X, G18.0-0.7, and G313.3+0.6 in the
          ``Kookaburra'' region) and 1 young PWN MSH 15-5{\it2} ($t=1.55$
          kyrs) have been identified to be VHE emitting PWN (sometimes
          called ``TeV Plerions''). Two more candidate ``TeV Plerions''
          have been identifed and have been reported at this conference
          [1]. In this contribution, the gamma-ray emission from Vela X
          is explained by a nucleonic component in the pulsar wind. The
          measured broad band spectral energy distribution is compared
          with the expected X-ray emission from primary and secondary
          electrons. The observed X-ray emission and TeV emission from
          the three middle aged PWN are compared with each other.

          Comments: 28 pages, including 6 figures and 2 tables, accepted
          for publication in MNRAS
          Orbital angular momentum (Jo), systemic mass (M) and orbital
          period (P) distributions of chromospherically active binaries
          (CAB) and W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) systems were investigated.
          The diagrams of log Jo - log P, log M - log P and log Jo-log M
          were formed from 119 CAB and 102 W UMa stars. The log Jo-log M
          diagram is found to be most meaningful in demonstrating
          dynamical evolution of binary star orbits. A slightly curved
          borderline (contact border) separating the detached and the
          contact systems was discovered on the log Jo - log M diagram.
          Since orbital size (a) and period (P) of binaries are
          determined by their current Jo, M and mass ratio q, the rates
          of orbital angular momentum loss (dlog Jo/dt) and mass loss
          (dlog M/dt) are primary parameters to determine the direction
          and the speed of the dynamical evolution. A detached system
          becomes a contact system if its own dynamical evolution enables
          it to pass the contact border on the log Jo - log M diagram.
          Evolution of q for a mass loosing detached system is unknown
          unless mass loss rate for each component is known. Assuming q
          is constant in the first approximation and using the mean
          decreasing rates of Jo and M from the kinematical ages of CAB
          stars, it has been predicted that 11, 23 and 39 cent of current
          CAB stars would transform to W UMa systems if their nuclear
          evolution permits them to live 2, 4 and 6 Gyrs respectively.

          Comments: 11 pages, 10 figures, accepted to MNRAS
          We report the discovery of twenty-one hitherto unknown bright
          southern ultracool dwarfs with spectral types in the range M7
          to L5.5, together with new observations of a further three late
          M dwarfs previously confirmed. Three more objects are already
          identified in the literature as high proper motion stars;we
          derive their spectral types for the first time. All objects
          were selected from the 2MASS All Sky and SuperCOSMOS point
          source databases on the basis of their optical/near-infrared
          colours, $J$-band magnitudes and proper motions. Low resolution
          (R $\sim$ 1000) $JH$ spectroscopy with the ESO/NTT SOFI
          spectrograph has confirmed the ultracool nature of 24 targets,
          out of a total of 25 candidates observed. Spectral types are
          derived by direct comparison with template objects and compared
          to results from H$_2$O and FeH indices. We also report the
          discovery of one binary, as revealed by SOFI acquisition
          imaging; spectra were taken for both components. The spectral
          types of the two components are L2 and L4 and the distance
          $\sim$ 19 pc. Spectroscopic distances and transverse velocities
          are derived for the sample. Two $\sim$ L5 objects lie only
          $\sim$ 10 pc distant. Such nearby objects are excellent targets
          for further study to derive their parallaxes and to search for
          fainter, later companions with AO and/or methane imaging.

          Understanding the galaxy in which we live is one of the great
          intellectual challenges facing modern science. With the advent
          of high quality observational data, the chemical evolution
          modeling of our galaxy has been the subject of numerous studies
          in the last years. However, all these studies have one missing
          element which is the evolution of close binaries. Reason: their
          evolution is very complex and single stars only perhaps can do
          the job. (Un)Fortunately at present we know that a significant
          fraction of the observed intermediate mass and massive stars
          are members of a binary or multiple system and that certain
          objects can only be formed through binary evolution. Therefore
          galactic studies that do not account for close binaries may be
          far from realistic. We implemented a detailed binary population
          in a galactic chemical evolutionary model. Notice that this is
          not something simple like replacing chemical yields. Here we
          discuss three topics: the effect of binaries on the evolution
          of 14N, the evolution of the type Ia supernova rate and the
          effects on the G-dwarf distribution, the link between the
          evolution of the r-process elements and double neutron star
          mergers (candidates of short gamma-ray burst objects).

          The High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) experiment has observed
          the GZK cutoff. HiRes' measurement of the flux of cosmic rays
          shows a sharp suppression at an energy of 6 x 10^{19} eV,
          exactly the expected cutoff energy. We observe the ``ankle'' of
          the cosmic ray spectrum as well, at an energy of 4 x 10^{18}
          eV. We describe the experiment, data collection, analysis, and
          estimate the systematic uncertainties. The results are
          presented and the calculation of a five standard deviation
          observation of the GZK cutoff is described.

          London, UK, 24-28 April 2006
          Thanks to INTEGRAL's long exposures of the Galactic Plane, the
          two brightest Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters, SGR 1806-20 and SGR
          1900+14, have been monitored and studied in detail for the
          first time at hard-X/soft gamma rays.
          This has produced a wealth of new scientific results, which we
          will review here. Since SGR 1806-20 was particularly active
          during the last two years, more than 300 short bursts have been
          observed with INTEGRAL. and their characteristics have been
          studied with unprecedented sensitivity in the 15-200 keV range.
          A hardness-intensity anticorrelation within the bursts has been
          discovered and the overall Number-Intensity distribution of the
          bursts has been determined. In addition, a particularly active
          state, during which ~100 bursts were emitted in ~10 minutes,
          has been observed on October 5 2004, indicating that the source
          activity was rapidly increasing. This eventually led to the
          Giant Flare of December 27th 2004, for which a possible soft
          gamma-ray (>80 keV) early afterglow has been detected.
          The deep observations allowed us to discover the persistent
          emission in hard X-rays (20-150 keV) from 1806-20 and 1900+14,
          the latter being in a quiescent state, and to directly compare
          the spectral characteristics of all Magnetars (two SGRs and
          three Anomalous X-ray Pulsars) detected with INTEGRAL.

          Title: The Formation of the Double Pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B}
          Authors: I. H. Stairs, S. E. Thorsett, R. J. Dewey, M. Kramer,
          C. A. McPhee
          Comments: To appear in MNRAS Letters
          Recent timing observations of the double pulsar J0737-3039A/B
          have shown that its transverse velocity is extremely low, only
          10 km/s, and nearly in the Plane of the Galaxy. With this new
          information, we rigorously re-examine the history and formation
          of this system, determining estimates of the pre-supernova
          companion mass, supernova kick and misalignment angle between
          the pre- and post-supernova orbital planes. We find that the
          progenitor to the recently formed `B' pulsar was probably less
          than 2 MSun, lending credence to suggestions that this object
          may not have formed in a normal supernova involving the
          collapse of an iron core. At the same time, the supernova kick
          was likely non-zero. A comparison to the history of the
          double-neutron-star binary B1534+12 suggests a range of
          possible parameters for the progenitors of these systems, which
          should be taken into account in future binary population
          syntheses and in predictions of the rate and spatial
          distribution of short gamma-ray burst events.

          supporting material
          The double pulsar system, PSR J0737-3039A/B, is unique in that
          both neutron stars are detectable as radio pulsars. This,
          combined with significantly higher mean orbital velocities and
          accelerations when compared to other binary pulsars, suggested
          that the system would become the best available testbed for
          general relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the
          strong-field regime. Here we report on precision timing
          observations taken over the 2.5 years since its discovery and
          present four independent strong-field tests of general
          relativity. Use of the theory-independent mass ratio of the two
          stars makes these tests uniquely different from earlier
          studies. By measuring relativistic corrections to the Keplerian
          description of the orbital motion, we find that the
          ``post-Keplerian'' parameter s agrees with the value predicted
          by Einstein's theory of general relativity within an
          uncertainty of 0.05%, the most precise test yet obtained. We
          also show that the transverse velocity of the system's center
          of mass is extremely small. Combined with the system's location
          near the Sun, this result suggests that future tests of
          gravitational theories with the double pulsar will supersede
          the best current Solar-system tests. It also implies that the
          second-born pulsar may have formed differently to the usually
          assumed core-collapse of a helium star.

          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL
          We report the discovery of a bright (H=12.77) brown dwarf
          designated IBIS J013656.57+093347.3. The discovery was made as
          part of the Infrared Brown dwarf Identification Survey (IBIS),
          which uses proper motion and near-infrared/optical photometry
          to identify brown dwarf candidates. A low resolution (R~40)
          spectrum of this brown dwarf covering the 0.88-2.35 microns
          wavelength interval is presented. Analysis of the spectrum
          indicates a spectral type of T2.5+/-0.5. A photometric distance
          of 6.4+/-0.3 pc is estimated assuming it is a single object.
          Current observations rule out a binary of mass ratio ~1 and
          separation >5 AU. IBIS0136 is the brightest T dwarf in the
          northern hemisphere and is surpassed only by Eps Indi Bab over
          the whole sky. It is thus an excellent candidate for detailed
          studies and should become a benchmark object for the early-T
          spectral class.

          Title: INTEGRAL observations of TeV plerions
          Authors: A. I. D. Hoffmann, D. Horns, A. Santangelo
          Comments: 4 pages, 6 figures, proceedings of conference "The
          Multi-Messenger Approach to High-Energy Gamma-ray Sources"
          Barcelona/Spain (2006)
          Amongst the sources seen in very high gamma-rays several are
          associated with Pulsar Wind Nebulae (``TeV plerions''). The
          study of hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray emission is providing an
          important insight into the energetic particle population
          present in these objects. The unpulsed emission from
          pulsar/pulsar wind nebula systems in the energy range
          accessible to the INTEGRAL satellite is mainly synchrotron
          emission from energetic and fast cooling electrons close to
          their acceleration site. Our analyses of public INTEGRAL data
          of known TeV plerions detected by ground based Cherenkov
          telescopes indicate a deeper link between these TeV plerions
          and INTEGRAL detected pulsar wind nebulae. The newly discovered
          TeV plerion in the northern wing of the Kookaburra region
          (G313.3+0.6 powered by the middle aged PSR J1420-6048) is found
          to have a previously unknown INTEGRAL counterpart which is
          besides the Vela pulsar the only middle aged pulsar detected
          with INTEGRAL. We do not find an INTEGRAL counterpart of the
          TeV plerion associated with the X-ray PWN ``Rabbit'' G313.3+0.1
          which is possibly powered by a young pulsar.

          Comments: Submitted to ApJ, 11 pages, 11 figures
          With recent and archival Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
          X-ray measurements of the heavily obscured X-ray pulsar EXO
          1722-363 (IGR J17252-3616), we carried out a pulse timing
          analysis to determine the orbital solution for the first time.
          The binary system is characterized by a_x sin(i) = 101 +/- 3
          lt-s and P_orb = 9.7403 +/- 0.0004 days (90% confidence), with
          the precision of the orbital period being obtained by
          connecting datasets separated by more than 7 years (272 orbital
          cycles). The orbit is consistent with circular, and e < 0.19 at
          the 90% confidence level. The mass function is 11.7 +/- 1.2
          M_sun and confirms that this source is a High Mass X-ray Binary
          (HMXB) system. The orbital period, along with the previously
          known ~414 s pulse period, places this system in the part of
          the Corbet diagram populated by supergiant wind accretors.
          Using previous eclipse time measurements by Corbet et al. and
          our orbital solution, combined with the assumption that the
          primary underfills its Roche lobe, we find i > 61 degrees at
          the 99% confidence level, the radius of the primary is between
          21 R_sun and 37 R_sun, and its mass is less than about 22
          M_sun. The acceptable range of radius and mass shows that the
          primary is probably a supergiant of spectral type B0I-B5I.
          Photometric measurements of its likely counterpart are
          consistent with the spectral type and luminosity if the
          distance to the system is between 5.3 kpc and 8.7 kpc. Spectral
          analysis of the pulsar as a function of orbital phase reveals
          an evolution of the hydrogen column density suggestive of dense
          filaments of gas in the downstream wake of the pulsar, with
          higher levels of absorption seen at orbital phases 0.5-1.0, as
          well as a variable Fe K_alpha line.

          Title: Dark matter sterile neutrinos in stellar collapse:
          alteration of energy/lepton number transport and a mechanism
          for supernova explosion enhancement
          Authors: Jun Hidaka, George M. Fuller
          Comments: 13 pages, 9 figures
          We investigate matter-enhanced Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein
          (MSW) active-sterile neutrino conversion in the $\nu_e
          \rightleftharpoons \nu_s$ channel in the collapse of the iron
          core of a pre-supernova star. For values of sterile neutrino
          rest mass $m_s$ and vacuum mixing angle $\theta$ (specifically,
          $0.5 {\rm keV}< m_s<10 {\rm keV}$ and $\sin^22\theta>
          5\times{10}^{-12}$) which include those required for viable
          sterile neutrino dark matter, our one-zone in-fall phase
          collapse calculations show a significant reduction in core
          lepton fraction. This would result in a smaller homologous core
          and therefore a smaller initial shock energy, disfavoring
          successful shock re-heating and the prospects for an explosion.
          However, these calculations also suggest that the MSW resonance
          energy can exhibit a minimum located between the center and
          surface of the core. In turn, this suggests a post-core-bounce
          mechanism to enhance neutrino transport and neutrino
          luminosities at the core surface and thereby augment shock
          re-heating: (1) scattering-induced or coherent MSW
          $\nu_e\to\nu_s$ conversion occurs deep in the core, at the
          first MSW resonance, where $\nu_e$ energies are large ($\sim
          150$ MeV); (2) the high energy $\nu_s$ stream outward at near
          light speed; (3) they deposit their energy when they encounter
          the second MSW resonance $\nu_s\to\nu_e$ just below the
          proto-neutron star surface.

          Title: Mountains on Neutron Stars: Accreted vs. Non-Accreted
          crusts
          Authors: B. Haskell, D.I. Jones, N. Andersson
          Comments: Accepted by MNRAS
          The aim of this paper is to compare the two cases of an
          isolated neutron star, with a non-accreted crust, and that of
          an accreting neutron star, with an accreted crust, and try to
          estimate which one of the two would make a better source of
          gravitational waves. In order to do this we must evaluate the
          maximum ``mountain'' that the crust can sustain in these two
          cases. We first do this using the formalism of Ushomirsky,
          Cutler and Bildsten (2000) and find that the maximum quadrupole
          is very similar in the two cases, with the non-accreted crust
          sustaining a slightly larger mountain. We then develop a
          perturbation formalism for the problem, that allows us to drop
          the Cowling approximation and have more control over the
          boundaries. The use of this formalism confirms that there is
          not much difference between the two cases, but leads to results
          approximately one order of magnitude larger than those we
          obtain with the formalism of Ushomirsky, Cutler and Bildsten
          (2000).

          Centre
          Authors: Idan Ginsburg, Abraham Loeb
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Recent surveys have identified seven hypervelocity stars (HVSs)
          in the halo of the Milky Way. Most of these stars may have
          originated from the breakup of binary star systems by the
          nuclear black hole SgrA*. In some instances, the breakup of the
          binary may lead to a collision between its member stars. We
          examine the dynamical properties of these collisions by
          simulating thousands of different binary orbits around SgrA*
          with a direct N-body integration code. For some orbital
          parameters, the two stars collide with an impact velocity lower
          than their escape velocity and may therefore coalesce. Some of
          the massive S-stars near Sgr A* might be the merger remnants of
          binary systems.

          Authors: B. A. Jacoby, M. Bailes, S. M. Ord, H. S. Knight, A.
          W. Hotan
          Comments: 15 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We present five recycled pulsars discovered during a 21-cm
          survey of approximately 4,150 deg^2 between 15 deg and 30 deg
          from the galactic plane using the Parkes radio telescope. One
          new pulsar, PSR J1528-3146, has a 61 ms spin period and a
          massive white dwarf companion. Like many recycled pulsars with
          heavy companions, the orbital eccentricity is relatively high
          (~0.0002), consistent with evolutionary models that predict
          less time for circularization. The four remaining pulsars have
          short spin periods (3 ms < P < 6 ms); three of these have
          probable white dwarf binary companions and one (PSR J2010-1323)
          is isolated. PSR J1600-3053 is relatively bright for its
          dispersion measure of 52.3 pc cm^-3 and promises good timing
          precision thanks to an intrinsically narrow feature in its
          pulse profile, resolvable through coherent dedispersion. In
          this survey, the recycled pulsar discovery rate was one per
          four days of telescope time or one per 600 deg^2 of sky. The
          variability of these sources implies that there are more
          millisecond pulsars that might be found by repeating this
          survey.

          Since the discovery, with the EINSTEIN satellite, of strong
          X-ray emission associated with HD93162 (=WR25), this object has
          been predicted to be a colliding-wind binary system. However,
          radial-velocity variations that would prove the suspected
          binary nature have yet to be found. We spectroscopically
          monitored this object to investigate its possible variability
          to address this discordance. We compiled the largest available
          radial-velocity data set for this star to look for variations
          that might be due to binary motion. We derived radial
          velocities from spectroscopic data acquired mainly between 1994
          and 2006, and searched these radial velocities for
          periodicities using different numerical methods. For the first
          time, periodic radial-velocity variations are detected. Our
          analysis definitively shows that the Wolf-Rayet star WR25 is an
          eccentric binary system with a probable period of about 208
          days.

          Submitted to ApJ
          To better understand several key event rates involving binary
          evolution and compact objects in Milky Way-like galaxies, we
          perform a methodical parameter study of the StarTrack
          population synthesis code. We significantly generalize earlier
          studies, and we provide thoroughly tested and well understood
          multidimensional fits for event rate results. These fits can be
          used in lieu of large-scale population calculations which are
          often forbiddingly computationally demanding. We anticipate
          that these efficient tools will facilitate the exploration of
          the dependence of rate predictions on a wide range binary
          evolution parameters and allow the derivation of constraints on
          these parameters, given empirical rate constraints and
          accounting for fitting errors.

          Title: The giant star of the symbiotic system YY Her: Rotation,
          Tidal wave, Solar-type cycle and Spots
          Authors: Liliana Formiggini, Elia M. Leibowitz (Tel Aviv

          Comments: 8 pages, 8 figures. Accepted by MNRAS
          We analyze the historical light curve of the symbiotic star YY
          Her, from 1890 up to December 2005. A secular declining trend
          is detected, at a rate of ~.01 magn in 1000 d, suggesting that
          the system could belong to the sub-class of symbiotic novae.
          Several outburst events are superposed on this slow decline.
          Three independent periodicities are identified in the light
          curve. A quasi-periodicity of 4650.7 d is detected for the
          outburst occurrence. We suggest that it is a signature of a
          solar-type magnetic dynamo cycle in the giant component. A
          period of 593.2 d modulates the quiescent light curve and it is
          identified as the binary period of the system. During outburst
          events the system shows a stable periodic oscillation of 551.4
          d. We suggest that it is the rotation period of the giant.The
          secondary minima detected at some epochs of quiescence are
          probably due to dark spots on the surface of the rotating
          giant.
          The difference between the frequencies of these two last
          periods is the frequency of a tidal wave in the outer layers of
          the giant. A period which is a beat between the magnetic cycle
          and the tidal wave period is also apparent in the light curve.
          YY Her is a third symbiotic system exhibiting these cycles in
          their light curve, suggesting that a magnetic dynamo process is
          prevalent in the giant components of symbiotic stars, playing
          an important role in the outburst mechanism of some of these
          systems.

          A new type of sources has been discovered by INTEGRAL. These
          sources are in the course of being unveiled by means of
          multi-wavelength optical, near- and mid-infrared observations.
          Among the high-energy binary sources, two distinct classes are
          appearing. The first class is constituted of intrinsically
          obscured high-energy sources, of which IGR J16318-4848 seems to
          be the archetype. The second class is populated by the
          so-called supergiant fast X-ray transients, with IGR
          J17544-2619 being the archetype. We report here on
          multi-wavelength observations of sources from these two
          classes, focusing on optical to mid-infrared observations. We
          show that in the case of the obscured sources IGR J16318-4848
          and IGR J16195-4945, our observations suggest the presence of
          absorbing material (dust and/or cold gas) enshrouding the whole
          binary system. We then discuss the nature of these two
          different types of sources.

          Title: Accurate and realistic initial data for black
          hole-neutron star binaries
          Authors: Philippe Grandclement (LUTH)
          Comments: 5 pages, 6 figures
          This paper is devoted to the computation of compact binaries
          composed of one black hole and one neutron star. The objects
          are assumed to be on exact circular orbits. Standard 3+1
          decomposition of Einstein equations is performed and the
          conformal flatness approximation is used. The obtained system
          of elliptic equations is solved by means of multi-domain
          spectral methods. Results are compared with previous work both
          in the high mass ratio limit and for one neutron star with very
          low compactness parameter. The accuracy of the present code is
          shown to be greater than with previous codes. Moreover, for the
          first time, some sequences containing one neutron star of
          realistic compactness are presented and discussed.

          We construct quasiequilibrium sequences of black hole-neutron
          star binaries for arbitrary mass ratios by solving the
          constraint equations of general relativity in the conformal
          thin-sandwich decomposition. We model the neutron star as a
          stationary polytrope satisfying the relativistic equations of
          hydrodynamics, and account for the black hole by imposing
          equilibrium boundary conditions on the surface of an excised
          sphere (the apparent horizon). In this paper we focus on
          irrotational configurations, meaning that both the neutron star
          and the black hole are approximately nonspinning in an inertial
          frame. We present results for a binary with polytropic index
          n=1, mass ratio M_{irr}^{BH}/M_{B}^{NS}=5 and neutron star
          compaction M_{ADM,0}^{NS}/R_0=0.0879, where M_{irr}^{BH} is the
          irreducible mass of the black hole, M_{B}^{NS} the neutron star
          baryon rest-mass, and M_{ADM,0}^{NS} and R_0 the neutron star
          Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass and areal radius in isolation,
          respectively. Our models represent valid solutions to
          Einstein's constraint equations and may therefore be employed
          as initial data for dynamical simulations of black hole-neutron
          star binaries.

          Title: The Sun is a plasma diffuser that sorts atoms by mass
          Authors: O. Manuel, S. A. Kamat, M. Mozina
          Comments: 20 pages, 92 references, 8 figures show that the Sun
          is an iron rich magnetic plasma diffuser that selectively moves
          lightweight elements and isotopes of each element to its
          surface. Solar luminosity, neutrinos, mass fractionation, and
          the outpouring of H ions in the solar wind arise from neutron
          emission and decay at the solar core
          The Sun is a magnetic plasma diffuser that selectively moves
          light elements like H and He and the lighter isotopes of each
          element to its surface. The Sun formed on the collapsed core of
          a supernova. It consists mostly of iron, oxygen, nickel,
          silicon and sulfur made near the SN core, like the rocky
          planets and ordinary meteorites. H ions, generated by emission
          and decay of neutrons at the core, are accelerated upward by
          deep magnetic fields, thus acting as a carrier gas that
          maintains mass separation in the Sun. Neutron emission from the
          central neutron star triggers a series of reactions that
          generate solar luminosity, solar neutrinos, solar
          mass-fractionation, and an outpouring of the neutron decay
          product, H, in the solar wind. Mass fractionation appears to
          have operated in the parent star as well, and likely occurs in
          other stars.

          We discuss a set of tests which confront observations of
          cooling compact objects and theories of their thermal
          evolution. As an example we apply the recently developed
          $\mathrm{Log N}$-$\mathrm{Log S}$ test of compact star cooling
          theories to hybrid stars with a color superconducting quark
          matter core, we also apply and discuss other existing tests.
          While there is not yet a microscopically founded
          superconducting quark matter phase which would fulfill
          constraints from cooling phenomenology, we explore the
          hypothetical 2SC+X phase and show that the magnitude and
          density-dependence of the X-gap can be chosen to satisfy a set
          of tests: the temperature -- age ($\mathrm{T}$-$\mathrm{t}$)
          test, the $\mathrm{Log N}$-$\mathrm{Log S}$ test, the
          brightness constraint, and the mass spectrum constraint. Some
          recent modifications of the population synthesis model used to
          obtain the $\mathrm{Log N}$-$\mathrm{Log S}$ distribution are
          briefly discussed. In addition, we propose to use the
          age-distance diagram as a new tool to study the local
          population of young isolated neutron stars.

          Title: The Nature of the Secondary Star in the Black Hole X-Ray
          Transient V616 Mon (=A0620-00)
          Authors: Thomas E. Harrison, Steve B. Howell, Paula Szkody,
          France A. Cordova
          Comments: 20 pages, 5 figures
          We have used NIRSPEC on Keck II to obtain $K$-band spectroscopy
          of the low mass X-ray binary V616 Mon (= A0620$-$00). V616 Mon
          is the proto-typical soft x-ray transient containing a black
          hole primary. As such it is important to constrain the masses
          of the binary components. The modeling of the infrared
          observations of ellipsoidal variations in this system lead to a
          derived mass of 11.0 M$_{\sun}$ for the black hole. The
          validity of this derivation has been called into question due
          to the possiblity that the secondary star's spectral energy
          distribution is contaminated by accretion disk emission (acting
          to dilute the variations). Our new $K$-band spectrum of V616
          Mon reveals a late-type K dwarf secondary star, but one that
          has very weak $^{\rm 12}$CO absorption features. Comparison of
          V616 Mon with SS Cyg leads us to estimate that the accretion
          disk supplies only a small amount of $K$-band flux, and the
          ellipsoidal variations are not seriously contaminated. If true,
          the derived orbital inclination of V616 Mon is not greatly
          altered, and the mass of the black hole remains large. A
          preliminary stellar atmosphere model for the $K$-band spectrum
          of V616 Mon reveals that the carbon abundance is approximately
          50% of the solar value. We conclude that the secondary star in
          V616 Mon has either suffered serious contamination from the
          accretion of supernova ejecta that created the black hole
          primary, or it is the stripped remains of a formerly more
          massive secondary star, one in which the CNO cycle had been
          active.

          Title: What Really is the Relativistic Radio-Jet Distance of
          GRO J1655--40?

          May 2006, in Blankenberge, Belgium)
          GRO J1655--40 is a galactic microquasar, i.e. a short-period
          binary with relativistic radio-jets and where the companion is
          a black-hole. A little after its discovery in 1994 by $BATSE$,
          a distance of 3.2$\pm$0.2 kpc has been estimated, and at which
          the radio jets appeared superluminal. Since that time, this
          distance of GRO J1655--40 has been discussed in many studies,
          often strengthening the value of 3.2 kpc, and used in numerous
          models. However, recently, \citet{Foellmi-etal-2006b-astroph}
          used new VLT-UVES and {\it published} photometric data to show
          that GRO J1655--40 must be closer than 1.7 kpc and that the
          accuracy of the main distance estimators for this source can be
          questioned. Still, the details on how really the distance of
          3.2 kpc has been build was not fully clear. It is the purpose
          of this article to show that while the {\it upper} limit to the
          distance is rather firm, the lower limit is not. We draw some
          conclusions about the new understanding we have of GRO
          J1655--40, and finally present a new and promising method that
          can be used to determine the distance of GRO J1655--40, and
          maybe many faint and embedded stars.

          Young, rapidly rotating neutron stars could accelerate protons
          to energies of $\sim 1$ PeV close to the stellar surface, which
          scatter with x-rays from the stellar surface through the
          $\Delta$ resonance and produce pions. The pions subsequently
          decay to produce muon neutrinos. We find that the energy
          spectrum of muon neutrinos consists of a sharp rise at $\sim
          50$ TeV, corresponding to the onset of the resonance, above
          which the flux drops as $\epsilon_\nu^{-2}$ up to an
          upper-energy cut-off that is determined by either kinematics or
          by the maximum energy to which protons are accelerated. We
          predict event rates as high as 10-50 km$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ from
          relatively young, close neutron stars. Such fluxes would be
          detectable by IceCube.

          We present a study of the neutron star X-Ray Transient Cen X-4.
          Our aim is to look for any evidence of irradiation of the
          companion with a detailed analysis of its radial velocity
          curve, relative contribution of the donor star and Doppler
          tomography of the main emission lines. To improve our study all
          our data are compared with a set of simulations that consider
          different physical parameters of the system, like the disc
          aperture angle and the mass ratio. We conclude that neither the
          radial velocity curve nor the orbital variation of the relative
          donor's contribution to the total flux are affected by
          irradiation. On the other hand, we do see emission from the
          donor star at H${\alpha}$ and HeI 5876 which we tentatively
          attribute to irradiation effects. In particular, the
          H${\alpha}$ emission from the companion is clearly asymmetric
          and we suggest is produced by irradiation from the hot-spot.
          Finally, from the velocity of the HeI 5876 spot we constrain
          the disc opening angle to alpha=7-14 deg.

          Title: Sedimentation and Type I X-ray Bursts at Low Accretion
          Rates
          Authors: Fang Peng, Edward F. Brown, James W. Truran
          Comments: 15 pages, 14 figures, submitted to ApJ, revised
          version
          Neutron stars, with their strong surface gravity, have
          interestingly short timescales for the sedimentation of heavy
          elements. Motivated by observations of Type I X-ray bursts from
          sources with extremely low persistent accretion luminosities,
          $L_X < 10^{36}\usp\ergspersecond (\simeq
          0.01\ensuremath{L_{\mathrm{Edd}}}$), we study how sedimentation
          affects the distribution of isotopes and the ignition of H and
          He in the envelope of an accreting neutron star. For local mass
          accretion rates $\mdot \lesssim 10^{-2}\medd$ (for which the
          ignition of H is unstable), where $\medd = 8.8\times
          10^{4}\nsp\gpscps$, the helium and CNO elements sediment out of
          the accreted fuel before reaching a temperature where H would
          ignite. Using one-zone calculations of the thermonuclear
          burning, we find a range of accretion rates for which the
          unstable H ignition does not trigger unstable He burning. This
          range depends on the emergent flux from reactions in the deep
          neutron star crust; for $F = 0.1\nsp\MeV(\dot{m}/\mb)$, the
          range is $3\times 10^{-3}\medd\lesssim\mdot\lesssim
          10^{-2}\medd$. We speculate that sources accreting in this
          range will build up a massive He layer that later produces an
          energetic and long X-ray burst. At mass accretion rates lower
          than this range, we find that the H flash leads to a strong
          mixed H/He flash. Surprisingly, even at accretion rates $\mdot
          \gtrsim 0.1\medd$, although the H and He do not completely
          segregate, the H abundance at the base of the accumulated layer
          is still reduced. While following the evolution of the X-ray
          burst is beyond the scope of this introductory paper, we note
          that the reduced proton-to-seed ratio favors the production of
          \iso{12}{C}--an important ingredient for subsequent
          superbursts.

          However, while some of the new sources can be associated by
          positional coincidence as well as by consistent
          multi-wavelength data to a known counterpart at other
          wavelengths, most of the sources remain not finally identified.
          In the following, the population of Galactic H.E.S.S. sources
          will be used to demonstrate the status of the identifications,
          to classify them into categories according to this status and
          to point out outstanding problems.

          Title: Effective charge and free energy of DNA inside an ion
          channel
          Authors: Jingshan Zhang, B. I. Shklovskii
          Comments: 10 pages, 10 figures, organization is improved
          Subj-class: Soft Condensed Matter; Subcellular Processes
          Translocation of a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) through an
          alpha-hemolysin channel in a lipid membrane driven by applied
          transmembrane voltage V was extensively studied recently. While
          the bare charge of the ssDNA piece inside the channel is
          approximately 12 (in units of electron charge) measurements of
          different effective charges resulted in values between one and
          two. We explain these challenging observations by a large
          self-energy of a charge in the narrow water filled gap between
          ssDNA and channel walls, related to large difference between
          dielectric constants of water and lipid, and calculate
          effective charges of ssDNA. We start from the most fundamental
          stall charge $q_s$, which determines the force $F_s= q_s V/L$
          stalling DNA against the voltage V (L is the length of the
          channel). We show that the stall charge $q_s$ is proportional
          to the ion current blocked by DNA, which is small due to the
          self-energy barrier. Large voltage V reduces the capture
          barrier which DNA molecule should overcome in order to enter
          the channel by $|q_c|V$, where $q_c$ is the effective capture
          charge. We expressed it through the stall charge $q_s$. We also
          relate the stall charge $q_s$ to two other effective charges
          measured for ssDNA with a hairpin in the back end: the charge
          $q_u$ responsible for reduction of the barrier for unzipping of
          the hairpin and the charge $q_e$ responsible for DNA escape in
          the direction of hairpin against the voltage. At small V we
          explain reduction of the capture barrier with the salt
          concentration.

          Title: Nuclear symmetry energy effects on neutron stars
          properties
          Authors: V.P. Psonis, Ch.C. Moustakidis, S.E. Massen
          Comments: 15 pages, 23 figures
          We construct a class of nuclear equations of state based on a
          schematic potential model, that originates from the work of
          Prakash et. al. \cite{Prakash-88}, which reproduce the results
          of most microscopic calculations. The equations of state are
          used as input for solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov
          equations for corresponding neutron stars. The potential part
          contribution of the symmetry energy to the total energy is
          parameterized in a generalized form both for low and high
          values of the baryon density. Special attention is devoted to
          the construction of the symmetry energy in order to reproduce
          the results of most microscopic calculations of dense nuclear
          matter. The obtained nuclear equations of state are applied for
          the systematic study of the global properties of a neutron star
          (masses, radii and composition). The calculated masses and
          radii of the neutron stars are plotted as a function of the
          potential part parameters of the symmetry energy. A linear
          relation between these parameters, the radius and the maximum
          mass of the neutron star is obtained. In addition, a linear
          relation between the radius and the derivative of the symmetry
          energy near the saturation density is found. We also address on
          the problem of the existence of correlation between the
          pressure near the saturation density and the radius.

          Title: MECI: A Method for Eclipsing Component Identification
          Authors: Jonathan Devor, David Charbonneau
          Comments: 25 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We describe an automated method for assigning the most probable
          physical parameters to the components of an eclipsing binary,
          using only its photometric light curve and combined colors.
          With traditional methods, one attempts to optimize a
          multi-parameter model over many iterations, so as to minimize
          the chi-squared value. We suggest an alternative method, where
          one selects pairs of coeval stars from a set of theoretical
          stellar models, and compares their simulated light curves and
          combined colors with the observations. This approach greatly
          reduces the parameter space over which one needs to search, and
          allows one to estimate the components' masses, radii and
          absolute magnitudes, without spectroscopic data. We have
          implemented this method in an automated program using published
          theoretical isochrones and limb-darkening coefficients. Since
          it is easy to automate, this method lends itself to systematic
          analyses of datasets consisting of photometric time series of
          large numbers of stars, such as those produced by OGLE, MACHO,
          TrES, HAT, and many others surveys.

          Modern Physics Letters A
          The multi-wavelength observations of the 2004 December~27 Giant
          Flare (GF) from SGR 1806-20 and its long-lived radio afterglow
          are briefly reviewed. The GF appears to have been produced by a
          dramatic reconfiguration of the magnetic field near the surface
          of the neutron star, possibly accompanied by fractures in the
          crust. The explosive release of over 10^46 ergs (isotropic
          equivalent) powered a one-sided mildly relativistic outflow.
          The outflow produced a new expanding radio nebula, that is
          still visible over a year after the GF. Also considered are the
          constraints on the total energy in the GF, the energy and mass
          in the outflow, and on the external density, as well as
          possible implications for short gamma-ray bursts and potential
          signatures in high energy neutrinos, photons, or cosmic rays.
          Some possible future observations of this and other GFs are
          briefly discussed.

          Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in the
          ApJ
          Thermonuclear burning on the surface of a neutron star causes
          the expansion of a thin outer layer of the star, $\Delta R(t)$.
          The layer rotates slower than the star due to angular momentum
          conservation. The shear between the star and the layer acts to
          twist the star's dipole magnetic field giving at first a
          trailing spiral field. The twist of the field acts in turn to
          `torque up' the layer increasing its specific angular momentum.
          As the layer cools and contracts, its excess specific angular
          momentum causes it to {\it rotate faster} than the star which
          gives a leading spiral magnetic field. The process repeats,
          giving rise to torsional oscillations. We derive equations for
          the angular velocity and magnetic field of the layer taking
          into account the diffusivity and viscosity which are probably
          due to turbulence. The magnetic field causes a nonuniformity of
          the star's photosphere (at the top of the heated layer), and
          this gives rise to the observed X-ray oscillations. The fact
          that the layer periodically rotates faster than the star means
          that the X-ray oscillation frequency may ``overshoot'' the
          star's rotation frequency. Comparison of the theory is made
          with observations of Chakrabarty et al. (2003) of an X-ray
          burst of SAX J1808.4-3658.

          Differentially Rotating Magnetized Neutron Stars
          Authors: Zachariah B. Etienne, Yuk Tung Liu, Stuart L. Shapiro
          (UIUC)
          Comments: 21 pages, 11 figures, published in Phys.Rev.D
          Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. D74 (2006) 044030
          We present long-term (~10^4 M) axisymmetric simulations of
          differentially rotating, magnetized neutron stars in the
          slow-rotation, weak magnetic field limit using a perturbative
          metric evolution technique. Although this approach yields
          results comparable to those obtained via nonperturbative (BSSN)
          evolution techniques, simulations performed with the
          perturbative metric solver require about 1/4 the computational
          resources at a given resolution. This computational efficiency
          enables us to observe and analyze the effects of magnetic
          braking and the magnetorotational instability (MRI) at very
          high resolution. Our simulations demonstrate that (1) MRI is
          not observed unless the fastest-growing mode wavelength is
          resolved by more than about 10 gridpoints; (2) as resolution is
          improved, the MRI growth rate converges, but due to the
          small-scale turbulent nature of MRI, the maximum growth
          amplitude increases, but does not exhibit convergence, even at
          the highest resolution; and (3) independent of resolution,
          magnetic braking drives the star toward uniform rotation as
          energy is sapped from differential rotation by winding magnetic
          fields.

          Title: The Planet Host Star Gamma Cephei: Physical Properties,
          the Binary Orbit, and the Mass of the Substellar Companion
          Authors: Guillermo Torres (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
          Astrophysics)
          Comments: 28 pages in emulateapj style, including tables and
          figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ
          The bright K1 III-IV star gamma Cep has been reported
          previously to have a companion in a 2.5-yr orbit that is
          possibly substellar, and also has a stellar companion at a
          larger separation that has never been seen. Here we determine
          for the first time the three-dimensional orbit of the stellar
          companion accounting also for the perturbation from the closer
          object. We combine new and existing radial velocity
          measurements (of both classical precision and high precision)
          with intermediate astrometric data from the Hipparcos mission
          (abscissa residuals) as well as ground-based positional
          observations going back more than a century. The orbit of the
          secondary star is eccentric and has a period of 66.8 yr. We
          establish the primary star to be on the first ascent of the
          giant branch, and to have a mass of 1.18 M_Sun, an effective
          temperature of 4800 K, and an age around 6.6 Gyr (for an
          assumed metallicity [Fe/H] = +0.01). The unseen secondary star
          is found to be an M4 dwarf with a mass of 0.362 M_Sun, and is
          expected to be about 6.4 mag fainter than the primary in K. The
          minimum mass of the putative planetary companion is M_p sin i =
          1.43 M_Jup. Taking advantage again of the high-precision
          Hipparcos observations we are able to place a dynamical upper
          limit on this mass of 13.3 M_Jup (95% confidence level) and
          16.9 M_Jup (99.73%, or 3 sigma) thus confirming that it is
          indeed substellar in nature. (Abridged)

          Title: Thermal evolution of rotating hybrid stars
          Authors: kang Miao, Zheng Xiaoping
          Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures
          As a neutron star spins down, the nuclear matter continuously
          is converted into quark matter due to the core density increase
          and then latent heat is released. We have investigated the
          thermal evolution of neutron stars undergoing such
          deconfinement phase transition. We have taken into account the
          conversion in the frame of the general theory of relativity.
          The released energy has been estimated as a function of change
          rate of deconfinement baryon number. Numerical solutions to
          cooling equation are obtained to be very different from the
          without heating effect. The results show that neutron stars may
          be heated to higher temperature which is well-matched with
          pulsar's data despite onset of fast cooling in neutron stars
          with quark matter core. It is also found that heating effect
          has magnetic field strength dependence. This feature could be
          particularly interesting for high temperature of low-field
          millisecond pulsar at late stage. The inferred temperature from
          observation for PSR J0437-4715 is just an illustration in
          quality.

          Title: Observational constraints on quarks in neutron stars
          Authors: Pan Nana, Zheng Xiaoping
          Comments: 16 pages,6 figures
          We estimate the constraints of observational mass and redshift
          on the properties of equations of state for quarks in the
          compact stars. We discuss two scenarios: strange stars and
          hybrid stars. We construct the equations of state utilizing MIT
          bag model taking medium effect into account for quark matter
          and relativistic mean field theory for hadron matter. We find
          that quark may exist in strange stars and the interior of
          neutron stars, and only these quark matters with stiff
          equations of state could be consistent with both constraints.
          The bag constant is main one parameter that affects the mass
          strongly for strange stars and only the intermediate coupling
          constant may be the best choice for compatibility with
          observational constraints in hybrid stars.

          Coronagraph
          Authors: K. Enya, S. Tanaka, L. Abe, T. Nakagawa
          Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures
          We present the results of the first laboratory experiment of
          checkerboard shaped pupil binary mask coronagraphs using
          visible light, in the context of the R&D activities for future
          mid-infrared space missions such as the 3.5 m SPICA telescope.
          The primary aim of this work is to demonstrate the
          coronagraphic performance of checkerboard masks down to a
          $10^{-6}$ peak-to-peak contrast, which is required to detect
          self-luminous extra-solar planets in the mid-infrared region.
          Two masks, consisting of aluminum films on a glass substrates,
          were manufactured using nano-fabrication techniques with
          electron beam lithography: one mask was optimized for a pupil
          with a 30% central obstruction and the other was for a pupil
          without obstruction. The theoretical contrast for both masks
          was $10^{-7}$ and no adaptive optics system was employed. For
          both masks, the observed point spread functions were quite
          consistent with the theoretical ones. The average contrast
          measured within the dark regions was $2.7 {\times} 10^{-7}$ and
          $1.1 {\times} 10^{-7}$. The coronagraphic performance
          significantly outperformed the $10^{-6}$ requirement and almost
          reached the theoretical limit determined by the mask designs.
          We discuss the potential application of checkerboard masks for
          mid-infrared coronagraphy, and conclude that binary masks are
          promising for future high-contrast space telescopes.

          Neutrino transport in spherically symmetric models of stellar
          core collapse and bounce has achieved a technically complete
          level, rewarded by the agreement among independent groups that
          a multi-dimensional treatment of the fluid-instabilities in the
          post-bounce phase is indispensable to model supernova
          explosions. While much effort is required to develop a reliable
          neutrino transport technique in axisymmetry, we explore
          neutrino physics approximations and parameterizations for an
          efficient three-dimensional simulation of the
          fluid-instabilities in the shock-heated matter that accumulates
          between the accretion shock and the protoneutron star. We
          demonstrate the reliability of a simple parameterization scheme
          in the collapse phase and extend our 3D magneto-hydrodynamical
          collapse simulations to a preliminary postbounce evolution. The
          growth of magnetic fields is investigated.

          Because of the similarity of the primary star of HS 1136+6646
          to the planetary nebula central star BE Ursae Majoris, we did
          wide field imaging of the former with an H-alpha filter. No
          nebulosity was detected. On the other hand, the point spread
          function of the star appeared extended. A partially-resolved
          red component is detected in the image with the five-band Sloan
          Digital Sky Survey. Most importantly, a companion is easily
          resolved in the HST acquisition image for the published STIS
          observation. A companion to the pre-cataclysmic binary is
          present at a separation of 1.349'' at position angle 54.4 deg.
          Evidence indicates that it is likely of K spectral type. We
          cannot demonstrate conclusively that this component has common
          proper motion with the close binary. However, the similar
          apparent z magnitudes and spectral types of HS 1136+6646B and
          the resolved component make it likely that we have in reality a
          hierarchial triple system. In any case, the presence of this
          component needs to be taken into account in future ground-based

          Comments: 5 pages four figures. ApJ Letters in press
          We report observations of gaseous methanol in an edge-on torus
          surrounding the young stellar object L1551 IRS5. The peaks in
          the torus are separated by ~ 10,000 AU from L1551 IRS5, and
          contain ~ 0.03 earth masses of cold methanol. We infer that the
          methanol abundance increases in the outer part of the torus,
          probably as a result of methanol evaporation from dust grain
          surfaces heated by the shock luminosity associated with the
          shocks associated with the jets of an externally located x-ray
          source. Any methanol released in such a cold environment will
          rapidly freeze again, spreading methanol throughout the

          Title: High-energy particles in the wind nebula of pulsar
          B1509-58 as seen by INTEGRAL

          We present observations with the INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope of the
          wind nebula powered by the young pulsar B1509-58 and we discuss
          the spatial and spectral properties of the unpulsed emission in
          the 20-200 keV energy band. The source extension and
          orientation along the northwest-southeast axis corresponds to
          the jet emission seen at keV and TeV energies. The hard X-ray
          spectrum is consistent with the earlier Beppo-SAX measurements.
          It follows a power law with a photon index alpha = -2.12 pm
          0.05 up to 160 keV. A possible break at this energy is found at
          the 2.9 sigma confidence level. The 0.1-100 keV data are
          consistent with synchrotron aging of pairs in the jet and yield
          a magnetic field strength of 22-33 muG for a bulk velocity of
          0.3-0.5c. The synchrotron cut-off energy thus corresponds to a
          maximum electron energy of 400-730 TeV.

          We found a very likely counterpart to the recently discovered
          hard X-ray source IGR J2018+4043 in the multi-wavelength
          observations of the source field. The source, originally
          discovered in the 20-40 keV band, is now confidently detected
          also in the 40-80 keV band, with a flux of (1.4 +/- 0.4) x
          10(-11) erg cm(-2) s(-1). A 5 ks Swift observation of the IGR
          J2018+4043 field revealed a hard point-like source with the
          observed 0.5-10 keV flux of 3.4(+0.7)(-0.8) x 10(-12) erg
          cm(-2) s(-1) (90% confidence level) at alpha = 20h18m38.55s,
          delta = +40d41m00.4s (with a 4.2" uncertainty). The combined
          Swift-INTEGRAL spectrum can be described by an absorbed
          power-law model with photon index gamma = 1.3 +/- 0.2 and N_H =
          6.1(+3.2)(-2.2) x 10(22) cm(-2). In archival optical and
          infrared data we found a slightly extended and highly absorbed
          object at the Swift source position. There is also an extended
          VLA 1.4 GHz source peaked at a beam-width distance from the
          optical and X-ray positions. The observed morphology and
          multiwavelength spectra of IGR J2018+4043 are consistent with
          those expected for an obscured accreting object, i.e. an AGN or
          a Galactic X-ray binary. The identification suggests possible
          connection of IGR J2018+4043 to the bright gamma-ray source GEV
          J2020+4023 (3EG J2020+4017) detected by COS B and CGRO EGRET in
          the gamma-Cygni SNR field.

          IGR J00291+5934 is one of the seven accreting millisecond
          pulsars (AMPs) discovered so far. We report on the aperiodic
          timing and color analysis of its X-ray flux, using all the RXTE
          observations of the 2004 outburst. Flat-top noise and two
          harmonically related quasi-periodic oscillations, all of them
          at very low frequencies (0.01-0.1 Hz), were present in the
          power spectra during most of the outburst as well as a very
          high fractional variability (~50%). These properties are
          atypical not only for AMPs but also for neutron star low-mass
          X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in general. There are instead some
          remarkable similarities with the variability observed in black
          hole systems, reinforcing the connections between these two
          types of LMXB, as well as some interesting differences. We note
          finally that the results of this paper are difficult to
          reconcile with interpretations where any break frequency of
          power density spectra scales inversely with the mass of the
          central object at an accuracy sufficient to distinguish between
          the masses of neutron stars and black holes in LMXBs.

          Title: Generalized Measure of Entropy, Mathai's Distributional
          Pathway Model, and Tsallis Statistics
          Authors: A.M. Mathai, H.J. Haubold
          Comments: LaTeX, 13 pages
          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          The pathway model of Mathai (2005) mainly deals with the
          rectangular matrix-variate case. In this paper the scalar
          version is shown to be associated with a large number of
          probability models used in physics. Different families of
          densities are listed here, which are all connected through the
          pathway parameter 'alpha', generating a distributional pathway.
          The idea is to switch from one functional form to another
          through this parameter and it is shown that basically one can
          proceed from the generalized type-1 beta family to generalized
          type-2 beta family to generalized gamma family when the real
          variable is positive and a wider set of families when the
          variable can take negative values also. For simplicity, only
          the real scalar case is discussed here but corresponding
          families are available when the variable is in the complex
          domain. A large number of densities used in physics are shown
          to be special cases of or associated with the pathway model. It
          is also shown that the pathway model is available by maximizing
          a generalized measure of entropy, leading to an entropic
          pathway. Particular cases of the pathway model are shown to
          cover Tsallis statistics (Tsallis, 1988) and the
          superstatistics introduced by Beck and Cohen (2003).

          and its minimal violation to the unimodular covariance
          specifically is considered. The proper extension of General
          Relativity is shown to describe consistently the massive scalar

          the metric. The bearing of the scalar graviton to the dark
          matter and dark energy is indicated.

          Comments: 6 pages revtex, 3 .eps figures
          We emphasize the inelasticity distribution of events detected
          at the IceCube neutrino telescope as an important tool for
          revealing new physics. This is possible because the unique
          energy resolution at this facility allows to separately assign
          the energy fractions for emergent muons and taus in neutrino
          interactions. As a particular example, we explore the
          possibility of probing second and third generation leptoquark
          parameter space (coupling and mass). We show that production of
          leptoquarks with masses \agt 250 GeV and diagonal generation
          couplings of O(1) can be directly tested if the cosmic neutrino
          flux is at the Waxman-Bahcall level.

          We describe observations of the seventh accretion-powered
          millisecond pulsar, HETE J1900.1-2455 made with the Rossi X-ray
          Timing Explorer during the year of activity that followed its
          discovery in 2005 June. We detected intermittent pulsations at
          a peak fractional amplitude of 3%, but only in the first two
          months of the outburst. On three occasions during this time we
          observed an abrupt increase in the pulse amplitude,
          approximately coincident with the time of a thermonuclear
          burst, followed by a steady decrease on a timescale of approx.
          10 d. HETE J1900.1-2455 has shown the longest active period by
          far for any transient accretion-powered millisecond pulsar,
          comparable instead to the outburst cycles for other transient
          X-ray binaries. Since the last detection of pulsations, HETE
          J1900.1-2455 has been indistinguishable from a low-accretion
          rate, non-pulsing LMXB; we hypothesize that other, presently
          active LMXBs may have also been detectable initially as
          millisecond X-ray pulsars.

          We present a first analysis of a deep X-ray spectrum of the
          isolated neutron star RBS1223 obtained with XMM-Newton.
          Spectral data from four new monitoring observations in
          2005/2006 were combined with archival observations obtained in
          2003 and 2004 to form a spin-phase averaged spectrum containing
          290000 EPIC-pn photons. This spectrum shows higher complexity
          than its predecessors, and can be parameterised with two
          Gaussian absorption lines superimposed on a blackbody. The line
          centers, E_2 ~ 2E_1, could be regarded as supporting the
          cyclotron interpretation of the absorption features in a field
          B ~ 4 x 10**13 G. The flux ratio of those lines does not
          support this interpretation. Hence, either feature might be of
          truly atomic origin.

          LS 5039 is the only X-ray binary persistently detected at TeV
          energies by the Cherenkov HESS telescope. It is moreover a
          gamma-ray emitter in the GeV and possibly MeV energy ranges. To
          understand important aspects of jet physics, like the magnetic
          field content or particle acceleration, and emission processes,
          such as synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC), a complete
          modeling of the multiwavelength data is necessary. LS 5039 has
          been detected along almost all the electromagnetic spectrum
          thanks to several radio, infrared, optical and soft X-ray
          detections. However, hard X-ray detections above 20 keV have
          been so far elusive and/or doubtful, partly due to source
          confusion for the poor spatial resolution of hard X-ray
          instruments. We report here on deep (300 ksec) serendipitous
          INTEGRAL hard X-ray observations of LS 5039, coupled with
          simultaneous VLA radio observations. We obtain a 20-40 keV flux
          of 1.1 +/- 0.3 mCrab (5.9 (+/-1.6) X 10^{-12} erg cm^{-2}
          s^{-1}), a 40-100 keV upper limit of 1.5 mCrab (9.5 x 10^{-12}
          erg cm^{-2}s^{-1}), and typical radio flux densities of about
          25 mJy at 5GHz. These hard X-ray fluxes are significantly lower
          than previous estimates obtained with BATSE in the same energy
          range but, in the lower interval, agree with extrapolation of
          previous RXTE measurements. The INTEGRAL observations also hint
          to a break in the spectral behavior at hard X-rays. A more
          sensitive characterization of the hard X-ray spectrum of LS
          5039 from 20 to 100 keV could therefore constrain key aspects
          of the jet physics, like the relativistic particle spectrum and
          the magnetic field strength. Future multiwavelength
          observations would allow to establish whether such hard X-ray
          synchrotron emission is produced by the same population of
          relativistic electrons as those presumably producing TeV
          emission through IC.

          Title: Gravitational Faraday Rotation in Binary Pulsar Systems
          Authors: Matteo Luca Ruggiero, Angelo Tartaglia
          Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures
          We study the gravitational Faraday rotation, on linearly
          polarized light rays emitted by a pulsar, orbiting another
          compact object. We relate the rotation angle to the orbital
          phase of the emitting pulsar, as well as to other parameters
          describing its orbit and the orientation of the angular
          momentum of the binary companion. We give numerical estimates
          of the effect for the double-pulsar system PSR J0737-3039, and
          we note that the expected magnitude is exceedingly small,
          making the effect unlikely to be observed with present
          technology. It is however interesting per se, since in this
          phenomenon, gravito-magnetism plays a leading role, unlike what
          happens, for instance, when studying light bending or
          gravitational time delay, where it appears as a correction to
          the gravito-electric contribution. Also, we envisage the
          possibility that this effect could be relevant, at least in
          principle, for a pulsar orbiting a non charged black-hole.

          Authors: G. Weigelt, et al
          Comments: 22 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables; A&A in press
          We present the first NIR spectro-interferometry of the LBV Eta
          Carinae. The K band observations were performed with the AMBER
          instrument of the ESO Very Large Telescope Interferometer using
          three 8.2m Unit Telescopes with baselines from 42 to 89m. The
          aim of this work is to study the wavelength dependence of Eta
          Car's optically thick wind region with a high spatial
          resolution of 5 mas (11 AU) and high spectral resolution. The
          medium spectral resolution observations (R=1,500) were
          performed in the wavelength range around both the HeI 2.059
          micron and the Br gamma 2.166 micron emission lines, the high
          spectral resolution observations (R=12,000) only in the Br
          gamma line region. In the K-band continuum, a diameter of 4.0
          +/-0.2 mas (Gaussian FWHM, fit range 28-89m) was measured for
          Eta Car's optically thick wind region. If we fit Hillier et al.
          (2001) model visibilities to the observed AMBER visibilities,
          we obtain 50 % encircled-energy diameters of 4.2, 6.5 and
          9.6mas in the 2.17 micron continuum, the HeI, and the Br gamma
          emission lines, respectively. In the continuum near the Br
          gamma line, an elongation along a position angle of 120+/-15
          degrees was found, consistent with previous VLTI/VINCI
          measurements by van Boekel et al. (2003). We compare the
          measured visibilities with predictions of the radiative
          transfer model of Hillier et al. (2001), finding good
          agreement. Furthermore, we discuss the detectability of the
          hypothetical hot binary companion. For the interpretation of
          the non-zero differential and closure phases measured within
          the Br gamma line, we present a simple geometric model of an
          inclined, latitude-dependent wind zone. Our observations
          support theoretical models of anisotropic winds from
          fast-rotating, luminous hot stars with enhanced high-velocity
          mass loss near the polar regions.

          Title: De-leptonization and Non-Axisymmetric Instabilities in
          Core Collapse Supernovae
          Authors: J. Craig Wheeler, Shizuka Akiyama
          Comments: 15 pages, 1 figure, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          The timescale of de-leptonization by neutrino loss and
          associated contraction of a proto-neutron star is short
          compared to the time to progagate a shock through the helium
          core of a massive star, and so the de-leptonization phase does
          not occur in the vacuum of space, but within the supernova
          ambiance whether or not there has been a successful explosion.
          Dynamical non-axisymmetric instabilities (NAXI) are predicted
          for sufficiently strongly differentially rotating proto-neutron
          stars. Some modes are unstable for small values of the ratio of
          rotational kinetic energy to binding energy, T/|W| > 0.01. The
          NAXI are likely to drive magnetoacoustic waves into the
          surrounding time-dependent density structure. These waves
          represent a mechanism of the dissipation of the free energy of
          differential rotation of the proto-neutron star, and the
          outward deposition of this energy may play a role in the
          supernova explosion process. We estimate the power produced by
          this process and the associated timescale and discuss the
          possible systematics of the de-leptonization phase in this
          context. A likely possibility is that the proto-neutron star
          will spin down through these effects before de-leptonization
          and produce substantial but not excessive energy input.

          NLTE. Evidence for cool companions to 8 sdOs as well as a
          binary consisting of two sdO stars is found. A correlation
          between He abundances and the presence of carbon and/or
          nitrogen lines emerges: below solar He abundance, no sdO shows
          C or N lines. In contrast, C and/or N lines are present in ALL
          sdOs with super- solar He abundance. We thus use the solar He
          abundance to divide our sample into He-deficient and
          He-enriched sdOs. While He-deficient sdOs are scattered in a
          wide range of the Teff-log(g)-diagram, most of the He-enriched
          sdOs cluster in a narrow region at Teff = 40,000 ... 50,000K
          and log(g)=5.5 ... 6.0. An evolu- tionary link between sdBs and
          sdOs appears plausible only for the He-deficient sdOs
          indicating that they are the likely successors to sdBs. The
          properties of He-enriched sdOs cannot be explained with
          canonical single star evolutionary models. Alternative
          scenarios (late hot flasher) as well as for binary evolution
          (white dwarf merger; post-RGB evolution) are tested. While we
          regard the post-RGB scenario as inappropriate, the white dwarf
          merger and the late hot flasher scenarios remain viable to
          explain the origin of He-enriched sdOs.

          Binding of few-electron systems in two-dimensional potential
          cavities in the presence of an external magnetic field is
          studied with the exact diagonalization approach. We demonstrate
          that for shallow cavities the few-electron system becomes bound
          only under the application of a strong magnetic field. The
          critical value of the depth of the cavity allowing the
          formation of a bound state decreases with magnetic field in a
          non-smooth fashion, due to the increasing angular momentum of
          the first bound state. In the high magnetic field limit the
          binding energies and the critical values for the depth of the
          potential cavity allowing the formation of a bound system tend
          to the classical values.

          Physical Review E

          The new mathematical framework based on the free energy of pure
          classical fluids presented in [R. D. Rohrmann, Physica A 347,
          221 (2005)] is extended to multi-component systems to determine
          thermodynamic and structural properties of chemically complex
          fluids. Presently, the theory focuses on $D$-dimensional
          mixtures in the low-density limit (packing factor $\eta <
          0.01$). The formalism combines the free-energy minimization
          technique with space partitions that assign an available volume
          $v$ to each particle. $v$ is related to the closeness of the
          nearest neighbor and provides an useful tool to evaluate the
          perturbations experimented by particles in a fluid. The theory
          shows a close relationship between statistical geometry and
          statistical mechanics. New, unconventional thermodynamic
          variables and mathematical identities are derived as a result
          of the space division. Thermodynamic potentials $\mu_{il}$,
          conjugate variable of the populations $N_{il}$ of particles
          class $i$ with the nearest neighbors of class $l$ are defined
          and their relationships with the usual chemical potentials
          $\mu_i$ are established. Systems of hard spheres are treated as
          illustrative examples and their thermodynamics functions are
          derived analytically. The low-density expressions obtained
          agree nicely with those of scaled-particle theory and
          Percus-Yevick approximation. Several pair distribution
          functions are introduced and evaluated. Analytical expressions
          are also presented for hard spheres with attractive forces due
          to K\^ac-tails and square-well potentials. Finally, we derive
          general chemical equilibrium conditions.

          The origin, evolution and role of magnetic fields in the
          production and shaping of proto-planetary and planetary nebulae
          (PPNe, PNe) is a subject of active research. Most PNe and PPNe
          are axisymmetric with many exhibiting highly collimated
          outflows, however, it is important to understand whether such
          structures can be generated by isolated stars or require the
          presence of a binary companion. Toward this end we study a
          dynamical, large-scale alpha-Omega interface dynamo operating
          in a 3.0 M_sun Asymptotic Giant Branch star (AGB) in both an
          isolated setting and one in which a low-mass companion is
          embedded inside the envelope. The back reaction of the fields
          on the shear is included and differential rotation and rotation
          deplete via turbulent dissipation and Poynting flux. For the
          isolated star, the shear must be resupplied in order to
          sufficiently sustain the dynamo. Furthermore, we investigate
          the energy requirements that convection must satisfy to
          accomplish this by analogy to the sun. For the common envelope
          case, a robust dynamo results, unbinding the envelope under a
          broad range of conditions. Two qualitatively different types of
          explosion may arise: (i) magnetically dominated, possibly
          resulting in collimated bipolar outflows and (ii) thermally
          induced from turbulent dissipation, possibly resulting in
          quasi-spherical outflows. A range of models is presented for a
          variety of companion masses.

          Title: Simulation of the Magnetothermal Instability
          Authors: Ian J. Parrish, James M. Stone
          Comments: Accepted for publication in Astrophysics and Space
          Science as proceedings of the 6th High Energy Density
          Laboratory Astrophysics (HEDLA) Conference
          In many magnetized, dilute astrophysical plasmas, thermal
          conduction occurs almost exclusively parallel to magnetic field
          lines. In this case, the usual stability criterion for
          convective stability, the Schwarzschild criterion, which
          depends on entropy gradients, is modified. In the magnetized
          long mean free path regime, instability occurs for small
          wavenumbers when (dP/dz)(dln T/dz) > 0, which we refer to as
          the Balbus criterion. We refer to the convective-type
          instability that results as the magnetothermal instability
          (MTI). We use the equations of MHD with anisotropic electron
          heat conduction to numerically simulate the linear growth and
          nonlinear saturation of the MTI in plane-parallel atmospheres
          that are unstable according to the Balbus criterion. The linear
          growth rates measured from the simulations are in excellent
          agreement with the weak field dispersion relation. The addition
          of isotropic conduction, e.g. radiation, or strong magnetic
          fields can damp the growth of the MTI and affect the nonlinear
          regime. The instability saturates when the atmosphere becomes
          isothermal as the source of free energy is exhausted. By
          maintaining a fixed temperature difference between the top and
          bottom boundaries of the simulation domain, sustained
          convective turbulence can be driven. MTI-stable layers
          introduced by isotropic conduction are used to prevent the
          formation of unresolved, thermal boundary layers. We find that
          the largest component of the time-averaged heat flux is due to
          advective motions as opposed to the actual thermal conduction
          itself. Finally, we explore the implications of this
          instability for a variety of astrophysical systems, such as
          neutron stars, the hot intracluster medium of galaxy clusters,
          and the structure of radiatively inefficient accretion flows.

          Cataclysmic Variables (CV) are close binary systems, in which
          the primary, the more massive star, is a white dwarf. CVs
          usually exhibit a number of periodicities, most of which are
          now understood. However, recently, a new phenomenon was
          discovered that does not fit the standard picture. Two objects
          have been discovered to show periods that are much longer than
          orbital, and have no relation to it, either in light curves or
          in radial velocity (RV) variations measured from spectroscopy.
          Here, we show that the precession of the fast rotating
          magnetically accreting white dwarf can successfully explain
          these phenomena. The theory of compact objects predicts certain
          relations between the spin and precession periods, and our
          finding provides a good test for the theory and establishes a
          qualitative model to be explored both theoretically and
          observationally. Detection of precession can become a powerful
          tool in searching for the internal properties of compact stars,
          which would be otherwise inaccessible for us.

          The nature of the progenitors of type Ia supernovae is still
          under controversial debate. KPD 1930+2752 is one of the best SN
          Ia progenitor candidates known today. The object is a double
          degenerate system consisting of a subluminous B star (sdB) and
          a massive white dwarf (WD). Maxted et al. (2000) conclude that
          the system mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass. This
          conclusion, however, rests on the assumption that the sdB mass
          is 0.5 Mo. However, recent binary population synthesis
          calculations suggest that the mass of an sdB star may range
          from 0.3 Mo to more than 0.7 Mo. It is therefore important to
          measure the mass of the sdB star simultaneously with that of
          the white dwarf. Since the rotation of the sdB star is tidally
          locked to the orbit the inclination of the system can be
          constrained if the sdB radius and the projected rotational
          velocity can be measured with high precision. An analysis of
          the ellipsoidal variations in the light curve allows to tighten
          the constraints derived from spectroscopy. We derive the
          mass-radius relation for the sdB star from a quantitative
          spectral analysis of 150 low-resolution spectra. The projected
          rotational velocity is determined for the first time from 200
          high-resolution spectra. In addition a reanalysis of the
          published light curve is performed. The atmospheric and orbital
          parameters are measured with unprecedented accuracy. In
          particular the projected rotational velocity is determined. A
          neutron star companion can be ruled out and the mass of the sdB
          is limited between 0.45 Mo and 0.52 Mo. The total mass of the
          system ranges from 1.36 Mo to 1.48 Mo and hence is likely to
          exceed the Chandrasekhar mass. So KPD 1930+2752 qualifies as an
          excellent double degenerate supernova Ia progenitor candidate.

          High-precision radial-velocity techniques, which enabled the
          detection of extrasolar planets are now sensitive to
          relativistic effects in the data of spectroscopic binary stars
          (SBs). We show how these effects can be used to derive the
          absolute masses of the components of eclipsing single-lined SBs
          and double-lined SBs from Doppler measurements alone.
          High-precision stellar spectroscopy can thus substantially
          increase the number of measured sellar masses, thereby
          improving the mass-radius and mass-magnitude calibrations.

          The black-hole X-ray binary transient GRO J1655-40 underwent an
          outburst beginning in early 2005. We present the results of our
          multi-wavelength observational campaign to study the early
          outburst spectral and temporal evolution, which combines data
          from X-ray (RXTE, INTEGRAL), radio (VLA) and optical (ROTSE,
          SMARTS) instruments. During the reported period the source left
          quiescence and went through four major accreting black hole
          states: low-hard, hard intermediate, soft intermediate and
          high-soft. We investigated dipping behavior in the RXTE band
          and compare our results to the 1996-1997 case, when the source
          was predominantly in the high-soft state, finding significant
          differences. We consider the evolution of the low frequency
          quasi-periodic oscillations and find that the frequency
          strongly correlates with the spectral characteristics, before
          shutting off prior to the transition to the high-soft state. We
          model the broad-band high-energy spectrum in the context of
          empirical models, as well as more physically motivated thermal
          and bulk-motion Comptonization and Compton reflection models.
          RXTE and INTEGRAL data together support a statistically
          significant high energy cut-off in the energy spectrum at
          100~200 keV during the low-hard state. The RXTE data alone also
          show it very significantly during the transition, but cannot
          see one in the high-soft state spectra. We consider radio,
          optical and X-ray connections in the context of possible
          synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton origins of X-ray
          emission in low-hard and intermediate states. In this outburst
          of GRO J1655-40, the radio flux does not rise strongly with the
          X-ray flux.

          Polaris, the nearest and brightest classical Cepheid, is a
          member of at least a triple system. It has a wide ($18''$)
          physical companion, the F-type dwarf Polaris B. Polaris itself
          is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period
          of 30 years (Kamper, 1996, JRASC, 90, 140). By combining {\it
          Hipparcos} measurements of the instantaneous proper motion with
          long-term measurements and the Kamper radial-velocity orbit,
          Wielen et al. (2000, A&A, 360, 399) have predicted the
          astrometric orbit of the close companion. Using the {\it Hubble
          Space Telescope} and the Advanced Camera for Surveys'
          High-Resolution Channel with an ultraviolet (F220W) filter, we
          have now directly detected the close companion. Based on the
          Wielen et al. orbit, the {\it Hipparcos} parallax, and our
          measurement of the separation ($0.176''$ $\pm$ $0.002''$), we
          find a preliminary mass of 5.0 $\pm$ 1.5 M$_{\odot}$ for the
          Cepheid and 1.38 $\pm$ 0.61 M$_{\odot}$ for the close
          companion. These values will be refined by additional {\it HST}
          observations scheduled for the next 3 years.
          We have also obtained a {\it Chandra} ACIS-I image of the
          Polaris field. Two distant companions C and D are not X-rays
          sources and hence are not young enough to be physical
          companions of the Cepheid. There is one additional stellar
          X-ray source in the field, located $253''$ from Polaris A,
          which is a possible companion. Further investigation of such a
          distant companion is valuable to confirm the full extent of the
          system.

          Title: A maximum likelihood method for fitting colour-magnitude
          diagrams
          Authors: Tim Naylor (University of Exeter) Rob Jeffries (Keele
          University)
          Comments: 15 pages, 17 figures
          We present a maximum likelihood method for fitting
          two-dimensional model distributions to stellar data in
          colour-magnitude space. This allows one to include (for
          example) binary stars in an isochronal population. The method
          also allows one to derive formal uncertainties for fitted
          parameters, and assess the likelihood that a good fit has been
          found. We use the method to derive an age of 38.5 +3.5/-6.5
          Myrs and a true distance modulus of 7.79 +0.11/-0.05 mags from
          the V vs V-I diagram of NGC2547 (the uncertainties are 67
          percent confidence limits, and the parameters are insensitive
          to the assumed binary fraction). These values are consistent
          with those previously determined from low-mass isochronal
          fitting, and are the first measurements to have statistically
          meaningful uncertainties. The age is also consistent with the
          lithium depletion age of NGC2547, and the HIPPARCOS distance to
          the cluster is consistent with our value.
          The method appears to be quite general and could be applied to
          any N-dimensional dataset, with uncertainties in each
          dimension. However, it is particularly useful when the data are
          sparse, in the sense that both the typical uncertainties for a
          datapoint and the size of structure in the function being
          fitted are small compared with the typical distance between
          datapoints. In this case binning the data will lose resolution,
          whilst the method presented here preserves it.

          Binaries
          Authors: Tamara Bogdanovic, Britton D. Smith, Michael
          Eracleous, Steinn Sigurdsson

          submitted to the proceedings of the LISA 6 Symposium. After it
          is published, it will be found at this http URL
          We model the electromagnetic emission signatures of massive
          black hole binaries (MBHBs) with an associated gas component.
          The method comprises numerical simulations of relativistic
          binaries and gas coupled with calculations of the physical
          properties of the emitting gas. We calculate the accretion
          powered UV/X-ray and Halpha light curves and the Halpha
          emission line profiles. The simulations have been carried out
          with a modified version of the parallel tree SPH code Gadget.
          The heating, cooling, and radiative processes for the solar
          metallicity gas have been calculated with the photoionization
          code Cloudy. We investigate gravitationally bound, sub-parsec
          binaries which have not yet entered the gravitational radiation
          phase. The results from the first set of calculations, carried
          out for a coplanar binary and gas disk, suggest that the
          outbursts in the X-ray light curve are pronounced during
          pericentric passages and can serve as a fingerprint for this
          type of binaries if periodic outbursts are a long lived
          signature of the binary. The Halpha emission-line profiles also
          offer strong indications of a binary presence and may be used
          as a criterion for selection of MBHB candidates for further
          monitoring from existing archival data. The orbital period and
          mass ratio of a binary could be determined from the Halpha
          light curves and profiles of carefully monitored candidates.
          Although systems with the orbital periods studied here are not
          within the frequency band of the Laser Interferometer Space
          Antenna (LISA), their discovery is important for understanding
          of the merger rates of MBHBs and the evolution of such binaries
          through the last parsec and towards the detectable
          gravitational wave window.

          Title: An exact method for orbit determinations of an
          astrometric binary
          Authors: Hideki Asada, Toshio Akasaka, Kazuya Kudoh
          Comments: 20 pages; submitted to Celestial Mech
          Here we present an exact method for orbit determinations of an
          astrometric binary for which the primary star can be seen but
          the companion is unseen like a black hole or an extra-solar
          planet. Since the laws of the motion of celestial objects were
          discovered by Kepler in the seventeenth century, many attempts
          have been made to solve a fundamental problem of how to
          determine the orbital elements (and the mass) of a binary by
          measuring its positions projected onto a celestial sphere. It
          has been long believed that some approximate/iterative or
          numerical technique must be employed to determine the orbital
          elements. In the nineteenth century, the problem was solved for
          resolved double stars, for which the relative vector from the
          primary star to the secondary is observable. For astrometric
          binaries, however, for which this relative vector is not
          observable, an exact solution was very recently found by Asada,
          Akasaka and Kasai by assuming no observational errors. This
          paper extends the solution considering realistic observational
          data. The generalized solution is still simply expressed only
          by elementary functions.

          Title: An exact solution to determination of an open orbit
          Authors: Hideki Asada
          Comments: 28 pages; submitted to Celestial Mech
          We present an exact solution of the equations for orbit
          determination of a two body system in a hyperbolic or parabolic
          motion. In solving this problem, we extend the method employed
          by Asada, Akasaka and Kasai (AAK) for a binary system in an
          elliptic orbit. The solutions applicable to each of elliptic,
          hyperbolic and parabolic orbits are obtained by the new
          approach, and they are all expressed in an explicit form,
          remarkably, only in terms of elementary functions. We show also
          that the solutions for an open orbit are recovered by making a
          suitable transformation of the AAK solution for an elliptic
          case.

          We conducted a radial velocity survey of the Cygnus OB2
          Association over a 6 year (1999 - 2005) time interval to search
          for massive close binaries. During this time we obtained 1139
          spectra on 146 OB stars to measure mean systemic radial
          velocities and radial velocity variations. We spectroscopically
          identify 73 new OB stars for the first time, the majority of
          which are likely to be Association members. Spectroscopic
          evidence is also presented for a B3Iae classification and
          temperature class variation (B3 - B8) on the order of 1 year
          for Cygnus OB2 No. 12. Calculations of the intial mass function
          with the current spectroscopic sample yield Gamma = -2.2 +/-
          0.1. Of the 120 stars with the most reliable data, 36 are
          probable and 9 are possible single-lined spectroscopic
          binaries. We also identify 3 new and 8 candidate double-lined
          spectroscopic binaries. These data imply a lower limit on the
          massive binary fraction of 30% - 42%. The calculated velocity
          dispersion for Cygnus OB2 is 2.44 +/- km/s, which is typical of
          open clusters. No runaway OB stars were found.

          Authors: Takamasa Chiba, Tatsunori Imai, Hideki Asada
          Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures
          None of N-body gravitating systems have been considered to emit
          periodic gravitational waves because of their chaotic orbits
          when N=3 (or more). Nevertheless, we show that triple stars are
          capable of generating periodic waves, thereby demonstrating
          that the true number of sources detectable by large-scale
          interferometers such as LIGO, VIRGO, GEO600 and TAMA300 is
          larger than previously thought. A tooth-shaped waveform
          generated by this novel source is different from that of a
          binary system. Therefore, it will be possible to distinguish it
          in future observations.

          Title: Probing Axions with Radiation from Magnetic Stars
          Authors: Dong Lai (Cornell), Jeremy Heyl (UBC)
          Comments: 11 pages, 11 figures. PRD submitted
          Recent experiments suggest that polarized photons may couple
          significantly to pseudoscalar particles such as axions. We
          study the possible observational signatures of axion-photon
          coupling for radiation from magnetic stars, with particular
          focus on neutron stars. We present general methods for
          calculating the axion-photon conversion probability during
          propagation through a varying magnetized vacuum as well as
          across an inhomogeneous atmosphere. Partial axion-photon
          conversion may take place in the vacuum region outside the
          star. Strong axion-photon mixing occurs due to a resonance in
          the atmosphere, and depending on the axion coupling strength
          and other parameters, significant axion-photon conversion can
          take place at the resonance. Such conversions may produce
          observable effects on the radiation spectra and polarization
          signals from the star. We also apply our results to
          axion-photon propagation in the Sun and in magnetic white
          dwarfs.

          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to A&A
          Aims: Hete J1900.1-2455 is the seventh known X-ray transient
          accreting millisecond pulsar and has been in outburst for more
          than one year. We compared the data on Hete J1900.1-2455 with
          other similar objects and made an attempt at deriving
          constraints on the physical processes responsible for a
          spectral formation. Methods: The broad-band spectrum of the
          persistent emission in the 2-300 keV energy band and the timing
          properties were studied using simultaneous INTEGRAL and the
          publicly available RXTE data obtained in October 2005. The
          properties of the X-ray bursts observed from Hete J1900.1-2455
          were also investigated. Results: The spectrum is well described
          by a two-component model consisting of a blackbody-like soft
          X-ray emission at 0.8 keV temperature and a thermal Comptonized
          spectrum with the electron temperature of 30 keV and Thomson
          optical depth tau_T ~ 2 for the slab geometry. The source is
          detected by INTEGRAL up to 200 keV at the luminosity of 5E36
          erg/s (assuming a distance of 5 kpc) in the 0.1-200 keV energy
          band. We have also detected one type I X-ray burst which shows
          the photospheric radius expansion. The burst occurred at an
          inferred persistent emission level of ~ 3-4% of the Eddington
          luminosity. Using the data for all X-ray bursts observed to
          date from Hete J1900.1-2455, the burst recurrence time is
          estimated to be about 2 days. No pulsations have been detected
          either in the RXTE or in the INTEGRAL data which puts
          interesting constraints on theories of the magnetic field
          evolution in neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries.

          2 ({\it WFPC2}) images of the Virgo Cluster dwarf elliptical
          galaxy VCC 128 reveal an apparently double nucleus. The two
          components, which are separated by $\sim 32$ pc in projection,
          have the same magnitude and color. We present a spectrum of
          this double nucleus and show that it is inconsistent with one
          or both components being emission-line background objects or
          foreground stars. The most likely interpretation is that, as
          suggested by \citet{lauer_etal_96} for the double nucleus in
          NGC 4486B, we are seeing a nuclear disk surrounding a
          supermassive black hole. This is only the second time an
          early-type dwarf (dE/dSph) galaxy has been suggested to host a
          SMBH.

          We present and discuss correlations for optical and
          near-infrared (5500-10030 angstroms) line intensity
          measurements at many positions in the Crab Nebula. These
          correlations suggest the existence of gas produced by a range
          of nuclear processing, from material in which synthesis ended
          with the CNO-cycle, to some helium-burning and nitrogen
          depletion, to regions containing enriched products of
          oxygen-burning. The latter exhibit a gradual, linear rise of
          [Ni II] emission with increasing argon enrichment, whereas gas
          with less nuclear processing shows markedly different [Ni II]
          emission characteristics, including the highest derived
          abundances. This suggests two origins for stable, neutron-rich
          nickel in the nebula: a type of "alpha-rich freezeout" in the
          more highly processed material, and possibly removal of ions
          from the neutron star in other regions. In addition, the data
          indicate that anomalously strong observed [C I] emission comes
          from broad, low-ionization zones. Although the strongest He I
          emission could also be enhanced in similar low-ionization gas,
          correlations between relevant line ratios argue against that
          interpretation, strengthening the case for an exceptionally
          high helium mass fraction in some locations.

          Title: Gamma--ray Burst Models
          Authors: Andrew King
          Comments: Proceedings of the Royal Society Discussion meeting
          on Gamma-ray Bursts, September 18-20, 2006. To appear in Phil.
          Trans. Roy. Soc. A
          I consider various possibilities for making gamma--ray bursts,
          particularly from close binaries. In addition to the
          much--studied neutron star + neutron star and black hole +
          neutron star cases usually considered good candidates for
          short--duration bursts, there are other possibilities. In
          particular neutron star + massive white dwarf has several
          desirable features. These systems are likely to produce
          long--duration GRBs, in some cases definitely without an
          accompanying supernova, as observed recently. This class of
          burst would have a strong correlation with star formation, and
          occur close to the host galaxy. However rare members of the
          class need not be near star--forming regions, and could have
          any type of host galaxy. Thus a long--duration burst far from
          any star--forming region would also be a signature of this
          class. Estimates based on the existence of a known progenitor
          suggest that this type of GRB may be quite common, in agreement
          with the fact that the absence of a supernova can only be
          established in nearby bursts.

          Title: Collisional Hardening of Compact Binaries in Globular
          Clusters
          Authors: S. Banerjee, P. Ghosh
          Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We consider essential mechanisms for orbit-shrinkage or
          "hardening" of compact binaries in globular clusters to the
          point of Roche-lobe contact and X-ray emission phase, focussing
          on the process of collisional hardening due to encounters
          between binaries and single stars in the cluster core. The
          interplay between this kind of hardening and that due to
          emission of gravitational radiation produces a characteristic
          scaling of the orbit-shrinkage time with the single-star binary
          encounter rate $\gamma$ in the cluster which we introduce,
          clarify, and explore. We investigate possible effects of this
          scaling on populations of X-ray binaries in globular clusters
          within the framework of a simple "toy" scheme for describing
          the evolution of pre-X-ray binaries in globular clusters. We
          find the expected qualitative trends sufficiently supported by
          data on X-ray binaries in galactic globular clusters to
          encourage us toward a more quantitative study.

          Balucinska-Church (1,2) ((1) University of Birmingham, UK; (2)
          Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland)
          Comments: 14 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in
          Astronomy and Astrophysics
          We present an explanation of the Z-track phenomenon based on
          spectral fitting of RXTE observations of GX340+0 using the
          emission model previously shown to describe the dipping LMXB.
          In our Z-track model, the soft apex is a quiescent state of the
          source with lowest luminosity. Moving away from this point by
          ascending the normal branch the strongly increasing luminosity
          of the Accretion Disc Corona (ADC) Comptonized emission L_ADC
          provides substantial evidence for a large increase of mass
          accretion rate Mdot. There are major changes in the neutron
          star blackbody emission, kT increasing to high values, the
          blackbody radius R_BB decreasing, these changes continuing
          monotonically on both normal and horizontal branches. The
          blackbody flux increases by a factor of ten to three times the
          Eddington flux so that the physics of the horizontal branch is
          dominated by the high radiation pressure of the neutron star,
          which we propose disrupts the inner disc, and an increase of
          column density is detected. We further propose that the very
          strong radiation pressure is responsible for the launching of
          the jets detected in radio on the horizontal branch. On the
          flaring branch, we find that L_ADC is constant, suggesting no
          change in Mdot so that flaring must consist of unstable nuclear
          burning. At the soft apex, the mass accretion rate per unit
          area on the neutron star m_dot is minimum for the horizontal
          and normal branches and about equal to the theoretical upper
          limit for unstable burning. Thus it is possible that unstable
          burning begins as soon as the source arrives at this position,
          the onset being consistent with theory. The large increase in
          R_BB in flaring is reminiscent of radius expansion in X-ray
          bursts. Finally, in our model, Mdot does not increase
          monotonically along the Z-track as often previously thought.

          Moeller, Karl-Ludwig Kratz
          Comments: 10 pages, 9 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical
          Journal
          We perform a self-consistent calculation of the thermal
          structure in the crust of a superbursting neutron star. In
          particular, we follow the nucleosynthetic evolution of an
          accreted element from deposition into the atmosphere down to
          neutron drip density. We include temperature-dependent
          continuum electron capture rates and realistic sources of heat
          loss by thermal neutrino emission from the crust and core. We
          show that, in contrast to previous calculations, electron
          captures to excited states and subsequent gamma-emission
          significantly reduces the local heat loss due to
          weak-interaction neutrinos. Furthermore, temperature-sensitive
          (gamma,n) rates trigger further energy deposition as the
          distribution of nuclei evolves toward a lower neutron
          separation energy. Depending on the initial composition these
          reactions release up to a factor of ten times more heat at
          densities <10^{11} g/cc than obtained previously. This heating
          reduces the ignition depth of superbursts. In particular, it
          reduces the discrepancy noted by Cumming et al. between the
          temperatures needed for unstable 12C ignition on timescales
          consistent with observations and the reduction in crust
          temperature from Cooper pair neutrino emission.

          We report on the discovery of a pointlike source (CXOU
          J160103.1$-$513353) at the center of a Galactic supernova
          remnant (SNR) G330.2+1.0 with {\it Chandra X-Ray Observatory}.
          The X-ray spectrum fits a black-body (BB) model with $kT$
          $\sim$ 0.49 keV, implying a small emission region of $R$ $\sim$
          0.4 km at the distance of 5 kpc. The estimated X-ray luminosity
          is $L_X$ $\sim$ 1 $\times$ 10$^{33}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ in the 1 $-$
          10 keV band. A power law model may also fit the observed
          spectrum, but the fit results in a very large photon index
          ($\Gamma$ $\sim$ 5). We find no counterparts at other
          wavelengths. The X-ray emission was steady over the $\sim$13 hr
          observation period, showing no variability. While we find
          marginal evidence for X-ray pulsations with $P$ $\approx$ 7.5
          s, the presence of a pulsar at the position of this object is
          not conclusive with the current data, requiring an independent
          confirmation. These results are generally consistent with an
          interpretation of this object as a Central Compact Object
          associated with SNR G330.2+1.0.

          burst. This flat segment caused the flux increasing by a factor
          of 5 over the extension of a single power law decrease. It may
          be caused either by a strong energy injection or by
          contribution of a second outflow component. Such a two
          component jet could be formed if the initial ejecta launched in
          the double neutron stars merger or neutron star-black hole
          merger is neutron rich and magnetized. In this work we show
          that the multi-band afterglows of GRB051221A could be well
          fitted by a two component model, provided that the shock
          physics parameters in different components are much different.
          This result suggests that GRB051221A might be the first
          detection of two component jet in short gamma-ray burst
          outflow.

          Title: The Lack of Gamma-Ray Bursts from Population III
          Binaries
          Authors: Krzysztof Belczynski, Tomasz Bulik, Alexander Heger,
          Chris Fryer
          Comments: 40 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables: submitted to ApJ
          We study the evolution of first star (Population III) binaries.
          Under specific conditions, these stars may produce high
          redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We demonstrate that the
          occurrence rate of GRBs does not depend sensitively on
          evolutionary parameters in the population synthesis models. We
          show that the first binaries may form a very small group (< 1%)
          of fast rotating stars through binary tidal interactions that
          make GRBs. This finding is contrary to the Bromm & Loeb
          assumption that all stars in close Population III binaries will
          be spun up by tides and produce a GRB. We find that there is
          simply not enough fast rotating stars in Population III
          binaries to expect detection with SWIFT. Predicted detection
          rates, even with very optimistic assumptions on binary
          fraction, evolutionary parameters and GRB detection, are very
          small: 0.1-0.01 per year.

          Title: The Effect of Neutrino Radiation on Magnetorotational
          Instability in Proto-Neutron Stars
          Authors: Youhei Masada, Takayoshi Sano, Kazunari Shibata
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ, 24 pages,6 figures
          Neutrino radiation takes a major role in the momentum, heat,
          and lepton transports in proto-neutron stars (PNSs). These
          diffusive processes affect the growth of magnetorotational
          instability (MRI) in PNSs. We perform a local linear analysis
          for the axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric MRI including the
          effects of neutrino transports and ohmic dissipation. We find
          that the MRI can grow even in the multi-diffusive situations
          that are realized in neutrino loaded PNSs. When the toroidal
          magnetic component dominates over the poloidal one,
          nonaxisymmetric MRI modes grow much faster than axisymmetric
          modes. These results suggest the importance of the
          nonaxisymmetric MRI in PNSs. Thus the understandings of
          three-dimensional nonlinear evolutions of the MRI are necessary
          to reveal the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.

          Title: The minimum mass for star formation, and the origin of
          binary brown dwarfs
          Authors: A. P. Whitworth, D. Stamatellos (Cardiff University,
          UK)
          Comments: 15 pages, A&A accepted
          Our first aim is to calculate the minimum mass for Primary
          Fragmentation in a variety of potential star-formation
          scenarios, i.e. (i) hierarchical fragmentation of a 3-D medium;
          (ii) one-shot, 2-D fragmentation of a shock-compressed layer;
          (iii) fragmentation of a circumstellar disc. Our second aim is
          to evaluate the role of H2 dissociation in facilitating
          Secondary Fragmentation and thereby producing close, low-mass
          binaries. Results: (i)For contemporary, local star formation,
          the minimum mass for Primary Fragmentation is in the range
          0.001-0.004Msun, irrespective of the scenario considered.
          (ii)Circumstellar discs are only able to radiate fast enough to
          undergo Primary Fragmentation in their cool outer parts
          (R>100AU). Therefore brown dwarfs (BDs) should have difficulty
          forming by Primary Fragmentation at R<30AU, explaining the
          Brown Dwarf Desert.Conversely, Primary Fragmentation at R>100AU
          could be the source of brown dwarfs in wide orbits, and could
          explain why massive discs with Rd>100AU are rarely seen.(iii)H2
          dissociation can lead to collapse and Secondary Fragmentation,
          thereby converting primary fragments into close, low-mass
          binaries, with semi-major axes a~5AU(Msystem/0.1Msun), in good
          agreement with observation; in this case, the minimum mass for
          Primary Fragmentation becomes a minimum system mass, rather
          than a minimum stellar mass.(iv)Any primary fragment can
          undergo Secondary Fragmentation, producing a close low-mass
          binary, provided only that the fragment is spinning. Secondary
          Fragmentation is therefore most likely in fragments formed in
          the outer parts of discs, and this could explain why a BD in a
          wide orbit about a Sun-like star has a greater likelihood of
          having a BD companion than a BD in the field -as seems to be
          observed.

          349-25 is the tenth ultracool dwarf system detected in radio
          and its trigonometric parallax pi = 67.6 mas, recently measured
          by Gatewood et al., makes it the furthest ultracool system
          detected by the Very Large Array to date, and the most

          Title: Photon gas dynamics in the early universe
          Authors: Chris Clarkson, Mattias Marklund
          Comments: 4 pages, 5 figure files
          Quantum electrodynamics predicts that photons undergo one-loop
          scattering. The combined effect of this on the behaviour of a
          photon gas for temperatures above ~10^12K results in a
          softening of the equation of state from w_\gamma=1/3 to
          w_\gamma=1/15. We calculate the effect this has on the
          effective equation of state in the early universe, taking into
          account all the species of the Standard Model. Just after the
          phase transition from a quark gluon plasma, there is a dramatic
          reduction in the overall equation of state of nearly 10% as
          compared to the standard scenario, but by the time neutrinos
          freeze out there is negligible change. The change to the
          dynamics of the early universe will be significant in a wide
          variety of high-energy phenomena.

          EuroWD06 to be published in Conference Series of the
          Astronomical Society of the Pacific
          Recent progress on the nature of short duration Gamma Ray
          Bursts (GRBs) has shown that a fraction of them originate in
          the local universe. These systems may well be the result of
          giant flares from Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs) believed to be
          magnetars (neutron stars with extremely large magnetic fields
          >= 10^14 G). If these magnetars are formed via the core
          collapse of massive stars, then it would be expected that the
          bursts should originate from predominantly young stellar
          populations. However, correlating the positions of BATSE short
          bursts with structure in the local universe reveals a
          correlation with all galaxy types, including those with little
          or no ongoing star formation. This is a natural outcome if, in
          addition to magnetars forming via the core collapse of massive
          stars, they also form via Accretion Induced Collapse following
          the merger of two white dwarfs, one of which is magnetic. We
          investigate this possibility and find that the rate of magnetar
          production via WD-WD mergers in the Milky Way is comparable to
          the rate of production via core collapse. However, while the
          rate of magnetar production by core collapse is proportional to
          the star formation rate, the rate of production via WD-WD
          mergers (which have long lifetimes) is proportional to the
          stellar mass density, which is concentrated in early-type
          systems. Therefore magnetars produced via WD-WD mergers may
          produce SGR giant flares which can be identified with early
          type galaxies. We also comment on the possibility that this
          mechanism could produce a fraction of the observed short
          duration GRB population at low redshift.

          observations of compact-object binaries and supernovae

          University)
          Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures. Submitted to ApJ
          The observed samples of supernovae (SN) and double compact
          objects (DCOs) provide several critical constraints on
          population-synthesis models: the parameters of these models
          must be carefully chosen to reproduce, among other factors, (i)
          the formation rates of double neutron star (NS-NS) binaries and
          of white dwarf-neutron star (WD-NS) binaries and (ii) the type
          II and Ib/c supernova rates. Even allowing for extremely
          conservative accounting of the uncertainties in observational
          and theoretical predictions, we find only a few plausible
          population synthesis models
          (roughly 9%) are consistent with DCO and SN rates empirically
          determined from observations. As a proof of concept, we
          describe the information that can be extracted about population
          synthesis models given such stringent observational tests,
          including surprisingly good agreement with the observed pulsar
          proper motion distribution. In the present study, we find that
          the current observational constraints favor: kicks described by
          a single Maxwellian with a typical velocity of about 300km/s;
          mass-loss fractions during non-conservative, but stable, mass
          transfer episodes of about 90%; and common envelope parameters
          of about 0.2-0.5. Finally, we use the subset of astrophysically
          consistent models to predict the rates at which double black
          hole (BH-BH), black hole-neutron star (BH-NS), and NS-NS
          binaries merge in the Milky Way through the emission of
          gravitational waves.

          Authors: Gordon I. Ogilvie
          Comments: 19 pages, 1 figure, to be published in MNRAS
          Mean-motion resonances between a Keplerian disc and an orbiting
          companion are analysed within a Hamiltonian formulation using
          complex canonical Poincare variables, which are ideally suited
          to the description of eccentricity and inclination dynamics.
          Irreversibility is introduced by allowing for dissipation
          within the disc. A method is given for determining the rates of
          change of eccentricity and inclination variables of the disc
          and companion associated with resonances of various orders,
          including both reversible and irreversible effects, which
          extend and generalize previous results. Preliminary
          applications to protoplanetary systems and close binary stars
          are discussed.

          Comments: To appear in the Astrophysical Journal (January 10,
          2007, v654n 2 issue)
          We present the first multi-epoch radial velocity study of
          embedded young massive stars using near-infrared spectra
          obtained with ISAAC mounted at the ESO Very Large Telescope,
          with the aim to detect massive binaries. Our 16 targets are
          located in high-mass star-forming regions and many of them are
          associated to known ultracompact HI I regions, whose young age
          ensures that dynamic evolution of the clusters did not
          influence the intrinsic binarity rate. We identify two stars
          with about 90 km/s velocity differences between two epochs
          proving the presence of close massive binaries. The fact that 2
          out of the 16 observed stars are binary systems suggests that
          at least 20% of the young massive stars are formed in close
          multiple systems, but may also be consistent with most if not
          all young massive stars being binaries. In addition, we show
          that the radial velocity dispersion of the full sample is about
          35 km/s, significantly larger than our estimated uncertainty
          (25 km/s). This finding is consistent with similar measurements
          of the young massive cluster 30 Dor which might have a high
          intrinsic binary rate. Furthermore, we argue that virial
          cluster masses derived from the radial velocity dispersion of
          young massive stars may intrinsically overestimate the cluster
          mass due to the presence of binaries.

          Comments: 13 pages, 9 figures; Fig. 6 corrected, typos
          corrected
          We examine how the properties of inhomogeneous nuclear matter
          at subnuclear densities depend on the density dependence of the
          symmetry energy. Using a macroscopic nuclear model we calculate
          the size and shape of nuclei in neutron star matter at zero
          temperature in a way dependent on the density dependence of the
          symmetry energy. We find that for smaller symmetry energy at
          subnuclear densities, corresponding to larger density symmetry
          coefficient L, the charge number of nuclei is smaller, and the
          critical density at which matter with nuclei or bubbles becomes
          uniform is lower. The decrease in the charge number is
          associated with the dependence of the surface tension on the
          nuclear density and the density of a sea of neutrons, while the
          decrease in the critical density can be generally understood in
          terms of proton clustering instability in uniform matter.

          2006
          The outbursts of low mass X-ray binaries are prolonged relative
          to those of dwarf nova cataclysmic variables as a consequence
          of X-ray irradiation of the disc. We show that the time-scale
          of the decay light curve and its luminosity at a characteristic
          time are linked to the radius of the accretion disc. Hence a
          good X-ray light curve permits two independent estimates of the
          disc radius. In the case of the milli-second pulsars SAX
          J1808.4-3658 and XTE J0929-314 the agreement between these
          estimates is very strong. Our analysis allows new
          determinations of distances and accretion disc radii. Our
          analysis will allow determination of accretion disc radii for
          sources in external galaxies, and hence constrain system
          parameters where other observational techniques are not
          possible. We also use the X-ray light curves to estimate the
          mass transfer rate. The broken exponential decay observed in
          the 2002 outburst of SAX J1808.4-3658 may be caused by the
          changing self-shadowing of the disc.

          and Si XIII are clearly detected. Similar to the CTTS TW Hya
          and BP Tau, the forbidden lines of O VII and Ne IX are weak
          compared to the intercombination line, indicating high plasma
          densities in the X-ray emitting regions. The Si XIII triplet,
          however, is within the low-density limit, in agreement with the
          predictions of the accretion funnel infall model with an
          additional stellar corona. V4046 Sgr is the first close binary
          exhibiting these features. Together with previous
          high-resolution X-ray data on TW Hya and BP Tau, and in
          contrast to T Tau, now three out of four CTTS show evidence of
          accretion funnels.

          Are the e-prints (electronic preprints) from the @arXiv
          repository being used instead of the journal articles? In this
          paper we show that the e-prints have not undermined the usage
          of journal papers in the astrophysics community. As soon as the
          journal article is published, the astronomical community
          prefers to read the journal article and the use of e-prints
          through the NASA Astrophysics Data System drops to zero. This
          suggests that the majority of astronomers have access to
          institutional subscriptions and that they choose to read the
          journal article when given the choice. Within the NASA
          Astrophysics Data System they are given this choice, because
          the e-print and the journal article are treated equally, since
          both are just one click away. In other words, the e-prints have
          not undermined journal use in the astrophysics community and
          thus currently do not pose a financial threat to the
          publishers. We present readership data for the @arXiv category

          Title: Hadronic model for radio-to-TeV gamma-ray emission from
          PSR B1259-63
          Authors: A.Neronov, M.Chernyakova
          Comments: Proceeding of "The multi messenger approach to high
          energy gamma ray sources", Barcelona, June 2006
          We discuss the implications of the recent X-ray and TeV
          gamma-ray observations of the PSR B1259-63 system (a young
          rotation powered pulsar orbiting a Be star) for the theoretical
          models of interaction of pulsar and stellar winds. We show that
          previously considered models in which the pulsar wind is purely
          electron loaded have problems to account for the observed
          behaviour of the system in the TeV and X-ray bands. We develop
          a model in which the broad band (radio, X-ray and high energy
          gamma-ray) emission from the binary system is produced in
          result of collisions of GeV-TeV energy protons accelerated by
          the pulsar wind and interacting with the stellar disk. In this
          model the high energy gamma-rays are produced in the decays of
          secondary neutral pions, while radio and X-ray emission are
          synchrotron and inverse Compton emission produced by low-energy
          (< 100 MeV) electrons from the decays of secondary charged pi
          mesons. This model can explain not only the observed energy
          spectra, but also the correlations between TeV, X-ray and radio
          emission components.

          Title: The role of reconnection in the pulsar magnetosphere
          Authors: Ioannis Contopoulos
          The present work is our first attempt to understand the role of
          reconnection in the pulsar magnetosphere. Our discussion is
          based on the observationaly infered fact that, as the pulsar
          spins down, the region of closed corotating dipolar field lines
          grows with time. This implies that reconnection must take place
          in the magnetosphere. We argue that non-dissipative
          reconnection along the equatorial current sheet allows for the
          continuous channeling of pulsar spindown energy into particle
          energy, all the way from the light cylinder to the pulsar wind
          termination shock, and we propose that this effect may account
          for the low \sigma values inferred by observations. We present
          a simple model that allows us to relate the magnetic
          diffusivity in the equatorial current sheet to an observable
          pulsar parameter, the braking index n. When n~1, the global
          structure of the magnetosphere approaches that of a
          relativistic split monopole where the pulsar spindown energy is
          carried by the electromagnetic field. However, for values of
          n>1.5, almost all field lines close inside the pulsar wind
          termination shock, and thus most of the electromagnetic pulsar
          spindown energy flux is effectively transformed into particle
          energy in the equatorial current sheet.

          Letters
          4U 1954+319 was discovered 25 years ago, but only recently has
          a clear picture of its nature begun to emerge. We present for
          the first time a broad-band spectrum of the source and a
          detailed timing study using more than one year of monitoring
          data. The timing and spectral analysis was done using publicly
          available Swift, INTEGRAL, BeppoSAX, and RXTE/ASM data in the
          0.7-150 keV energy band. The source spectrum is described well
          by a highly absorbed (N_H~10^23 cm^-2) power law with a
          high-energy exponential cutoff around 15 keV. An additional
          black body component is needed below 3 keV to account for a
          soft excess. The derived ~5 hr periodicity, with a spin-up
          timescale of ~25 years, could be identified as the neutron star
          spin period. The spectral and timing characteristics indicate
          that we are dealing both with the slowest established
          wind-accreting X-ray pulsar and with the second confirmed
          member of the emerging class dubbed "symbiotic low mass X-ray
          binaries" to host a neutron star.

          Title: INTEGRAL observation of the accreting pulsar GX 1+4

          Comments: 15 pages, 13 figures. Accepted for publication on
          Astronomy and Astrophysics
          We present the results of the INTEGRAL monitoring campaign on
          the accreting low mass X-ray binary pulsar GX 1+4 performed
          during the Galactic plane scan of the INTEGRAL Core Programme.
          The source has been observed in different luminosity states
          ranging from L(20-40 keV)= 1.7x10^{-10} erg/cm^2/s, to L(20-40
          keV)=10.5x10^{-10} erg/cm^2/s for about 779 ks from 2003 March
          until 2004 October. Our observations confirm the secular spin
          down of GX 1+4 with spin period varying from 139.63 s to 141.56
          s. In the highest luminosity state a spin-up phase is observed.
          The phase averaged spectrum of the source has been modelled
          either with an absorbed cut-off power law or with a
          Comptonization model with parameters significantly different in
          the two brightest luminosity states. No evidence for any
          absorption-like feature is observed in the phase averaged
          spectrum up to 110 keV. At highest luminosity, the source is
          found to pulsate up to 130 keV. Phase resolved spectroscopy
          reveals a phase dependent continuum and marginal evidence for
          an absorption feature at 34 keV in the descending part of the
          pulse. If interpreted as due to electron resonant cyclotron
          scattering, the magnetic field in the emitting region would be
          2.9x10^{12}(1+z) G where z is the gravitational red-shift of
          the emitting region. We also observed a very low luminosity
          state, typical of this source, which lasted for about two days
          during which the source spectrum was modelled by a simple
          power-law and a pulsed signal was still detectable in the
          15-100 keV energy range.

          Title: The evolutionary status of the white dwarf companion of
          the binary pulsar PSR J1713+0747
          Authors: O. G. Benvenuto, R. D. Rohrmann, M. A. De Vito
          Comments: 11 pages, 9 figures. Published in MNRAS
          Journal-ref: 2006 MNRAS 366, 1520B
          Splaver and coworkers have measured the masses of the white
          dwarf and the neutron star components of the PSR J1713+0747
          binary system pair by Shapiro Delay. We attempt to find the
          original configuration of this system performing a set of
          binary evolution calculations to simultaneously account for the
          masses of both stars and the orbital period. We considered
          initial masses of 1.5 and 1.4 \msun for the normal (donor) and
          the neutron star, respectively. We assumed two metallicity
          values (Z = 0.010 and 0.020), and an initial orbital period
          near 3 days. We assume that the neutron star is only able to
          retain \lesssim 0.10 of the matter transferred by the donor
          star.
          Calculations were performed employing our binary hydro code
          that handles the mass transfer rate in a fully implicit way
          together with state-of-the-art physical ingredients, diffusion
          and a non-grey atmospheres.
          We compare the structure of the resulting white dwarfs with the
          characteristic age of PSR J1713+0747 finding a nice agreement
          with observations by Lundgren et al. especially for the case of
          a donor star with Z= 0.010. This result indicates that the
          evolution of this kind of binary system is well understood.
          The models predict that, due to diffusion, the atmosphere of
          the white dwarf is an almost hydrogen-pure one. We find that
          such structures are unable to account for the colours measured
          by Lundgren et al. within their error bars. Thus, some
          discrepances in the white dwarf emergent radiation remain to be
          explained.

          Title: Haar measures, relative entropy and the relativistic
          canonical velocity distribution
          Authors: Jörn Dunkel, Peter Talkner, Peter Hänggi
          Comments: 5 pages
          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics; Mathematical Physics
          The concept of equipartition (uniform distribution) can be
          extended to locally compact, topological groups by means of the
          Haar measure. Guided by this fact, we argue here that the
          relative entropy with respect to the Haar measure of the
          Lorentz group provides the most natural choice for the
          canonical equilibrium entropy in relativistic thermostatistics.
          Maximization of this entropy under the usual constraints yields
          a modified one-particle J\"uttner distribution that differs
          from the standard J\"uttner distribution by a prefactor which
          is proportional to the inverse relativistic kinetic energy.
          Remarkably, this modified distribution remains invariant in
          relativistic elastic collisions, whereas the standard J\"uttner
          function does not. The relevance of this result with regard to
          applications in high energy physics and astrophysics is
          discussed.

          Supernova Explosions
          Authors: A. Burrows, E. Livne, L. Dessart, C.D. Ott, J. Murphy
          Comments: Accepted to the Astrophysical Journal, 23 pages in
          emulateapj format, including 12 figures
          In the context of 2D, axisymmetric, multi-group,
          radiation/hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae
          over the full 180$^{\circ}$ domain, we present an exploration
          of the progenitor dependence of the acoustic mechanism of
          explosion. All progenitor models we have tested with our
          Newtonian code explode. We investigate the roles of the
          Standing-Accretion-Shock-Instability (SASI), the excitation of
          core g-modes, the generation of core acoustic power, the
          ejection of matter with r-process potential, the wind-like
          character of the explosion, and the fundamental anisotropy of
          the blasts. We find that the breaking of spherical symmetry is
          central to the supernova phenomenon and the blasts, when
          top-bottom asymmetric, are self-collimating. We see indications
          that the initial explosion energies are larger for the more
          massive progenitors, and smaller for the less massive
          progenitors, and that the neutrino contribution to the
          explosion energy may be an increasing function of progenitor
          mass. The degree of explosion asymmetry we obtain is completely
          consistent with that inferred from the polarization
          measurements of Type Ic supernovae. Furthermore, we calculate
          for the first time the magnitude and sign of the net impulse on
          the core due to anisotropic neutrino emission and suggest that
          hydrodynamic and neutrino recoils in the context of our
          asymmetric explosions afford a natural mechanism for observed
          pulsar proper motions. [abridged]

          Title: Axisymmetric oscillations of magnetic neutron stars
          Authors: Umin Lee
          Comments: submitted to monthly notices
          We calculate axisymmetric oscillations of rotating neutron
          stars composed of the surface fluid ocean, solid crust, and
          fluid core, taking account of a dipole magnetic field as strong
          as $B_S\sim 10^{15}$G at the surface. The adiabatic oscillation
          equations for the solid crust threaded by a dipole magnetic
          field are derived in Newtonian dynamics, on the assumption that
          the axis of rotation is aligned with the magnetic axis so that
          perturbations on the equilibrium can be represented by series
          expansions in terms of spherical harmonic functions
          $Y_l^m(\theta,\phi)$ with different degrees $l$ for a given
          azimuthal wave number $m$ around the the magnetic axis.
          Although the three component models can support a rich variety
          of oscillation modes, axisymmetric ($m=0$) toroidal $_{l}t_n$
          and spheroidal $_ls_n$ shear waves propagating in the solid
          crust are our main concerns, where $l$ and $n$ denote the
          harmonic degree and the radial order of the modes,
          respectively. In the absence of rotation, axisymmetric
          spheroidal and toroidal modes are completely decoupled, and we
          consider the effects of rotation on the oscillation modes only
          in the limit of slow rotation. We find that the oscillation
          frequencies of the fundamental toroidal torsional modes
          $_{l}t_n$ in the crust are hardly affected by the magnetic
          field as strong as $B_S\sim 10^{15}$G at the surface. As the
          radial order $n$ of the shear modes in the crust becomes
          higher, however, both spheroidal and toroidal modes become
          susceptible to the magnetic field and their frequencies in
          general get higher with increasing $B_S$. We also find that the
          surface $g$ modes and the crust/ocean interfacial modes are
          suppressed by a strong magnetic field, and that there appear
          magnetic modes in the presence of a strong magnetic field.

          Title: Asymmetry Function of Interstellar Scintillations of
          Pulsars
          Authors: V.I. Shishov, T.V. Smirnova
          Journal-ref: Astronomy Reports, v. 49, No.11, p. 905, 2005
          A new method for separating intensity variations of a source's
          radio emission having various physical natures is proposed. The
          method is based on a joint analysis of the structure function
          of the intensity variations and the asymmetry function, which
          is a generalization of the asymmetry coefficient and
          characterizes the asymmetry of the distribution function of the
          intensity fluctuations on various scales for the
          inhomogeneities in the diffractive scintillation pattern.
          Relationships for the asymmetry function in the cases of a
          logarithmic normal distribution of the intensity fluctuations
          and a normal distribution of the field fluctuations are
          derived. Theoretical relationships and observational data on
          interstellar scintillations of pulsars (refractive,
          diffractive, and weak scintillations) are compared. Pulsar
          scintillations match the behavior expected for a normal
          distribution of the field fluctuations (diffractive
          scintillation) or logarithmic normal distribution of the
          intensity fluctuations (refractive and weak scintillation).
          Analysis of the asymmetry function is a good test for
          distinguishing scintillations against the background of
          variations that have different origins.

          transition in a rotating neutron star core
          Authors: J. L. Zdunik, M. Bejger, P. Haensel, E. Gourgoulhon
          Comments: 8 pages, 8 figures, submitted to A&A
          We calculate energy release associated with a first order phase
          transition at the center of a rotating neutron star. The
          results are based on precise numerical 2-D calculations, in
          which both the polytropic equations of state (EOS) as well as
          realistic EOS of the normal phase are used. Presented results
          are obtained for a broad range of metastability of initial
          configuration and size of the new superdense phase core in the
          final configuration. For small radii of the superdense phase
          core analytical expressions for the energy release are
          obtained. For a fixed "overpressure" dP (the relative excess of
          central pressure of collapsing metastable star over the
          pressure of equilibrium first-order phase transition) the
          energy release remarkably does not depend on the stellar
          angular momentum and coincides with that for nonrotating stars
          with the same dP. The energy release is proportional to dP^2.5
          for small dPs, when sufficiently precise brute force 2-D
          numerical calculations are out of question. For higher dPs,
          results of 1-D calculations of energy release for non-rotating
          stars are shown to reproduce, with very high precision, the
          exact 2-D results for rotating stars.

          In this paper, we use high-resolution smoothed particle
          hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations to investigate the response of
          a marginally stable self-gravitating protostellar disc to a
          close parabolic encounter with a companion discless star. Our
          main aim is to test whether close brown dwarfs or massive
          planets can form out of the fragmentation of such discs. We
          follow the thermal evolution of the disc by including the
          effects of heating due to compression and shocks and a simple
          prescription for cooling and find results that contrast with
          previous isothermal simulations. In the present case we find
          that fragmentation is inhibited by the interaction, due to the
          strong effect of tidal heating, which results in a strong
          stabilization of the disc. A similar behaviour was also
          previously observed in other simulations involving discs in
          binary systems. As in the case of isolated discs, it appears
          that the condition for fragmentation ultimately depends on the
          cooling rate.

          Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables; accepted for
          publication in MNRAS
          New and previously published observations of the bright
          eclipsing binary VV Orionis are analyzed. We present new radial
          velocities and interstellar reddening measurements from
          high-resolution spectra of this detached, short-period (P=1.48
          d) binary. We discuss the validity of prior claims for the
          existence of a third body and show that our new velocities and
          light curve solution cast doubt on them. The components of VV
          Ori are shown to be a B1 V primary with a mass $M{_1}=10.9 \pm
          0.1 M_{\sun}$ and a radius $R_{1}=4.98 \pm 0.02 R_{\sun}$ and a
          B4.5 V secondary with a mass $M{_2}=4.09 \pm 0.05 M_{\sun}$ and
          a radius $R_{2}=2.41 \pm 0.01 R_{\sun}$.

          We present a re-analysis of our H- and K-band photometry and
          light-curves for GCIRS 16SW, a regular periodic source near the
          Galactic center. These data include those presented by DePoy et
          al. (2004); we correct a sign error in their reduction, finding
          GCIRS 16SW to be an eclipsing binary with no color variations.
          We find the system to be an equal mass overcontact binary (both
          stars overfilling their Roche lobes) with a period P=19.4513
          days, an inclination angle i=71 degrees, and zero eccentricity.
          This confirms and strengthens the findings of Martins et al.
          (2006) that GCIRS 16SW is an eclipsing binary composed of two
          ~50 Msun stars, implying that there has been recent star
          formation very close to the Galactic center. Finally, the
          calculated luminosity of each component is close to the
          Eddington luminosity, implying that the temperature of 24400 K
          given by Najarro et al. (1997) might be too high for these
          evolved stars.

          Submitted to ApJ
          We report the discovery of a new detached eclipsing binary
          known as NSVS01031772 with component masses M_1= 0.5428 +/-
          0.0027Msun, M_2= 0.4982 +/- 0.0025Msun, and radii R_1= 0.5260
          +/- 0.0028Rsun, R_2= 0.5088 +/- 0.0030Rsun. The system has an
          orbital period of 0.3681414(3) days and an apparent magnitude V
          ~ 12.6. The estimated effective temperatures of the stars are
          T_eff1 = 3615 +/- 72K and T_eff2 = 3513 +/- 31K. The space
          velocities of the system suggest that it is a main sequence
          binary and with a metallicity that is approximately solar. The
          two stars in this binary are located in a region of the
          Mass-Radius relation where no accurate observational data were
          previously available. Similarly to other low-mass binaries
          recently studied, the radius of each star in NSVS01031772
          exceeds the best evolutionary model predictions by about 8.5%
          on average.

          Comments: 3 pages, submitted to Phys. Rev. D
          It is shown that nuggets of strange quark matter may be
          extracted from the surface of pulsars and accelerated by strong
          electric fields to high energies if pulsars are strange stars
          with the crusts, comprised of nuggets embedded in a uniform
          electron background. Such high energy nuggets called usually
          strangelets give an observable contribution into galactic
          cosmic rays and may be detected by the upcoming cosmic ray
          experiment Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer AMS-02 on the
          International Space Station.

          Title: Mimicking neutron star precession by polar cap
          current-pattern drifting
          Authors: M. Ruderman, J. Gil
          We propose a model for rotating current patterns within
          radiopulsar polar cap accelerators which has observational
          consequences that mimic those which have been attributed to
          neutron star free precession. The model is a simple extension
          of a canonical one for the origin of the "drifting subpulses"
          often observed within the pulse envelope of radiopulsars.
          The new model's current pattern rotation period (with respect
          to the neutron star) is estimated to be of order a year.
          Associated with that rotation are small oscillations in
          spin-down torque, pulse arrival time, and radiobeam direction
          with this same period. These have estimated magnitudes which
          support a reinterpretation of free precession "observations"
          which could resolve the severe problem of obtaining anywhere
          near the otherwise required precession parameters with
          canonical neutron star models.

          The cross-correlation between the ROSAT all-sky survey (~150000
          sources) and the Tycho mission (~1000000 stars) catalogs has
          selected about 14000 stellar X-ray sources (RasTyc sample,
          Guillout et al. 1999). About 200-300 stars have been
          spectroscopically observed at high resolution both in the
          Halpha and LiI lambda-6708 regions with Elodie and Aurelie
          spectrographs of the OHP (Observatoire de l'Haute Provence,
          France). The aim was to classify the RasTyc star sample in
          terms of age and chromospheric activity level and to detect
          eventual binary systems. Photometric and spectroscopic
          follow-up observations of a RasTyc sub-sample composed of
          particularly interesting objects (binaries and very young
          stars) has been performed with the 91-cm telescope of the
          Catania Astrophysical Observatory. In this work we present some
          results of this monitoring. In particular, we have obtained
          good radial velocity curves and solved for the orbits of three
          SB2 and three SB1 spectroscopic binaries. In addition, for near
          all sources we have detected a photometric modulation
          ascribable to photospheric surface inhomogeneities and
          chromospheric Halpha line variation.

          Aims. This study aims to determine the level and constancy of
          the Spite plateau as definitively as possible from homogeneous
          high-quality VLT-UVES spectra of 19 of the most metal-poor
          dwarf stars known. Methods. Our high-resolution (R ~ 43000),
          high S/N spectra are analysed with OSMARCS 1D LTE model
          atmospheres and turbospectrum synthetic spectra to determine
          effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities as
          well as Li abundances for our stars. Results. Eliminating a
          cool subgiant and a spectroscopic binary, we find 8 stars to
          have -3.5 < [Fe/H] < -3.0 and 9 stars with -3.0 < [Fe/H] <
          -2.5. Our best value for the mean level of the plateau is A(Li)
          =2.10 +- 0.09. The scatter around the mean is entirely
          explained by our estimate of the observational error and does
          not allow for any intrinsic scatter in the Li abundances. In
          addition, we conclude that a systematic error of the order of
          200 K in any of the current temperature scales remains
          possible. The iron excitation equilibria in our stars support
          our adopted temperature scale, which is based on a fit to wings
          of the Halpha line, and disfavour hotter scales, which would
          lead to a higher Li abundance, but fail to achieve excitation
          equilibrium for iron. Conclusions. We confirm the previously
          noted discrepancy between the Li abundance measured in
          extremely metal-poor turnoff stars and the primordial Li
          abundance predicted by standard Big-Bang nucleosynthesis models
          adopting the baryonic density inferred from WMAP. We discuss
          recent work explaining the discrepancy in terms of diffusion
          and find the uncertain temperature scales to remain a major
          question mark. (abridged)

          Comments: 27 pages, 12 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Recent observations and theoretical investigations of neutron
          stars indicate that their atmospheres consist not of hydrogen
          or iron but possibly heavier elements such as helium. We
          calculate the ionization and dissociation equilibrium of helium
          in the conditions found in the atmospheres of magnetized
          neutron stars. For the first time this investigation includes
          the internal degrees of freedom of the helium molecule. We
          found that at the temperatures and densities of neutron star
          atmospheres the rotovibrational excitations of helium molecules
          are populated. Including these excitations increases the
          expected abundance of molecules by up to two orders of
          magnitude relative to calculations that ignore the internal
          states of the molecule; therefore, if the atmospheres of
          neutron stars indeed consist of helium, helium molecules and
          possibly polymers will make the bulk of the atmosphere and
          leave signatures on the observed spectra from neutron stars.

          The surface impedance of a superconductor changes when energy
          is absorbed and Cooper pairs are broken to produce single
          electron (quasiparticle) excitations. This change may be
          sensitively measured using a thin-film resonant circuit called
          a microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID). The practical
          application of MKIDs for photon detection requires a method of
          efficiently coupling the photon energy to the MKID. We present
          results on position sensitive X-ray detectors made by using two
          aluminum MKIDs on either side of a tantalum photon absorber
          strip. Diffusion constants, recombination times, and energy
          resolution are reported. MKIDs can easily be scaled into large
          arrays.

          We explore heavy-element nucleosynthesis by rapid neutron
          capture (r-process) in the decompressing ejecta from the
          surface of a neutron star. The decompression is triggered by a
          violent phase transition to strange quark matter (quark-nova
          scenario). The presence of neutron-rich large Z nuclei
          (40,95)<(Z,A)<(70,177), the large neutron-to-seed ratio, and
          the low electron fraction Ye ~ 0.03 in the decompressing ejecta
          present favorable conditions for the r-process. We perform
          network calculations that are adapted to the quark-nova
          conditions, and which mimic usual (n-\gamma) equilibrium
          r-process calculations during the initially cold decompression
          phase. They match to dynamical r-process calculations at
          densities below neutron drip (4x10^11 g/cc). We present results
          for the final element abundance distribution with and without
          heating from nuclear reactions, and compare to the solar
          abundance pattern of r-process elements. We highlight the
          distinguishing features of quark-novae by contrasting it with
          conventional nucleosynthesis sites such as type II supernovae
          and neutron star mergers, especially in the context of
          heavy-element compositions of extremely metal-deficient stars.

          Title: Using long-term transit timing to detect terrestrial
          planets
          Authors: Jeremy S. Heyl, Brett J. Gladman
          Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Monthly Notices
          We propose that the presence of additional planets in
          extrasolar planetary systems can be detected by long-term
          transit timing studies. If a transiting planet is on an
          eccentric orbit then the presence of another planet causes a
          secular advance of the transiting planet's pericenter over and
          above the effect of general relativity. Although this secular
          effect is impractical to detect over a small number of orbits,
          it causes long-term differences in when future transits occur,
          much like the long-term decay observed in pulsars. Measuring
          this transit-timing delay would thus allow the detection of
          either one or more additional planets in the system or the
          first measurements of non-zero oblateness ($J_2$) of the
          central stars.

          We present Keck K-band photometry and low-resolution H & K-band
          spectroscopy of the X-ray nova GRO J0422+32 obtained while the
          system was in the quiescent state. No clear ellipsoidal
          modulation is present in the light curve, which is instead
          dominated by a strong flickering component. In the K-band we
          observe strong Br_gamma emission, with an equivalent width of
          38 +/- 5 Angstroms. From this we conclude that the accretion
          disc is the most likely source of the observed photometric
          contamination, and that previous infrared-based attempts to
          constrain the mass of the putative black hole in this system
          are prone to considerable uncertainty. We finally proceed to
          show how it is possible to place meaningful constraints on some
          of the binary parameters of this system, even in the presence
          of a relatively high level of contamination from the disc.

          the Palomar-Green sample
          Authors: Magaretha L. Pretorius, Christian Knigge, Ulrich Kolb
          Comments: 12 pages, 11 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Large differences between the properties of the known sample of
          cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) and the predictions of the
          theory of binary star evolution have long been recognised.
          However, because all existing CV samples suffer from strong
          selection effects, observational biases must be taken into
          account before it is possible to tell whether there is an
          inconsistency. In order to address this problem, we have
          modelled the impact of selection effects on observed CV samples
          using a Monte Carlo approach. By simulating the selection
          criteria of the Palomar-Green (PG) Survey, we show that
          selection effects cannot reconcile the predictions of standard
          CV evolution theory with the observed sample. More generally,
          we illustrate the effect of the biases that are introduced by
          magnitude limits, selection cuts in U-B, and restrictions in
          galactic latitude.

          formalism to determine various contributions to the luminosity

          stars in the cluster core. We interpret this feature as the
          signature of an extra-population likely made by the progeny of
          massive stars originated by the evolution of binary systems.
          Indeed the comparison with theoretical tracks suggests that the
          AGB population of 47 Tuc can be significantly contaminated by
          more massive stars currently experiencing the first ascending
          Red Giant Branch.

          Stars
          Journal-ref: ASP Conference Series, 349, 301-304 (2006)
          We present here a complete list of contributions to the
          gravitational wave frequency evolution from compact binaries on
          circular orbits up to the second post-Newtonian order by
          including the interaction of magnetic dipole moments,
          quadrupole-monopole interactions together with the spin-orbit,
          the spin-spin and the self-interaction spin contributions. We
          apply our results to the Manchester et al. model of the
          J0737-3039A-B double pulsar.

          Title: Recent Progress on Anomalous X-ray Pulsars
          Authors: V. M. Kaspi (McGill University)
          Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures; to appear in proceedings of the
          conference "Isolated Neutron Stars: From the Interior to the
          Surface" eds. S. Zane, R. Turolla, D. Page; Astrophysics &
          Space Science in press
          I review recent observational progress on Anomalous X-ray
          Pulsars, with an emphasis on timing, variability, and spectra.
          Highlighted results include the recent timing and flux
          stabilization of the notoriously unstable AXP 1E 1048.1-5937,
          the remarkable glitches seen in two AXPs, the newly recognized
          variety of AXP variability types, including outbursts, bursts,
          flares, and pulse profile changes, as well as recent
          discoveries regarding AXP spectra, including their surprising
          hard X-ray and far-infrared emission, as well as the pulsed
          radio emission seen in one source. Much has been learned about
          these enigmatic objects over the past few years, with the pace
          of discoveries remaining steady. However additional work on
          both observational and theoretical fronts is needed before we
          have a comprehensive understanding of AXPs and their place in
          the zoo of manifestations of young neutron stars.

          Title: High Energy Processes in Pulsar Wind Nebulae
          Authors: W. Bednarek
          Comments: 9 pages, 1 figure, Proc. Multimessenger approach to
          high energy gamma-ray sources
          Young pulsars produce relativistic winds which interact with
          matter ejected during the supernova explosion and the
          surrounding interstellar gas. Particles are accelerated to very
          high energies somewhere in the pulsar winds or at the shocks
          produced in collisions of the winds with the surrounding
          medium. As a result of interactions of relativistic leptons
          with the magnetic field and low energy radiation (of
          synchrotron origin, thermal, or microwave background), the
          non-thermal radiation is produced with the lowest possible
          energies up to $\sim$100 TeV. The high energy (TeV) gamma-ray
          emission has been originally observed from the Crab Nebula and
          recently from several other objects. Recent observations by the
          HESS Cherenkov telescopes allow to study for the first time
          morphology of the sources of high energy emission, showing
          unexpected spectral features. They might be also interpreted as
          due to acceleration of hadrons. However, theory of particle
          acceleration in the PWNe and models for production of radiation
          are still at their early stage of development since it becomes
          clear that realistic modeling of these objects should include
          their time evolution and three-dimensional geometry. In this
          paper we concentrate on the attempts to create a model for the
          high energy processes inside the PWNe which includes existence
          not only relativistic leptons but also hadrons inside the
          nebula. Such model should also take into account evolution of
          the nebula in time. Possible high energy expectations based on
          such a model are discussed in the context of new observations.

          Comments: The 6th INTEGRAL Workshop 2006. The 6th INTEGRAL
          Workshop 2006, submitted
          \integral and \sax observations of the neutron-star LMXB
          4U~1705--44 have been analysed to deeply investigate the
          spectral state transitions nature. Its energy spectrum can be
          described as the sum of one or two blackbody, a 6.4-keV Fe line
          and a component due to thermal Comptonization. For the first
          time in this source, we find a strong signature of Compton
          reflection, presumably due to illumination of the
          optically-thick accretion disk by the Comptonized spectrum.
          Detection of two blackbody component in the soft states could
          originate in the disk and the neutron-star surface, and the
          Comptonized component arises from a hot inner flow with the
          seed photons coming from the disk and/or the neutron-star
          surface. The spectral transitions are shown to be associated
          with variations in the accretion rate, which changes in turn
          the temperature of the Comptonizing electrons and the strength
          of Compton reflection.

          Recent INTEGRAL observations and archival BeppoSAX data have

          the neutron star, atoll type, low mass X-ray Binary 4U1636-53.
          Our investigation in three different periods outline three
          corresponding different sates. Infact, the source was detected
          in both the canonical high and low state and moreover in one
          occasion \integral spectrum shows, for first time in this
          source, a hard tail dominating the emission above 30 keV. This
          spectrum is fitted as the sum of a Comptonized component
          similar to soft state and a power-law component
          ($\Gamma=2.76$), indicating the presence of a non thermal
          electron distribution of velocities.

          Title: A New Young Galactic Supernova Remnant Containing a
          Compact Object: G15.9+0.2
          Authors: S.P. Reynolds, K.J. Borkowski, U. Hwang, I. Harrus, R.
          Petre, G. Dubner
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures. Accepted by ApJ Letters
          We identify the radio-emitting shell-type supernova remnant
          G15.9+0.2 as a relatively young remnant containing an X-ray
          point source that may be its associated neutron star. The
          integrated spectrum of the remnant shell obtained from our 30
          ks exploratory Chandra observation shows very strong lines that
          require elevated element abundances from ejecta, in particular
          of sulfur. A plane-shock model fit gives a temperature $kT =
          0.9 (0.8, 1.0)$ keV, an ionization timescale $n_et = 6 (4, 9)
          \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ s, and a sulfur abundance of 2.1
          (1.7, 2.7) times solar (90% confidence limits). Two-component
          models with one solar and one enriched component are also
          plausible, but are not well constrained by the data. Various
          estimates give a remnant age of order $10^3$ yr, which would
          make G15.9+0.2 among the dozen or so youngest remnants in the
          Galaxy. The sparse point source spectrum is consistent with
          either a steep $\Gamma \sim$ 4 power law or a $kT \sim$ 0.4 keV
          blackbody. The spectrum is absorbed by a H column density $N_H
          \sim 4 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ similar to that required for
          the remnant shell. The implied 2--9.5 keV source luminosity is
          about $10^{33}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ for an assumed distance of 8.5
          kpc consistent with the high absorption column. We suggest that
          the point source is either a rotation-powered pulsar or a
          compact central object (CCO).

          Authors: S. Schuh, T. Nagel
          Comments: 6 pages, Proceedings, 15th European Workshop on White
          Dwarfs
          The archival spectrum of SDSS J212531.92-010745.9 shows not
          only the typical signature of a PG1159 star, but also indicates
          the presence of a companion. With time-series photometry of
          SDSS J212531.92-010745.9 during 10 nights, spread over one
          month, with the T"ubingen 80cm and the G"ottingen 50cm
          telescopes, the binary nature of this object has recently been
          proven. An orbital period of 6.9h could be determined, and the
          observed light curve fitted with the nightfall program. A
          comparison of the spectrum of SDSS J212531.92-010745.9 with
          NLTE models further constrained the light curve solution. We
          emphasize that this is the first system of this kind which will
          allow a dynamical mass determination for a PG1159 star.

          We report INTEGRAL/IBIS results on temporal and spectral
          behaviour of the Low Mass X-ray Binary XB 1832-330 located in
          the globular cluster NGC 6652. During the 2003-2005 monitoring
          of the Galactic Centre, the source shows a weak flux
          variability and an everage flux in the 20-150 keV of about
          2*10^{-10} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}. The overall energy spectrum
          extends up to 150 keV and is well described by a Comptonization
          model with an electrons temperature of $\sim$ 22 keV and a
          plasma optical depth of 1.8. We thus confirm the persistent
          nature of this burtser.

          The 4-200 keV spectral and temporal behaviour of the low mass
          X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 has been studied with INTEGRAL during
          2003-2005. This source as been observed in both the soft
          (banana) and hard (island) spectral states. A high energy tail
          above 50 keV in the hard state has been revealed for the first
          time. This places the source in the category of X-ray bursters
          showing high-energy emission. The tail can be modeled as a soft
          power law component, with the photon index of ~ 2.4, on top of
          thermal Comptonization emission from a plasma with the electron
          temperature of kT_e ~ 6 keV and optical depth of $\tau ~ 4.
          Alternatively, but at a lower goodness of the fit, the
          hard-state broad band spectrum can be accounted for by emission
          from a hybrid, thermal-nonthermal, plasma. During the
          observations, the source spent most of the time in the soft
          state, as previously reported and the $\ge$4 keV spectra can be
          represented by thermal Comptonization with kT_e ~ 3 keV and
          $\tau ~ 6-7.

          narrow-band gravitational wave detector Schenberg
          Authors: G. F. Marranghello, J. C. N. de Araujo
          We briefly review the properties of quasi-normal modes of
          neutron stars and black holes. We analyse the consequences of a
          possible detection of such modes via the gravitational waves
          associated with them, especially addressing our study to the
          Brazilian spherical antenna, on which a possible detection
          would occur at 3.0-3.4 kHz. A question related to any putative
          gravitational wave detection concerns the source that produces
          it. We argue that, since the characteristic damping times for
          the gravitational waves of neutron stars and black holes are
          different, a detection can distinguish between them, and also
          distinguish the neutron stars oscillating modes. Moreover,
          since the source can be identified by its characteristic
          damping time, we are able to extract information about the
          neutron star or black hole. This information would lead, for
          example, to a strong constraint in the nuclear matter equation
          of state, namely the compression modulus should be K=220 MeV.

          Title: Star Clusters with Primordial Binaries: III. Dynamical
          Interaction between Binaries and an Intermediate Mass Black
          Hole
          Authors: M. Trenti, E. Ardi, S. Mineshige, P. Hut
          Comments: 11 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We present the first study of the dynamical evolution of an
          isolated star cluster that combines a significant population of
          primordial binaries with the presence of a central black hole.
          We use equal-mass direct N-body simulations, with N ranging
          from 4096 to 16384 and a primordial binary ratio of 0-10%; the
          black hole mass is about one percent of the total mass of the
          cluster. The evolution of the binary population is strongly
          influenced by the presence of the black hole, which gives the
          cluster a large core with a central density cusp. Starting from
          a variety of initial conditions (Plummer and King models), we
          first encounter a phase, that last approximately 10 half-mass
          relaxation times, in which binaries are disrupted faster
          compared to analogous simulations without a black hole.
          Subsequently, however, binary disruption slows down
          significantly, due to the large core size. The dynamical
          interplay between the primordial binaries and the black hole
          thus introduces new features with respect to the scenarios
          investigated so far, where the influence of the black hole and
          of the binaries have been considered separately. A large core
          to half mass radius ratio appears to be a promising indirect
          evidence for the presence of a intermediate-mass black hole in
          old globular clusters.

          Authors: J. Takata, H.-K. Chang, K.S.Cheng
          Comments: 32pages, 8 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ
          We investigate polarization of high-energy emissions from the
          Crab pulsar in the frame work of the outer gap accelerator,
          following previous works of Cheng and coworkers. The recent
          version of the outer gap, which extends from inside the null
          charge surface to the light cylinder, is used for examining the
          synchrotron radiations from the secondary and the tertiary
          pairs, which are produced outside the gap. We calculate the
          light curve, the spectrum and the polarization characteristics,
          simultaneously, by taking into account gyration motion of the
          particles. The polarization position angle curve and the
          polarization degree are calculated to compare with the Crab
          optical data. We demonstrate that the radiations from inside
          the null charge surface make outer-wing and off-pulse emissions
          in the light curve, and the tertiary pairs contribute to bridge
          emissions. The emissions from the secondary pairs explain the
          main features of the observed light curve and spectrum.
          On the other hand, both emissions from inside the null charge
          surface and from the tertiary pairs are required to explain the
          optical polarization behavior of the Crab pulsar. The energy
          dependence of the polarization features is expected by the
          present model. For the Crab pulsar, the polarization position
          angle curve indicates that the viewing angle of the observer
          measured from the rotational axis is greater than $90^{\circ}$.

          and Pulsars, held in Bad Honnef, May 14-19 2006
          In the core of a canonical spinning magnetized neutron star(NS)
          a nearly uniform superfluid neutron vortex-array interacts
          strongly with a twisted array of magnetic flux-tubes threading
          the core's superconducting protons. One consequence is that
          changes in NS-spin alter both arrays and also the magnetic
          field distribution on the surface of the surrounding crust.
          Among predicted consequences for very young spinning-down NSs
          are "spin-down indices" increasing from 2 to 3, and a family of
          (Crab-like) spin-period "glitches" with permanent fractional
          jumps in spin-down torque 10E5 times greater than those in
          NS-spin. For older NSs, average spin-down indices increase to
          around 5, and an additional (Vela-like) family of giant
          glitches develops. NS spin-up to millesecond pulsars results in
          a high abundance of orthogonal and aligned rotators, and
          anomolously small polar cap areas. Observations do not conflict
          with these expectations. An epoch of NS magnetic field
          evolution between the onset of proton superconductivity
          (approx. yr) and neutron superfluidity (approx. 10E3 yrs ?) may
          be important for large surface magnetic field changes and needs
          further study. Observations generally considered evidence for
          NS precession seem to need reconsideration.

          Title: Absolute Being vs Relative Becoming
          Authors: Joy Christian (Perimeter and Oxford)
          Comments: 34 pages; To appear in Relativity and the
          Dimensionality of the World (within the series Fundamental
          Theories of Physics), edited by V. Petkov (Springer, NY 2007)
          Contrary to our immediate and vivid sensation of past, present,
          and future as continually shifting non-relational modalities,
          time remains as tenseless and relational as space in all of the
          established theories of fundamental physics. Here an
          empirically adequate generalized theory of the inertial
          structure is discussed in which proper time is causally
          compelled to be tensed within both spacetime and dynamics. This
          is accomplished by introducing the inverse of the Planck time
          at the conjunction of special relativity and Hamiltonian
          mechanics, which necessitates energies and momenta to be
          invariantly bounded from above, and lengths and durations
          similarly bounded from below, by their respective Planck scale
          values. The resulting theory abhors any form of preferred
          structure, and yet captures the transience of now along
          timelike worldlines by causally necessitating a genuinely
          becoming universe. This is quite unlike the scenario in
          Minkowski spacetime, which is prone to a block universe
          interpretation. The minute deviations from the special
          relativistic effects such as dispersion relations and Doppler
          shifts predicted by the generalized theory remain quadratically
          suppressed by the Planck energy, but may nevertheless be
          testable in the near future, for example via observations of
          oscillating flavor ratios of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos,
          or of altering pulse rates of extreme energy binary pulsars.

          Title: Proton Decay in Teravolt Unification
          Authors: P.H. frampton
          Comments: 4 pages latex
          Model building based on abelian quiver gauge theories gives
          models which resemble trinification, originally proposed with
          yottavolt unification. However, unification occurs in the
          teravolt range so proton decay must be completely excluded in
          the scalar sector. It is straightforward to accomplish this by
          a discrete symmetry which is a generalized baryon number B.
          Unlike in trinification, this is possible because quarks and
          leptons acquire masses from relevant operators which appear in
          four-dimensional conformal symmetry breaking.

          Title: A Spin-down Power Threshold for Pulsar Wind Nebula
          Generation?

          218, ASP Conference Proceedings), eds. F. Camilo and B. M.
          Gaensler, p. 225
          A systematic X-ray survey of the most energetic
          rotation-powered pulsars known, based on spin-down energy loss
          rate, $\dot E$ = $I\omega\dot\omega$, shows that all energetic
          pulsars with $\dot E > \dot E_{c} \approx 3.4 \times\ 10^{36}$
          erg s$^{-1}$ are X-ray bright, manifest a distinct pulsar wind
          nebula (PWN), and are associated with a supernova event, either
          historically or via a thermal remnant, with over half residing
          in shell-like supernova remnants. Below $\dot E_c$, the 2-10
          keV PWN flux ratio $F_{PWN}/F_{PSR}$ decreases by an
          order-of-magnitude. This threshold is predicted by the lower
          limit on the spectral slope $\Gamma_{min} \approx 0.5$ observed
          for rotation-powered pulsars (Gotthelf 2003). The apparent lack
          of bright pulsar nebulae below a critical Edot suggests a
          change in the particle injection spectrum and serves as a
          constraint on emission models for rotation-powered pulsars.
          Neither a young age nor a high density environment is found to
          be a sufficient condition for generating a PWN, as often
          suggested, instead the spin-down energy loss rate is likely the
          key parameter in determining the evolution of a
          rotation-powered pulsar.

          publication in Astrophysics and Space Science, as part of the
          proceedings of the London meeting on "Isolated Neutron Stars,"
          eds. S. Zane, R. Turolla & D. Page
          A significant new development in the study of Anomalous X-ray
          Pulsars (AXPs) has been the recent discovery by INTEGRAL and
          RXTE of flat, hard X-ray components in three AXPs. These
          non-thermal spectral components differ dramatically from the
          steeper quasi-power-law tails seen in the classic X-ray band in
          these sources. A prime candidate mechanism for generating this
          new component is resonant, magnetic Compton upscattering. This
          process is very efficient in the strong magnetic fields present
          in AXPs. Here an introductory exploration of an inner
          magnetospheric model for upscattering of surface thermal X-rays
          in AXPs is offered, preparing the way for an investigation of
          whether such resonant upscattering can explain the 20-150 keV
          spectra seen by INTEGRAL. Characteristically flat emission
          spectra produced by non-thermal electrons injected in the
          emission region are computed using collision integrals. A
          relativistic QED scattering cross section is employed so that
          Klein-Nishina reductions are influential in determining the
          photon spectra and fluxes. Spectral results depend strongly on
          the magnetospheric locale of the scattering and the observer's
          orientation, which couple directly to the angular distributions
          of photons sampled.

          Comments: 19 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We investigate the hydrodynamics of two identical hypersonic
          stellar winds in a binary system. The interaction of these
          winds manifests itself in the form of two shocks and a contact
          surface between them. We neglect the binary rotation and assume
          that the gas flow ahead of the shocks is spherically
          symmetrical. In this case the contact surface that separates
          the gas emanated from the different stars coincides with the
          midplane of the binary components. In the shock the gas is
          heated and flows away nearly along the contact surface. We find
          the shock shape and the hot gas parameters in the shock layer
          between the shock and the contact surface.

          Comments: 19 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication by A&A
          DW Carinae is a close but detached early B-type eclipsing
          binary in the young open cluster Cr 228. We have measured
          accurate physical properties of its components (masses and
          radii to 1%) and used these to derive the age, metallicity and
          distance of Cr 228. The rotational velocities of both
          components of DW Car are high, so we have investigated the
          performance of double-Gaussian fitting, one- and
          two-dimensional cross-correlation and spectral disentangling
          for measuring radial velocities in the presence of strong line
          blending. Gaussian and cross-correlation analyses require
          substantial corrections for the effects of line blending, which
          are only partially successful for cross-correlation.
          Disentangling is to be preferred because it does not assume
          anything about the shapes of spectral lines, and is not
          significantly affected by blending. Complete Stromgren uvby
          light curves have been obtained and accurate radii have been
          measured from them using the Wilson-Devinney program,
          constrained by an accurate spectroscopic light ratio. The Teffs
          and reddening have been found from Stromgren photometric
          calibrations. The masses and radii of DW Car are M_A = 11.34
          +/- 0.12 Msun, R_A = 4.558 +/- 0.045 Rsun, M_B = 10.63 +/- 0.14
          Msun and R_B = 4.297 +/- 0.055 Rsun. The Teffs are Teff_A =
          27900 +/- 1000 K and Teff_B = 26500 +/- 1000 K, and the
          reddening is E(b-y) = 0.18 +/- 0.02 mag. Using empirical
          bolometric corrections we find a distance modulus of 12.24 +/-
          0.12 mag for DW Car, which is in agreement with, and more
          accurate than, literature values for Cr 228. A comparison
          between the properties of DW Car and theoretical predictions is
          undertaken in the mass--radius and mass--Teff diagrams. Good
          agreement is found for an age of about 6 Myr and a metal
          abundance of Z approx 0.01 (abridged).

          Title: Short GRBs: Rates and luminosity function implications
          Authors: Dafne Guetta
          Comments: 6 pages, 2figures. Submitted to the proceedings of
          the Swift-Venice 2006 meeting to be published by "Il Nuovo
          Cimento"
          We compare the luminosity function and rate inferred from the
          BATSE short hard bursts (SHBs) peak flux distribution with the
          redshift and luminosity distributions of SHBs observed by
          Swift/HETE II. The Swift/HETE II SHB sample is incompatible
          with SHB population that follows the star formation rate.
          However, it is compatible with a distribution of delay times
          after the SFR. This would be the case if SHBs are associated
          with the mergers of double neutron star (DNS) systems. DNS may
          be ``primordial'' or can form dynamically by binary exchange
          interaction in globular clusters during core collapse. The
          implied SHB rates that we find range from \sim 8 to \sim
          30h_(70)^3 Gpc^(-3)yr^(-1). This rate is a much higher than
          what was previously estimated and, when beaming is taken into
          account, it is comparable to the rate of neutron star mergers
          estimated from statistics of binary pulsars. If GRBs are
          produced in mergers the implied rate practically guarantees
          detection by LIGO II and possibly even by LIGO I.

          Title: Collisionally Regenerated Dark Matter Structures in
          Galactic Nuclei
          Authors: David Merritt, Stefan Harfst, Gianfranco Bertone
          Comments: 11 pages, uses revtex4
          We show that the presence of a rho~1/r^{3/2} dark matter
          overdensity can be robustly predicted at the center of any
          galaxy old enough to have grown a power-law density cusp in the
          stars via the Bahcall-Wolf mechanism. Using both Fokker-Planck
          and direct N-body integrations, we demonstrate collisional
          generation of these dark matter "crests" (Collisionally
          REgenerated STtructures) even in the extreme case that the
          density of both stars and dark matter were previously lowered
          by slingshot ejection from a binary supermassive black hole.
          The time scale for collisional growth of the crest is
          approximately the two-body relaxation time as defined by the
          stars, which is < 10 Gyr at the centers of stellar spheroids
          with luminosities comparable to that of the Milky Way bulge or
          less. The presence of crests can robustly be predicted in such
          galaxies, unlike the steeper enhancements, called "spikes,"
          produced by the adiabatic growth of black holes. We discuss
          special cases where the prospects for detecting dark matter
          annihilations from the centers of galaxy haloes are
          significantly affected by the formation of crests.

          electromagnetic field. We also discuss observational effects of
          a single entrance to wormhole and a model for a binary
          astrophysical system formed by the entrances of wormholes with
          magnetic fields and consider its possible manifestation.

          Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure
          Double neutron star systems lead to strong tests of general
          relativity. The history of the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039 is
          also very interesting. There are claims that the younger member
          of this binary (pulsar B) had a light progenitor. It is
          possible that such double pulsar systems are double strange
          stars. We suggest that the collapse of the light progenitor was
          a phase transition to strange matter and J0737-3039B is a
          strange star. This would support small baryon loss implied by
          the small natal kick velocity for the system J0737-3039. Using
          equation of states for strange quark matter and neutron matter,
          we have calculated the stellar structure and the baryon content
          of the progenitor as well as the existing star - to compare
          with observational predictions. We have also calculated the
          moment of inertia using both of the equation of states to
          facilitate comparison with expected future measurements. The
          baryon number of the progenitor turns out to be ~ 2 X 10^{57}
          and with small baryon loss the this fits into a strange star of
          mass 1.25 M_sun. Double neutron stars may be double strange
          stars. If the moment of inertia of these stars are found in the
          near future as expected, then our predictions can be further
          tested.

          Authors: Andrew King, Emma Olsson, Melvyn B. Davies
          Comments: MNRAS, in press
          We consider gamma--ray bursts produced by the merger of a
          massive white dwarf with a neutron star. We show that these are
          likely to produce long--duration GRBs, in some cases definitely
          without an accompanying supernova, as observed recently. This
          class of burst would have a strong correlation with star
          formation, and occur close to the host galaxy. However rare
          members of the class need not be near star--forming regions,
          and could have any type of host galaxy. Thus a long--duration
          burst far from any star--forming region would also be a
          signature of this class. Estimates based on the existence of a
          known progenitor suggest that our proposed class may be an
          important contributor to the observed GRB rate.

          pdf can be found at: this http URL
          We present three-dimensional, nonrelativistic, hydrodynamic
          simulations of bow shocks in pulsar wind nebulae. The
          simulations are performed for a range of initial and boundary
          conditions to quantify the degree of asymmetry produced by
          latitudinal variations in the momentum flux of the pulsar wind,
          radiative cooling in the postshock flow, and density gradients
          in the interstellar medium (ISM). We find that the bow shock is
          stable even when travelling through a strong ISM gradient. We
          demonstrate how the shape of the bow shock changes when the
          pulsar encounters density variations in the ISM. We show that a
          density wall can account for the peculiar bow shock shapes of
          the nebulae around PSR J2124-3358 and PSR B0740-28. A wall
          produces kinks in the shock, whereas a smooth ISM density
          gradient tilts the shock. We conclude that the anisotropy of
          the wind momentum flux alone cannot explain the observed bow
          shock morphologies but it is instead necessary to take into
          account external effects. We show that the analytic (single
          layer, thin shell) solution is a good approximation when the
          momentum flux is anisotropic, fails for a steep ISM density
          gradient, and ap- proaches the numerical solution for efficient
          cooling. We provide analytic expressions for the latitudinal
          dependence of a vacuum-dipole wind and the associated shock
          shape, and compare the results to a split-monopole wind. We
          find that we are unable to distinguish between these two wind
          models purely from the bow shock morphology.

          Title: Merging of a massive black hole binary II
          Authors: Christian Zier
          Comments: 17 pages, 7 figures, MNRAS submitted
          In this paper, the second in a series of two, we justify two
          important assumptions on which the result is based that in
          course of a galaxy merger the slingshot ejection of bound stars
          in the second phase is sufficiently efficient as to allow the
          black hole binary to merge. The required steep cusp, which is
          as massive as the binary and surrounds the black holes at the
          time the binary becomes hard, is formed during the merger from
          both clusters surrounding each black hole and the matter
          funneled into the center. We find this profile to be in
          agreement with observed post-merger distributions after the
          cusp has been destroyed. The time dependency we derive for the
          merger predicts that stalled binaries, if they exist at all,
          will preferably be found at the end of the second phase. To
          test this prediction we compute the current semimajor axis of
          12 candidates of ongoing mergers. We find all of them
          unambiguously to be already in the last phase where the black
          holes coalesce due to the emission of gravitational waves.
          Therefore, in striking contradiction with predictions of a
          depleted loss-cone, the finding of not a single source in the
          second phase strongly supports our previous and current
          results: Binaries merge due to slingshot ejection of stars
          which have been funneled into the central regions in course of
          a galaxy collision.

          The masses of compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars
          and black holes are fundamental to astrophysics, but very
          difficult to measure. We present the results of an analysis of
          subluminous B (sdB) stars in close binary systems with unseen
          compact companions to derive their masses and clarify their
          nature. Radial velocity curves were obtained from time resolved
          spectroscopy. The atmospheric parameters were determined in a
          quantitative spectral analysis. With high resolution spectra we
          were able to measure the projected rotational velocity of the
          stars with high accuracy. The assumption of orbital
          synchronization made it possible to constrain inclination angle
          and companion mass of the binaries. Five invisible companions
          have masses that are compatible with white dwarfs or late type
          main sequence stars. But four sdBs have very massive companions
          like heavy white dwarfs, neutron stars or even black holes.
          Such a high fraction of massive compact companions can not be
          explained with current models of binary evolution.

          12 Bootis is a double-lined spectroscopic binary whose orbit
          has been resolved by interferometry. We present a detailed
          modelling of the system and show that the available
          observational constraints can be reproduced by models at
          different evolutionary stages, depending on the details of
          extra-mixing processes acting in the central regions. In order
          to discriminate among these theoretical scenarios, additional
          and independent observational constraints are needed: we show
          that these could be provided by solar-like oscillations, that
          are expected to be excited in both system components.

          We present the results of broad band (3-100 keV) observations
          of several X-ray pulsars with the INTEGRAL and RXTE
          observatories. We concentrate on the luminosity and energy
          dependence of the pulse profile and the variations of the
          cyclotron line energy. In V0332+53 the line energy changes
          nearly linearly with the source luminosity, while in 4U0115+63
          its behavior is more complicated. Strong variations of the
          pulse profile with the energy and source intensity were found
          for both of pulsars; in V0332+53 the changes of the pulse
          profile near the cyclotron line are especially drastic. The
          preliminary results obtained for Her X-1 and GX 301-2 in a high
          intensity state show the absence of significant pulse profile
          changes with the energy. Results and possible emission
          mechanisms are briefly discussed in terms of theoretical models
          of accreting pulsars.

          Title: Intermediate-mass black holes in colliding clusters:
          Implications for lower-frequency gravitational-wave astronomy
          Authors: Pau Amaro-Seoane, Marc Freitag
          Comments: Accepted for publication ApJ Letts. (the abstract
          shown below has been shortened)
          Observations suggest that star clusters often form in binaries
          or larger bound groups. Therefore, mergers between two clusters
          are likely to occur. If these clusters both harbor an
          intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH; 10^{2-4} Msun) in their
          center, they can become a strong source of gravitational waves
          when the black holes merge with each other. In order to
          understand the dynamical processes that operate in such a
          scenario, one has to study the evolution of the merger of two
          such young massive star clusters, and more specifically, their
          respective IMBHs. We employ the direct-summation Nbody4
          numerical tool on special-purpose GRAPE6 hardware to simulate a
          merger of two stellar clusters each containing 63,000 particles
          and a central IMBH. This allows us to study accurately the
          orbital evolution of the colliding clusters and the embedded
          massive black holes. Within ~7 Myr the clusters have merged and
          the IMBHs constitute a hard binary. The final coalescence
          happens in ~10^8 yrs. The implication of our analysis is that
          intermediate-mass black holes merging as the result of
          coalescence of young dense clusters could provide a source for
          the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space-based
          gravitational wave detector mission. We find that interactions
          with stars increase the eccentricity of the IMBH binary to
          about 0.8. Although the binary later circularizes by emission
          of gravitational waves, the residual eccentricity can be
          detectable through its influence on the phase of the waves if
          the last few years of inspiral are observed.

          Title: IR Monitoring of the Microquasar GRS 1915+105: Detection
          of Orbital and Superhump Signatures
          Authors: Ethan T. Neil, Charles D. Bailyn, Bethany E. Cobb
          Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We present the results of seven years of K-band monitoring of
          the low-mass X-ray binary GRS 1915+105. Positive correlations
          between the infrared flux and the X-ray flux and X-ray hardness
          are demonstrated. Analysis of the frequency spectrum shows that
          the orbital period of the system is $P_{orb}= 30.8 \pm 0.2$
          days. The phase and amplitude of the orbital modulation
          suggests that the modulation is due to the heating of the face
          of the secondary star. We also report another periodic
          signature between 31.2 and 31.6 days, most likely due to a
          superhump resonance. From the superhump period we then obtain a
          range on the mass ratio of the system, $0.05 < q < 0.12$.

          Title: Modelling the formation of double white dwarfs
          Authors: M.V. van der Sluys, F. Verbunt, O.R. Pols
          Comments: 20 pages, 17 figures, 6 tables, accepted for
          publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics. See this http URL
          for high-resolution versions of Figs. 15 and 16
          We investigate the formation of the ten double-lined double
          white dwarfs that have been observed so far. A detailed stellar
          evolution code is used to calculate grids of single-star and
          binary models and we use these to reconstruct possible
          evolutionary scenarios. We apply various criteria to select the
          acceptable solutions from these scenarios. We confirm the
          conclusion of Nelemans et al. (2000) that formation via
          conservative mass transfer and a common envelope with spiral-in
          based on energy balance or via two such spiralins cannot
          explain the formation of all observed systems. We investigate
          three different prescriptions of envelope ejection due to
          dynamical mass loss with angular-momentum balance and show that
          they can explain the observed masses and orbital periods well.
          Next, we demand that the age difference of our model is
          comparable to the observed cooling-age difference and show that
          this puts a strong constraint on the model solutions. However,
          the scenario in which the primary loses its envelope in an
          isotropic wind and the secondary transfers its envelope, which
          is then re-emitted isotropically, can explain the observed age
          differences as well. One of these solutions explains the
          DB-nature of the oldest white dwarf in PG1115+116 along the
          evolutionary scenario proposed by Maxted et al. (2002a), in
          which the helium core of the primary becomes exposed due to
          envelope ejection, evolves into a giant phase and loses its
          hydrogen-rich outer layers.

          Title: X-ray emission properties of the old pulsar PSR B2224+65
          Authors: C. Y. Hui, W. Becker
          Comments: submitted to A&A
          Using archival Chandra data we studied the X-ray emission
          properties of PSR B2224+65 and its environment. Albeit limited
          by photon statistics the spectral analysis suggests that the
          bulk of the emission from PSR B2224+65 is non-thermal. Fitting
          a power-law to the observed energy spectrum yields a photon
          index of $\Gamma=1.58^{+0.43}_{-0.33}$. The possible origin of
          the non-thermal pulsar emission is discussed in the context of
          the outer-gap model. We did not find any evidence for a compact
          nebula around PSR B2224+65 though the Chandra data reveal the
          existence of an extended feature which appears to be associated
          with PSR B2224+65. It extends from the pulsar position about 2
          arcmin to the north-west. Its orientation deviates by
          $\sim118^{\circ}$ from the pulsar's proper motion direction.
          Investigating its energy spectrum shows that the emission of
          this extended feature is much harder than that of the pulsar
          itself and is non-thermal in nature.

          S. Zane, R. Turolla & D. Page
          The existence of radio pulsars having inferred magnetic elds in
          the magnetar regime suggests that possible transition objects
          could be found in the radio pulsar population. The discovery of
          such an object would contribute greatly to our understanding of
          neutron star physics. Here we report on unusual X-ray emission
          detected from the radio pulsar PSR J1119-6127 using XMM-Newton.
          The pulsar has a characteristic age of 1,700 yrs and inferred
          surface dipole magnetic eld strength of 4.1x10^13 G. In the
          0.5-2.0 keV range, the emission shows a single, narrow pulse
          with an unusually high pulsed fraction of ~70%. No pulsations
          are detected in the 2.0-10.0 keV range, where we derive an
          upper limit at the 99% level for the pulsed fraction of 28%.
          The pulsed emission is well described by a thermal blackbody
          model with a high temperature of 2.4x10^6 K. While no
          unambiguous signature of magnetar-like emission has been found
          in high-magnetic-eld radio pulsars, the X-ray characteristics
          of PSR J1119-6127 require alternate models from those of
          conventional thermal emission from neutron stars. In addition,
          PSR J1119-6127 is now the radio pulsar with the smallest
          characteristic age from which thermal X-ray emission has been
          detected.

          We present results from Chandra and XMM-Newton observations
          pulsar B1046-58. A high-resolution spatial analysis reveals
          pulsar wind nebula (PWN) ~6"x11" in size. The combined emission
          pulsar and its PWN is faint, with a best-fit power-law photon
          index and unabsorbed luminosity of ~10^32 ergs/s in the
          0.5-10.0 keV a distance of 2.7 kpc). A spatially resolved
          imaging analysis presence of softer emission from the pulsar.
          No pulsations are PSR B1046-58; assuming a worst-case
          sinusoidal pulse profile, upper limit for the pulsed fraction
          in the 0.5-10.0 keV range of 53%. PWN emission is seen within
          2" of the pulsar; the additional structures asymmetric and
          extend predominantly to the south-east. We discuss from the PWN
          as resulting from material downstream of the wind shock, as
          outflow from the pulsar or as structures confined by a
          velocity. The first two interpretations imply equipartition
          fields in structures of & 40-100 uG, while the latter case
          implies a velocity & 190 n^{-1/2} km/s (where n is the ambient
          number density in emission from an associated supernova remnant

          Aims: We present discovery observations of the new cataclysmic
          variable star (CV) 1RXS J092737.4-191529, as well as spectra
          and photometry of SY Vol. The selection technique that turned
          up these two CVs is described; it should be efficient for
          finding dwarf novae with high outburst duty cycles. Methods:
          Two very common observational features of CVs, namely optical
          variability and X-ray emission, are combined to select targets
          for follow-up observations. Long-slit spectra were taken to
          identify CVs in the sample. Results: Two out of three objects
          selected in this way are CVs. One of these is the known dwarf
          nova SY Vol, while the second system, 1RXS J092737.4-191529, is
          a new discovery. We present medium resolution spectra, $UBVRI$
          magnitudes, and high-speed photometry for both these CVs. Rapid
          flickering in the light curve of 1RXS J092737.4-191529 confirms
          the mass transferring binary nature of this object; it is
          probably a dwarf nova that was in quiescence during our
          observations.

          chosen dEBs with primary components of B and early A type. One

          Many planet candidates have been detected by radial velocity
          variations of the primary star; they are planet candidates,
          because of the unknown orbit inclination. Detection of the
          wobble in the two other dimensions, to be measured by
          astrometry, would yield the inclination and, hence, true mass
          of the companions. We aim to show that planets can be confirmed
          or discovered in a close visual stellar binary system by
          measuring the astrometric wobble of the exoplanet host star as
          periodic variation of the separation, even from the ground. We
          test the feasibility with HD 19994, a visual binary with one
          radial velocity planet candidate. We use the adaptive optics
          camera NACO at the VLT with its smallest pixel scale (13 mas)
          for high precision astrometric measurements. The separations
          measured in single 120 images taken within one night are shown
          to follow white noise, so that the standard deviation can be
          devided by the square root of the number of images to obtain
          the precision. In this paper we present the first results and
          investigate the achievable precision in relative astrometry
          with adaptive optics. With a careful data reduction it is
          possible to achieve a relative astrometric precision as low as
          50 micro arc sec for a 0.6 arc sec, binary with VLT/NACO
          observations in one hour, the best relative astrometric
          precision ever achieved with a single telescope from the
          ground. The relative astrometric precision demonstrated here
          with AO at an 8-m mirror is sufficient to detect the
          astrometric signal of the planet HD 19994 Ab as periodic
          variation of the separation between HD 19994 A and B.

          We study possible impact of a softening of the equation of
          state by a phase transition, or appearance of hyperons, on the
          spin evolution of of isolated pulsars. Numerical simulations
          are performed using exact 2-D simulations in general
          relativity. The equation of state of dense matter at
          supranuclear densities is poorly known. Therefore, the accent
          is put on the general correlations between evolution and
          equation of state, and mathematical strictness. General
          conjectures referring to the structure of the one-parameter
          families of stationary configurations are formulated. The
          interplay of the back bending phenomenon and stability with
          respect to axisymmetric perturbations is described. Changes of
          pulsar parameters in a corequake following instability are
          discussed, for a broad choice of phase transitions predicted by
          different theories of dense matter. The energy release in a
          corequake, at a given initial pressure, is shown to be
          independent of the angular momentum of collapsing
          configuration. This result holds for various types of phases
          transition, with and without metastability. We critically
          review observations of pulsars that could be relevant for the
          detection of the signatures of the phase transition in neutron
          star cores.

          Title: The Planetary Mass Companion 2MASS1207-3932 B:
          Temperature, Mass and Evidence for an Edge-On Disk

          We present J-band imaging and H+K-band low-resolution
          spectroscopy of 2MASS1207-3932 AB, obtained with VLT NACO. For
          the putative planetary mass secondary, we find J = 20.0+/-0.2
          mag. The HK spectra of both components imply low gravity, and a
          dusty atmosphere for the secondary. Comparisons to synthetic
          spectra yield Teff_A ~ 2550+/-150K, and Teff_B ~ 1600+/-100K,
          consistent with their late-M and mid-to-late L types. For these
          Teff, and an age of 5-10 Myrs, evolutionary models imply M_A ~
          24+/-6 M_Jup and M_B ~ 8+/-2 M_Jup. Independent comparisons of
          these models to the observed colors, spanning ~I to L', also
          yield the same masses and temperatures. Our primary mass agrees
          with other recent analyses; however, our secondary mass, while
          still in the planetary regime, is 2-3 times larger than claimed
          previously. This discrepancy can be traced to the luminosities:
          while the absolute photometry and Mbol of the primary agree
          with theoretical predictions, the secondary is ~ 2.5+/-0.5 mag
          fainter than expected in all bands from I to L' and in Mbol.
          This accounts for the much lower secondary mass (and
          temperature) derived earlier. We argue that this effect is
          highly unlikely to result from a variety of model-related
          problems, and is instead real. This conclusion is bolstered by
          the absence of any luminosity problems in either the primary,
          or in AB Pic B which we also analyse. We therefore suggest grey
          extinction in 2M1207B, due to occlusion by an edge-on
          circum-secondary disk. This is consistent with the observed
          properties of edge-on disks around T Tauri stars, and with the
          known presence of a high-inclination evolved disk around the
          primary. Finally, the system's implied mass ratio of ~0.3
          suggests a binary-like formation scenario. (abridged)

          Title: Population Boundaries for Galactic White Dwarf Binaries
          in LISA's Amplitude-Frequency Domain
          Authors: Ravi Kumar Kopparapu, Joel E. Tohline
          Comments: 23 pages, 3 figures, Accepted for publication in
          Astrophysical Journal
          Detached, inspiraling and semi-detached, mass-transferring
          double white dwarf (DWD) binary systems are both expected to be
          important sources for the proposed space-based
          gravitational-wave detector, LISA. The mass-radius relationship
          of individual white dwarf stars in combination with the
          constraints imposed by Roche geometries permit us to identify
          population boundaries for DWD systems in LISA's ``absolute''
          amplitude-frequency diagram. With five key population
          boundaries in place, we are able to identify four principal
          population sub-domains, including one sub-domain that
          identifies where progenitors of Type Ia supernovae will reside.
          Given one full year of uninterrupted operation, LISA should be
          able to measure the rate at which the gravitational-wave
          frequency $f$ and, hence, the orbital period is changing in the
          highest frequency subpopulation of our Galaxy's DWD systems. We
          provide a formula by which the distance to each DWD system in
          this subpopulation can be determined; in addition, we show how
          the masses of the individual white dwarf stars in
          mass-transferring systems may be calculated.

          Title: Binary central stars of planetary nebulae
          Authors: Albert A. Zijlstra
          Comments: Invited review, in 'Evolution and chemistry of
          symbiotic stars and related objects', Wierzba, August 2006. To
          appear in Baltic Astronomy
          This paper reviews our knowledge on binary central stars of
          planetary nebulae and presents some personal opinions regarding
          their evolution. Three types of interactions are distinguished:
          type I, where the binary companion induces the mass loss; type
          II, where it shapes the mass loss but does not enhance it; type
          III, where a wide orbit causes the centre of mass to move,
          leading to a spiral embedded in the wind. Surveys for binary
          central stars are discussed, and the separations are compared
          to the distribution for binary post-AGB stars. The effect of
          close binary evolution on nebular morphology is discussed.
          Post-common-envelope binaries are surrounded by thin, expanding
          disks, expelled in the orbital plane. Wider binaries give rise
          to much thicker expanding torii. Type I binary evolution
          predicts a wide distribution of masses of central stars, skewed
          towards low masses. Comparison with observed mass distributions
          suggests that this is unlikely to be the only channel leading
          to the formation of a planetary nebula. A new sample of compact
          Bulge nebulae shows about 40% of nebulae with binary-induced
          morphologies.

          Title: Tides in asynchronous binary systems
          Authors: Oswaldo Toledano, Edmundo Moreno, Gloria

          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures
          Stellar oscillations are excited in non-synchronously rotating
          stars in binary systems due to the tidal forces. Tangential
          components of the tides can drive a shear flow which behaves as
          a differentially forced rotating structure in a stratified
          outer medium. In this paper we show that our single-layer
          approximation for the calculation of the forced oscillations
          yields results that are consistent with the predictions for the
          synchronization timescales in circular orbits. In addition,
          calibrating our model results to fit Zahn's relationship
          between synchronization timescales and orbital separation, we
          are able to constrain the value of the kinematical viscosity
          parameter. For the 4Mo+5Mo binary modeled in this paper, the
          kinematical viscosity is in the range 0.0015 -- 0.0043 Ro^2/d
          for orbital periods in the range 2.5 -- 25 d. Furthermore, the
          energy dissipation rate due to the shear flow is found to
          decrease by ~2 orders of magnitude as synchronization is
          approached, implying that binary systems may approach
          synchronization relatively quickly but that it takes a much
          longer timescale to actually attain this condition. Our model
          can be used to calculate the energy dissipation rates
          throughout the orbital cycle for arbitrary values of
          eccentricity and stellar rotational velocity. We suggest that
          the asymmetric distribution of energy dissipation over the
          stellar surface may lead to the appearance of localized regions
          of enhanced surface activity.

          The ratio of the depths of spectral lines is a powerful
          indicator of the effective temperature. The method based on
          this analysis is capable of discerning small temperature
          variations of individual stars.
          We apply this spectroscopic data analysis to three type of
          stars, namely an RS CVn type binary system, a young solar-type
          star and a Cepheid variable. We show that individual LDRs
          converted into temperature through calibration relations lead
          to rotational and pulsational modulation of the average surface
          temperature with amplitudes of 127 K, 48 K and 1466 K in the
          three types of stars, with average estimated errors of some
          tens Kelvin degrees.

          We report here on X-ray and IR observations of the Anomalous
          X-ray Pulsar 1RXS J170849-400910. First, we report on new
          XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT and Chandra observations of this AXP,
          which confirm the intensity-hardness correlation observed in
          the long term X-ray monitoring of this source by Rea et al.
          (2005). These new X-ray observations show that the AXP flux is
          rising again, and the spectrum hardening. If the increase in
          the source intensity is indeed connected with the glitches and
          a possible bursting activity, we expect this source to enter in
          a bursting active phase around 2006-2007. Second, we report on
          deep IR observations of 1RXS J170849-400910, taken with the
          VLT-NACO adaptive optics, showing that there are many weak
          sources consistent with the AXP position. Neither star A or B,
          previously proposed by different authors, might yet be
          conclusively recognised as the IR counterpart of 1RXS
          J170849-400910. Third, using Monte Carlo simulations, we
          re-address the calculation of the significance of the
          absorption line found in a phase-resolved spectrum of this
          source by Rea et al. (2003), and interpreted as a resonant
          scattering cyclotron feature.

          Binary properties are an important diagnostic of the star and
          brown dwarf formation processes. While wide binaries appear to
          be rare in the sub-stellar regime, recent observations have
          revealed Ophiuchus 162225-240515 (2MASS J16222521-2405139) as a
          likely young ultra-low-mass binary with an apparent separation
          of ~240 AU. Here, we present low-resolution near-infrared
          spectra of the pair from NTT/SOFI (R~600) and VLT/ISAAC
          (R~1400), covering the 1.0-2.5um spectral region. By comparing
          to model atmospheres from Chabrier & Baraffe and Burrows et
          al., we confirm the surface temperatures to be T_A =
          (2350+/-150) K and T_B = (2100+/-100) K for the two components
          of the binary, consistent with earlier estimates from optical
          spectra. Using gravity sensitive K I features, we find the
          surface gravity to be significantly lower than field dwarfs of
          the same spectral type, providing the best evidence so far that
          these objects are indeed young. However, we find that models
          are not sufficiently reliable to infer accurate ages/masses
          from surface gravity. Instead, we derive masses of M_A = 13
          (+8/-4) M_J and M_B = 10 (+5/-4) M_J for the two objects using
          the well-constrained temperatures and assuming an age of 1-10
          Myr, consistent with the full range of ages reported for the
          Oph region.

          Driven by the incomplete understanding of the formation of gas
          giant extrasolar planets and of their mass-radius relationship,
          several ground-based, wide-field photometric campaigns are
          searching the skies for new transiting extrasolar gas giants.
          As part of the Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey (TrES), we
          monitored approximately 30,000 stars (9 .5 < V < 15.5) in a 5.7
          degree x 5.7 degree field in Andromeda with three telescopes
          over five months. We identified six candidate transiting
          planets from the stellar light curves. From subsequent
          follow-up observations, we rejected each of these as an
          astrophysical false positive, i.e. a stellar system containing
          an eclipsing binary, whose light curve mimics that of a
          Jupiter-sized planet transiting a sun-like star. We present
          these candidates as an example of the procedures followed by
          the TrES team to reject false positives from our list of
          candidate transiting hot Jupiters.

          companions of Hipparcos stars and the frequency of wide binary
          systems
          Authors: Sébastien Lépine, Bethany Bongiorno
          Comments: 18 pages, to appear in The Astronomical Journal
          We perform a search for faint, common proper motion companions
          of Hipparcos stars using the recently published LSPM-north
          catalog of stars with proper motion mu>0.15 arcsec/yr. Our
          survey uncovers a total of 521 systems with angular separations
          3" < Delta theta < 1500", with 15 triples and 1 quadruple. Our
          new list of wide systems with Hipparcos primaries includes 130
          systems identified here for the first time, including 44 in
          which the secondary star has V>15.0. Our census is
          statistically complete for secondaries with angular separations
          20" < Delta theta < 300" and apparent magnitudes V<19.0.
          Overall, we find that at least 9.5 % of nearby (d<100 pc)
          Hipparcos stars have distant stellar companions with projected
          orbital separations s>1,000 AU. We observe that the
          distribution in orbital separations is consistent with Opik's
          law f(s) ds ~ s^{-1} ds only up to separation s~4,000 AU,
          beyond which it follows a more steeply decreasing power law
          f(s) ds ~ s^{-l} ds with l=1.6+/-0.1. We also find that the
          luminosity function of the secondaries is significantly
          different from that of the single stars field population,
          showing a relative deficiency in low-luminosity (8<M_V<14)
          objects. The observed trends suggest either a formation
          mechanism biased against low-mass companions, or a disruption
          over time of systems with low gravitational binding energy.

          We present the results of an H-alpha monitoring campaign on the
          BeXRB and microquasar system LS I +61 303. We use radial
          velocity measurements of HeI lines in our spectra to
          re-evaluate the orbital elements and to better establish the
          time of periastron. We list equivalent widths and other
          parameters for the H-alpha emission line and discuss the
          orbital phase related variations observed. We call attention to
          a dramatic episode of emission weakening that occurred in less
          than a day that probably resulted from exposure to a transient
          source of ionizing radiation. We argue that the increase in
          H-alpha and X-ray emission following periastron probably
          results from the creation of an extended density wave in the
          disk created by tidal forces. We also discuss estimates of the
          size of the disk from the H-alpha equivalent width
          measurements, and we suggest that the disk radius from the
          average equivalent width corresponds to a resonant truncation
          radius of the disk while the maximum equivalent width
          corresponds to a radius limited by the separation of the stars
          at periastron. We note that a nearby faint companion is
          probably an unrelated foreground object.

          adiabatic donor expansion, and late-time donor cooling. Details
          of the first and third phase are new results from this study
          and we focus on generally characterizing these two phases.

          The distribution of the intensities of individual pulses of PSR
          B0950+08 as a function of the longitudes at which they appear
          is analyzed. The flux density of the pulsar at 111 MHz varies
          strongly from day to day (by up to a factor of 13) due to the
          passage of the radiation through the interstellar plasma
          (interstellar scintillation). The intensities of individual
          pulses can exceed the amplitude of the mean pulse profile,
          obtained by accumulating 770 pulses, by more than an order of
          magnitude. The intensity distribution along the mean profile is
          very different for weak and strong pulses. The differential
          distribution function for the intensities is a power law with
          index n = -1.1 +- 0.06 up to peak flux densities for individual
          pulses of the order of 160 Jy.

          Title: Properties of planets in binary systems. The role of
          binary separation
          Authors: S. Desidera, M. Barbieri
          Comments: A&A, in press
          The statistical properties of planets in binaries were
          investigated. Any difference to planets orbiting single stars
          can shed light on the formation and evolution of planetary
          systems. As planets were found around components of binaries
          with very different separation and mass ratio, it is
          particularly important to study the characteristics of planets
          as a function of the effective gravitational influence of the
          companion. A compilation of planets in binary systems was made;
          a search for companions orbiting stars recently shown to host
          planets was performed, resulting in the addition of two further
          binary planet hosts (HD 20782 and HD 109749). The probable
          original properties of the three binary planet hosts with white
          dwarfs companions were also investigated. Using this updated
          sample of planets in binaries we performed a statistical
          analysis of the distributions of planet mass, period, and
          eccentricity, fraction of multiplanet systems, and stellar
          metallicity for planets orbiting components of tight and wide
          binaries and single stars. The only highly significant
          difference revealed by our analysis concerns the mass
          distribution of short-period planets. Massive planets in short
          period orbits are found in most cases around the components of
          rather tight binaries. The properties of exoplanets orbiting
          the components of wide binaries are compatible with those of
          planets orbiting single stars, except for a possible greater
          abundance of high-eccentricity planets. The previously
          suggested lack of massive planets with P>100 days in binaries
          is not confirmed. We conclude that the presence of a stellar
          companion with separation smaller than 100-300 AU is able to
          modify the formation and/or migration and/or the dynamical
          evolution history of giant planets while wide companions play a
          more limited role

          Title: Capture Formed Binaries via Encounters with Massive
          Protostars
          Authors: Nickolas Moeckel, John Bally
          Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures, accepted to ApJ
          Most massive stars are found in the center of dense clusters,
          and have a companion fraction much higher than their lower mass
          siblings; the massive stars of the Trapezium core in Orion have
          ~ 1.5 companions each. This high multiplicity could be a
          consequence of formation via a capture scenario, or it could be
          due to fragmentation of the cores that form the massive stars.
          During stellar formation circumstellar disks appear to be
          nearly ubiquitous. Their large radii compared to stellar sizes
          increase the interaction radius significantly, suggesting that
          disk interactions with neighboring stars could assist in
          capturing binary companions. This mechanism has been studied
          for stars of approximately solar mass and found to be
          inefficient. In this paper we present simulations of
          interactions between a 22 Msun star-disk system and less
          massive impactors, to study the disk-assisted capture formation
          of binaries in a regime suited to massive stars. The formation
          of binaries by capture is found to be much more efficient for
          massive capturers. We discuss the effects of a mass dependent
          velocity dispersion and mass segregation on the capture rates,
          and consider the long term survival of the resultant binaries
          in a dense cluster.

          Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are known to come in two duration
          classes, separated at ~2 s. Long bursts originate from star
          forming regions in galaxies, have accompanying supernovae (SNe)
          when near enough to observe and are likely caused by
          massive-star collapsars. Recent observations show that short
          bursts originate in regions within their host galaxies with
          lower star formation rates consistent with binary neutron star
          (NS) or NS - black hole (BH) mergers. Moreover, although their
          hosts are predominantly nearby galaxies, no SNe have been so
          far associated with short GRBs. We report here on the bright,
          nearby GRB 060614 that does not fit in either class. Its ~102 s
          duration groups it with long GRBs, while its temporal lag and
          peak luminosity fall entirely within the short GRB subclass.
          Moreover, very deep optical observations exclude an
          accompanying supernova, similar to short GRBs. This combination
          of a long duration event without accompanying SN poses a
          challenge to both a collapsar and merging NS interpretation and
          opens the door on a new GRB classification scheme that
          straddles both long and short bursts.

          Authors: Shahin Jafarzadeh
          Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures and 6 tables
          The new B and V photoelectric observations of the beta Lyrae
          eclipsing binary DO Cas were obtained on 6 nights form December
          2000 to January 2001. The observations were made at the Biruni
          Observatory, Shiraz, Iran and the light curves are analyzed
          using the Wilson light curve synthesis and differential
          correction code. So, the relative surface luminosities, new
          light elements, and new orbital elements have been obtained,
          and from times of minimum the period is improved. With these
          and previously published times, the period variation is studied
          and a constant period is approved, though some authors has
          mentioned some variations. The solutions of the light curves
          suggest that DO Cas is a contact binary.

          cataclysmic variables
          Authors: Magaretha L. Pretorius, Christian Knigge, Ulrich Kolb
          Comments: To appear in the proceedings of the conference `The
          Multicoloured Landscape of Compact Objects and their Explosive
          Origins' (Cefalu, Sicily, June 2006)
          Large differences between the properties of the known sample of
          cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) and the predictions of the
          theory of binary star evolution have long been recognised.
          However, because all existing CV samples suffer from strong
          selection effects, observational bias must be considered before
          it is possible to tell whether there is an inconsistency, which
          would imply a failure of the evolutionary model. We have
          modelled common selection effects and illustrate their
          influence on observed CV samples.

          We report the serendipitous discovery of a peculiar main
          sequence in archived Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 observations
          of the young star cluster NGC 2011 in the Large Magellanic
          Cloud. The bright part of this main sequence exhibits a
          prominent double, fork-like feature, as if it consists of twin
          main sequences, one of them being redder. The color-magnitude
          diagram, constructed from the stars found in the only available
          WFPC2 field of the cluster, is used to distinguish the stars
          according to their membership to each of these sequences and to
          study their spatial distribution. We find that there are two
          well distinguished populations in the sense that the redder
          main sequence is dominated by stars that belong to the main
          body of the cluster, while the stars of the bluer main sequence
          belong to the surrounding region. Providing that NGC 2011 is a
          verified binary cluster, with the second companion
          unfortunately not observed, and taking into account the general
          region where this cluster is located, we discuss the possible
          scenarios from both star formation, and early dynamical
          evolution point-of-view that might explain this unique
          discovery.

          Title: Comparing Eta Carinae with the Red Rectangle
          Authors: Noam Soker (Technion, Israel)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          I compare the structures of the bipolar nebulae around the
          massive binary system Eta Carinae and around the low mass
          binary system HD 44179. While Eta Carinae is on its way to
          become a supernova, the Red Rectangle is on its way to form a
          planetary nebula. Despite the two orders of magnitude
          difference in mass, these two systems show several
          similarities, both in the properties of the stellar binary
          systems and the nebulae. From this comparison and further
          analysis of the accretion process during the 20 years Great
          Eruption of Eta Carinae, I strengthen the binary model for the
          formation of its bipolar nebula--the Homunculus. In the binary
          model a large fraction of the mass lost by the primary star
          during the Great Eruption was transferred to the secondary star
          (the companion); An accretion disk was formed around the
          companion, and the companion launched two opposite jets. I show
          that the gravitational energy of the mass accreted onto the
          secondary star during the Great Eruption can account for the
          extra energy of the Great Eruption, both the radiated energy
          and the kinetic energy in the Homunculus. I also conclude that
          neither the proximity of the primary star in Eta Car to the
          Eddington luminosity, nor the rotation of the primary star are
          related directly to the shaping of the Homunculus. I speculate
          that the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae was triggered by
          disturbance in the outer boundary of the convective region,
          most likely by magnetic activity, that expelled the outer
          radiative zone.

          Title: The Origin of Carbon-Enhancement and Initial Mass
          Function of Extremely Metal-Poor Stars in the Galactic Halo
          Authors: Yutaka Komiya, Takuma Suda, Hiroki Minaguchi,
          Toshikazu Shigeyama, Wako Aoki, Masayuki Y. Fujimoto
          Comments: 66 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables Accepted for
          publication in ApJ
          It is known that the carbon-enhanced, extremely metal-poor
          (CEMP) stars constitute a substantial proportion in the
          extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars of the Galactic Halo, by far
          larger than CH stars in Population II stars. We investigate
          their origin with taking into account an additional
          evolutionary path to the surface carbon-enrichment, triggered
          by hydrogen engulfment by the helium flash convection, in EMP
          stars of $[Fe/H] \lesssim -2.5$. This process is distinct from
          the third dredge-up operating in more metal-rich stars and also
          in EMP stars. In binary systems of EMP stars, the secondary
          stars become CEMP stars through mass transfer from the primary
          stars of low and intermediate masses, which have developed the
          surface carbon-enhancement. Our binary scenario can predict the
          variations in the abundances not only for carbon but also for
          nitrogen and s-process elements and reasonably explain the
          observed properties such as the stellar distributions with
          respect to the carbon abundances, the binary periods, and the
          evolutionary stages. Furthermore, from the observed frequencies
          of CEMP stars with and without s-process element enhancement,
          we demonstrate that the initial mass function of EMP stars need
          to give the mean mass $~10\msun$ under the reasonable
          assumptions on the distributions of orbital separations and
          mass ratio of binary components. This also indicates that the
          currently observed EMP stars were exclusively born as the
          secondary members of binaries, making up $\sim 10%$ remnants of
          EMP binary systems of mass $~10^8\msun$ in total; in addition
          to CEMP stars with white dwarf companions, a significant
          fraction of them have experienced supernova explosions of their
          companions. We discuss the implications of the present results
          in relation to the formation of Galactic halo.

          of Time of Arrival (TOA) due to the effect would be as large as
          10 ns in 20 years observation span. These residuals can be much

          HESS J1804-216
          Authors: Wei Cui, Alexander Konopelko (Purdue Univ.)
          Comments: 14 pages including 4 figures. Accepted by ApJ Letters
          We present high-resolution X-ray images taken with the {\em
          Chandra X-ray Observatory} of the field that contains the
          unidentified TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1804-216. A total of
          eleven discrete sources were detected with {\it a posteriori}
          significance of $> 5\sigma$ over the entire field of view.
          Among them, only one, designated as CXOU J180351.4-213707, is
          significantly extended. The source is about 40\arcsec away from
          the radio pulsar PSR J1803-2137, which was the target of the
          {\em Chandra} observation but was not detected in X-rays. A
          natural question is whether the two sources are physically
          related. While it is conceivable that CXOU J180351.4-213707
          could be associated with a previously unknown supernova remnant
          (SNR), in which the pulsar was born, it seems equally plausible
          that it might be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) that is powered by
          a different pulsar whose emission is beamed away from us. In
          either case, we argue that CXOU J180351.4-213707 is likely the
          X-ray counterpart of HESS J1804-216, based on the fact that the
          Galactic TeV gamma-ray sources are predominantly SNRs or PWNe.
          The X-ray spectrum of the source can be fitted well with a
          power law, although the model is not well constrained due to
          large statistical uncertainties. The spectrum seems to be very
          hard, with the best-fit photon index about $\sim 1.2$. Under
          the assumption that CXOU J180351.4-213707 is the X-ray
          counterpart of HESS J1804-216, we attempted to model the X-ray
          and TeV emission as synchrotron and inverse Compton scattered
          radiation from relativistic electrons. We briefly discuss the
          results.

          We report on observations of the radio-emitting anomalous X-ray
          pulsar XTE J1810-197 during 2006 May-October using the Nancay,
          Parkes, GBT, and VLA telescopes at a frequency of 1.4 GHz. The
          torque experienced by the neutron star during this period, as
          inferred from a measurement of its rotational frequency
          derivative, decreased by 30%, although not in a steady manner.
          We have also observed very large ongoing fluctuations in flux
          density and pulse shape. Superimposed on these, a general
          diminution of flux density and a broadening of the pulse
          profile components occurred nearly contemporaneously with a
          decrease in torque of about 10% that took place in late July
          over an interval of two weeks. In addition, a simultaneous
          observation of the pulsar with the Chandra X-ray Observatory
          and the GBT allows us to show how the X-ray and radio profiles
          are aligned. We discuss briefly the implications of these
          results for the magnetospheric currents in this remarkable

          binary white dwarf systems
          Authors: Étienne Racine, E. Sterl Phinney, Phil Arras
          Comments: 30 pages, 2 figures, to be submitted to ApJ
          We study a non-dissipative hydrodynamical mechanism that can
          stabilize the spin of the accretor in an ultra-compact double
          white dwarf binary. This novel synchronization mechanism relies
          on a nonlinear wave interaction spinning down the background
          star. The essential physics of the synchronization mechanism is
          summarized as follows. As the compact binary coalesces due to
          gravitational wave emission, the largest star eventually fills
          its Roche lobe and accretion starts. Some of the accretor then
          spins up due to infalling material and eventually reaches a
          spin frequency where a normal mode of the star is resonantly
          driven by the gravitational tidal field of the companion. If
          the resonating mode satisfies a set of specific criteria, which
          we elucidate in this paper, it exchanges angular momentum with
          the background star at a rate such that the spin of the
          accretor locks at this resonant frequency, even though
          accretion is ongoing. Some of the accreted angular momentum
          that would otherwise spin up the accretor is fed back into the
          orbit through this resonant tidal interaction.
          Two modes capable of stabilizing the accretor's spin are the
          l=4,m=2 and l=5,m=3 CFS unstable hybrid r-modes, which
          stabilize the spin of the accretor at frequency 2.6 and 1.5
          times the binary's orbital frequency respectively. Since the
          stabilization mechanism relies on continuously driving a mode
          at resonance, its lifetime is limited since eventually the mode
          amplitude saturates due to non-linear mode-mode coupling. Rough
          estimates of the lifetime of the effect lie from a few orbits
          to thousands of years.

          Title: Fragmentation of Collapsar Disks and the Production of
          Gravitational Waves
          Authors: Anthony L. Piro, Eric Pfahl (KITP)
          Comments: Submitted for publication in The Astrophysical
          Journal Letters, 4 pages, 2 figures
          We argue that gravitational instability in the outer parts of
          collapsar disks may lead to fragmentation near the radius where
          helium photodisintegrates, because of the strong cooling
          provided by this process. This physics sets clear physical
          scales for the fragmentation conditions and the properties of
          gravitationally bound clumps. Collapse of a fragment proceeds
          until the neutrons become degenerate; a neutron star of mass
          ~0.1-1Msun may result. We find that tidal disruption of a
          fragment and accretion by the central black hole are too rapid
          to account for the durations of observed X-ray flares from long
          gamma-ray bursts. Prior to disruption, migration of the
          fragment is driven by gravitational radiation and disk
          viscosity, which act together to produce a unique
          gravitational-wave signature. Advanced LIGO may be able to
          detect such sources within ~100 Mpc.

          We present a variable star catalog of an extensive ground-based
          wide-field variability survey in the globular cluster omega
          Centauri. Using the ANU 40-inch (1m) telescope at Siding Spring
          Observatory, the cluster was observed with a 52'x52' (0.75
          deg^2) field for 25 nights. A total of 187 variable stars were
          identified in the field, 81 of which are new discoveries. This
          work comprises the widest field variability survey yet
          undertaken for this cluster. Here we present the V+R
          lightcurves and preliminary analysis of the detected variable
          stars, comprising 58 eclipsing binaries, 69 RR Lyrae stars, 36
          long period variables (P>=2d) and 24 miscellaneous pulsators
          including 15 SX Phoenicis stars and two Type II Cepheids.
          Analysis of the eclipsing binary radial distribution has
          revealed an apparent lack of binaries in the 8'-15' range,
          perhaps indicating two separate binary populations. Four
          detached binaries have short periods (<2.5d) and are likely
          composed of low-mass M-dwarf components, useful for testing
          stellar evolution models. One further detached system has a
          period of 0.8 days and due to the blueness of the system could
          be composed of white dwarf stars. Analysis of the RR Lyrae
          sample has produced a reddening corrected distance modulus
          (also accounting for metallicity spread) for the cluster of
          13.68+-0.27, a result consistent with previously published
          values. This paper also presents a total stellar database
          comprising V and I photometry (with astrometry better than
          0.25'') for 203,892 stars with 12.0<V<21.0 and 25-night V+R
          lightcurves for 109,726 stars (14.0<V<22.0) for both the
          cluster and the field.

          Title: Gamma-ray binaries
          Authors: I.F. Mirabel
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures. Invited talk to appear in
          Proceedings of the conference "The Multi-Messenger Approach to
          High-Energy Gamma-ray Sources", Barcelona, 4-7 July 2006
          Recent observations have shown that some compact stellar
          binaries radiate the highest energy light in the universe. The
          challenge has been to determine the nature of the compact
          object and whether the very high energy gamma-rays are
          ultimately powered by pulsar winds or relativistic jets.
          Multiwavelength observations have shown that one of the three
          gamma-ray binaries known so far, PSR B1259-63, is a neutron
          star binary and that the very energetic gamma-rays from this
          source and from another gamma-ray binary, LS I +61 303, may be
          produced by the interaction of pulsar winds with the wind from
          the companion star. At this time it is an open question whether
          the third gamma-ray binary, LS 5039, is also powered by a
          pulsar wind or a microquasar jet, where relativistic particles
          in collimated jets would boost the energy of the wind from the
          stellar companion to TeV energies.

          Authors: Jorge A. Combi, Juan F. Albacete Colombo, Gustavo E.
          Romero, Paula Benaglia
          Comments: 13 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for publication in
          Astrophysical Journal Letters
          We report the first XMM detection of the SNR candidate
          G337.2+0.1 (=AX J1635.9-4719). The object shows centrally
          filled and diffuse X-ray emission. The emission peaks in the
          hard 3.0-10.0 keV band. A spatially resolved spectral study
          confirms that the column density of the central part of the SNR
          is about N_{H}~5.9 +/- 1.5*10^{22} cm^{-2} and its X-ray
          spectrum is well represented by a single power-law with a
          photon index Gamma=0.96 +/- 0.56. The non-detection of line
          emission in the central spectrum is consistent with synchrotron
          radiation from a population of relativistic electrons. Detailed
          spectral analysis indicates that the outer region is highly
          absorbed and quite softer than the inner region, with
          N_{H}~16.2(+/-5.2)*10^{22} cm^{-2} and kT=4.4(+/-2.8) keV. Such
          characteristics are already observed in other X-ray plerions.
          Based on the morphological and spectral X-ray information, we
          confirm the SNR nature of G337.2+0.1, and suggest that the
          central region of the source is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN),
          originated by an energetic though yet undetected pulsar, that
          is currently losing energy at a rate of ~ 10^{36} erg s^{-1}.

          Atmosphere Models

          Comments: 22 pages, 6 figures; accepted by The Astrophysical
          Journal
          We explore the sensitivity of limb darkening coefficients
          computed from stellar atmosphere models to different
          least-squares fitting methods. We demonstrate that conventional
          methods are strongly biased to fitting the stellar limb. Our
          suggested method of fitting by minimizing the radially
          integrated squared residual yields improved fits with better
          flux conservation. The differences of the obtained coefficients
          from commonly used values are observationally significant. We
          show that the new values are in better agreement with solar
          limb darkening measurements as well as with coefficients
          reported from analyses of eclipsing binary light curves.

          interstellar medium on AU-scales
          Authors: Mark A. Walker (MAW Technology Pty Ltd)
          Comments: 8 Pages, 4 figures, Proceedings of Small Ionised and
          Neutral Structures conference (Socorro, 21st-24th May 2006)
          Several radio-wave scintillation phenomena exhibit properties
          which are difficult to accommodate within the standard
          propagation model based on distributed Kolmogorov turbulence in
          the ionised ISM; here we discuss one such phenomenon, namely
          Extreme Scattering Events. By analysis of the data we
          demonstrate that these events are caused by ionised gas
          associated with self-gravitating, AU-sized gas clouds. The data
          also show that the ionised gas is confined by ram pressure,
          with the clouds moving at hundreds of km/s relative to the
          diffuse ISM and causing strong shocks. These conclusions are
          supported by a quantitative model in which heat from the
          shocked ISM evaporates gas from the surface of a cold cloud;
          this model readily explains the physical conditions which are
          required for Extreme Scattering and yields passable
          reproductions of the light-curves. The magnetotail of the cloud
          provides a site in which two other ``anomalous'' radio-wave
          propagation phenomena -- IntraDay Variability of quasars, and
          pulsar parabolic arcs -- can plausibly arise, thus linking
          three anomalous propagation phenomena in a single physical
          model. Locally there must be thousands of these neutral clouds
          per cubic parsec and by mass they are the primary constituent
          of interstellar matter.

          differentially rotating neutron stars
          Authors: Branson C. Stephens, Matthew D. Duez, Yuk Tung Liu,
          Stuart L. Shapiro, Masaru Shibata
          Comments: Submitted to a special issue of Classical and Quantum
          Gravity based around the New Frontiers in Numerical Relativity
          meeting at the Albert Einstein Institute, Potsdam, July 17-21,
          2006
          The capacity to model magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) flows in
          dynamical, strongly curved spacetimes significantly extends the
          reach of numerical relativity in addressing many problems at
          the forefront of theoretical astrophysics. We have developed
          and tested an evolution code for the coupled
          Einstein-Maxwell-MHD equations which combines a BSSN solver
          with a high resolution shock capturing scheme. As one
          application, we evolve magnetized, differentially rotating
          neutron stars under the influence of a small seed magnetic
          field. Of particular significance is the behavior found for
          hypermassive neutron stars (HMNSs), which have rest masses
          greater the mass limit allowed by uniform rotation for a given
          equation of state. The remnant of a binary neutron star merger
          is likely to be a HMNS. We find that magnetic braking and the
          magnetorotational instability lead to the collapse of HMNSs and
          the formation of rotating black holes surrounded by massive,
          hot accretion tori and collimated magnetic field lines. Such
          tori radiate strongly in neutrinos, and the resulting
          neutrino-antineutrino annihilation (possibly in concert with
          energy extraction by MHD effects) could provide enough energy
          to power short-hard gamma-ray bursts. To explore the range of
          outcomes, we also evolve differentially rotating neutron stars
          with lower masses and angular momenta than the HMNS models.
          Instead of collapsing, the non-hypermassive models form nearly
          uniformly rotating central objects which, in cases with
          significant angular momentum, are surrounded by massive tori.

          Title: Constraining Galactic Neutrino Production in $p\gamma$
          Interactions with Cosmic Ray Electron and Positron Spectra
          Authors: Nayantara Gupta (UNLV), Bing Zhang (UNLV)
          Comments: 8 pages, no figure
          High energy neutrinos are expected to be produced inside
          astrophysical sources of cosmic rays {\it e.g.} supernova
          remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, active galactic nuclei and
          gamma-ray bursts by the decay of charged pions produced in
          $p\gamma$ and $pp$ interactions. Although $pp$ interactions may
          be the dominant mechanism in our Galaxy, it is unclear how
          important $p\gamma$ process is for neutrino production. We show
          that it is possible to put a lower limit on the contribution of
          $p\gamma$ interactions to high energy neutrino production from
          all Galactic astrophysical cosmic ray sources using the
          observed cosmic ray electron and positron spectra. Assuming
          equal injection powers of electrons and nucleons, the
          contribution of $p\gamma$ interactions to high energy neutrino
          production is found to be at least $\sim 6%$. Their
          contribution could be even larger if there is a large number of
          sources from which electrons and positrons can not escape due
          to their radiation losses, or the optical depths of both $pp$
          and $p\gamma$ processes are small.

          The radio supernova remnant W50 hosts at its center the
          peculiar galactic X-ray binary SS 433. It shows a central
          spherical structure with two `ears' which are supposed to be
          formed by the interaction of the precessing jets of SS 433 with
          the supernova shell. In two pointings in September/October 2004
          for 30 ks each the eastern jet of SS 433 was observed with
          XMM-Newton to study the outermost parts of the `ear' and the
          X-ray bright emission region about 35 arcmin from SS 433. The
          spectra consist of two components: a non-thermal power law with
          photon index \Gamma ~ 2.17+/-0.02 and a thermal component at a
          typical temperature of kT ~ 0.3 keV. The X-ray emission seems
          to fill the whole interior region of the radio remnant W50. The
          jet terminates in the eastern `ear' in a ring-like terminal
          shock which indicates a flow with a kind of hollow-cone
          morphology. The spatial coincidence of X-ray and radio emission
          suggests physical conditions similar to those found at the
          outer shocks of ordinary supernova remnants. The bright
          emission region closer to SS 433 radiates non-thermally in a
          spatially well confined geometry at higher X-ray energies. At
          soft X-rays the shape of the region gets blurred, centered on
          the hard lenticular emission. The shape of this region and the
          bend in the jet propagation direction might be caused by the
          interaction of a re-collimated jet with the outer, non
          homogeneous interstellar matter distribution. The physical
          conditions leading to the re-collimation of the jet and the
          peculiar emission morphology are far from being understood and
          require deeper observations as well as a detailed modeling of
          the interaction of a jet with its surroundings.

          We describe the mid- (MIR) and far- (FIR) infrared properties
          of a large ($\sim$1000) sample of the most isolated galaxies in
          the local Universe. This sample is intended as a
          ``nurture-free'' zero point against which more environmentally
          influenced samples can be compared. We reprocess IRAS MIR/FIR
          survey data using the ADDSCAN/SCANPI utility for 1030 out of
          1050 galaxies from the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies (CIG) as
          part of the AMIGA project. We focus on diagnostics (FIR
          luminosity $L_{FIR}$, $R=\log(L_{FIR}/L_{B})$ and IRAS colours)
          thought to be sensitive to effects of environment or
          interaction. The distribution of $\log(L_{FIR})$ is sharply
          peaked from 9.0--10.5 with very few ($<$2%) galaxies above
          10.5. The optically normalised luminosity diagnostic $R=
          \log(L_{FIR}/L_{B})$ shows a distribution sharply peaked
          between 0.0 and $-$1.0. These results were compared to the
          magnitude limited CfA sample that was selected without
          environmental discrimination. This modestly (e.g. compared to
          cluster, binary galaxy and compact group samples)
          environmentally affected sample shows significantly higher mean
          $\log(L_{FIR})$ and $R$, whereas the mean $\log(L_{B})$ is the
          same. Our sample shows a strong $L_{FIR}$ vs. $L_{B}$
          correlation, with a slope steeper than one ($L_{FIR} \propto
          L_{B}^{1.41}$). Interacting galaxies were found above this
          correlation, showing an enhancement in $L_{FIR}$. With respect
          to the IRAS colours, we found higher $F_{60}/F_{100}$ value for
          ellipticals and late-type galaxies than for spirals, indicating
          a higher dust temperature. The results indicate that the FIR
          emission is a variable enhanced by interaction, and that our
          sample probably shows the lowest possible mean value. This
          attests to the utility of our sample for defining a
          nurture-free zero point.

          Comments: PhD thesis, University of Amsterdam, 2006 (very low
          resolution). Full-resolution PDF available at this http URL
          Observations over the last decade have indicated that a large
          fraction of the stars are part of a binary or multiple system.
          For our understanding of star formation it is therefore of
          crucial importance to characterise the outcome of the star
          forming process in terms of binary parameters. This thesis
          describes the recovery of the primordial binary population in
          the nearby OB association Sco OB2. The current binary
          population in Sco OB2 is first recovered using two adaptive
          optics surveys (ADONIS, NAOS-CONICA), a literature study, and a
          detailed analysis of the selection effects of visual,
          spectroscopic, and astrometric binary surveys. Our results
          indicate a binary fraction close to 100%. The mass ratio
          distribution (among A/B primaries) has the form f(q) = q^-0.4,
          while random pairing is excluded. The semi-major axis
          distribution has the form f(log a) = constant. Due to its youth
          and low stellar density, the current binary population of Sco
          OB2 is very similar to its primordial binary population. Our
          study further indicates a small brown dwarf companion frequency
          and a small substellar-to-stellar companion frequency among A
          and B type stars. These properties, often referred to as the
          brown dwarf desert, are a natural result of the mass ratio
          distribution in Sco OB2. The embryo ejection scenario is not
          necessary to explain observations. The brown dwarf desert may
          be ascribed to an excess of planetary companions, rather than
          by a lack of brown dwarf companions.

          Title: Origin of the Break and Mass-Dependence in the
          Wide-Binary Projected-Separation Distribution
          Authors: Andrew Gould, Jason Eastman (Ohio State)
          Comments: submitted to ApJ Letters, 4 pages + 1 figure
          The distribution of Galactic-disk wide binaries shows a clear
          break in slope at projected separations of about r_\perp ~ 2500
          AU in two basically independent surveys by Chaname & Gould and
          Lepine & Bongiorno. The latter also showed that the frequency
          of wide-binary companions to G-star primaries declines
          monotonically as a function of companion mass. We show that
          both effects can be explained by the operation of Heggie's law
          in the typical open-cluster environments where binaries form.
          One immediate conclusion is that most Galactic-disk stars
          formed in open clusters with internal dispersions of a few
          hundred meters per second and disruption times of a few hundred
          million years.

          Title: Inspiral, merger and ring-down of equal-mass black-hole
          binaries
          Authors: Alessandra Buonanno, Gregory B. Cook, Frans Pretorius
          Comments: 43 pages, 34 figures, full abstract in paper, revtex4
          We investigate the dynamics and gravitational-wave (GW)
          emission in the binary merger of equal-mass black holes as
          obtained from numerical relativity simulations. Results from
          the evolution of three sets of initial data are explored in
          detail, corresponding to different initial separations of the
          black holes. We find that to a good approximation the inspiral
          phase of the evolution is quasi-circular, followed by a
          "blurred, quasi-circular plunge", then merger and ring down. We
          present first-order comparisons between analytical models of
          the various stages of the merger and the numerical results. We
          provide comparisons between the numerical results and
          analytical predictions based on the adiabatic Newtonain,
          post-Newtonian (PN), and non-adiabatic resummed-PN models. From
          the ring-down portion of the GW we extract the fundamental
          quasi-normal mode and several of the overtones. Finally, we
          estimate the optimal signal-to-noise ratio for typical binaries
          detectable by GW experiments.

          PSR B1931+24 is a 813 ms radio pulsar which has been recently
          discovered to display peculiar intermittent radio emission.
          This source is observable in the radio band for ~5-10 days and
          remains radio quiet for the following 25-35 days, periodically.
          Even more remarkable is its spin-down behaviour: the pulsar
          slows down at a rate a factor of ~1.5 faster in the radio-on
          than during the radio-off phase. We report here on new X-ray
          and optical observations of PSR B1931+24, performed with the
          Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Isaac Newton Telescope.
          Furthermore, we present here the possibility that this radio
          pulsar is hosted in an eccentric binary system with a very low
          mass companion. We then discuss our results in the intermittent
          isolated radio pulsar scenario and in the binary picture.

          (Abridged) We report on ten weeks of RXTE observations of the
          X-ray transient XTE J1701-462. Comparisons with other sources
          suggest it had all the characteristics of the neutron star Z
          sources (the brightest persistent neutron star LMXBs). These
          include Z tracks in X-ray color diagrams and typical
          variability components detected in the power spectra. XTE
          J1701-462 is the first transient Z source and provides unique
          insights into mass accretion rate (Mdot) and luminosity
          dependencies in neutron star LMXBs. As its overall luminosity
          decreased, we observed a switch between two types of Z-source
          behavior, with most of the branches of the Z-track changing
          their shape and/or orientation. We interpret this switch as an
          extreme case of the longterm changes seen in the persistent Z
          sources and suggest that these result from changes in Mdot. We
          also suggest that the Cyg-like Z sources (Cyg X-2, GX 5-1, and
          GX 340+0) might be more luminous (> 50%) than the Sco-like Z
          sources (Sco X-1, GX 17+2, and GX 349+2). Adopting a possible
          explanation for the behavior of kHz QPOs, which involves a
          prompt as well as a filtered response to changes in Mdot, we
          propose that changes in Mdot can explain both movement along
          the Z track and changes in the shape of the Z track. We discuss
          some consequences of this and consider the possibility that the
          branches of the Z will evolve into the branches observed in the
          X-ray color diagrams of the less luminous atoll sources, but
          not in a way that was previously suggested.

          (Abridged) We present the results of the systematic survey of
          X-ray sources in the central region of M31 using the data from
          XMM-Newton observations performed in the years 2000-2004. The
          spectral properties and variability of 123 bright X-ray sources
          with apparent luminosities between ~10^{36} and \~5x10^{38}
          ergs/s were studied in detail. The spectral distribution of M31
          X-ray sources, based on the spectral fitting with a power law
          model is clearly bimodal with a main peak corresponding to a
          photon index Gamma ~ 1.75 and a shoulder at Gamma ~ 2.0-2.2
          extending to the soft spectral region, and shows clear
          evolution with source luminosity. The distribution of absorbing
          columns towards M31 sources derived from spectral analysis has
          a peak at N_H~1.2x10^{21} cm^{-2} extending up to 1.3x10^{22}
          cm^{-2}, with an average value of (1.52 +/- 0.02)x10^{21}
          cm^{-2}. More than 80% of sources observed in two or more
          observations show significant variability on the time scales of
          days to years. About 50% of the sources in our sample are
          spectrally variable. The spectral evolution of a number of
          sources is correlated with the level of their X-ray flux, while
          some sources demonstrate complex patterns of evolution on the
          hardness-intensity diagram. Based on the similarity of the
          properties of M31 X-ray sources and their Galactic
          counterparts, we expect most of the X-ray sources in our sample
          to be accreting binary systems with neutron star and black hole
          primaries. A total of 44 X-ray sources can be identified as
          probable X-ray binaries. Combining the results of X-ray
          analysis with available data at other wavelengths, we classify
          7% and 24% of sources in our sample as, respectively, probable
          black hole and neutron star candidates.

          Observations of the Mercury-Manganese star Phi Herculis with
          the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer (NPOI) conclusively
          reveal the previously unseen companion in this single-lined
          binary system. The NPOI data were used to predict a spectral
          type of A8V for the secondary star Phi Her B. This prediction
          was subsequently confirmed by spectroscopic observations
          obtained at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory. Phi Her B
          is rotating at 50 +/-3 km/sec, in contrast to the 8 km/sec
          lines of Phi Her A. Recognizing the lines from the secondary
          permits one to separate them from those of the primary. The
          abundance analysis of Phi Her A shows an abundance pattern
          similar to those of other HgMn stars with Al being very
          underabundant and Sc, Cr, Mn, Zn, Ga, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, and Hg

          Comments: RMxAA, 21, 227 (4 pages, 2 figures)
          The observational properties of brown dwarfs pose challenges to
          the theory of star formation. Because their mass is much
          smaller than the typical Jeans mass of interstellar clouds,
          brown dwarfs are most likely formed through secondary
          fragmentation processes, rather than through the direct
          collapse of a molecular cloud core. In order to prevent
          substantial post-formation mass accretion, young brown dwarfs
          must leave the high density formation regions in which they
          form. We propose here that brown dwarfs are formed in the
          optically thin outer regions of circumbinary disks. Through
          post-formation dynamical interaction with their host binary
          stars, young brown dwarfs are either scattered to large
          distance or removed, with modest speed, from their cradles.

          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics; Mathematical Physics
          The nonrelativistic standard model for a continuous,
          one-parameter diffusion process is the Wiener process. As
          well-known, the Gaussian transition probability density
          function (PDF) of this process is in conflict with special
          relativity, as it permits particles to propagate at velocities
          larger than the speed of light. A frequently considered
          alternative is provided by the telegraph equation, whose
          solutions avoid superluminal propagation speeds but suffer from
          singular diffusion fronts on the light cone, which are unlikely
          to exist for massive particles. Attempting to avoid such
          singularities, we discuss non-Markovian relativistic
          generalizations of the Wiener process by focussing directly on
          the desired properties of the transition PDFs. This approach
          yields two types of continuous diffusion models for massive
          particles which could be used as a viable alternative to the
          solutions of the telegraph equation.

          Phys. Rev. D
          We study magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects arising in the
          collapse of magnetized, rotating, massive stellar cores to
          proto-neutron stars (PNSs). We perform axisymmetric numerical
          simulations in full general relativity with a hybrid equation
          of state. The formation and early evolution of a PNS are
          followed with a grid of 2500 x 2500 zones, which provides
          better resolution than in previous (Newtonian) studies. We
          confirm that significant differential rotation results even
          when the rotation of the progenitor is initially uniform.
          Consequently, the magnetic field is amplified both by magnetic
          winding and the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Even if
          the magnetic energy E_EM is much smaller than the rotational
          kinetic energy T_rot at the time of PNS formation, the ratio
          E_EM/T_rot increases to 0.1-0.2 by the magnetic winding.
          Following PNS formation, MHD outflows lead to losses of rest
          mass, energy, and angular momentum from the system. The
          earliest outflow is produced primarily by the increasing
          magnetic stress caused by magnetic winding. The MRI amplifies
          the poloidal field and increases the magnetic stress, causing
          further angular momentum transport and helping to drive the
          outflow. After the magnetic field saturates, a nearly
          stationary, collimated magnetic field forms near the rotation
          axis and a Blandford-Payne type outflow develops along the
          field lines. These outflows remove angular momentum from the
          PNS at a rate given by \dot{J} \sim \eta E_EM C_B, where \eta
          is a constant of order 0.1 and C_B is a typical ratio of
          poloidal to toroidal field strength. As a result, the rotation
          period quickly increases for a strongly magnetized PNS until
          the degree of differential rotation decreases. Our simulations
          suggest that rapidly rotating, magnetized PNSs may not give
          rise to rapidly rotating neutron stars.

          Comments: Accepted by ApJL
          The formation of planets is directly linked to the evolution of
          the circumstellar (CS) disk from which they are born. The
          dissipation timescales of CS disks are, therefore, of direct
          astrophysical importance in evaluating the time available for
          planet formation. We employ Spitzer Space Telescope spectra to
          complete the CS disk census for the late-type members of the ~8
          Myr-old eta Chamaeleontis star cluster. Of the 15 K- and M-type
          members, eight show excess emission. We find that the presence
          of a CS disk is anti-correlated with binarity, with all but one
          disk associated with single stars. With nine single stars in
          total, about 80% retain a CS disk. Of the six known or
          suspected close binaries the only CS disk is associated with
          the primary of RECX 9. No circumbinary disks have been
          detected. We also find that stars with disks are slow rotators
          with surface values of specific angular momentum j = 2-15
          j_sun. All high specific angular momentum systems with j =
          20-30 j_sun are confined to the primary stars of binaries. This
          provides novel empirical evidence for rotational disk locking
          and again demonstrates the much shorter disk lifetimes in close
          binary systems compared to single star systems. We estimate the
          characteristic mean disk dissipation timescale to be ~5 Myr and
          ~9 Myr for the binary and single star systems, respectively.

          Journal
          The gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060218 has ~10^5 times lower
          luminosity than typical long GRBs, and is associated with a
          supernova (SN). The radio afterglow displays no jet break, so
          that this burst might arise from a mildly-relativistic
          spherical outflow produced by the SN shock sweeping the stellar
          surface. Since this model is energetically difficult, we
          propose that the radio afterglow is produced by a
          non-relativistic phase of an initially collimated outflow
          (jet). Our jet model is supported by the detection of optical
          linear polarization in the SN component. We also show
          analytically that the jet can penetrate a progenitor star.
          Furthermore, we analyzed the observational data of the prompt
          emission of this burst and obtained the implications that it
          may last longer than 10^6 s, which prefers a neutron star
          engine to a black hole engine. The collimation-corrected event
          rate of such low-luminosity GRBs is ~10 times higher than that
          of typical long GRBs, and they might form a different GRB
          population: low-luminosity GRBs are produced by
          mildly-relativistic jets from neutron stars at the collapses of
          massive stars, while typical long GRBs by highly-relativistic
          jets from black holes. We suggest that the central engine of
          GRB 060218 is a pulsar (or a magnetar) with the initial
          rotation period P_0 ~10 ms and the magnetic field B ~10^{16} G.
          A giant flare from the magnetar might be observed in future.

          Authors: J. Dyks, B. Rudak, Joanna M. Rankin

          Averaged pulse profiles of three nearby pulsars: B1929+10,
          J0437-4715 and B0950+08 exhibit unusual `double notches'. These
          W-like looking features consist of two adjacent V-shaped dips
          that approach each other at increasing observation frequency
          nuobs roughly at a rate sep \propto nuobs^{-1/2}, where sep is
          the separation between the notches' minima. We show that basic
          properties of the notches, namely their W-like look and the
          rate of their converging can be understood within a narrow
          class of models of coherent radio emission from pulsars: the
          free electron maser models based on coherent inverse Compton
          scattering of parallel oscillations of ambient electric field.
          The observed properties of the pulsars imply that the Fourier
          spectrum of the wiggler-like oscillations is narrow and that
          the broad-band character of the radio emission reflects the
          width of the electron energy distribution. Such a model
          provides a natural explanation for the frequency-independent
          separation between the main pulse and interpulse of B0950+08 as
          well as for the lack of radius to frequency mapping in the
          conal-like emission of J0437-4715. The frequency behaviour of
          the main pulse in the profile of the first radio magnetar XTE
          J1810-197 can also be explained within this model.

          Title: Transient pulsar dynamics in hard x-rays: Prognoz 9 and
          GRIF "Mir" space experiments data
          Authors: M. I. Kudryavtsev, S. I. Svertilov, V. V. Bogomolov
          The long-term observations of the Galactic Centre as well as
          the Galactic anti-Centre regions in hard X-rays (10-300 keV)
          were made in experiments on board Prognoz-9 satellite and "Mir"
          orbital station (GRIF experiment). Some transient pulsars
          including A0535+262, GS1722-36, 4U1145-619, A1118-615,
          EXO2030+37, Sct X-1, SAX J2103.5+4545, IGR 16320-4751, IGR
          16465-4507 were observed. The pulsation flux components of
          A0535+26 and GS1722-36 X-ray emission were revealed at
          significant level. For other observed pulsars the upper limits
          of pulsation intensity were obtained. The mean pulsation
          profiles of A0535+26 in different energy ranges as well as the
          energy spectra were obtained at different stages of outburst
          decreasing. The pulsation intensity-period behavior does not
          contradict the well-known correlation between spin-up rate and
          X-ray flux, while the stable character of the energy spectrum
          power index indicates on the absence of thermal component. The
          energy spectrum and mean pulsation profiles were also obtained
          for one time interval of GS1722-36 observations. The upper
          limits of pulsation fluxes obtained for other observed
          transient pulsars at the orbital phases more than 0.14
          correspond the quiescent state or final stage of the first type
          outburst.

          Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient displaying periodic outbursts

          The hard X-ray source IGRJ11215-5952, discovered with INTEGRAL
          during a brief outburst in 2005, has been proposed as a new
          member of the class of Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients.
          Analysing archival INTEGRAL observations of the source field,we
          have discovered two previously unnoticed outbursts (in July
          2003 and in May 2004),spaced by intervals of ~330 days,
          suggesting a possible orbital period.The 5-100keV spectrum is
          well described by a cut-off power law, with a photon index of
          0.5, and a cut-off energy 15-20keV, typical of High Mass X-ray
          Binaries containing a neutron star. The luminosity is
          ~3E36erg/s assuming 6.2kpc, the distance of the likely optical
          counterpart, the blue supergiant HD306414.A fourth outburst was
          discovered in 2006 with XTE/PCA, 329 days after the third one,
          confirming the periodic nature of the source
          outbursts.Follow-up observations with Swift/XRT refined the
          source position and confirmed the association with HD306414.The
          5-100keV spectrum, the recurrent nature of the outbursts, the
          blue supergiant companion star HD 306414, support the
          hypothesis that IGRJ11215-5952 is a Supergiant Fast X-ray
          Transient, and it is the first object of this class of High
          Mass X-ray Binaries displaying periodic outbursts.

          The X-ray burster 4U1850-087, located in the globular cluster
          NGC6712, is an ultracompact binary likely harbouring a
          degenerate companion.The source has been observed with INTEGRAL
          several times, during the monitoring of the Galactic plane,
          with an unprecedented exposure time. The broad-band spectrum
          (2-100 keV; INTEGRAL together with a quasi-simultaneous
          XMM-Newton observation) is well described with a disk-blackbody
          emission (kTin=0.8keV) together with a power-law (photon index
          of 2). We report here the first detection of hard X-ray
          emission from this source above 50 keV. A lower limit on the
          presence of a high energy cut-off can be placed at Ec>100keV.

          Title: Accretion by Isolated Neutron Stars
          Authors: N.R. Ikhsanov
          Comments: 3 pages, to appear in Astrophysics and Space Science,
          in the proceedings of "Isolated Neutron Stars: from the
          Interior to the Surface", edited by D. Page, R. Turolla and S.
          Zane
          Accretion of interstellar material by an isolated neutron star
          is discussed. The point I address here is the interaction
          between the accretion flow and the stellar magnetosphere. I
          show that the interchange instabilities of the magnetospheric
          boundary under the conditions of interest are basically
          suppressed. The entry of the material into the magnetosphere is
          governed by diffusion. Due to this reason the persistent
          accretion luminosity of isolated neutron stars is limited to <
          4E+26 erg/s. These objects can also appear as X-ray bursters
          with the burst durations of about 30 minutes and repetition
          time of about 1E+5 yr. This indicates that the number of the
          accreting isolated neutron stars which could be observed with
          recent and modern X-ray missions is a few orders of magnitude
          smaller than that previously estimated.

          tables
          We report on a three year spectroscopic monitoring program of
          the H-alpha emission in the massive X-ray binary LS I +65 010 =
          2S 0114+650, which consists of a B-supergiant and a slowly
          rotating X-ray pulsar. We present revised orbital elements that
          yield a period of P=11.5983 +/- 0.0006 d and confirm that the
          orbit has a non-zero eccentricity e=0.18 +/- 0.05. The H-alpha
          emission profile is formed in the base of the wind of the
          B-supergiant primary, and we show how this spectral feature
          varies on timescales that are probably related to the
          rotational period of the B-supergiant. We also examine the
          X-ray fluxes from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer All-Sky
          Monitor instrument, and we show that the X-ray orbital light
          curve has a maximum at periastron and a minimum at the inferior
          conjunction of the B-supergiant. We also show that the wind
          emission strength and the high energy X-ray flux appear to vary
          in tandem on timescales of approximately a year.

          We report on the X-ray aperiodic timing analysis of two
          accreting millisecond pulsars: XTE J1807-294 and IGR
          J00291+5934. On the one hand, we discovered in XTE J1807-294
          seven pairs of simultaneous kilohertz quasi-periodic
          oscillations (kHz QPOs) separated in frequency by nearly the
          spin frequency of the neutron star. This confirms the suspected
          dichotomy in the frequency separation of kHz QPOs: sometimes
          once and sometimes half the spin frequency. On the other hand,
          we found an extreme behavior in the power spectra of IGR
          J00291+5934: very strong variability at very low frequencies.
          Namely, the fractional amplitude of the variability was ~50%,
          the highest value found so far in a neutron star system.

          Title: Binary black hole spectroscopy
          Authors: Chris Van Den Broeck, Anand Sengupta
          Comments: 25 pages, many figures
          We investigate the effects on parameter estimation of including
          amplitude corrections to post-Newtonian (PN) gravitational
          waveforms for the quasi-circular, adiabatic inspiral of binary
          compact objects. The amplitude-corrected waveforms are
          superpositions of harmonics of the orbital phase. Their
          performance is compared with that of the restricted PN
          waveforms, which only have the dominant harmonic at twice the
          orbital phase, with no amplitude corrections. For concreteness
          we consider parameter estimation in the covariance matrix
          formalism for Advanced LIGO as well as a possible
          third-generation detector tentatively called EGO. We use the
          stationary phase approximation to the Fourier transform of
          waveforms at 2.5PN order in amplitude and in phase, with
          inclusion of spin-related contributions to the phasing up to
          2PN order. It is found that the use of such high-order
          amplitude-corrected waveforms leads to a dramatic improvement
          in the quality of parameter estimation. With restricted
          waveforms the errors are steep functions of the total mass of
          the binary, and accurate parameter extraction is only possible
          for relatively light stellar mass binaries. By contrast, at
          distances of $\sim 100$ Mpc the amplitude-corrected waveforms
          allow for high-accuracy parameter extraction for total masses
          up to several hundred solar masses. Other qualitative
          advantages include the measurability of individual component
          masses (which are poorly determined with restricted waveforms),
          and the possibility of finding objects whose spin exceeds the
          Kerr bound.

          Authors: Alessandro Nagar, Olindo Zanotti, Jose A. Font,
          Luciano Rezzolla
          Comments: 15 pages, 12 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. D
          By combining the numerical solution of the nonlinear
          hydrodynamics equations with the solution of the linear
          inhomogeneous Zerilli-Moncrief and Regge-Wheeler equations we
          investigate the properties of the gravitational radiation
          emitted during the axisymmetric accretion of matter onto a
          Schwarzschild black hole. The matter models considered include
          quadrupolar dust shells and thick accretion disks, permitting
          us to simulate situations which may be encountered at the end
          stages of stellar gravitational collapse or binary neutron star
          merger. We focus on the interference pattern appearing in the
          energy spectra of the emitted gravitational waves and on the
          amount of excitation of the quasi-normal modes of the accreting
          black hole. We show that, quite generically in the presence of
          accretion, the black hole ringdown is not a simple
          superposition of quasi-normal modes, although the fundamental
          mode is usually present and often dominates the
          gravitational-wave signal. We interpret this as due to
          backscattering of waves off the non-exponentially decaying part
          of the black-hole potential and to the finite spatial extension
          of the accreting matter. Our results suggest that the
          black-hole QNM contributions to the full gravitational-wave
          signal should be extremely small and possibly not detectable in
          generic astrophysical scenarios involving the accretion of
          extended distributions of matter.

          Title: The Effects of Finite Emission Height in Precision
          Pulsar Timing
          Authors: Caroline D'Angelo (1,2), Roman R. Rafikov (3) ((1)
          University of Toronto, (2) MPA, (3) CITA)
          Comments: 12 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review D
          Precision timing is the key ingredient of ongoing pulsar-based
          gravitational wave searches and tests of general relativity
          using binary pulsars. The conventional approach to timing
          explicitly assumes that the radio emitting region is located at
          the center of the pulsar, while polarimetric observations
          suggest that radio emission is in fact produced at altitudes
          ranging from tens to thousands of kilometers above the neutron
          star surface. Here we present a calculation of the effects of
          finite emission height on the timing of binary pulsars using a
          simple model for the emitting region geometry. Finite height of
          emission changes the propagation path of radio photons through
          the binary and gives rise to a large spin velocity of the
          emission region co-rotating with the neutron star. Under
          favorable conditions these two effects introduce corrections to
          the conventional time delays at the microsecond level (for a
          millisecond pulsar in a double neutron star binary with a
          period of several hours and assuming the emission height of 100
          km). Exploiting the dependence of the emission height on
          frequency (radius-to-frequency mapping) and using
          multi-frequency observations one should be able to detect these
          timing corrections even though they are formally degenerate
          with conventional time delays. Although even in the most
          accurately timed systems the magnitude of the finite emission
          height effects is currently somewhat below timing precision,
          longer-term observations and future facilities like SKA will
          make measurement of these effects possible, providing an
          independent check of existing emission height estimates.

          Title: Evolution of Close White Dwarf Binaries
          Authors: Vayujeet Gokhale, Xiao Meng Peng, Juhan Frank
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          We describe the evolution of double degenerate binary systems,
          consisting of components obeying the zero temperature mass
          radius relationship for white dwarf stars, from the onset of
          mass transfer to one of several possible outcomes including
          merger, tidal disruption of the donor, or survival as a
          semi-detached AM CVn system. We use a combination of analytic
          solutions and numerical integrations of the standard
          orbit-averaged first-order evolution equations, including
          direct impact accretion and the evolution of the components due
          to mass exchange. We include also the effects of mass-loss
          during super-critical (super-Eddington) mass transfer and the
          tidal and advective exchanges of angular momentum between the
          binary components. We cover much the same ground as Marsh et
          al.(2004) with the additional effects of the advective or
          consequential angular momentum from the donor and its tidal
          coupling to the orbit which is expected to be stronger than
          that of the accretor. With the caveat that our formalism does
          not include an explicit treatment of common envelope phases,
          our results suggest that a larger fraction of detached double
          white dwarfs than what has been hitherto assumed, survive the
          onset of mass transfer, even if this mass transfer is initially
          unstable and rises to super-Eddington levels. In addition, as a
          consequence of the tidal coupling, systems that come into
          contact near the mass transfer instability boundary undergo a
          phase of oscillation cycles in their orbital period (and other
          system parameters). Much of the formalism developed here would
          also apply to other mass-transferring binaries, and in
          particular to cataclysmic variables and Algol systems.

          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures
          We consider the stochastic background of gravitational waves
          produced by a network of cosmic strings and assess their
          accessibility to current and planned gravitational wave
          detectors, as well as to the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN),
          cosmic microwave background (CMB), and pulsar timing
          constraints. We find that current data from interferometric
          gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO, are sensitive to
          areas of parameter space of cosmic string models complementary
          to those accessible to pulsar, BBN, and CMB bounds. Future more
          sensitive LIGO runs and interferometers such as Advanced LIGO
          and LISA will be able to explore substantial parts of the
          parameter space.

          In the last decade, over 7000 eclipsing binaries have been
          discovered in the Local Group through various variability
          surveys. Measuring fundamental parameters of these eclipsing
          binaries has become feasible with 8 meter class telescopes,
          making it possible to use eclipsing binaries as distance
          indicators. Distances with eclipsing binaries provide an
          independent method for calibrating the extragalactic distance
          scale and thus determining the Hubble constant. This method has
          been used for determining distances to eclipsing binaries in
          the Magellanic Clouds and the Andromeda Galaxy and most
          recently to a detached eclipsing binary in the Triangulum
          Galaxy by the DIRECT Project. The increasing number of
          eclipsing binaries found by microlensing and variability
          surveys also provide a rich database for advancing our
          understanding of star formation and evolution.

          Here we report the discovery of very high energy gamma-ray
          emission from the radio emitting X-ray binary LS I +61 303 with
          the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC)
          telescope. This high energy emission has been found to be
          variable, detected 4 days after the periastron passage and
          lasting for several days. The data have been taken along
          different orbital cycles, and the fact that the detections
          occur at similar orbital phases, suggests that the emission is
          periodic. Two different scenarios have been involved to explain
          this high energy emission: the microquasar scenario where the
          gamma-rays are produced in a radio-emitting jet; or the pulsar
          binary scenario, where they are produced in the shock which is
          generated by the interaction of a pulsar wind and the wind of
          the massive companion.

          Title: The Modified Restricted Three Body Problems
          Authors: Ing-Guey Jiang (1), Li-Chin Yeh (2) ((1)National

          The restricted three body problem is well-known and very
          important for dynamics of binary, multiple stars and also
          planetary systems. We extend the classical version of this
          problem to the situation that there are some external forces
          from the belt. We find that both the equilibrium points and
          solution curves become quite different from the classical case.
          We also determine the values of Lyapunov Exponent for some
          important orbits.

          Title: Simultaneous Single-Pulse Observations of Radio Pulsars:
          V. On the Broadband Nature of The Pulse Nulling Phenomenon in
          PSR B1133+16
          Authors: N. D. R. Bhat, Y. Gupta, M. Kramer, A. Karastergiou,
          A. G. Lyne, S. Johnston
          Comments: 12 pages, 13 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A
          We revisit the phenomenon of pulse nulling using high-quality
          single-pulse data of PSR B1133+16 from simultaneous
          multifrequency observations. Observations were made at 325,
          610, 1400 and 4850 MHz as part of a joint program between the
          European Pulsar Network and the Giant Metrewave Radio
          Telescope. The pulse energy time series are analysed to derive
          improved statistics of nulling pulses as well as to investigate
          the frequency dependence of the phenomenon. The pulsar is
          observed to be in null state for approximately 15% of the time;
          however, we find that nulling does not always occur
          simultaneously at all four frequencies of observation. We
          characterise this "selective nulling'' as a function of
          frequency, separation in frequency, and combination of
          frequencies. The most remarkable case is a significantly large
          number of nulls ($\approx$6%) at lower frequencies, that are
          marked by the presence of a fairly narrow emission feature at
          the highest frequency of 4850 MHz. We refer to these as "low
          frequency (LF) nulls." Our analysis shows that this high
          frequency emission tends to occur preferentially over a narrow
          range in longitude and with pulse widths typically of the order
          of a few milliseconds. We discuss the implications of our
          results for the pulsar emission mechanism in general and for
          the broadbandness of nulling phenomenon in particular. Our
          results signify the presence of an additional process of
          emission which does not turn off when the pulsar nulls at low
          frequencies, and becomes more prominent at higher frequencies.
          Our analysis also hints at a possible outer gap origin for this
          new population of pulses, and thus a likely connection to some
          high-energy emission processes that occur in the outer parts of
          the pulsar magnetosphere.

          We report on 10 yr of monitoring of the 8.7-s Anomalous X-ray
          Pulsar 4U 0142+61 using the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE).
          This pulsar exhibited stable rotation from 2000 until February
          2006: the RMS phase residual for a spin-down model which
          includes nu, nudot, and nuddot is 2.3%. We report a possible
          phase-coherent timing solution valid over a 10-yr span
          extending back to March 1996. A glitch may have occured between
          1998 and 2000, but it is not required by the existing data. We
          also report that the source's pulse profile has been evolving
          in the past 6 years, such that the dip of emission between its
          two peaks has been getting shallower since 2000, almost as if
          the profile is recovering to its pre-2000 morphology, in which
          there was no clear distinction between the peaks. These profile
          variations are seen in the 2-4 keV band but not in 6-8 keV.
          Finally, we present the pulsed flux time series of the source
          in 2-10 keV. There is evidence of a slow but steady increase in
          the source's pulsed flux since 2000. The pulsed flux
          variability and the narrow-band pulse profile changes present
          interesting challenges to aspects of the magnetar model.

          Title: Direct constraint on the distance of y2 Velorum from
          AMBER/VLTI observations
          Authors: F. Millour, et al
          In this work, we present the first AMBER observations, of the
          Wolf-Rayet and O (WR+O) star binary system y2 Velorum. The
          AMBER instrument was used with the telescopes UT2, UT3, and UT4
          on baselines ranging from 46m to 85m. It delivered spectrally
          dispersed visibilities, as well as differential and closure
          phases, with a resolution R = 1500 in the spectral band
          1.95-2.17 micron. We interpret these data in the context of a
          binary system with unresolved components, neglecting in a first
          approximation the wind-wind collision zone flux contribution.
          We show that the AMBER observables result primarily from the
          contribution of the individual components of the WR+O binary
          system. We discuss several interpretations of the residuals,
          and speculate on the detection of an additional continuum
          component, originating from the free-free emission associated
          with the wind-wind collision zone (WWCZ), and contributing at
          most to the observed K-band flux at the 5% level. The expected
          absolute separation and position angle at the time of
          observations were 5.1&plusmn;0.9mas and 66&plusmn;15&deg;
          respectively. However, we infer a separation of 3.62+0.11-0.30
          mas and a position angle of 73+9-11&deg;. Our analysis thus
          implies that the binary system lies at a distance of 368+38-13
          pc, in agreement with recent spectrophotometric estimates, but
          significantly larger than the Hipparcos value of 258+41-31 pc.

          Title: Calibration of the pre-main sequence RS Cha binary
          system
          Authors: E. Alecian, M.-J. Goupil, Y. Lebreton, M.-A. Dupret,
          C. Catala
          Comments: 9 pages, 10 figures, accepted by Astronomy &
          Astrophysics
          Context: The calibration of binary systems with accurately
          known masses and/or radii provides powerful tools to test
          stellar structure and evolution theory and to determine the age
          and helium content of stars. We study the eclipsing
          double-lined spectroscopic binary system RS Cha, for which we
          have accurate observations of the parameters of both stars
          (masses, radii, luminosities, effective temperatures and
          metallicity). Aims: We have calculated several sets of stellar
          models for the components of the RS Cha system, with the aim of
          reproducing simultaneously the available observational
          constraints and to estimate the age and initial helium
          abundance of the system. Methods: Using the CESAM stellar
          evolution code, we model both components starting from the
          initial mass and metallicity and adjusting the input parameters
          and physics in order to satisfy the observational constraints.
          Results: We find that the observations cannot be reproduced if
          we assume that the abundance ratios are solar but they are
          satisfied if carbon and nitrogen are depleted in the RS Cha
          system with respect to the Sun. This is in accordance with the
          abundances observed in other young stars. The RS Cha system is
          in an evolutionary stage at the end of the PMS phase where
          models are not strongly sensitive to various physical
          uncertainties. However we show that the oscillations of these
          two stars, which have been detected, would be able to
          discriminate between different options in the physical
          description of this evolutionary phase.

          Astrophysics" (Prague, 22-25 August 2006), Bill Hartkopf, Ed
          Guinan & Petr Harmanec, eds
          Wide binaries, particularly in large numbers and as free from
          selection biases as possible, constitute a largely overlooked
          tool for studying the Galaxy. The goal of this review is to
          highlight the potential inherent to large samples of field wide
          binaries for research on problems as varied as star formation
          in the early Galaxy, the nature of halo dark matter, the
          evolution of the stellar halo, new geometric distances,
          metallicities, masses, and ages of field stars and white
          dwarfs, and much more. Using the Revised NLTT as an
          illustrative example, I review the main steps in the assembly
          of a large catalog of wide binaries useful for multiple
          applications. The capability of cleanly separating between the
          Galactic disk and halo populations using good colors and proper
          motions is emphasized. The critical role of large surveys for
          research on wide binaries as well as for the better
          understanding of the Galaxy in general is stressed throughout.
          Finally, I point out the potential for assembling new samples
          of wide binaries from available proper-motion surveys, and
          report on current efforts of using the SDSS towards this goal.

          Title: Internal heating and thermal emission from old neutron
          stars: Constraints on dense-matter and gravitational physics
          Authors: Andreas Reisenegger, Rodrigo Fernandez, Paula Jofre
          Comments: 6 pages, 7 figures. To appear in the proceedings of
          "Isolated Neutron Stars: from the Interior to the Surface", a
          conference held in London in April 2006 (special issue of
          Astrophysics and Space Science, edited by Dany Page, Roberto
          Turolla, & Silvia Zane)
          The equilibrium composition of neutron star matter is achieved
          through weak interactions (direct and inverse beta decays),
          which proceed on relatively long time scales. If the density of
          a matter element is perturbed, it will relax to the new
          chemical equilibrium through non-equilibrium reactions, which
          produce entropy that is partly released through neutrino
          emission, while a similar fraction heats the matter and is
          eventually radiated as thermal photons. We examined two
          possible mechanisms causing such density perturbations: 1) the
          reduction in centrifugal force caused by spin-down
          (particularly in millisecond pulsars), leading to "rotochemical
          heating", and 2) a hypothetical time-variation of the
          gravitational constant, as predicted by some theories of
          gravity and current cosmological models, leading to
          "gravitochemical heating". If only slow weak interactions are
          allowed in the neutron star (modified Urca reactions, with or
          without Cooper pairing), rotochemical heating can account for
          the observed ultraviolet emission from the closest millisecond
          pulsar, PSR J0437-4715, which also provides a constraint on
          |dG/dt| of the same order as the best available in the
          literature.

          black-hole binary inspiral

          Mark Hannam, Sascha Husa
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures
          When unequal-mass black holes merge, the final black hole
          receives a ``kick'' due to the asymmetric loss of linear
          momentum in the gravitational radiation emitted during the
          merger. The magnitude of this kick has important astrophysical
          consequences. Recent breakthroughs in numerical relativity
          allow us to perform the largest parameter study undertaken to
          date in numerical simulations of binary black hole inspirals.
          We study non-spinning black-hole binaries with mass ratios from
          $q=M_1/M_2=1$ to $q =0.25$ ($\eta = q/(1 + q)^2$ from 0.25 to
          0.16). We accurately calculate the velocity of the kick to
          within 6\%, and the final spin of the black holes to within
          2\%. A maximum kick of $175.70\pm11$ km\,s$^{-1}$ is achieved
          for a mass ratio of $\eta = 0.195 \pm 0.005$.

          Strong (B >> 10^9 G) and superstrong (B > 10^{14} G) magnetic
          fields profoundly affect many thermodynamic and kinetic
          characteristics of dense plasmas in neutron star envelopes. In
          particular, they produce strongly anisotropic thermal
          conductivity in the neutron star crust and modify the equation
          of state and radiative opacities in the atmosphere, which are
          major ingredients of the cooling theory and spectral atmosphere
          models. As a result, both the radiation spectrum and the
          thermal luminosity of a neutron star can be affected by the
          magnetic field. We briefly review these effects and demonstrate
          the influence of magnetic field strength on the thermal
          structure of an isolated neutron star, putting emphasis on the
          differences brought about by the superstrong fields and high
          temperatures of magnetars. For the latter objects, it is
          important to take proper account of a combined effect of the
          magnetic field on thermal conduction and neutrino emission at
          densities \rho > 10^{10} g cm^{-3}. We show that the neutrino
          emission puts a B-dependent upper limit on the effective
          surface temperature of a cooling neutron star.

          The pulse profile of pulsar gives geometric information about
          pulsar's radiation model. After investigating the pulse
          profiles of PSR B1642-03 and PSR B0950+08, we calculate the
          ratios of beam width and the emission height between different
          frequencies. We find that the ratios are almost constants as
          inclination angle $\alpha$ changes from $0^{\circ}$ to
          $90^{\circ}$. The ratios can be used to test pulsar's radiation
          model. In particular it can well constrain the parameter space
          of the inverse Compton scattering (ICS) model. These
          constrained parameters indicate some physical implication for
          the ICS model.

          Comments: 10 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Advances in Space
          Research" (Proceedings of COSPAR 2006)
          As a result of observational difficulties, braking indices of
          only six rotation-powered pulsars are obtained with certainty,
          all of which are remarkably smaller than the value ($n=3$)
          expected for pure magnetodipole radiation model. This is still
          a real fundamental question not being well answered after
          nearly forty years of the discovery of pulsar. The main problem
          is that we are shamefully not sure about the dominant
          mechanisms that result in pulsars' spin-down. Based on the
          previous works, the braking index is re-examined, with a
          conclusion of suggesting a constant gap potential drop for
          pulsars with magnetospheric activities. New constrains on model
          parameters from observed braking indices are presented.

          we consider here is found to be valid in the entire range of
          the argument.

          Comments: to appear in Proc. IAU Symp. 238, "Black Holes: from
          stars to galaxies - across the range of masses"
          We examine the possibility that Ultraluminous X-ray sources
          (ULXs) represent the extreme end of the black hole X-ray binary
          (XRB) population. Based on their X-ray properties, we suggest
          that ULXs are persistently in a high/hard spectral state and we
          propose a new disk-jet model that can accomodate both a high
          accretion rate and a hard X-ray spectrum. Our model predicts
          that the modified disk emission can be substantially softer
          than that predicted by a standard disk as a result of jet
          cooling and this may explain the unusually soft components that
          are sometimes present in the spectra of bright ULXs. We also
          show that relativistic beaming of jet emission can indeed
          account for the high X-ray luminosities of ULXs, but strong
          beaming produces hard X-ray spectra that are inconsistent with
          observations. We predict the beamed synchrotron radio emission
          should have a flat spectrum with a flux density < 0.01 mJy.

          Title: "High-field" pulsars torqued by accretion disk?
          Authors: Y. L. Yue, W. W. Zhu, R. X. Xu
          Comments: 6 pages, 1 figures, submitted to "Advances in Space
          Research" (Proceedings of COSPAR 2006)
          The nature of AXPs/SGRs (anomalous X-ray pulsars/soft
          $\gamma$-ray repeaters) and high field radio pulsars is still
          unclear even in the magnetar and/or accretion models. The
          detection of radio emission from AXP XTE J1810$-$197 and the
          discovery of a debris disk around AXP 4U 0142+61 might shed
          light on the problem. We propose that AXPs/SGRs could be
          pulsars that have magnetic field $B\lesssim 10^{13} \mathrm{G}$
          as normal pulsars, but in accretion environments. We
          investigate these issues under the accretion model and find
          that two of the AXPs/SGRs might be low mass quark stars if all
          AXPs and SGRs are likely grouped together.

          Title: Common Envelope Evolution

          life with stars," a conference in honor of Ed van den Heuvel's
          60th birthday, New Ast. Rev
          The common envelope phase of binary star evolution plays a
          central role in many evolutionary pathways leading to the
          formation of compact objects in short period systems. Using
          three dimensional hydrodynamical computations, we review the
          major features of this evolutionary phase, focusing on the
          conditions that lead to the successful ejection of the envelope
          and, hence, survival of the system as a post common envelope
          binary. Future hydrodynamical calculations at high spatial
          resolution are required to delineate the regime in parameter
          space for which systems survive as compact binary systems from
          those for which the two components of the system merge into a
          single rapidly rotating star. Recent algorithmic developments
          will facilitate the attainment of this goal.

          Title: Relativistic neutron star merger simulations with
          non-zero temperature equations of state I. Variation of binary
          parameters and equation of state
          Authors: R. Oechslin, H.-T. Janka, A. Marek (MPA Garching)
          Comments: 18 pages, 15 figures, submitted to Astronomy &
          Astrophysics
          An extended set of binary neutron star (NS) merger simulations
          is performed with an approximative conformally flat treatment
          of general relativity to systematically investigate the
          influence of the nuclear equation of state (EoS), the neutron
          star masses, and the NS spin states prior to merging. We employ
          the two non-zero temperature EoSs of Shen et al. (1998a,b) and
          Lattimer & Swesty (1991). In addition, we use the cold EoS of
          Akmal et al. (1998) with a simple ideal-gas-like extension
          according to Shibata & Taniguchi (2006), and an ideal-gas EoS
          with parameters fitted to the supernuclear part of the
          Shen-EoS. We estimate the mass sitting in a dilute high-angular
          momentum ``torus'' around the future black hole (BH). The
          dynamics and outcome of the models is found to depend strongly
          on the EoS and on the binary parameters. Larger torus masses
          are found for asymmetric systems (up to ~0.3 M_sun for a mass
          ratio of 0.55), for large initial NSs, and for a NS spin state
          which corresponds to a larger total angular momentum. We find
          that the postmerger remnant collapses either immediately or
          after a short time when employing the soft EoS of Lattimer&
          Swesty, whereas no sign of post-merging collapse is found
          within tens of dynamical timescales for all other EoSs used.
          The typical temperatures in the torus are found to be about
          3-10 MeV depending on the strength of the shear motion at the
          collision interface between the NSs and thus depending on the
          initial NS spins. About 10^{-3}-10^{-2} M_sun of NS matter
          become gravitationally unbound during or right after the
          merging process. This matter consists of a hot/high-entropy
          component from the collision interface and (only in case of
          asymmetric systems) of a cool/low-entropy component from the
          spiral arm tips. (abridged)

          We present results from the first successful open call e-VLBI
          science run, observing the X-ray binary GRS 1915+105. e-VLBI
          science allows the rapid production of VLBI radio maps, within
          hours of an observation rather than weeks, facilitating a
          decision for follow-up observations. A total of 6 telescopes
          observing at 5 GHz across the European VLBI Network (EVN) were
          correlated in real time at the Joint Institute for VLBI in
          Europe (JIVE). Constant data rates of 128 Mbps were transferred
          from each telescope, giving 4 TB of raw sampled data over the
          12 hours of the whole experiment. Throughout this, GRS 1915+105
          was observed for a total of 5.5 hours, producing 2.8 GB of
          visibilities of correlated data. A weak flare occurred during
          our observations, and we detected a slightly resolved component
          of 2.7 x 1.2 milliarcsecond with a position angle of 140 (+/-2)
          degrees. The peak brightness was 10.2 mJy per beam, with a
          total integrated radio flux of 11.1 mJy.

          Title: The first detection of Compton Reflection in the

          Authors: Mariateresa Fiocchi, Angela Bazzano, Pietro Ubertini,
          Andrzej A. Zdziarski
          Comments: accepted ApJ
          We present data from INTEGRAL and BeppoSAX satellites showing
          spectral state transitions of the neutron-star, atoll-type,
          low-mass X-ray binary 1705-44. Its energy spectrum can be
          described as the sum of one or two blackbody components, a
          6.4-keV Fe line, and a component due to thermal Comptonization.
          In addition, and for the first time in this source, we find a
          strong signature of Compton reflection, presumably due to
          illumination of the optically-thick accretion disk by the
          Comptonization spectrum. The two blackbody components, which
          the soft-state data require, presumably arise from both the
          disk and the neutron-star surface. The Comptonization probably
          takes place in a hot inner flow irradiated by some of the
          blackbody photons. The spectral transitions are shown to be
          associated with variations in the bolometric luminosity, most
          likely proportional to the accretion rate. Indipendentely from
          the spectral state, we also see changes in the temperature of
          the Comptonizing electrons and the strength of Compton
          reflection.

          Comments: Accepted for publication as a letter in MNRAS
          We report the results of the first two 5 GHz e-VLBI
          observations of the X-ray binary Cygnus X-3 using the European
          VLBI Network. Two successful observing sessions were held, on
          2006 April 20, when the system was in a quasi-quiescent state
          several weeks after a major flare, and on 2006 May 18, a few
          days after another flare. At the first epoch we detected faint
          emission probably associated with a fading jet, spatially
          separated from the X-ray binary. The second epoch in contrast
          reveals a bright, curved, relativistic jet more than 40
          milliarcseconds in extent. In the first, and probably also
          second epochs, the X-ray binary core is not detected, which may
          indicate a temporary suppression of jet production as seen in
          some black hole X-ray binaries in certain X-ray states.
          Spatially resolved polarisation maps at the second epoch
          provide evidence of interaction between the ejecta and the
          surrounding medium. These results clearly demonstrate the
          importance of rapid analysis of long-baseline observations of
          transients, such as facilitated by e-VLBI.

          Accreting black holes and neutron stars release an unknown
          fraction of the infalling particles and energy in the form of
          collimated jets. The jets themselves are radiatively
          inefficient, but their power can be constrained by observing
          their interaction with the surrounding environment. Here we
          present observations of X-ray binary jet-ISM interactions which
          produce optical line emission, using the ESO/MPI 2.2m and Isaac
          Newton Telescopes. We constrain the time-averaged power of the
          Cyg X-1 jet-powered nebula, and present a number of new
          candidate nebulae discovered. Comparisons are made to the large
          scale lobes of extragalactic AGN. We also speculate that some
          emission line emitters close to X-ray binaries in M31 are
          likely to be microquasar jet-powered nebulae.

          Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We present the analysis of the high energy emission of the
          Galactic black hole binary GX 339-4 in a low/hard state at the
          beginning of its 2004 outburst. The data from 273 ks of
          INTEGRAL observations, spread over 4 weeks, are analyzed, along
          with the existing simultaneous RXTE HEXTE and PCA data. During
          this period, the flux increases by a factor of about 3, while
          the spectral shape is quite unchanged, at least up to 150 keV.
          The high energy data allows us to detect the presence of a high
          energy cut-off, generally related to thermal mechanisms, and to
          estimate the plasma parameters in the framework of the
          Comptonization models. We found an electron temperature of
          60-70 keV, an optical depth around 2.5, with a rather low
          reflection factor (0.2-0.4). In the last observation, we
          detected a high energy excess above 200 keV with respect to
          thermal Comptonization while at lower energy, the spectrum is
          practically identical to the previous one, taken just 2 days
          before. This suggests that the low and high energy components
          have a different origin.

          We report on VLBA astrometry and CXO imaging of PSR J0538+2817
          in the supernova remnant S147. We measure a parallax distance
          of $1.47^{+0.42}_{-0.27}$kpc along with a high-precision proper
          motion, giving a transverse velocity
          $V_\perp=400^{+114}_{-73}$km/s. A small extended wind nebula is
          detected around the pulsar; the symmetry axis of this structure
          suggests that the spin axis lies $12\arcdeg\pm4\arcdeg$ from
          the velocity vector (2-D), but the emission is too faint for
          robust model independent statements. The neutron star is hot,
          consistent with the young ~40kyr kinematic age. The pulsar
          progenitor is likely a runaway from a nearby cluster, with NGC
          1960 (M36) a leading candidate.

          (Italy), to be published by AIP
          Neutron stars, with their strong surface gravity, have
          interestingly short timescales for the sedimentation of heavy
          elements. Recent observations of unstable thermonuclear burning
          (observed as X-ray bursts) on the surfaces of slowly accreting
          neutron stars ($< 0.01$ of the Eddington rate) motivate us to
          examine how sedimentation of CNO isotopes affects the ignition
          of these bursts. We further estimate the burst development
          using a simple one-zone model with a full reaction network. We
          report a region of mass accretion rates for weak H flashes.
          Such flashes can lead to a large reservoir of He, the unstable
          burning of which may explain some observed long bursts
          (duration $\sim 1000$ s).

          Comments: 4 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Low-mass white dwarfs can either be produced in low-mass X-ray
          binaries by stable mass transfer to a neutron star, or in a
          common-envelope phase with a heavier white dwarf companion. We
          have searched 8 low-mass white dwarf candidates recently
          identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for radio pulsations
          from pulsar companions, using the Green Bank Telescope at
          340MHz. We have found no pulsations down to flux densities of
          0.6-0.8 mJy/kpc^2 and conclude that a given low-mass
          helium-core white dwarf has a probability of < 0.18+-0.05 of
          being in a binary with a radio pulsar.

          September 26-29, 2006. 11 pages, 12 figures
          High-resolution radio observations have revealed that
          non-thermal radio emission in WR stars arises where the stellar
          wind of the WR star collides with that of a binary companion.
          These colliding-wind binary (CWB) systems offer an important
          laboratory for investigating the underlying physics of particle
          acceleration. Hydrodynamic models of the binary stellar winds
          and the wind-collision region (WCR) that account for the
          evolution of the electron energy spectrum, largely due to
          inverse Compton cooling, are now available. Radiometry and
          imaging obtained with the VLA, MERLIN, EVN and VLBA provide
          essential constraints to these models. Models of the radio
          emission from WR146 and WR147 are shown, though these very wide
          systems do not have defined orbits and hence lack a number of
          important model parameters. Multi-epoch VLBI imaging of the
          archetype WR+O star binary WR140 through a part of its 7.9-year
          orbit has been used to define the orbit inclination, distance
          and the luminosity of the companion star to enable the best
          constraints for any radio emitting CWB system. Models of the
          spatial distribution of relativistic electrons and ions, and
          the magnetic energy density are used to model the radio
          emission, and also to predict the high energy emission at X-ray
          and gamma-ray energies. It is clear that high-energy facilities
          e.g. GLAST and VERITAS, will be important for constraining
          particle acceleration parameters such as the spectral index of
          the energy spectrum and the acceleration efficiency of both
          ions and electrons, and in turn, identify unique models for the
          radio spectra. This will be especially important in future
          attempts to model the spectra of WR140 throughout its complete
          orbit. A WCR origin for the synchrotron emission in O-stars,
          the progenitors of WR stars, is illustrated by observations of
          Cyg OB2 No. 9.

          Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We report on mid-infrared imaging observations of the anomalous
          X-ray pulsars (AXPs) 1E 1048.1-5937, 1RXS J170849-400910, and
          XTE J1810-197. The observations were carried out at 4.5 and 8.0
          microns with the Infrared Array Camera and at 24 microns with
          the Multiband Imaging Photometer on the Spitzer Space
          Telescope. No mid-infrared counterparts were detected. As
          infrared emission from AXPs may be related to their X-ray
          emission either via the magnetosphere or via a dust disk, we
          compare the derived upper limits on the infrared/X-ray flux
          ratios of the AXPs to the same ratio for 4U 0142+61, an AXP
          previously detected in the mid-infrared range. The comparison
          indicates that our three non-detections are consistent with
          their relatively low X-ray fluxes. For XTE J1810-197, our upper
          limits set a constraint on its rising radio/millimeter energy
          spectrum, suggesting a spectral break between 1.5$\times
          10^{11}$--6$\times10^{13}$ Hz.

          of small adiabatic oscillations of relativistic barotropic thin
          accretion disks around black holes (and compact weakly magnetic
          neutron stars). Employing WKB techniques, we obtain the
          eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the modes for different
          values of the mass and angular momentum of the central black
          hole. We discuss the properties of the various types of modes
          and examine the role of viscosity, as it appears to render some
          of the modes unstable to rapid growth.

          Title: Gravitational recoil velocities from eccentric binary
          black hole mergers
          Authors: Carlos F. Sopuerta, Nicolas Yunes, Pablo Laguna
          Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures
          The formation and growth of supermassive black holes is a key
          issue to unveil the secrets of galaxy formation. In particular,
          the gravitational recoil produced in the merger of unequal mass
          black hole binaries could have a number of astrophysical
          implications, such as the ejection of black holes from the host
          galaxy or globular cluster. We present estimates of the recoil
          velocity that include the effect of small eccentricities. The
          approach is specially suited for the last stage of the merger,
          where most of the emission of linear momentum in gravitational
          waves takes place. Supplementing our estimates with
          post-Newtonian approximations, we obtain lower and upper bounds
          that constrain previous recoil velocities estimates as well as
          a best estimate that agrees with numerical simulations in the
          quasi-circular case. For eccentricities e <= 0.1, the maximum
          recoil is found for mass ratios of M_1/M_2 ~ 0.38 with a best
          estimate of ~ 167 (1 + e) km/s and upper and lower bounds of 79
          (1 + e) km/s and 216 (1 + e) km/s respectively.

          eds. D.Page, S.Zane, R.Turolla
          The properties of superdense matter in neutron star (NS) cores
          control NS thermal states by affecting the efficiency of
          neutrino emission from NS interiors. To probe these properties
          we confront the theory of thermal evolution of NSs with
          observations of their thermal radiation. Our observational
          basis includes cooling isolated NSs (INSs) and NSs in quiescent
          states of soft X-ray transients (SXTs). We find that the data
          on SXTs support the conclusions obtained from the analysis of
          INSs: strong proton superfluidity with T_{cp,max} >= 10^9 K
          should be present, while mild neutron superfluidity with
          T_{cn,max} =(2*10^8 -- 2*10^9) K is ruled out in the outer NS
          core. Here T_{cn,max} and T_{cp,max} are the maximum values of
          the density dependent critical temperatures of neutrons and
          protons. The data on SXTs suggest also that: (i) cooling of
          massive NSs is enhanced by neutrino emission more powerful than
          the emission due to Cooper pairing of neutrons; (ii) mild
          neutron superfluidity, if available, might be present only in
          inner cores of massive NSs. In the latter case SXTs would
          exhibit dichotomy, i.e. very similar SXTs may evolve to very
          different thermal states.

          Title: Fall-back crust around a quark-nova compact remnant II:
          The degenerate torus case with applications to AXPs
          Authors: Rachid Ouyed, Denis Leahy, Brian Niebergal
          Comments: submitted to ApJ
          In the first paper of this series we explored the case where a
          quark-nova ejecta forms a degenerate shell, supported by the
          star's magnetic field. Herein, we consider the case where the
          ejecta has sufficient angular momentum to form a Keplerian
          torus, and we show that the density and temperature of the
          torus are such that it will remain degenerate throughout it's
          lifetime. We go on to discuss the evolution of such a torus and
          apply it to two AXPs, namely 1E2259$+$586 and 4U0142$+$615. As
          it turns out, using our model we can account for many of the
          observations of these objects including the quiescent phase
          luminosity, and blackbody temperatures during quiescence and
          bursting phases. Furthermore, for 1E2259$+$586 our model
          explains the steep and slow decay components seen in the burst
          lightcurve, as well as the rotation period glitches and
          enhanced spin-down rate. We also estimate the mass of the
          degenerate torus to be of the order of $10^{-6}M_{\odot}$, and
          speculate that the observed optical/infrared emission from
          4U0142$+$615 might be a signature of the thin degenerate torus
          we describe here.

          be published by AIP
          We review the main properties of solar metallicity massive
          stars in the range 11-120 Msun. The influence of the mass loss
          on the hydrostatic burning stages as well as the final
          explosion is discussed in some detail. We find that the minimum
          masses that enter the WNL, WNE and WC stages are 30 Msun, 35
          Msun and 40 Msun respectively; the limiting mass between stars
          exploding as SNII and SNIb/c is between 30 and 35 Msun; the
          limiting mass between stars forming neutron stars and black
          holes after the explosion is between 25-30 Msun. We also
          discuss the properties of the chemical yields integrated over a
          Salpeter IMF and we find that stars with M>=35 Msun contribute
          for ~60% to the production of C, N and for ~40% to the
          production Sc and s-process elements up to Zr, while they do
          not produce any intermediate mass element because of the large
          remnant masses

          strongly-magnetized neutron stars
          Authors: Kaya Mori (1,2), Wynn C.G. Ho (3,4) ((1) University of
          Toronto, (2) CITA, (3) Harvard-Smithsonian CfA, (4) MIT)
          Comments: 16 pages, 23 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We construct models for strongly-magnetized neutron star
          atmospheres composed of mid-Z elements (carbon, oxygen and
          neon) with magnetic fields B=10^{12}-10^{13} G and effective
          temperatures Teff=(1-5)*10^6 K; this is done by first
          addressing the physics relevant to strongly-magnetized plasmas
          and calculating the equation of state and
          polarization-dependent opacities. We then obtain the atmosphere
          structure and spectrum by solving the radiative transfer
          equations in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium. In contrast
          to hydrogen opacities at the relevant temperatures, mid-Z
          element opacities are dominated by numerous bound-bound and
          bound-free transitions. Consequently, temperature profiles are
          closer to grey profiles, and photosphere densities are lower
          than in the hydrogen case. Mid-Z element atmosphere spectra are
          significantly softer than hydrogen atmosphere spectra and show
          numerous absorption lines and edges. The atmosphere spectra
          depend strongly on surface composition and magnetic field but
          weakly on surface gravity. Absorption lines are primarily
          broadened by motional Stark effects and the (unknown) surface
          magnetic field distribution. Given the multiple absorption
          features observed from several isolated neutron stars, it is
          possible to determine, with existing X-ray data, the surface
          composition, magnetic field, temperature, and gravitational
          redshift; we present qualitative comparisons between our model
          spectra and the neutron stars 1E1207.4-5209 and RX
          J1605.3+3249. Future high-resolution X-ray missions such as
          Constellation-X will measure the gravitational redshift with
          high accuracy by resolving narrow absorption features, and when
          combined with radius measurements, it will be possible to
          uniquely determine the mass and radius of isolated neutron
          stars. (Abridged)

          Turolla and D. Page
          For the first time a quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength
          campaign has been performed on an Anomalous X-ray Pulsar from
          the radio to the hard X-ray band. 4U 0142+61 was an INTEGRAL
          target for 1 Ms in July 2005. During these observations it was
          also observed in the X-ray band with Swift and RXTE, in the
          optical and NIR with Gemini North and in the radio with the
          WSRT. In this paper we present the source-energy distribution.
          The spectral results obtained in the individual wave bands do
          not connect smoothly; apparently components of different origin
          contribute to the total spectrum. Remarkable is that the
          INTEGRAL hard X-ray spectrum (power-law index 0.79 +/- 0.10) is
          now measured up to an energy of ~230 keV with no indication of
          a spectral break. Extrapolation of the INTEGRAL power-law
          spectrum to lower energies passes orders of magnitude
          underneath the NIR and optical fluxes, as well as the low ~30
          microJy (2 sigma) upper limit in the radio band.

          We report on a campaign to identify the counterparts to the
          population of X-ray sources discovered at the centre of our
          Galaxy by Wang et al.(2002) using Chandra. We have used deep,
          near infrared images obtained on VLT/ISAAC to identify
          candidate counterparts as astrometric matches to the X-ray
          positions. Follow up Ks-band spectroscopic observations of the
          candidate counterparts are used to search for accretions
          signatures in the spectrum, namely the Brackett-Gamma emission
          line (Bandyopadhyay et al.1997). From our small initial sample,
          it appears that only a small percentage, ~2-3% of the ~1000
          X-ray sources are high mass X-ray binaries or wind accreting
          neutron stars, and that the vast majority will be shown to be
          canonical low mass X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables.

          Authors: T. Sanuki, M. Honda, T. Kajita, K. Kasahara, S.
          Midorikawa
          We have studied the hadronic interaction for the calculation of
          the atmospheric neutrino flux by summarizing the accurately
          measured atmospheric muon flux data and comparing with
          simulations. We find the atmospheric muon and neutrino fluxes
          respond to errors in the $\pi$-production of the hadronic
          interaction similarly, and compare the atmospheric muon flux
          calculated using the HKKM04 code with experimental
          measurements. The $\mu^++\mu^-$ data show good agreement in the
          1$\sim$30 GeV/c range, but a large disagreement above 30 GeV/c.
          The the $\mu^+/\mu^-$ ratio shows sizable differences at lower
          and higher momenta for opposite directions. As the
          disagreements are considered to be due to assumptions in the
          hadronic interaction model, we try to improve it
          phenomenologically based on the quark parton model. The
          improved interaction model reproduces the observed muon flux
          data well. The calculation of the atmospheric neutrino flux
          will be reported in the following paper

          molecular clouds and HII regions
          Authors: J.L. Han (NAOC), J.S. Zhang (GuangZhouUni)
          Comments: 17 pages with two long tables of collected data.
          Submited to A&A. Comments welcome!
          Aims: Magnetic fields exist on all scales in our Galaxy. There
          is a controversy on whether the magnetic fields in molecular
          clouds are preserved from the permeated magnetic fields in the
          interstellar medium (ISM). We want to check this controversy
          using available data in the light of the newly revealed
          magnetic field structure of the Galactic disk obtained from
          pulsar rotation measures (RMs). Methods: We collected the
          measurements of the magnetic fields in molecular clouds,
          including Zeeman splitting data of OH masers in clouds and OH
          or HI absorption or emission lines of clouds themselves.
          Results: These Zeeman data show structures in the sign
          distribution of line-of-sight component of magnetic field.
          Comparing with the large- scale Galactic magnetic fields from
          pulsar RMs we found that the sign-distribution show similar
          large-scale field reversals. Previous such examinations were
          flawed by the over-simplified global model for the large-scale
          magnetic fields in the Galactic disk. Conclusions: We conclude
          that the magnetic fields in the clouds may still "remember" the
          directions of magnetic fields in the Galactic ISM to some
          extent, and could be used as completementary tracer for the
          large-scale magnetic structure. More Zeeman data of OH masers
          in widerly distributed clouds are desired for such a study.

          Convincing evidence for long-term variations in the emission
          properties of the anomalous X-ray pulsar 1RXS J170849.0-400910
          has been gathered in the last few years. In particular, and
          following the pulsar glitches of 1999 and 2001, XMM-Newton
          witnessed in 2003 a decline of the X-ray flux accompanied by a
          definite spectral softening. This suggested the existence of a
          correlation between the luminosity and the spectral hardness in
          this source, similar to that seen in the soft gamma-repeater
          SGR 1806-20. Here we report on new Chandra and Swift
          observations of 1RXS J170849.0-400910 performed in 2004 and
          2005, respectively. These observations confirm and strengthen
          the proposed correlation. The trend appears to have now
          reversed: the flux increased and the spectrum is now harder.
          The consequences of these observations for the twisted
          magnetosphere scenario for anomalous X-ray pulsars are briefly
          discussed.

          We report high-energy results obtained with INTEGRAL and
          Rossi-XTE on two microquasars: the persistent high-mass system
          Cygnus X-1 and the transient low-mass binary SWIFT
          J1753.5-0127. INTEGRAL observed Cygnus X-1 from 2002 to 2004:
          the spectral (5-1000 keV) properties of the source, seen at
          least in three distinct spectral states, show disc and corona
          changes. In 2003 June, a high-energy tail at several hundred
          keV in excess of the thermal Comptonization model was observed,
          suggesting the presence of an additional non-thermal component.
          At that time, we detected an unusual correlation between radio
          data and high-energy hardness. We also report and compare the
          results obtained with simultaneous observations of the
          transient source SWIFT J1753.5-0127 performed with Rossi-XTE,
          INTEGRAL, VLA, REM and NTT on 2005 August 10-12 near its hard
          X-ray outburst. Broad-band spectra and fast time-variability
          properties are derived on this source (probably located in the
          galactic halo) together with radio, IR and optical data. We
          build a spectral energy distribution of the source and derive
          interesting multiwavelength constraints. Significantly detected
          up to 600 keV in a typical Low/Hard State, the transient does
          not seem to follow the usual radio/X-ray correlation.

          A dark matter halo is said to have formed when at least half

          The standard estimate of this distribution depends on the shape
          of the conditional mass function--the distribution of
          progenitor masses of a halo as a function of time. If the
          spherical collapse model is used to estimate the progenitor
          mass function, then the formation times one infers
          systematically underestimate those seen in numerical
          simulations of hierarchical gravitational clustering. We
          provide estimates of halo formation which may be related to an
          ellipsoidal collapse model. These estimates provide a
          substantially better description of the simulations. We also
          provide an alternative derivation of the formation time
          distribution which is based on the assumption that haloes
          increase their mass through binary mergers only. Our results
          are useful for models which relate halo structure to halo
          formation.

          We performed a timing analysis of the fastest accreting
          millisecond pulsar IGR J00291+5934 using RXTE data taken during
          the outburst of December 2004. We corrected the arrival times
          of all the events for the orbital (Doppler) effects and
          performed a timing analysis of the resulting phase delays. In
          this way we have the possibility to study, for the first time
          in this class of sources, the spin-up of a millisecond pulsar
          as a consequence of accretion torques during the X-ray
          outburst. The accretion torque gives us for the first time an
          independent estimate of the mass accretion rate onto the
          neutron star, which can be compared with the observed X-ray
          luminosity. We also report a revised value of the spin period
          of the pulsar.

          Title: Supermassive binary black holes among cosmic gamma-ray
          sources
          Authors: Frank M. Rieger
          Comments: 4 pages, based on presentation at "The multimessenger
          approach to unidentified gamma-ray sources", Barcelona/Spain,
          July 2006; accepted for publication in Astrophysics and Space
          Science
          Supermassive binary black holes (SBBHs) are a natural outcome
          of galaxy mergers. Here we show that low-frequency ($f \leq
          10^{-6}$ Hz) quasi-periodic variability observed from cosmic
          blazar sources can provide substantial inductive support for
          the presence of close ($d \lppr 0.1$ pc) SBBHs at their
          centers. It is argued on physical grounds that such close
          binary systems are likely to give rise to different (although
          not independent) periodicities in the radio, optical and
          X-ray/TeV regime, and, hence that detection of appropriate
          period ratios significantly corroborates the SBBH
          interpretation. This is illustrated for a binary model where
          optical longterm periodicity is related to accretion disk
          interactions, radio periodicity to Newtonian jet precession,
          and periodicities in the high energy bands to the orbital
          motion of the jet. We use the observed periodicities to
          constrain the properties for a sample of SBBH candidates
          including OJ 287 and AO 0235+16, and discuss the results within
          the context of jet activity and binary evolution.

          Title: Low mass X-ray binaries with pre-main sequence
          companions
          Authors: Natalia Ivanova
          Comments: 4 pages in emuapj style, 3 fugures, to appear in ApJL
          In this Letter we examine the idea that a subset of
          short-period black-hole low-mass X-ray binaries could be
          powered by the mass transfer from pre-main sequence donors. As
          the star contracts towards the main sequence, the strong
          magnetic fields operate the magnetic braking which dissipates
          the orbital angular momentum, driving the binary to contact. We
          show that the periods and apparent donor spectral classes of
          the X-ray binaries with a pre-main sequence donor agree better
          with the available observations of black hole X-ray binaries
          than those of binaries with a main-sequence donor. This
          mechanism also explains, without the need for additional
          hypotheses, the roughly primordial abundance of Li detected in
          donor companions of black hole X-ray candidates in our Galaxy.

          Astronomy & Astrophysics
          Our recent studies of pulsar population statistics suggest that
          improvements of radio and gamma-ray beam geometry and
          luminosity models require further refinement. The goal of this
          project is to constrain the viewing geometry for some radio
          pulsars, especially three-peaked pulse profiles, in order to
          limit the uncertainty of the magnetic inclination and impact
          angles. We perform fits of the pulse profile and position angle
          sweep of radio pulsars for the available frequencies. We assume
          a single core and conal beams described by Gaussians. We
          incorporate three different size cones with frequency
          dependence from the work of Mitra & Deshpande (1999). We obtain
          separate spectral indices for the core and cone beams and
          explore the trends of the ratio of core to cone peak fluxes.
          This ratio is observed to have some dependence with period.
          However, we cannot establish the suggested functional form of
          this ratio as indicated by the work of Arzoumanian, Chernoff &
          Cordes (2002).

          (Abridged) Chandra and Hubble ACS observations of 11 early-type
          galaxies probe the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) - globular
          cluster (GC) connection. We explore the optical properties of
          270 GCs with LMXBs and 6,488 GCs without LMXBs. More massive,
          redder, and more compact GCs are more likely to contain LMXBs.
          Unlike Galactic GCs, a large number of GCs with LMXBs have
          half-mass relaxation times > 2.5 Gyr. We fit the dependence of
          the expected number of LMXBs per GC, \lambda_t, on the GC mass
          M, color (g-z), and half-mass radius r_{h,cor}, and find that
          \lambda_t \propto M^{1.24\pm0.08} 10^{0.9^{+0.2}_{-0.1} (g-z)}
          r_{h,cor}^{-2.2^{+0.3}_{-0.4}}. Our fit rules out that the
          number of LMXBs per GC is linearly proportional to GC mass and
          that most GCs with high X-ray luminosities contain a single
          LMXB. The detailed dependence of \lambda_t on GC properties
          appears essentially equivalent to a dependence on the encounter
          rate \Gamma_h and the metallicity Z, \lambda_t \propto
          \Gamma_h^{0.82\pm0.05} Z^{0.39\pm0.07}. Our analysis provides
          strong evidence that dynamical formation and metallicity play
          the primary roles in determining the presence of an LMXB in
          extragalactic GCs. The shallower than linear dependence for our
          sample, as well as Galactic X-ray sources and radio pulsars in
          GCs, requires an explanation by theories of dynamical binary
          formation. The abundance dependence is consistent with a
          metallicity-dependent variation in the number of neutron stars
          and black holes per unit mass GC or effects from irradiation
          induced winds.

          (2006)
          We present X-ray observations of the Black-Hole Binary GRS
          1915+105 made with the RXTE (Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer). We
          concentrated on timing analysis of the strong variability
          focusing on its aperiodic variability on short (<1s) time
          scales. In the power density spectra, we found a feature which
          is seen in many transient systems, but until now was not
          detected in GRS 1915+105 due to its elusiveness. As this
          feature has been associated to the collimation and emission of
          superluminal relativistic jets visible in the radio band, its
          presence on the prototypical galactic jet source strengthens
          this connection. Since its discovery in 1992, GRS 1915+105 was
          considered a peculiar source. Our results suggest that its
          general behaviour is similar to that of other black-hole
          binaries, but its state-transitions are much faster and
          difficult to analyze.

          High-dispersion spectroscopy of EY Cyg obtained from data
          spanning twelve years show, for the first time, the radial
          velocity curves from both emission and absorption line systems,
          yielding semi-amplitudes K_{em}=24+/- 4 km s^-1 and
          K_{abs}=54+/- 2 km s^-1. The orbital period of this system is
          found to be 0.4593249(1)d. The masses of the stars, their mass
          ratio and their separation are found to be M_1 sin^3 i =
          0.015+/-0.002 M_sun, M_2 sin^3 i = 0.007+/-0.002 M_sun, q =
          K_1/K_2 = M_2/M_1 = 0.44+/-0.02 and a sin i = 0.71+/-0.04
          R_sun. We also found that the spectral type of the secondary
          star is around K0,consistent with an early determination by
          Kraft(1962). From the spectral type of the secondary star and
          simple comparisons with single main sequence stars, we conclude
          that the radius of the secondary star is about 30 per cent
          larger than a main sequence star of the same mass. We also
          present VRI CCD photometric observations, some of them
          simultaneous with the spectroscopic runs. The photometric data
          shows several light modulations, including a sinusoidal
          behaviour with twice the frequency of the orbital period,
          characteristic of the modulation coming from an elongated,
          irradiated secondary star. Low and high states during
          quiescence are also detected and discussed. From several
          constrains, we obtain tight limits for the inclination angle of
          the binary system between 13 and 15 degrees, with a best value
          of 14 degrees obtained from the sinusoidal light curve
          analysis. From the above results we derive masses M_1 =
          1.10+/-0.09 M_sun, M_2 = 0.49+/-0.09 M_sun, and a binary
          separation a = 2.9+/- 0.1 R_sun.

          We present the first detailed kinematical analysis of the
          planetary nebula Abell 63, which is known to contain the
          eclipsing close-binary nucleus UU Sge. Abell 63 provides an
          important test case in investigating the role of close-binary
          central stars on the evolution of planetary nebulae.
          Longslit observations were obtained using the Manchester
          echelle spectrometer combined with the 2.1-m San Pedro Martir
          Telescope. The spectra reveal that the central bright rim of
          Abell 63 has a tube-like structure. A deep image shows
          collimated lobes extending from the nebula, which are shown to
          be high-velocity outflows. The kinematic ages of the nebular
          rim and the extended lobes are calculated to be 8400+/-500
          years and 12900+/-2800 years, respectively, which suggests that
          the lobes were formed at an earlier stage than the nebular rim.
          This is consistent with expectations that disk-generated jets
          form immediately after the common envelope phase.
          A morphological-kinematical model of the central nebula is
          presented and the best-fit model is found to have the same
          inclination as the orbital plane of the central binary system;
          this is the first proof that a close-binary system directly
          affects the shaping of its nebula. A Hubble-type flow is
          well-established in the morphological-kinematical modelling of
          the observed line profiles and imagery.
          Two possible formation models for the elongated lobes of Abell
          63 are considered (1) a low-density, pressure-driven jet
          excavates a cavity in the remnant AGB envelope; (2)
          high-density bullets form the lobes in a single ballistic
          ejection event.

          The third EGRET catalog contains a large number of unidentified
          sources. This subset of objects is expected to include known
          gamma-ray emitters of Galactic origin such as pulsars and
          supernova remnants, in addition to an extragalactic population
          of blazars. However, current data allows the intriguing
          possibility that some of these objects may represent a new
          class of yet undiscovered gamma-ray sources. Many theoretically
          motivated candidate emitters (e.g. clumps of annihilating dark
          matter particles) have been suggested to account for these
          detections. We take a new approach to determine to what extent
          this population is Galactic and to investigate the nature of
          the possible Galactic component. By assuming that galaxies
          similar to the Milky Way should host comparable populations of
          objects, we constrain the allowed Galactic abundance and
          distribution of various classes of gamma-ray sources using the
          EGRET data set. We find it is highly improbable that a large
          number of the unidentified sources are members of a Galactic
          halo population, but that a distribution of the sources
          entirely in the disk and bulge is plausible. Finally, we
          discuss the additional constraints and new insights that GLAST
          will provide.

          electron-positron pair cascade model for massive binaries:
          Application to LS 5039

          Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures, A&A accepted
          TeV gamma-ray emission from two massive binaries of the
          microquasar type, LS 5039 and LS I +61$^{\rm o}$ 303, show
          clear variability with their orbital periods. Our purpose is to
          calculate the GeV and TeV $\gamma$-ray light curves from the
          massive binary LS 5039 which are expected in the specific
          Inverse Compton $e^\pm$ pair cascade model. This model
          successfully predicted the basic features of the high energy
          $\gamma$-ray emission from LS 5039 and LS I +61 303. In the
          calculations we apply the Monte Carlo code which follows the IC
          $e^\pm$ pair cascade in the anisotropic radiation of the
          massive star. The $\gamma$-ray light curves and spectra are
          obtained for different parameters of the acceleration scenario
          and the inclination angles of the binary system. It is found
          that the GeV and TeV $\gamma$-ray light curves should be
          anti-correlated. This feature can be tested in the near future
          by the simultaneous observations of LS 5039 with the AGILE and
          GLAST telescopes in GeV energies and the Cherenkov telescopes
          in the TeV energies. Considered model also predicts a broad
          maximum in the TeV $\gamma$-ray light curve between the phases
          $\sim 0.4-0.8$ consistently with the observations of LS 5039 by
          the HESS telescopes. Moreover, we predict additional dip in the
          TeV light curve for large inclination angles $\sim 60^{\rm o}$.
          This feature could serve as a diagnostic for independent
          measuring of the inclination angle of this binary system
          indicating also on the presence of a neutron star in LS 5039.

          Title: Moderate Asphericity of the SN 2002ic Circumstellar
          Envelope
          Authors: Nikolai N. Chugai, Roger A. Chevalier
          Comments: 13 pages, 4 figs., ApJ, accepted
          The polarization of SN 2002ic interacting with a dense
          circumstellar envelope is calculated in the context of the
          asymmetric version of a previously proposed spherical
          interaction model. The circumstellar envelope is taken to be
          oblate. The observed polarization (Wang et al. 2004) can be
          reproduced for an aspect ratio of 0.65-0.7 assuming inclination
          angles >60 degrees. This model predicts a weak sensitivity of
          the line profiles to the orientation, in agreement with the
          absence of significant variations of the line profiles among SN
          2002ic-like supernovae. We propose a test for distinguishing
          between the binary and single star progenitor scenarios based
          upon the polarization distribution function for the growing
          sample of these events.

          Title: Production and evolution of millisecond X-ray and radio
          pulsars
          Authors: Frederick K. Lamb

          of Compact X-ray Binaries, ed. P. Ghosh, & E.P.J. van den

          Observations using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer have
          discovered dozens of accreting neutron stars with millisecond
          spin periods in low-mass binary star systems. Eighteen are
          millisecond X-ray pulsars powered by accretion or nuclear
          burning or both. These stars have magnetic fields strong enough
          for them to become millisecond rotation-powered (radio) pulsars
          when accretion ceases. Few, if any, accretion- or
          rotation-powered pulsars have spin rates higher than 750 Hz.
          There is strong evidence that the spin-up of some accreting
          neutron stars is limited by magnetic spin equilibrium whereas
          the spin-up of others is halted when accretion ends. Further
          study will show whether the spin rates of some accretion- or
          rotation-powered pulsars are or were limited by emission of
          gravitational radiation.

          Title: Be born slow or die fast: spin evolution of neutron
          stars with alignment or counteralignment
          Authors: S.A. Eliseeva, S.B. Popov, V.S. Beskin
          Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures
          We revisit the case of magneto-rotational evolution of neutron
          stars (NSs) with accounting for changes of the angle \chi
          between spin and magnetic axes. This element of the evolution
          of NSs is very important for age estimates and population
          modeling, but usually it is neglected. In the framework of two
          models of energy losses we demonstrate that unless NSs are born
          with the inclination angle \chi_0 very close (within 1 degree)
          to the position of maximal losses, pulsars with short initial
          periods quickly reach regions of small energy losses (aligned
          rotators in the case of magneto-dipole losses and orthogonal
          rotators -- in the case of current losses) without significant
          spin-down. This means that either most of known NSs should be
          born with relatively long periods close to presently observed
          values, or the initial inclination angles should be large
          (close to 90) for the magnetodipole model and very small (close
          to 0) for the current losses model, or that both models cannot
          be applied for the whole evolutionary track of a typical NS. In
          particular, magnetar candidates should be born with periods
          close to the observed ones within the scope of both models of
          energy losses. We discuss how these considerations can
          influence population synthesis models and age estimates for
          different types of isolated NSs. Focusing on the model of
          current losses we illustrate our conclusion with evolutionary
          track reconstructions on the P--\sin \chi plane. We conclude,
          that most probably both existing models of energy losses --
          magneto-dipole and longitudinal current -- require serious
          modifications, on the other hand, estimates obtained under the
          standard assumption of \sin \chi=1=const does not have solid
          theoretical ground and should be taken with care.

          A variety of pulsar studies, ranging from high precision
          astrometry to tests for theories of gravity, require high time
          resolution data. Few such observations at more than two
          frequencies below 1 GHz are available. Giant Meterwave Radio
          Telescope (GMRT) has the unique capability to provide such
          multi-frequency pulsar data at low observation frequencies, but
          the quality and time resolution of pulsar radio signals is
          degraded due to dispersion in the inter-stellar medium at these
          frequencies. Such degradation is usually taken care of by
          employing specialized digital hardware, which implement
          coherent dedispersion algorithm. In recent years, a new
          alternative is provided by the availability of cheap computer
          hardware. In this approach, the required signal processing is
          implemented in software using commercially off-the-shelf
          available computing hardware. This makes such a receiver
          flexible and upgradeable unlike a hardware implementation. The
          salient features and the modes of operation of a high time
          resolution pulsar instrument for GMRT based on this approach is
          described in this paper. The capability of the instrument is
          demonstrated by illustrations of test observations. We have
          obtained the average profile of PSR B1937+21 at 235 MHz for the
          first time and this profile indicates a scattering timescale of
          about 300 us. Lastly, the possible future extensions of this
          concept are discussed.

          We report on a Chandra grating observation of the recently
          discovered hard X-ray transient IGR J17497-2821. The
          observation took place about two weeks after the source
          discovery at a flux level of about 20 mCrab in the 0.8-8 keV
          range. We extracted the most precise X-ray position of IGR
          J17497-2821, RA=17 49 38.037, DEC= -28 21 17.37 (90%
          uncertainty of 0.6"). We also report on optical and near
          infra-red photometric follow-up observations based on this
          position. With the multi-wavelength information at hand, we
          discuss the possible nature of the source proposing that IGR
          J17497-2821 is a low-mass X-ray binary, most likely hosting a
          black hole, with a red giant K-type companion.

          centres
          Authors: Sergei Nayakshin (U of Leicester), Rashid Sunyaev
          (MPA-Garching)
          Comments: submitted to MNRAS; 5 pages
          Compact remnants -- stellar mass black holes and neutron stars
          formed in the inner few parsec of galactic centres are
          predicted to sink into the central parsec due to dynamical
          friction on low mass stars, forming a high concentration cusp
          (Morris 1993). Same physical region may also contain very high
          density molecular clouds and accretion discs that are needed to
          fuel SMBH activity. Here we estimate gas capture rates onto the
          cusp of stellar remnants, and the resulting X-ray luminosity,
          as a function of the accretion disc mass. At low disc masses,
          most compact objects are too dim to be observable, whereas in
          the high disc case most of them are accreting at their
          Eddington rates. We find that for low accretion disc masses,
          compact remnant cusps may be more luminous than the central
          SMBHs. This ``diffuse'' emission may be of importance for local
          moderately bright AGN, especially Low Luminosity AGN. We also
          briefly discuss how this expected emission can be used to put
          constraints on the black hole cusp near our Galactic Centre.

          Title: Revealing the Nature of Algol Disks through Optical and

          Authors: Brendan Miller, Jan Budaj, Mercedes Richards, Pavel
          Koubsky, Geraldine J. Peters
          Comments: 46 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables, accepted by ApJ
          We have developed a systematic procedure to study the disks in
          Algol-type binaries using spectroscopic analysis, synthetic
          spectra, and tomography. We analyzed 119 H-alpha spectra of TT
          Hya, an Algol-type eclipsing interacting binary, collected from
          1985-2001. The new radial velocities enabled us to derive
          reliable orbital elements, including a small non-zero
          eccentricity, and to improve the accuracy of the absolute
          dimensions of the system. High resolution IUE spectra were also
          analyzed to study the formation of the ultraviolet lines and
          continuum. Synthetic spectra of the iron curtain using our new
          shellspec program enabled us to derive a characteristic disk
          temperature of 7000K. We have demonstrated that the UV emission
          lines seen during total primary eclipse cannot originate from
          the accretion disk, but most likely arise from a hotter
          disk-stream interaction region.
          The synthetic spectra of the stars, disk, and stream allowed us
          to derive a lower limit to the mass transfer rate of 2e-10
          solar masses per year. Doppler tomography of the observed
          H-alpha profiles revealed a distinct accretion disk. The
          difference spectra produced by subtracting the synthetic
          spectra of the stars resulted in an image of the disk, which
          virtually disappeared once the composite synthetic spectra of
          the stars and disk were used to calculate the difference
          spectra. An intensity enhancement of the resulting tomogram
          revealed images of the gas stream and an emission arc. We
          successfully modeled the gas stream using shellspec and
          associated the emission arc with an asymmetry in the accretion
          disk.

          A new density dependent effective baryon-baryon interaction has
          been recently derived from the quark-meson-coupling (QMC)
          model, offering impressive results in application to finite
          nuclei and dense baryon matter. This self-consistent,
          relativistic quark-level approach is used to construct the
          Equation of State (EoS) and to calculate key properties of high
          density matter and cold, slowly rotating neutron stars. The
          results include predictions for the maximum mass of neutron
          star models, together with the corresponding radius and central
          density, as well the properties of neutron stars with mass of
          order 1.4 $M_\odot$. The cooling mechanism allowed by the QMC
          EoS is explored and the parameters relevant to slow rotation,
          namely the moment of inertia and the period of rotation
          investigated. The results of the calculation, which are found
          to be in good agreement with available observational data, are
          compared with the predictions of more traditional EoS. The QMC
          EoS provides cold neutron star models with maximum mass
          1.9--2.1 M$_\odot$, with central density less than 6 times
          nuclear saturation density ($n_{0}= 0.16 {\rm fm}^{-3}$) and
          offers a consistent description of the stellar mass up to this
          density limit. In contrast with other models, QMC predicts no
          hyperon contribution at densities lower than $3n_0$, for matter
          in $\beta$-equilibrium. At higher densities, $\Xi^{-,0}$ and
          $\Lambda$ hyperons are present.

          We report a dual-band observation at 223 and 654 GHz (460
          micron) toward an ultracompact (UC) HII region, G240.31+0.07,
          with the Submillimeter Array. With a beam size of 1"5 X 0"8,
          the dust continuum emission is resolved into two clumps, with
          clump A coincident well with an H2O maser and the UC HII
          region. The newly discovered clump, B, about 1"3 (~8.3 X 10^3
          AU) to the southwest of clump A, is also associated with H2O
          masers and may be a more recent star-forming site. The
          continuum flux densities imply an opacity spectral index of
          \beta = 1.5 +- 0.3, suggestive of a value lower than the
          canonical 2.0 found in the interstellar medium and in cold,
          massive cores. The presence of hot (~100 K) molecular gas is
          derived by the brightness ratio of two H2CO lines in the 223
          GHz band. A radial velocity difference of 2.5 +- 0.4 km/s is
          found between the two clumps in C18O (6-5) emission. The total
          (nebular and stellar) mass of roughly 58 Msun in the central
          region is close to, but not by far larger than, the minimum
          mass required for the two clumps to be gravitationally bound
          for binary rotation. Our continuum data do not suggest a large
          amount of matter associated with the H2 knots that were
          previously proposed to arise from a massive disk or envelope.

          Title: Assessing Millisecond Proto-Magnetars as GRB Central
          Engines
          Authors: Todd A. Thompson
          Comments: 10 pages; proceedings of the conference "Triggering
          Relativistic Jets," held in Cozumel, Mexico, 2005; accepted for
          publication in Rev. Mex. A&A
          Magnetars are a sizable subclass of the neutron star census.
          Their very high magnetic field strengths are thought to be a
          consequence of rapid (millisecond) rotation at birth in a
          successful core-collapse supernova. In their first tens of
          seconds of existence, magnetars transition from hot, extended
          ``proto-''magnetars to the cooled and magnetically-dominated
          objects we identify $\sim10^4$ years later as Soft Gamma-ray
          Repeaters (SGRs) and Anamolous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs).
          Millisecond proto-magnetar winds during this cooling phase
          likewise transition from non-relativistic and thermally-driven
          to magneto-centrifugally-driven, and finally to relativistic
          and Poynting-flux dominated. Here we review the basic
          considerations associated with that transition. In particular,
          we discuss the spindown of millisecond proto-magnetars
          throughout the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling epoch. Because of their
          large reservoir of rotational energy, their association with
          supernovae, and the fact that their winds are expected to
          become highly relativistic in the seconds after their birth,
          proto-magnetars have been suggested as the central engine of
          long-duration gamma ray bursts. We discuss some of the issues
          and outstanding questions in assessing them as such.

          Title: Binary and recycled pulsars: 30 years after
          observational discovery
          Authors: G S Bisnovatyi-Kogan
          Journal-ref: Physics-Uspekhi 49 (1)53-61 (2006)
          Binary radio pulsars, first discovered by Hulse and Taylor in
          1974 [1], are a unique tool for experimentally testing general
          relativity (GR), whose validity has been confirmed with a
          precision unavailable in laboratory experiments. In particular,
          indirect evidence of the existence of gravitational waves has
          been obtained. Radio pulsars in binary systems (which have come
          to be known as recycled) have completed the accretion stage,
          during which neutron star spins reach millisecond periods and
          their magnetic fields decay 2 to 4 orders of magnitude more
          weakly than ordinary radio pulsars. Among about a hundred known
          recycled pulsars, many have turned out to be single neutron
          stars. The high concentration of single recycled pulsars in
          globular clusters suggests that close stellar encounters are
          highly instrumental in the loss of the companion. A system of
          one recycled pulsar and one 'normal' one discovered in 2004 is
          the most compact among binaries containing recycled pulsars
          [2]. Together with the presence of two pulsars in one system,
          this suggests new prospects for further essential improvements
          in testing GR. This paper considers theoretical predictions of
          binary pulsars, their evolutionary formation, and mechanisms by
          which their companions may be lost. The use of recycled pulsars
          in testing GR is discussed and their possible relation to the
          most intriguing objects in the universe, cosmic gamma-ray
          bursts, is examined.

          Comments: To be published in the proceedings of "The

          Origins"
          The amount of mass loss in symbiotic systems is investigated,
          specifically mass loss via the formation of jets in R Aquarii
          (R Aqr). The jets in R Aqr have been observed in the X-ray by
          Chandra over a four year time period. The jet changes on times
          scales of a year and new outflows have been observed.
          Understanding the amount of mass and the frequency of ejection
          further constrain the ability of the white dwarf in the system
          to accrete enough mass to become a Type 1a supernova
          progenitor. The details of multi-wavelength studies, such as
          speed, density and spatial extent of the jets will be discussed
          in order to understand the mass balance in the binary system.
          We examine other symbiotic systems to determine trends in mass
          loss in this class of objects.

          Context. Wolf Rayet/black hole binaries are believed to exist
          as a later evolutionary product of high-mass X-ray binaries.
          Hundreds of such binaries may exist in galaxies, but only a few
          of them are close enough to be observed as X-ray binaries. Only
          a couple of candidates have been reported so far. Aims. Based
          on XMM-Newton observations, we report the positional
          coincidence of the brightest X-ray source in NGC 300 (NGC 300
          X-1) with a Wolf-Rayet candidate. Temporal and spectral
          analysis of the X-ray source is performed. Methods. We
          determine an accurate X-ray position of the object, and derive
          light curves, spectra and flux in four XMM-Newton observations.
          Results. The positions of the X-ray source and the helium star
          candidate coincide within 0.11"+-0.45". The X-ray light curves
          show irregular variability. During one XMM-Newton observation,
          the flux increased by about a factor of ten in 10 hours. The
          spectrum can be modelled by a power-law with Gamma~2.45 with
          additional relatively weak line emission, notably around 0.95
          kev. The mean observed (absorbed) luminosity in the 0.2-10 kev
          band is ~2x10^38 erg/s. Conclusions. NGC 300 X-1 is a good
          candidate for a Wolf-Rayet/black-hole X-ray binary: its
          position coincides with a Wolf-Rayet candidate and the
          unabsorbed X-ray luminosity reached L(0.2-10 kev)~1x10^39
          erg/s, suggesting the presence of a black hole.

          Title: Direct detection of exoplanet host star companion gamma
          Cep B and revised masses for both stars and the sub-stellar
          object

          The star gamma Cep is known as a single-lined spectroscopic
          triple system at a distance of 13.8 pc, composed of a K1 III-IV
          primary star with V = 3.2 mag, a stellar-mass companion in a
          66--67 year orbit (Torres 2006), and a substellar companion
          with M_p sin i = 1.7 M_Jup that is most likely a planet (Hatzes
          et al. 2003). We aim to obtain a first direct detection of the
          stellar companion, to determine its current orbital position
          (for comparison with the spectroscopic and astrometric data),
          its infrared magnitude and, hence, mass. We use the Adaptive
          Optics camera CIAO at the Japanese 8m telescope Subaru on Mauna
          Kea, Hawaii, with the semi-transparent coronograph to block
          most of the light from the bright primary gamma Cep A, and to
          detect at the same time the faint companion B. In addition, we
          also used the IR camera Omega-Cass at the Calar Alto 3.5m
          telescope, Spain, to image gamma Cep A and B by adding up many
          very short integrations (without AO). gamma Cep B is clearly
          detected on our CIAO and Omega-Cass images. We use a
          photometric standard star to determine the magnitude of B after
          PSF subtraction in the Subaru image, and the magnitude
          difference between A and B in the Calar Alto images, and find
          an average value of K = 7.3 \pm 0.2 mag. The separations and
          position angles between A and B are measured on 15 July 2006
          and 11 and 12 Sept 2006, B is slightly south of west of A. By
          combining the radial velocity, astrometric, and imaging data,
          we have refined the binary orbit and determined the dynamical
          masses of the two stars in the gamma Cep system, namely 1.40
          \pm 0.12 M_sun for the primary and 0.409 \pm 0.018 M_sun for
          the secondary (consistent with being a M4 dwarf). We also
          determine the minimum mass of the sub-stellar companion to be
          M_p sin i = 1.60 \pm 0.13 M_Jup.

          Title: The binary pulsar PSR J1811-1736: evidence of a low

          (Abridged abstract)
          Aims: The binary pulsar PSR J1811-1736 has been identified,
          since its discovery, as a member of a double neutron star
          system. Observations of such binary pulsars allow the
          measurement of general relativistic effects, which in turn lead
          to information about the orbiting objects and, in a few cases,
          to tests of theories of gravity. Methods: Regular timing
          observations have been carried out with three of the largest
          European radio telescopes involved in pulsar research. The
          prospects of continued observations were studied with simulated
          timing data. Pulse scattering times were measured using
          dedicated observations at 1.4 GHz and at 3.1 GHz, and the
          corresponding spectral index has also been determined. The
          possibility of detecting the yet unseen companion as a radio
          pulsar was also investigated. A study of the natal kick
          received by the younger neutron star at birth was performed.
          Results: We present an up to date and improved timing solution
          for the binary pulsar PSR J1811-1736. One post-Keplerian
          parameter, the relativistic periastron advance, is measured and
          leads to the determination of the total mass of this binary
          system. The pulse profile at 1.4 GHz is heavily broadened by
          interstellar scattering, limiting the timing precision
          achievable at this frequency and the measurability of other
          post-keplerian parameters. Interstellar scattering is unlikely
          to be the reason for the continued failure to detect radio
          pulsations from the companion of PSR J1811-1736. The
          probability distribution that we derive for the amplitude of
          the kick imparted on the companion neutron star at its birth
          indicates that the kick has been of low amplitude.

          Title: Fallback accretion in the aftermath of a compact binary
          merger
          Authors: S. Rosswog
          Comments: submitted to MNRAS, 3 figures
          Recent observations of long and short gamma-ray bursts have
          revealed a puzzling X-ray activity that in some cases
          continuous until hours after the burst. It is difficult to
          reconcile such time scales with the viscous time scales that an
          accretion disk can plausibly provide. Here I discuss the
          accretion activity expected from the material that during a
          compact binary merger coalescence is launched into eccentric,
          but gravitationally bound orbits. From a simple analytical
          model the time scales and accretion luminosities that result
          from fallback in the aftermath of a compact binary merger are
          derived. For the considered mass range double neutron star
          binaries are relatively homogeneous in their fallback
          luminosities, neutron star black hole systems show a larger
          spread in their fallback behaviour. While the model is too
          simple to make predictions about the detailed time structure of
          the fallback, it is expected to make reasonable predictions
          about its gross properties. About one hour after the
          coalescence the fallback accretion luminosity can still be as
          large as $\sim 10^{45}$ erg/s, a fraction of which will be
          transformed into X-rays. Large-scale amplitude variations in
          the X-ray luminosities can plausibly be caused by gravitational
          fragmentation, which for the high-eccentricity fallback should
          occur more easily than in an accretion disk.

          Title: The origin of long-period X-ray pulsars
          Authors: N.R. Ikhsanov
          Comments: 7 pages, 2 tables, submitted for publication in MNRAS
          Several relatively bright, persistent X-ray sources display
          regular pulses, with periods in the range of 700-10000 s. These
          sources are identified with massive close binaries in which a
          neutron star accretes material onto its surface. The observed
          pulsations in all of them, but one, are unambiguously
          associated with the spin period of the neutron star. Analyzing
          possible history of these pulsars I conclude that the neutron
          stars in these systems undergo spherical accretion and their
          evolutionary tracks in a previous epoch contained three instead
          of two states, namely, ejector, supersonic propeller, and
          subsonic propeller. An assumption about a supercritical value
          of the initial magnetic field of the neutron stars within this
          scenario is not necessary. Furthermore, I show that the
          scenario in which the neutron star in 2S 0114+650 is assumed to
          be a magnetar descendant encounters major difficulties in
          explaining the evolution of the massive companion. An
          alternative interpretation of the spin evolution of the neutron
          star in this system is presented and the problem raised by
          association of the 10000 s pulsations with the spin period of
          the neutron star is briefly discussed.

          Authors: J. Kijak, Y. Gupta, K. Krzeszowski
          Comments: 4 pages, to be published in Astronomy & Astrophysics
          The main aim is to investigate the possibility of a high
          frequency turn-over in the radio spectrum of pulsars. Using the
          GMRT, multi-frequency flux density measurements of several
          candidate pulsars have been carried out and their spectra have
          been extended to lower frequencies. We present the first direct
          evidence for turn-over in pulsar radio spectra at high
          frequencies. A total of 3 pulsars (including 2 new ones from
          this study) are now shown to have a turn-over frequency > 1
          GHz, and one is shown to have a turn-over at ~600 MHz.

          Abundance in the Hot Gaseous Interstellar Medium
          Authors: Yangsen Yao, Norbert Schulz, Q. Daniel Wang, Michael

          Comments: 5 pages with emulateapj, 3 figures and 1 table,
          accepted to ApJ Letter
          The iron depletion level and the gas-phase iron abundance in
          the hot ~10^6 K interstellar medium (ISM) is critical to the
          understanding of its energy balance as well as the thermal
          sputtering, cooling, and heating processes of dust grains. Here
          we report on the first detection of the Fe XVII absorption line
          at 15.02 A from the hot ISM in the spectrum of the low mass
          X-ray binary 4U~1820-303 observed with Chandra X-ray
          observatory. By jointly analyzing this absorption line with
          those from OVII, OVIII, and NeIX ions in the same spectrum, we
          obtain an abundance ratio as Fe/Ne=0.8(0.4, 2.1) in units of
          Anders & Grevesse's solar value (90% confidence intervals). We
          find that the result is robust with respect to different
          assumed gas temperature distributions. The obtained Fe/Ne
          abundance ratio, albeit with large uncertainties, is consistent
          with the solar value, indicating that there is very little or
          no iron depleted into dust grains, i.e., most of or all of the
          dust grains have been destroyed in the hot ISM.

          Title: Inferring the Magnetic Fields of Magnetars from their
          X-ray Spectra
          Authors: Tolga Guver, Feryal Ozel, Maxim Lyutikov
          Comments: submitted to ApJ
          We present the first self-consistent theoretical models of
          magnetar spectra that take into account the combined effects of
          the stellar atmosphere and its magnetosphere. We find that the
          proton cyclotron lines that are already weakened by atmospheric
          effects become indistinguishable from the continuum for
          moderate scattering optical depths in the magnetosphere.
          Furthermore, the hard excess becomes more pronounced due to
          resonant scattering and the resulting spectra closely resemble
          the observed magnetar spectra. We argue that while the absence
          of proton cyclotron lines in the observed spectra are
          inconclusive about the surface field strengths of magnetars,
          the continuum carries nearly unique signatures of the field
          strength and can thus be used to infer this quantity. We fit
          our theoretical spectra with a phenomenological two-blackbody
          model and compare our findings to source spectra with existing
          two-blackbody fits. The field strengths that we infer
          spectroscopically are in remarkable agreement with the values
          inferred from the period derivative of the sources assuming a
          dipole spindown. These detailed predictions of line energies
          and equivalent widths may provide an optimal opportunity for
          measuring directly the surface field strengths of magnetars
          with future X-ray telescopes such as {\em Constellation}-X.

          measurement of general relativistic effects, which in turn lead
          to information about the orbiting objects and, in a few cases,
          to tests of theories of gravity. Methods: Regular timing
          observations have been carried out with three of the largest
          European radio telescopes involved in pulsar research. The
          prospects of continued observations were studied with simulated
          timing data. Pulse scattering times were measured using
          dedicated observations at 1.4 GHz and at 3.1 GHz, and the
          corresponding spectral index has also been determined. The
          possibility of detecting the yet unseen companion as a radio
          pulsar was also investigated. A study of the natal kick
          received by the younger neutron star at birth was performed.
          Results: We present an up to date and improved timing solution
          for the binary pulsar PSR J1811-1736. One post-Keplerian
          parameter, the relativistic periastron advance, is measured and
          leads to the determination of the total mass of this binary
          system. The pulse profile at 1.4 GHz is heavily broadened by
          interstellar scattering, limiting the timing precision
          achievable at this frequency and the measurability of other
          post-keplerian parameters. Interstellar scattering is unlikely
          to be the reason for the continued failure to detect radio
          pulsations from the companion of PSR J1811-1736. The
          probability distribution that we derive for the amplitude of
          the kick imparted on the companion neutron star at its birth
          indicates that the kick has been of low amplitude.

          Title: Fallback accretion in the aftermath of a compact binary
          merger
          Authors: S. Rosswog
          Comments: submitted to MNRAS, 3 figures
          Recent observations of long and short gamma-ray bursts have
          revealed a puzzling X-ray activity that in some cases
          continuous until hours after the burst. It is difficult to
          reconcile such time scales with the viscous time scales that an
          accretion disk can plausibly provide. Here I discuss the
          accretion activity expected from the material that during a
          compact binary merger coalescence is launched into eccentric,
          but gravitationally bound orbits. From a simple analytical
          model the time scales and accretion luminosities that result
          from fallback in the aftermath of a compact binary merger are
          derived. For the considered mass range double neutron star
          binaries are relatively homogeneous in their fallback
          luminosities, neutron star black hole systems show a larger
          spread in their fallback behaviour. While the model is too
          simple to make predictions about the detailed time structure of
          the fallback, it is expected to make reasonable predictions
          about its gross properties. About one hour after the
          coalescence the fallback accretion luminosity can still be as
          large as $\sim 10^{45}$ erg/s, a fraction of which will be
          transformed into X-rays. Large-scale amplitude variations in
          the X-ray luminosities can plausibly be caused by gravitational
          fragmentation, which for the high-eccentricity fallback should
          occur more easily than in an accretion disk.

          Title: The origin of long-period X-ray pulsars
          Authors: N.R. Ikhsanov
          Comments: 7 pages, 2 tables, submitted for publication in MNRAS
          Several relatively bright, persistent X-ray sources display
          regular pulses, with periods in the range of 700-10000 s. These
          sources are identified with massive close binaries in which a
          neutron star accretes material onto its surface. The observed
          pulsations in all of them, but one, are unambiguously
          associated with the spin period of the neutron star. Analyzing
          possible history of these pulsars I conclude that the neutron
          stars in these systems undergo spherical accretion and their
          evolutionary tracks in a previous epoch contained three instead
          of two states, namely, ejector, supersonic propeller, and
          subsonic propeller. An assumption about a supercritical value
          of the initial magnetic field of the neutron stars within this
          scenario is not necessary. Furthermore, I show that the
          scenario in which the neutron star in 2S 0114+650 is assumed to
          be a magnetar descendant encounters major difficulties in
          explaining the evolution of the massive companion. An
          alternative interpretation of the spin evolution of the neutron
          star in this system is presented and the problem raised by
          association of the 10000 s pulsations with the spin period of
          the neutron star is briefly discussed.

          Authors: J. Kijak, Y. Gupta, K. Krzeszowski
          Comments: 4 pages, to be published in Astronomy & Astrophysics
          The main aim is to investigate the possibility of a high
          frequency turn-over in the radio spectrum of pulsars. Using the
          GMRT, multi-frequency flux density measurements of several
          candidate pulsars have been carried out and their spectra have
          been extended to lower frequencies. We present the first direct
          evidence for turn-over in pulsar radio spectra at high
          frequencies. A total of 3 pulsars (including 2 new ones from
          this study) are now shown to have a turn-over frequency > 1
          GHz, and one is shown to have a turn-over at ~600 MHz.

          Abundance in the Hot Gaseous Interstellar Medium
          Authors: Yangsen Yao, Norbert Schulz, Q. Daniel Wang, Michael

          Comments: 5 pages with emulateapj, 3 figures and 1 table,
          accepted to ApJ Letter
          The iron depletion level and the gas-phase iron abundance in
          the hot ~10^6 K interstellar medium (ISM) is critical to the
          understanding of its energy balance as well as the thermal
          sputtering, cooling, and heating processes of dust grains. Here
          we report on the first detection of the Fe XVII absorption line
          at 15.02 A from the hot ISM in the spectrum of the low mass
          X-ray binary 4U~1820-303 observed with Chandra X-ray
          observatory. By jointly analyzing this absorption line with
          those from OVII, OVIII, and NeIX ions in the same spectrum, we
          obtain an abundance ratio as Fe/Ne=0.8(0.4, 2.1) in units of
          Anders & Grevesse's solar value (90% confidence intervals). We
          find that the result is robust with respect to different
          assumed gas temperature distributions. The obtained Fe/Ne
          abundance ratio, albeit with large uncertainties, is consistent
          with the solar value, indicating that there is very little or
          no iron depleted into dust grains, i.e., most of or all of the
          dust grains have been destroyed in the hot ISM.

          Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures, accepted by ApJ
          We report the results of simultaneous observations of the Vela
          pulsar in X-rays and radio from the RXTE satellite and the
          Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory in Tasmania. We sought
          correlations between the Vela's X-ray emission and radio
          arrival times on a pulse by pulse basis. At a confidence level
          of 99.8% we have found significantly higher flux density in
          Vela's main X-ray peak during radio pulses that arrived early.
          This excess flux shifts to the 'trough' following the 2nd X-ray
          peak during radio pulses that arrive later. Our results suggest
          that the mechanism producing the radio pulses is intimately
          connected to the mechanism producing X-rays. Current models
          using resonant absorption of radio emission in the outer
          magnetosphere as a cause of the X-ray emission are explored as
          a possible explanation for the correlation.

          Title: Paramagnetism in color superconductivity and compact
          stars
          Authors: Efrain J. Ferrer, Vivian de la Incera
          Comments: 7 pages, presented at IRAG 2006, Barcelona, July
          11-15, 2006
          It is quite plausible that color superconductivity occurs in
          the inner regions of neutron stars. At the same time, it is
          known that strong magnetic fields exist in the interior of
          these compact objects. In this paper we discuss some important
          effects that can occur in the color superconducting core of
          compact stars due to the presence of the stars' magnetic field.
          In particular, we consider the modification of the gluon
          dynamics for a color superconductor with three massless quark
          flavors in the presence of an external magnetic field. We show
          that the long-range component of the external magnetic field
          that penetrates the color-flavor locked phase produces an
          instability for field values larger than the charged gluons'
          Meissner mass. As a consequence, the ground state is
          restructured forming a vortex state characterized by the
          condensation of charged gluons and the creation of magnetic
          flux tubes. In the vortex state the magnetic field outside the
          flux tubes is equal to the applied one, while inside the tubes
          its strength increases by an amount that depends on the
          amplitude of the gluon condensate. This paramagnetic behavior
          of the color superconductor can be relevant for the physics of
          compact stars.

          Title: Understanding white dwarf binary evolution with white
          dwarf/main sequence binaries: first results from SEGUE
          Authors: M.R. Schreiber, A. Nebot Gomez-Moran, A.D. Schwope
          Comments: 6 pages, Proceedings, 15th European Workshop on White
          Dwarfs
          Close white dwarf binaries make up a wide variety of objects
          such as double white dwarf binaries, which are possible SN Ia
          progenitors, cataclysmic variables, super soft sources, or AM
          CVn stars. The evolution and formation of close white dwarf
          binaries crucially depends on the rate at which angular
          momentum is extracted from the binary orbit. The two most
          important sources of angular momentum loss are the common
          envelope phase and magnetic braking. Both processes are so far
          poorly understood. Observational population studies of white
          dwarf/main sequence binaries provide the potential to
          significantly progress with this situation and to clearly
          constrain magnetic braking and the CE-phase. However, the
          current population of white dwarf/main sequence binaries is
          highly incomplete and heavily biased towards young systems
          containing hot white dwarfs. The SDSSII/SEGUE collaboration
          awarded us with 5 fibers per plate pair in order to fill this
          gap and to identify the required unbiased sample of old white
          dwarf/main sequence binaries. The success rate of our selection
          criteria exceeds 65% and during the first 10 months we have
          identified 41 new systems, most of them belonging to the missed
          old population.

          of Compact Objects and their Explosive Origins'', 2006 June

          I study the behaviour of the maximum rms fractional amplitude,
          $r_{\rm max}$ and the maximum coherence, $Q_{\rm max}$, of the
          kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) in a dozen
          low-mass X-ray binaries. I find that: (i) The maximum rms
          amplitudes of the lower and the upper kHz QPO, $r^{\ell}_{\rm
          max}$ and $r^{\rm u}_{\rm max}$, respectively, decrease more or
          less exponentially with increasing luminosity of the source;
          (ii) the maximum coherence of the lower kHz QPO, $Q^{\ell}_{\rm
          max}$, first increases and then decreases exponentially with
          luminosity; (iii) the maximum coherence of the upper kHz QPO,
          $Q^{\rm u}_{\rm max}$, is more or less independent of
          luminosity; and (iv) $r_{\rm max}$ and $Q_{\rm max}$ show the
          opposite behaviour with hardness of the source, consistent with
          the fact that there is a general anticorrelation between
          luminosity and spectral hardness in these sources. Both $r_{\rm
          max}$ and $Q_{\rm max}$ in the sample of sources, and the rms
          amplitude and coherence of the kHz QPOs in individual sources
          show a similar behaviour with hardness. This similarity argues
          against the interpretation that the drop of coherence and rms
          amplitude of the lower kHz QPO at high QPO frequencies in
          individual sources is a signature of the innermost stable
          circular orbit around a neutron star.

          Comments: 13 pages, 5 figures (2 in the Appendix), 4 tables (1
          in the Appendix), accepted for publication on A&A, main journal
          (Abridged) We present results of several X-ray observations of
          the X-ray binary 4U 1954+31 performed with the satellites
          BeppoSAX, EXOSAT, ROSAT, RXTE, and Swift. We also studied the
          RXTE ASM data over a period of more than 10 years. Light curves
          of all observations show an erratic behaviour with sudden
          increases in the source emission on timescales variable from
          hundreds to thousands of seconds. There are no indications of
          changes in the source spectral hardness, with the possible
          exception of the RXTE pointed observation. Timing analysis does
          not reveal the presence of coherent pulsations or periodicities
          either in the pointed observations in the range from 2 ms to
          2000 s or in the long-term RXTE ASM light curve on timescales
          from days to years. The 0.2-150 keV spectrum, afforded with
          BeppoSAX, is the widest for this source available up to now in
          terms of spectral coverage and is well described by a model
          consisting of a lower-energy thermal component (hot diffuse
          gas) plus a higher-energy (Comptonization) emission, with the
          latter modified by a partially-covering cold absorber plus a
          warm (ionized) absorber. A blackbody modelization of our
          BeppoSAX low-energy data is instead ruled out. The presence of
          a complex absorber local to the source is also supported by the
          0.1-2 keV ROSAT spectrum. RXTE, EXOSAT and Swift X-ray
          spectroscopy is consistent with the above results, but
          indicates variations in the density and the ionization of the
          local absorber. A 6.5 keV emission line is possibly detected in
          the BeppoSAX and RXTE spectra. All this information suggests
          that the scenario which better describes 4U 1954+31 consists of
          a binary system in which a neutron star orbits in a highly
          inhomogeneus medium from a stellar wind coming from its optical
          companion, an M-type giant star.

          Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Conference
          Proceedings of IAU Symp. 240
          We review the results of our analysis of the OGLE LMC eclipsing
          binaries (Mazeh, Tamuz & North 2006), using EBAS -- Eclipsing
          Binary Automated Solver, an automated algorithm to fit
          lightcurves of eclipsing binaries (Tamuz, Mazeh & North 2006).
          After being corrected for observational selection effects, the
          set of detected eclipsing binaries yielded the period
          distribution and the frequency of all LMC short-period
          binaries, and not just the eclipsing systems.
          Somewhat surprisingly, the period distribution is consistent
          with a flat distribution in log P between 2 and 10 days. The
          total number of binaries with periods shorter than 10 days in
          the LMC was estimated to be about 5000. This figure led us to
          suggest that (0.7 +- 0.4)% of the main-sequence A- and B-type
          stars are found in binaries with periods shorter than 10 days.
          This frequency is substantially smaller than the fraction of
          binaries found by small Galactic radial-velocity surveys of B
          stars.

          We present results for the spin-1 color-spin locking phase
          (CSL) using a NJL-type model in two flavor quark matter for
          compact stars applications. The CSL condensate is flavor
          symmetric and therefore charge and color neutrality can easily
          be satisfied. We find small energy gaps ~1 MeV, which make the
          CSL matter composition and the EoS not very different from the
          normal quark matter phase. We keep finite quark masses in our
          calculations and obtain no gapless modes that could have strong
          consequences in the late cooling of neutron stars. Finally, we
          show that the region of the phase diagram relevant for neutron
          star cores, when asymmetric flavor pairing is suppressed, could
          be covered by the CSL phase.

          Comments: ApJ, submitted
          Extremely low mass white dwarfs are very rare objects likely
          formed in compact binary systems. We present MMT optical
          spectroscopy of 42 low mass white dwarf candidates
          serendipitously discovered in a survey for hypervelocity B-type
          stars. One of these objects, SDSS J0917+46, has Teff= 11,288
          \pm 72 K and log g = 5.48 \pm 0.03; with an estimated mass of
          0.17 M_sun, it is the lowest gravity/mass white dwarf currently
          known. However, 40 of the low mass candidates are normal DA
          white dwarfs with apparently inaccurate SDSS g magnitudes. We
          revisit the identification of low mass white dwarf candidates
          previously found in the SDSS, and conclude that four objects
          have M < 0.2 M_sun. None of these white dwarfs show excess
          emission from a binary companion, and radial velocity searches
          will be necessary to constrain the nature of the unseen
          companions.

          Title: Binaries and the L Dwarf/T Dwarf Transition
          Authors: Adam J. Burgasser (MIT)
          Comments: 51 pages, 14 figures; accepted for publication in ApJ
          High-resolution imaging has revealed an unusually high binary
          fraction amongst objects spanning the transition between the L
          dwarf and T dwarf spectral classes. In an attempt to reproduce
          and unravel the origins of this apparent binary excess, I
          present a series of Monte Carlo mass function and multiplicity
          simulations of field brown dwarfs in the vicinity of the Sun.
          These simulations are based on the solar metallicity brown
          dwarf evolutionary models and incorporate empirical luminosity
          and absolute magnitude scales, measured multiplicity statistics
          and observed spectral templates in the construction and
          classification of composite binary spectra. In addition to
          providing predictions on the number and surface density
          distributions of L and T dwarfs for volume-limited and
          magnitude-limited samples, these simulations successfully
          reproduce the observed binary fraction distribution assuming an
          intrinsic (resolved) binary fraction of 11(+6)(-3)% (95%
          confidence interval), consistent with prior determinations.
          However, the true binary fraction may be as high as 40% if, as
          suggested by Liu et al., a significant fraction of L/T
          transition objects (~66%) are tightly-bound, unresolved
          multiples. The simulations presented here demonstrate that the
          binary excess amongst L/T transition objects arises primarily
          from the flattening of the luminosity scale over these spectral
          types and is not inherently the result of selection effects
          incurred in current magnitude-limited imaging samples. Indeed,
          the existence of a binary excess can be seen as further
          evidence that brown dwarfs traverse the L/T transition rapidly,
          possibly driven by a nonequilibrium submergence of photospheric
          condensates.

          Title: Multicolour CCD Measurements of Visual Double and
          Multiple Stars. III
          Authors: P. Lampens, A. Strigachev, D. Duval

          press (2006)
          Recent CCD observations were performed in the period 1998-2004
          for a large sample of visual double and multiple stars selected
          from the Hipparcos Catalogue and/or from the Gliese Catalogue
          of Nearby Stars. Accurate astrometric and photometric data
          allowing to characterize the individual components are
          provided. These data are confronted to Hipparcos data or to
          data from an older epoch in order to assess the nature of the
          observed systems. We simultaneously apply a Moffat-Lorentz
          profile with a similar shape to all detected components and
          adjust the profile parameters from which we obtain the relative
          astrometric position (epoch, position angle, angular
          separation) as well as differential multi-colour photometry
          (filters (B)VRI). We thus acquired recent data for 71 visual
          systems of which 6 are orbital binaries, 27 are nearby and 30
          are multiple systems. In three cases, the systems remained
          unresolved. 23 new components were detected and measured. Two
          new visual double stars of intermediate separation were also
          found. The estimated accuracies in relative position are 0.04
          deg and 0.01" respectively, while those in differential
          photometry are of the order of 0.01-0.02 mag in general. The
          nature of the association of 55 systems is evaluated. New basic
          binary properties are derived for 20 bound systems. Component
          colours and masses are provided for two orbital binaries.

          Title: The Be/X-ray transient 4U 0115+63/V635 Cassiopeiae. III.
          Quasi-cyclic variability

          form only
          4u 0115+63 is one of the most active and best studied Be/X-ray
          transients. Previous studies of 4u0115+63 have led to the
          suggestion that it undergoes relatively fast quasi-cyclic
          activity. However, due to the lack of good coverage of the
          observations, the variability time scales are uncertain. Our
          objective is to investigate the long-term behaviour of 4u
          0115+63 to confirm its quasi-cyclic nature and to explain its
          correlated optical/IR and X-ray variability. We have performed
          optical/IR photometric observations and optical spectroscopic
          observations of 4u 0115+63 over the last decade with
          unprecedented coverage. We have focused on the Halpha line
          variability and the long-term changes of the photometric
          magnitudes and colours and investigated these changes in
          correlation with the X-ray activity of the source. results The
          optical and infrared emission is characterised by cyclic
          changes with a period of ~ 5 years. This long-term variability
          is attributed to the state of the circumstellar disc around the
          Be star companion. Each cycle involves a low state when the
          disc is very weak or absent and the associated low amplitude
          variability is orbitally modulated and a high state when a
          perturbed disc precesses, giving rise to fast and large
          amplitude photometric changes. X-ray outbursts in 4u 0115+63
          come in pairs, i.e., two in every cycle. However, sometimes the
          second outburst is missing. Our results can be explained within
          the framework of the decretion disc model. The neutron star
          acts as the perturbing body, truncating and distorting the
          disc. The first outburst would occur before the disc is
          strongly perturbed. The second outburst leads to the dispersal
          of the disc and marks the end of the perturbed phase.

          Title: Merger of black hole-neutron star binaries in full
          general relativity
          Authors: Masaru Shibata, Koji Uryu
          Comments: 14 pages. To appear in a special issue of Classical
          and Quantum Gravity: New Frontiers in Numerical Relativity
          We present our latest results for simulation for merger of
          black hole (BH)-neutron star (NS) binaries in full general
          relativity which is performed preparing a quasicircular state
          as initial condition. The BH is modeled by a moving puncture
          with no spin and the NS by the $\Gamma$-law equation of state
          with $\Gamma=2$ and corotating velocity field as a first step.
          The mass of the BH is chosen to be $\approx 3.2 M_{\odot}$ or
          $4.0M_{\odot}$, and the rest-mass of the NS $\approx 1.4
          M_{\odot}$ with relatively large radius of the NS $\approx
          13$--14 km. The NS is tidally disrupted near the innermost
          stable orbit but $\sim 80$--90% of the material is swallowed
          into the BH and resulting disk mass is not very large as $\sim
          0.3M_{\odot}$ even for small BH mass $\sim 3.2M_{\odot}$. The
          result indicates that the system of a BH and a massive disk of
          $\sim M_{\odot}$ is not formed from nonspinning BH-NS binaries
          irrespective of BH mass, although a disk of mass $\sim
          0.1M_{\odot}$ is a possible outcome for this relatively small
          BH mass range as $\sim 3$--4$M_{\odot}$. Our results indicate
          that the merger of low-mass BH and NS may form a central engine
          of short-gamma-ray bursts.

          The fundamental properties of detached eclipsing binary stars
          can be measured very accurately, which could make them
          important objects for constraining the treatment of convection
          in theoretical stellar models. However, only four or five
          pieces of information can be found for the average system,
          which is not enough. We discuss studies of more interesting and
          useful objects: eclipsing binaries in clusters and eclipsing
          binaries with pulsating components.

          Science; Strongly Correlated Electrons
          Classic and recent results for gauge effects on the properties
          of the normal-to-superconducting phase transition in bulk and
          thin film superconductors are reviewed. Similar problems in the
          description of other natural systems (liquid crystals, quantum
          field theory, early universe) are also discussed. The
          relatively strong gauge effects on the fluctuations of the
          ordering field at low spatial dimensionality D and, in
          particular, in thin (quasi-2D) films are considered in details.
          A special attention is paid to the fluctuations of the gauge
          field. It is shown that the mechanism in which these gauge
          fluctuations affect on the order of the phase transition and
          other phase transition properties varies with the variation of
          the spatial dimensionality D. The problem for the experimental
          confirmation of the theoretical predictions about the order of
          the phase transitions in gauge systems is discussed.

          Title: Discovery of a nearby twin of SN1987A's nebula around
          the luminous blue variable HD168625: Was Sk--69 202 an LBV?
          Authors: Nathan Smith
          Comments: 14 pages, accepted by AJ
          Spitzer images of the luminous blue variable (LBV) candidate
          HD168625 reveal the existence of a bipolar nebula several times
          larger than its previously-known equatorial dust torus. The
          outer nebula of HD168625 has a full extent of about 80 arcsec
          or 0.85 pc, and one of the lobes has a well-defined polar ring.
          The nebula is a near twin of the triple-ring system around
          SN1987A. Because of these polar rings, and accounting for
          stellar/progenitor luminosity, HD168625 is an even closer twin
          of SN1987A than the B supergiant Sher 25 in NGC3603. HD168625's
          nebula was probably ejected during a giant LBV eruption and not
          during a red supergiant phase, so its similarity to the nebula
          around SN1987A may open new possibilities for the creation of
          SN1987A's rings. Namely, the hypothesis that Sk-69 202 suffered
          an LBV-like eruption would avert the complete surrender of
          single star models for its bipolar nebula by offering an
          alternative to an unlikely binary merger scenario. It also
          hints that LBVs are the likely progenitors of some type II
          supernovae, and that HD168625's nebula is a good example of a
          pre-explosion environment.

          3, 2005, ZARM, University of Bremen, 28359 Bremen, Germany
          Binary systems of compact objects are strong emitters of
          gravitational waves whose amplitude depends on the binary
          orbital parameters as the component mass, the orbital
          semi-major axis and eccentricity. Here, in addition to the
          famous Hulse-Taylor binary system, we have studied the
          possibility to detect the gravitational wave signal emitted by
          binary systems at the center of our galaxy. In particular,
          recent infrared observation of the galactic center have
          revealed the existence of a cluster of stars each of which
          appears to orbit the central black hole in $SgrA^*$. For the
          stars labelled as S2 and S14, we have studied the emitted
          spectrum of gravitational wave and compare it with the
          sensitivity threshold of space-based interferometers like Lisa
          and Astrod. Furthermore, following recent observations, we have
          considered the possibility that $SgrA^*$ is actually a binary
          system of massive black holes and calculated the emission
          spectrum as a function of the system parameters. The
          diffraction pattern of gravitational waves emitted by a binary
          system by a cluster of stars has been also analyzed. We remark
          that this is only a preliminary-theoretical work than can
          acquire more interest in view of the next-coming gravitational
          wave astronomy era.

          eds: T. Belloni et al. September 2006
          To gain a better understanding of high-energy Galactic sources,
          we observed the Galactic X-ray binary and black hole candidate
          XTE J1720-318 in the optical and near-infrared, just after the
          onset of its X-ray outburst in January, 2003. These
          observations were obtained with the ESO/NTT as a Target of
          Opportunity, in February and April 2003. We performed an
          accurate astrometry and analysed photometrical observations. We
          then produced a colour-magnitude diagram, looked at the overall
          evolution of the multi-wavelength light curve, and analysed the
          spectral energy distribution. We discovered the optical
          counterpart in the R-band (R ~ 21.5) and confirmed the
          near-infrared counterpart. We show that, for an absorption
          between 6 and 8 magnitudes, XTE J1720-318 is likely to be an
          intermediate mass X-ray binary located at a distance between 3
          and 10 kpc, hosting a main sequence star of spectral type
          between late B and early G. Our second set of observations took
          place simultaneously with the third secondary outburst present
          in X-ray and near-infrared light curves. The evolution of its
          spectral energy distribution shows that XTE J1720-318 entered a
          transition from a high-soft to a low-hard state in-between the
          two observations. We finally discuss the different phases of
          the outburst of this source in the general scheme of outbursts
          from microquasars.

          Comments: 16 pages, 17 figures, to be published in 'Astronomy
          and Astrophysics'
          We present a detailed analysis of Jupiter's X-ray (0.2-10 keV)
          auroral emissions as observed by XMM-Newton in Nov. 2003 and
          compare it with that of an Apr. 2003 observation. We discover
          the existence of an electron bremsstrahlung component in the
          aurorae, which accounts for essentially all the X-ray flux
          above 2 keV: its presence had been predicted but never detected
          for lack of sensitivity of previous X-ray missions. This
          bremsstrahlung component varied significantly in strength and
          spectral shape over the 3.5 days covered by the Nov. 2003
          observation, displaying substantial hardening of the spectrum
          with increasing flux. This variability may be linked to the
          strong solar activity taking place at the time, and may be
          induced by changes in the acceleration mechanisms inside
          Jupiter's magnetosphere. As in Apr. 2003, the auroral spectra
          below 2 keV are best fitted by a superposition of line emission
          most likely originating from ion charge exchange, with OVII
          playing the dominant role. We still cannot resolve conclusively
          the ion species responsible for the lowest energy lines (around
          0.3 keV), so the question of the origin of the ions
          (magnetospheric or solar wind) is still open. It is conceivable
          that both scenarios play a role in what is certainly a very
          complex planetary structure. High resolution spectra of the
          whole planet obtained with the XMM-Newton RGS in the range
          0.5-1 keV clearly separate emission lines (mostly of Fe)
          originating at low latitudes on Jupiter from the auroral lines
          due to O. These are shown to possess very broad wings which
          imply velocities of ~5000 km/s. Such speeds are consistent with
          the energies at which precipitating and charge exchanging O
          ions are expected to be accelerated in Jupiter's magnetosphere.
          Overall we find good agreement between our measurements and the
          predictions of recent models.

          Title: Theoretical orbital period distributions of cataclysmic
          variables above the period gap: effects of circumbinary disks
          Authors: B. Willems, R. Taam, U. Kolb, G. Dubus, E. Sandquist
          Comments: accepted for publication in ApJ
          The population of non magnetic cataclysmic variables evolving
          under the influence of a circumbinary disk is investigated for
          systems above the upper edge of the period gap at orbital
          periods greater than 2.75hr. For a fractional mass input rate
          into the disk, corresponding to 3e-4 of the mass transfer rate,
          the model systems exhibit a bounce at orbital periods greater
          than 2.75hr. The simulations reveal that (1) some systems can
          exist as dwarf nova type systems throughout their lifetime, (2)
          dwarf nova type systems can evolve into nova-like systems as
          their mass transfer rate increases with increasing circumbinary
          disk mass, and (3) nova-like systems can evolve back into dwarf
          nova systems during their postbounce evolution to longer
          orbital periods. Among these subclasses, nova-like cataclysmic
          variables would be the best candidates to search for
          circumbinary disks at wavelengths greater than 10 micron. The
          theoretical orbital period distribution of our population
          synthesis model is in reasonable accord with the combined
          population of dwarf novae and nova-like systems above the
          period gap, suggesting the possibility that systems with
          unevolved donors need not detach and evolve below the period
          gap as in the disrupted magnetic braking model. The resulting
          population furthermore reveals the possible presence of systems
          with small mass ratios (a property of systems exhibiting
          superhump phenomena at long orbital periods) and a preference
          of O/Ne/Mg white dwarfs in dwarf nova systems in comparison to
          nova-like systems. The importance of observational bias in
          accounting for the differing populations is examined, and it is
          shown that an understanding of these effects is necessary in
          order to confront the theoretical distributions with the
          observed ones in a meaningful manner. (abridged)

          Title: The crust of neutron stars
          Authors: Nicolas Chamel
          Comments: 9 pages, 2 figures, to appear in the Proceedings of
          the Tours Symposium on Nuclear Physics VI (2006)
          The structure of the crust of a neutron star is completely
          determined by the experimentally measured nuclear masses up to
          a density of the order of 10^11 g.cm^{-3}. At higher densities,
          the composition of the crust still remains uncertain, mainly
          due to the presence of ``free'' superfluid neutrons which
          affect the properties of the nuclear ``clusters''. After
          briefly reviewing calculations of the equilibrium structure of
          the crust, we point out that the current approach based on the
          Wigner-Seitz approximation does not properly describe the
          unbound neutrons. We have recently abandoned this approximation
          by applying the band theory of solids. We have shown that the
          dynamical properties of the free neutrons are strongly affected
          by the clusters by performing 3D calculations with Bloch
          boundary conditions.

          Title: Discovery of a nearby twin of SN1987A's nebula around
          the luminous blue variable HD168625: Was Sk--69 202 an LBV?
          Authors: Nathan Smith
          Comments: 14 pages, accepted by AJ
          Spitzer images of the luminous blue variable (LBV) candidate
          HD168625 reveal the existence of a bipolar nebula several times
          larger than its previously-known equatorial dust torus. The
          outer nebula of HD168625 has a full extent of about 80 arcsec
          or 0.85 pc, and one of the lobes has a well-defined polar ring.
          The nebula is a near twin of the triple-ring system around
          SN1987A. Because of these polar rings, and accounting for
          stellar/progenitor luminosity, HD168625 is an even closer twin
          of SN1987A than the B supergiant Sher 25 in NGC3603. HD168625's
          nebula was probably ejected during a giant LBV eruption and not
          during a red supergiant phase, so its similarity to the nebula
          around SN1987A may open new possibilities for the creation of
          SN1987A's rings. Namely, the hypothesis that Sk-69 202 suffered
          an LBV-like eruption would avert the complete surrender of
          single star models for its bipolar nebula by offering an
          alternative to an unlikely binary merger scenario. It also
          hints that LBVs are the likely progenitors of some type II
          supernovae, and that HD168625's nebula is a good example of a
          pre-explosion environment.

          3, 2005, ZARM, University of Bremen, 28359 Bremen, Germany
          Binary systems of compact objects are strong emitters of
          gravitational waves whose amplitude depends on the binary
          orbital parameters as the component mass, the orbital
          semi-major axis and eccentricity. Here, in addition to the
          famous Hulse-Taylor binary system, we have studied the
          possibility to detect the gravitational wave signal emitted by
          binary systems at the center of our galaxy. In particular,
          recent infrared observation of the galactic center have
          revealed the existence of a cluster of stars each of which
          appears to orbit the central black hole in $SgrA^*$. For the
          stars labelled as S2 and S14, we have studied the emitted
          spectrum of gravitational wave and compare it with the
          sensitivity threshold of space-based interferometers like Lisa
          and Astrod. Furthermore, following recent observations, we have
          considered the possibility that $SgrA^*$ is actually a binary
          system of massive black holes and calculated the emission
          spectrum as a function of the system parameters. The
          diffraction pattern of gravitational waves emitted by a binary
          system by a cluster of stars has been also analyzed. We remark
          that this is only a preliminary-theoretical work than can
          acquire more interest in view of the next-coming gravitational
          wave astronomy era.

          J1720-318: a transition from high-soft to low-hard state

          eds: T. Belloni et al. September 2006
          To gain a better understanding of high-energy Galactic sources,
          we observed the Galactic X-ray binary and black hole candidate
          XTE J1720-318 in the optical and near-infrared, just after the
          onset of its X-ray outburst in January, 2003. These
          observations were obtained with the ESO/NTT as a Target of
          Opportunity, in February and April 2003. We performed an
          accurate astrometry and analysed photometrical observations. We
          then produced a colour-magnitude diagram, looked at the overall
          evolution of the multi-wavelength light curve, and analysed the
          spectral energy distribution. We discovered the optical
          counterpart in the R-band (R ~ 21.5) and confirmed the
          near-infrared counterpart. We show that, for an absorption
          between 6 and 8 magnitudes, XTE J1720-318 is likely to be an
          intermediate mass X-ray binary located at a distance between 3
          and 10 kpc, hosting a main sequence star of spectral type
          between late B and early G. Our second set of observations took
          place simultaneously with the third secondary outburst present
          in X-ray and near-infrared light curves. The evolution of its
          spectral energy distribution shows that XTE J1720-318 entered a
          transition from a high-soft to a low-hard state in-between the
          two observations. We finally discuss the different phases of
          the outburst of this source in the general scheme of outbursts
          from microquasars.

          and Astrophysics'
          We present a detailed analysis of Jupiter's X-ray (0.2-10 keV)
          auroral emissions as observed by XMM-Newton in Nov. 2003 and
          compare it with that of an Apr. 2003 observation. We discover
          the existence of an electron bremsstrahlung component in the
          aurorae, which accounts for essentially all the X-ray flux
          above 2 keV: its presence had been predicted but never detected
          for lack of sensitivity of previous X-ray missions. This
          bremsstrahlung component varied significantly in strength and
          spectral shape over the 3.5 days covered by the Nov. 2003
          observation, displaying substantial hardening of the spectrum
          with increasing flux. This variability may be linked to the
          strong solar activity taking place at the time, and may be
          induced by changes in the acceleration mechanisms inside
          Jupiter's magnetosphere. As in Apr. 2003, the auroral spectra
          below 2 keV are best fitted by a superposition of line emission
          most likely originating from ion charge exchange, with OVII
          playing the dominant role. We still cannot resolve conclusively
          the ion species responsible for the lowest energy lines (around
          0.3 keV), so the question of the origin of the ions
          (magnetospheric or solar wind) is still open. It is conceivable
          that both scenarios play a role in what is certainly a very
          complex planetary structure. High resolution spectra of the
          whole planet obtained with the XMM-Newton RGS in the range
          0.5-1 keV clearly separate emission lines (mostly of Fe)
          originating at low latitudes on Jupiter from the auroral lines
          due to O. These are shown to possess very broad wings which
          imply velocities of ~5000 km/s. Such speeds are consistent with
          the energies at which precipitating and charge exchanging O
          ions are expected to be accelerated in Jupiter's magnetosphere.
          Overall we find good agreement between our measurements and the
          predictions of recent models.

          Title: Theoretical orbital period distributions of cataclysmic
          variables above the period gap: effects of circumbinary disks
          Authors: B. Willems, R. Taam, U. Kolb, G. Dubus, E. Sandquist
          Comments: accepted for publication in ApJ
          The population of non magnetic cataclysmic variables evolving
          under the influence of a circumbinary disk is investigated for
          systems above the upper edge of the period gap at orbital
          periods greater than 2.75hr. For a fractional mass input rate
          into the disk, corresponding to 3e-4 of the mass transfer rate,
          the model systems exhibit a bounce at orbital periods greater
          than 2.75hr. The simulations reveal that (1) some systems can
          exist as dwarf nova type systems throughout their lifetime, (2)
          dwarf nova type systems can evolve into nova-like systems as
          their mass transfer rate increases with increasing circumbinary
          disk mass, and (3) nova-like systems can evolve back into dwarf
          nova systems during their postbounce evolution to longer
          orbital periods. Among these subclasses, nova-like cataclysmic
          variables would be the best candidates to search for
          circumbinary disks at wavelengths greater than 10 micron. The
          theoretical orbital period distribution of our population
          synthesis model is in reasonable accord with the combined
          population of dwarf novae and nova-like systems above the
          period gap, suggesting the possibility that systems with
          unevolved donors need not detach and evolve below the period
          gap as in the disrupted magnetic braking model. The resulting
          population furthermore reveals the possible presence of systems
          with small mass ratios (a property of systems exhibiting
          superhump phenomena at long orbital periods) and a preference
          of O/Ne/Mg white dwarfs in dwarf nova systems in comparison to
          nova-like systems. The importance of observational bias in
          accounting for the differing populations is examined, and it is
          shown that an understanding of these effects is necessary in
          order to confront the theoretical distributions with the
          observed ones in a meaningful manner. (abridged)

          [Abridged] Contex. Young open clusters provide important clues
          to the interface between the main sequence and
          pre-main-sequence phases of stellar evolution. The young and
          nearby open cluster IC 2391 is well-suited to studies of these
          two evolutionary phases. Aims. We establish a bona fide set of
          cluster members and then analyze this set in terms of binary
          frequency, projected rotational velocities, [Fe/H], and lithium
          abundance. In the wake of the Hipparcos distance controversy
          for the Pleiades, we compare the main-sequence fitting distance
          modulus to the Hipparcos mean parallax for IC 2391. Results.
          The proper-motion survey covers a 6 times larger sky area than
          the prior targeted searches for cluster members in IC 2391. A
          total of 66 stars are considered bona fide cluster members down
          to a mass equivalent to 0.5M_sun. A quarter of them have been
          newly identified with many in the F2-K5 spectral range, which
          is crucial for a main-sequence fit. We find a mean [Fe/H] value
          of +0.06+/-0.06, when a solar abundance of log epsilon
          (Fe)=7.45 is adopted. The main sequence fitting yields a
          distance modulus that is 0.19 mag larger than that derived from
          Hipparcos parallaxes; thus this offset nearly has the size of a
          similar offset found for the Pleiades. The Li abundance pattern
          is similar to the earlier findings and is typical for a 40 Myr
          old open cluster.

          of Compact Objects and their Explosive Origins'', 2006 June
          11--24, Cefalu, Sicily, to be published by AIP
          I describe the current state of our knowledge of the mapping
          between the initial masses of stars and the compact objects --
          particularly neutron stars and black holes -- that they
          produce. Most of that knowledge is theoretical in nature, and
          relies on uncertain assumptions about mass loss through winds,
          binary mass transfer, and the amount of mass ejected during a
          supernovae. Observational constraints on the initial masses of
          stars that produce neutron stars and black holes is scarce.
          They fall into three general categories: (1) models of the
          stars that produced the supernova remnants associated with
          known compact objects, (2) scenarios through with high mass
          X-ray binaries were produced, and (3) associations between
          compact objects and coeval clusters of stars for which the
          minimum masses of stars that have undergone supernovae are
          known. I focus on the last category as the most promising in
          the near term. I describe three highly-magnetized neutron stars
          that have been associated with progenitors that had initial
          masses of $>$30\msun, and evaluate the prospects of finding
          further associations between star clusters and compact objects.

          Title: Compact star constraints on the high-density EoS
          Authors: H. Grigorian, D. Blaschke, T. Klahn
          Comments: 4 pages, 6 figures
          A new scheme for testing the nuclear matter (NM) equation of
          state (EoS) at high densities using constraints from compact
          star (CS) phenomenology is applied to neutron stars with a core
          of deconfined quark matter (QM). An acceptable EoS shall not to
          be in conflict with the mass measurement of 2.1 +/- 0.2 M_sun
          (1 sigma level) for PSR J0751+1807 and the mass-radius relation
          deduced from the thermal emission of RX J1856-3754. Further
          constraints for the state of matter in CS interiors come from
          temperature-age data for young, nearby objects. The CS cooling
          theory shall agree not only with these data, but also with the
          mass distribution inferred via population synthesis models as
          well as with LogN-LogS data. The scheme is applied to a set of
          hybrid EsoS with a phase transition to stiff, color
          superconducting QM which fulfills all above constraints and is
          constrained otherwise from NM saturation properties and flow
          data of heavy-ion collisions. We extrapolate our description to
          low temperatures and draw conclusions for the QCD phase diagram
          to be explored in heavy-ion collision experiments.

          s^{-1} in the 1-6 keV band. The spectrum can be described by a
          two-component PL+BB model, suggesting a mixture of thermal and
          magnetospheric emission. For a plausible hydrogen column
          density n_{H}=1.4 10^{22} cm^{-2}, the PL component has a slope
          Gamma=1.4+/-0.6 and a luminosity L_{psr}^{nonth}=4 10^{31}(d/4
          kpc)^2 ergs s^{-1}. The properties of the thermal component
          (kT=0.1-0.3 keV, L^{bol}=10^{31}-10^{33} ergs s^{-1}) are very
          poorly constrained because of the strong interstellar
          absorption. The compact, 7''\times4'', inner pulsar-wind nebula
          (PWN), elongated perpendicular to the pulsar's proper motion,
          is immersed in a fainter asymmetric emission. The observed flux
          of the PWN is (5.5+/-0.6) 10^{-14} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} in the
          1-8 keV band. The PWN spectrum fits by a PL model with
          Gamma=1.6+/-0.3, L=1.6 10^{32} (d/4 kpc})^2 ergs s^{-1}. The
          shape of the inner PWN suggests that the pulsar moves
          subsonically and X-ray emission emerges from a torus associated
          with the termination shock in the equatorial pulsar wind. The
          inferred PWN-pulsar properties (e.g., the PWN X-ray efficiency,
          L_{pwn}/\dot{E}~10^{-4}; the luminosity ratio,
          L_{pwn}/L_{psr}^{nonth}=4; the pulsar wind pressure at the
          termination shock, p_s=10^{-9} ergs cm^{-3}) are very similar
          to those of other subsonically moving Vela-like objects
          detected with Chandra (L_{pwn}/\dot{E}=10^{-4.5}-10^{-3.5},
          L_{pwn}/L_{psr}^{nonth}~5, p_s=10^{-10}-10^{-8} ergs cm^{-1}).

          Title: VLTI/AMBER interferometric observations of the recurrent

          Comments: Accepted in A&A
          We report on interferometric AMBER/VLTI observations of the
          recurrent nova RS Oph five days after its outburst on 2006 Feb
          12. Using three baselines from 44 to 86m, and a spectral
          resolution of 1500, we measured the extension of the emission
          in the K band continuum and in the BrG and HeI2.06 micron
          lines. The continuum visibilities were interpreted by fitting
          simple geometric models consisting of uniform and Gaussian
          ellipses, ring and binary models. The visibilities and
          differential phases in the BrG line were interpreted using
          skewed ring models aiming to perform a limited parametric
          reconstruction of the extension and kinematics of the line
          forming region. The limited uv coverage does not allow
          discrimination between filled models and rings. Binary models
          are discarded because the measured closure phase in the
          continuum is close to zero. The visibilities in the lines are
          at a low level compared to their nearby continuum, consistent
          with a more extended line forming region for HeI2.06 than BrG.
          The ellipse models for the continuum and for the lines are
          highly flattened and share the same position angle. Two radial
          velocity fields are apparent in the BrG line: a 'slow'
          expanding ring-like structure (v~1800km/s), and a 'fast'
          structure extended in the E-W direction (v~2500-3000km/s).
          These results confirm the basic fireball model, contrary to the
          conclusions of other interferometric observations conducted by
          Monnier et al. (2006).

          Authors: Renxin Xu (PKU)
          Comments: COSPAR2006 E1.3, submitted
          The magnetar model and the solid quark star model for anomalous
          X-ray pulsars/soft gamma-ray repeaters (AXPs/SGRs) are
          discussed. The pulsar-like stars manifesting variously are
          speculated to have different ambience and/or inner structure
          (mass and strain) in the solid quark star scenario. Relevant
          arguments made by the author's group are briefly summarized
          too.

          This article was co-authored by all invited speakers at the
          Joint Discussion on `Neutron Stars and Black Holes in Star
          Clusters,' which took place during the IAU General Assembly in
          Prague, Czech Republic, on August 17 and 18, 2006. Each section
          presents a short summary of recent developments in a key area
          of research, incorporating the main ideas expressed during the
          corresponding panel discussion at the meeting. Our meeting,
          which had close to 300 registered participants, was broadly
          aimed at the large community of astronomers around the world
          working on the formation and evolution of compact objects and
          interacting binary systems in dense star clusters, such as
          globular clusters and galactic nuclei. Great advances have
          occurred in this field during the past few years, including the
          introduction of fundamentally new theoretical paradigms for the
          formation and evolution of compact objects in binaries as well
          as countless new discoveries by astronomers that have
          challenged many accepted models. Some of the highlights
          include: a nearly complete census of all the millisecond
          pulsars in 47 Tuc; first detections of many new radio pulsars
          in other clusters, particularly Terzan 5; detailed studies of
          X-ray binary populations and their luminosity functions in many
          galaxies and extragalactic globular clusters; increasing
          evidence for intermediate-mass black holes in clusters and
          greatly improved theoretical understanding of their possible
          formation processes.

          Title: Improved age constraints for the AB Dor quadruple system
          - The binary nature of AB Dor B
          Authors: Markus Janson, Wolfgang Brandner, Rainer Lenzen, Laird
          Close, Eric Nielsen, Markus Hartung, Thomas Henning, Herve Bouy
          Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          We present resolved NACO photometry of the close binary AB Dor
          B in H- and Ks-band. AB Dor B is itself known to be a wide
          binary companion to AB Dor A, which in turn has a very low-mass
          close companion named AB Dor C. These four known components
          make up the young and dynamically interesting system AB Dor,
          which will likely become a benchmark system for calibrating
          theoretical pre-main sequence evolutionary mass tracks for
          low-mass stars. However, for this purpose the actual age has to
          be known, and this subject has been a matter of discussion in
          the recent scientific literature. We compare our resolved
          photometry of AB Dor Ba and Bb with theoretical and empirical
          isochrones in order to constrain the age of the system. This
          leads to an age estimate of about 50 to 100 Myr. We discuss the
          implications of such an age range for the case of AB Dor C, and
          compare with other results in the literature.

          Title: X-ray properties of the quasar HE0450-2958
          Authors: Xin-Lin Zhou, Fang Yang, Xiao-Rong Lv, Jian-Min Wang
          Comments: 23 pages, 8 figures, AJ in press
          We present an {\it XMM-Newton} EPIC observation of HE0450-2958
          which may be a ``naked''quasar as suggested by Magain et al.
          The \xmm EPIC spectra show a substantial soft X-ray excess, a
          steep photon index, as well as marginal evidence for a weak Fe
          K$\alpha$ line. The X-ray absorption is consistent with the
          galactic level. The 0.3-10 keV EPIC spectra can be fitted by a
          power law plus a blackbody model, however, the fit by the
          relativistically blurred photoionized disc reflection is
          better. We estimate the black hole mass of $2^{+7}_{-1.3}
          \times 10^{7} M_{\odot}$ from the X-ray variability. This
          broadly agrees with the value derived from the optical \hb line
          width. These results support a high-state Seyfert galaxy of the
          source. HE0450-2958 shares similar properties of transitionary
          objects from ultra-luminous infrared galaxies to quasars. We
          suggest that HE0450-2958 is just in the beginning of an optical
          quasar window.

          Title: A Survey for Young Spectroscopic Binary K7-M4 Stars in
          Ophiuchus
          Authors: L. Prato
          Comments: 30 pages, 6 figures; accepted in Astrophysical
          Journal
          This paper describes a high-resolution, infrared spectroscopic
          survey of young, low-mass stars designed to identify and
          characterize pre-main-sequence spectroscopic binaries. This is
          the first large infrared radial velocity survey of very young
          stars to date. The frequency and mass ratio distribution of the
          closest, low-mass binaries bear directly on models of stellar,
          brown dwarf, and planetary mass companion formation.
          Furthermore, spectroscopic binaries can provide mass ratios and
          ultimately masses, independent of assumptions, needed to
          calibrate models of young star evolution. I present the initial
          results from observations of a uniform sample of 33 T Tauri M
          stars in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud. The average mass of
          this sample is less than that of other young star radial
          velocity surveys of similar scope by a factor of ~2. Almost
          every star was observed at 3-4 epochs over 3 years with the 10
          meter Keck II telescope and the facility infrared spectrometer
          NIRSPEC. An internal precision of 0.43 km/s was obtained with
          standard cross-correlation calibration techniques. Four of the
          targets are newly discovered spectroscopic binaries, one of
          which is located in a sub-arcsecond, hierarchical quadruple
          system. Three other sub-arcsecond visual binaries were also
          serendipitously identified during target acquisition. The
          spectroscopic multiplicity of the sample is comparable to that
          of earlier type, pre-main-sequence objects. Therefore, there is
          no dearth of young, low-mass spectroscopic binary stars, at
          least in the Ophiuchus region.

          Comments: Submitted to A&A
          We present X-ray and 12CO(J=1-0) observations of the
          very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray source HESS J1813-178 with the
          aim of understanding the origin of the gamma-ray emission.
          Using this dataset we are able to undertake spectral and
          morphological studies of the X-ray emission from this object
          with greater precision than previous studies. NANTEN
          12CO(J=1-0) data are used to search for correlations of the
          gamma-ray emission with molecular clouds which could act as
          target material for gamma-ray production in a hadronic
          scenario. The NANTEN 12CO(J=1-0) observations show a giant
          molecular cloud of mass 2.5 10^5 M$_{\sun}$ at a distance of 4
          kpc in the vicinity of HESS J1813-178. Even though there is no
          direct positional coincidence, this giant cloud might have
          influenced the evolution of the gamma-ray source and its
          surroundings. The X-ray data show a highly absorbed non-thermal
          X-ray emitting object coincident with the previously known ASCA
          source AX J1813-178 showing a compact core and an extended tail
          towards the north-east, located in the centre of the radio
          shell-type Supernova remnant (SNR) G12.82-0.2. This central
          object shows morphological and spectral resemblance to a Pulsar
          Wind Nebula (PWN) and we therefore consider that the object is
          very likely to be a composite SNR. We discuss the scenario in
          which the gamma-rays originate in the shell of the SNR and the
          one in which they originate in the central object. We
          demonstrate, that in order to connect the core X-ray emission
          to the VHE gamma-ray emission electrons have to be accelerated
          to energies of at least 1 PeV.

          Nebulae in the Galactic Center

          Brandt, S. Park (Penn State), M. R. Morris (UCLA)
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures (2 color). submitted to ApJL
          Based on three years of deep observations of the Galactic
          center with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we report the
          discovery of changes in the intensities and morphologies of two
          hard X-ray nebulosities. The nebulosities are dominated by
          fluorescent iron emission, and are coincident with molecular
          clouds. The morphological changes are manifest on parsec
          scales, which requires that these iron features are scattered
          X-rays from a 2 or 3-year-long outburst of a point source
          (either Sgr A* or an X-ray binary) with a luminosity of at
          least 1e37 erg/s. The variability precludes the hypotheses that
          these nebulae either are produced by keV electrons bombarding
          molecular clouds, or are iron-rich ejecta from supernovae.
          Moreover, the morphologies of the reflection nebulae implies
          that the dense regions of the clouds are filamentary, with
          widths of ~0.3 pc and lengths of ~2 pc.

          Gamma-ray astrophysics depends in many ways on multiwavelength
          studies. The Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) Large
          Area Telescope (LAT) Collaboration has started multiwavelength
          planning well before the scheduled 2007 launch of the
          observatory. Some of the high-priority multiwavelength needs
          include: (1) availability of contemporaneous radio and X-ray
          timing of pulsars; (2) expansion of blazar catalogs, including
          redshift measurements; (3) improved observations of molecular
          clouds, especially at high galactic latitudes; (4) simultaneous
          broad-band blazar monitoring; (5) characterization of gamma-ray
          transients, including gamma ray bursts; (6) radio, optical,
          X-ray and TeV counterpart searches for reliable and effective
          sources identification and characterization. Several of these
          activities are needed to be in place before launch.

          gamma-ray observations

          (Third Workshop on the Nature of Unidentified High-Energy
          Sources)", Barcelona, July 4-7, 2006
          In a novel approach in observational high-energy gamma-ray
          astronomy, observations carried out by imaging atmospheric
          Cherenkov telescopes provide necessary templates to pinpoint
          the nature of intriguing, yet unidentified EGRET gamma-ray
          sources. Using GeV-photons detected by CGRO EGRET and taking
          advantage of high spatial resolution images from H.E.S.S.
          observations, we were able to shed new light on the EGRET
          observed gamma-ray emission in the Kookaburra complex, whose
          previous coverage in the literature is somewhat contradictory.
          3EGJ1420-6038 very likely accounts for two GeV gamma-ray
          sources (E>1 GeV), both in positional coincidence with the
          recently reported pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) by HESS in the
          Kookaburra/Rabbit complex. PWN associations at VHE energies,
          supported by accumulating evidence from observations in the
          radio and X-ray band, are indicative for the PSR/plerionic
          origin of spatially coincident, but still unidentified Galactic
          gamma-ray sources from EGRET. This not only supports the
          already suggested connection between variable, but unidentified
          low-latitude gamma-ray sources with pulsar wind nebulae
          (3EGJ1420-6038 has been suggested as PWN candidate previoulsy),
          it also documents the ability of resolving apparently confused
          EGRET sources by connecting the GeV emission as measured from a
          large-aperture space-based gamma-ray instrument with narrow
          field-of-view but superior spatial resolution observations by
          ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, a very promising
          identification technique for achieving convincing individual
          source identifications in the era of GLAST-LAT.

          Hartkopf, E. Guinan & P. Harmanec (Cambridge Univ. Press)
          We have analysed publicly available MACHO observations of 6833
          variable stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, classified as
          eclipsing binaries. After finding that a significant fraction
          of the sample was misclassified, we redetermined periods and
          variability class for all stars, producing a clean sample of
          3031 eclipsing binaries. We have investigated their
          distribution in the period-color-luminosity space, which was
          used, for example, to assign a foreground probability to every
          object and establish new period-luminosity relations to
          selected types of eclipsing stars. We found that the orbital
          period distribution of LMC binaries is very similar to those of
          the SMC and the Milky Way. We have also determined the rate of
          period change for every star using the O-C method, discovering
          about 40 eclipsing binaries with apsidal motion, 45 systems
          with cyclic period changes and about 80 stars with parabolic
          O-C diagrams. In a few objects we discovered gradual amplitude
          variation, which can be explained by changes in the orbital
          inclination caused by a perturbing third body in the system.

          We propose to determine the mass and the radius of a neutron
          star (NS) using three measurable mass-radius relationships,
          namely the ``apparent'' radius inferred from neutron star
          thermal emission, the gravitational redshift inferred from the
          absorption lines, as well as the averaged stellar mass density
          inferred from the orbital Keplerian frequency derived from the
          kilohertz quasi periodic oscillation (kHz QPO) data. We apply
          the method to constrain the NS mass and the radius of the X-ray
          sources, 1E 1207.4-5209, Aql X-1 and EXO 0748-676.

          Detached eclipsing binaries are very useful objects for
          calibrating theoretical stellar models and checking their
          predictions. Detached eclipsing binaries in open clusters are
          particularly important because of the additional constraints on
          their age and chemical composition from their membership of the
          cluster. I compile a list containing absolute parameters of
          well-studied eclipsing binaries in open clusters, and present
          new observational data on the B-type systems V1481 Cyg and
          V2263 Cyg which are members of the young open cluster NGC 7128.

          Title: Torsional Oscillations of Relativistic Stars with Dipole
          Magnetic Fields II. Global Alfv\'en Modes

          We investigate torsional Alfv\'{e}n modes of relativistic stars
          with a global dipole magnetic field. It has been noted recently
          (Glampedakis et al. 2006) that such oscillation modes could
          serve as as an alternative explanation (in contrast to
          torsional crustal modes) for the SGR phenomenon, if the
          magnetic field is not confined to the crust. We compute global
          Alfv\'{e}n modes for a representative sample of equations of
          state and magnetar masses, in the ideal MHD approximation and
          ignoring $\ell \pm 2$ terms in the eigenfunction. We find that
          the presence of a realistic crust has a negligible effect on
          Alfv\'{e}n modes for $B > 4\times 10^{15}$ G. Furthermore, we
          find strong avoided crossings between torsional Alfv\'{e}n
          modes and torsional crust modes. For magnetar-like magnetic
          field strengths, the spacing between consecutive Alfv\'{e}n
          modes is of the same order as the gap of avoided crossings. As
          a result, it is not possible to identify modes of predominantly
          crustal character and all oscillations are predominantly
          Alfv\'{e}n-like. Interestingly, we find excellent agreement
          between our computed frequencies and observed frequencies in
          two SGRs, for a maximum magnetic field strenght in the range of
          (0.8--1.2)$\times 10^{16}$ G.

          Title: Parsec-scale Constraints on the Ionized Interstellar
          Medium with the Terzan 5 Pulsars
          Authors: Scott M. Ransom (NRAO)
          Comments: 6 pages, 2 color figures. For the proceedings of the
          "SINS - Small Ionized and Neutral Structures in the Diffuse
          Interstellar Medium" meeting, edited by M. Haverkorn & W. M.
          Goss
          Over the past two years, we used a series of GBT observations
          to uncover at least 33 millisecond pulsars in the globular
          cluster Terzan 5 located in the Galactic bulge. We now have 32
          timing solutions for the pulsars which give us precise
          positions and dispersion measures (DMs) and indicate that the
          DMs are dominated by variations in the integrated electron
          density along the slightly different sight lines towards the
          pulsars. At a distance of ~8.7 kpc, angular separations between
          the pulsars range from 0.4"-100" and correspond to projected
          physical separations of 0.01-4 pc, giving us a unique probe
          into the ionized ISM properties on these scales. Our
          measurement of the DM structure function toward Terzan 5 is not
          inconsistent with Kolmogorov-like electron density fluctuations
          in the ISM on scales ranging from at least 0.2-2 pc.

          Title: Pulsar spins from an instability in the accretion shock
          of supernovae
          Authors: John M. Blondin, Anthony Mezzacappa
          Comments: To be published in Nature
          Rotation-powered radio pulsars are born with inferred initial
          rotation periods of order 300 ms (some as short as 20 ms) in
          core-collapse supernovae. In the traditional picture, this fast
          rotation is the result of conservation of angular momentum
          during the collapse of a rotating stellar core. This leads to
          the inevitable conclusion that pulsar spin is directly
          correlated with the rotation of the progenitor star. So far,
          however, stellar theory has not been able to explain the
          distribution of pulsar spins, suggesting that the birth
          rotation is either too slow or too fast. Here we report a
          robust instability of the stalled accretion shock in
          core-collapse supernovae that is able to generate a strong
          rotational flow in the vicinity of the accreting proto-neutron
          star. Sufficient angular momentum is deposited on the
          proto-neutron star to generate a final spin period consistent
          with observations, even beginning with spherically symmetrical
          initial conditions. This provides a new mechanism for the
          generation of neutron star spin and weakens, if not breaks, the
          assumed correlation between the rotational periods of supernova
          progenitor cores and pulsar spin.

          common proper motion of the components and their similar
          spectrophotometric distances (19+/-2 pc). The projected

          Title: Linear growth of spiral SASI modes in core-collapse
          supernovae
          Authors: John M. Blondin, Samantha Shaw
          Comments: To be published in The Astrophysical Journal
          Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations have shown that the
          post-bounce accretion shock in core collapse supernovae is
          subject to the Spherical Accretion Shock Instability, or SASI.
          Recent three-dimensional simulations have revealed the
          existence of a non-axisymmetric mode of the SASI as well, where
          the postshock flow displays a spiral pattern. Here we
          investigate the growth of these spiral modes using
          two-dimensional simulations of the post-bounce accretion flow
          in the equatorial plane of a core-collapse supernova. By
          perturbing a steady-state model we are able to excite both one,
          two and three-armed spiral modes that grow exponentially with
          time, demonstrating that these are linearly unstable modes
          closely related to the original axisymmetric sloshing modes. By
          tracking the distribution of angular momentum, we show that
          these modes are able to efficiently separate the angular
          momentum of the accretion flow (which maintains a net angular
          momentum of zero), leading to a significant spin-up of the
          underlying accreting proto-neutron star.

          Title: Turning Points in the Evolution of Isolated Neutron
          Stars' Magnetic Fields
          Authors: U. Geppert
          Comments: Comments: 37 pages and 14 figures. Paper presented
          (in part) at the 363-rd Heraeus Seminar in Bad Honef, Germany.
          The paper will be published as a Springer Lecture Notes.
          Submitted for refereeing
          During the life of isolated neutron stars (NSs) their magnetic
          field passes through a variety of evolutionary phases.
          Depending on its strength and structure and on the physical
          state of the NS (e.g. cooling, rotation), the field looks
          qualitatively and quantitatively different after each of these
          phases. Three of them, the phase of MHD instabilities
          immediately after NS's birth, the phase of fallback which may
          take place hours to months after NS's birth, and the phase when
          strong temperature gradients may drive thermoelectric
          instabilities, are concentrated in a period lasting from the
          end of the proto--NS phase until 100, perhaps 1000 years, when
          the NS has become almost isothermal. The further evolution of
          the magnetic field proceeds in general inconspicuous since the
          star is in isolation. However, as soon as the product of Larmor
          frequency and electron relaxation time, the so-called
          magnetization parameter, locally and/or temporally considerably
          exceeds unity, phases, also unstable ones, of dramatic changes
          of the field structure and magnitude can appear. An overview is
          given about that field evolution phases, the outcome of which
          makes a qualitative decision regarding the further evolution of
          the magnetic field and its host NS.

          We present a partial analysis of a multi-wavelength study of
          the X-ray binary Cir X-1, a system harboring the most
          relativistic outflow in our galaxy so far. The data were taken
          (almost) simultaneously in radio and X ray during a survey
          carried out in October 2000 and December 2002. Cir X-1 was
          observed at the radio frequencies of 4.8 and 8.6 GHz with the
          Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). In the X-ray spectral
          domain we used the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). We found
          strong evidence for flaring activity in radio not only at the
          periastron but also at the apoastron passages. A comparison of
          our data against different correlations between radio and X ray
          found in other neutron star systems shows that Cir X-1 does not
          seem to follow the general trend. However, the fact that Cir
          X-1 is an `exotic' X-ray binary makes any interpretation more
          complicated.

          We report the discovery of oscillations at 1122 +/- 0.3 Hz in
          an X-ray burst from the X-ray transient XTE J1739-285. The
          signal has a peak Leahy power of 42.8 and, after consideration
          of the number of trials, has a chance probability of occurrence
          of 4E-5 equivalent to a 4.2 sigma detection. The oscillation
          frequency suggests that XTE J1739-285 contains the fastest
          rotating neutron star yet found. We also found millisecond
          quasiperiodic oscillations in the persistent emission with
          frequencies ranging from 757 Hz to 862 Hz. We detected seven
          X-ray bursts and derive an upper limit on the source distance
          of about 10.6 kpc from the brightest burst.

          Title: Associations of Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Sources
          Discovered by H.E.S.S. with Pulsar Wind Nebulae
          Authors: Yves A. Gallant, for the H.E.S.S. Collaboration
          Comments: 5 pages, to appear in Astrophysics and Space Science
          (proceedings of "The Multi-Messenger Approach to High-Energy
          Gamma-Ray Sources")
          The H.E.S.S. array of imaging Cherenkov telescopes has
          discovered a number of previously unknown gamma-ray sources in
          the very high energy (VHE) domain above 100 GeV. The good
          angular resolution of H.E.S.S. (~0.1 degree per event), as well
          as its sensitivity (a few percent of the Crab Nebula flux) and
          wide 5-degree field of view, allow a much better constrained
          search for counterparts in comparison to previous instruments.
          In several cases, the association of the VHE sources revealed
          by H.E.S.S. with pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) is supported by a
          combination of positional and morphological evidence,
          multi-wavelength observations, and plausible PWN model
          parameters. These include the plerions in the composite
          supernova remnants G 0.9+0.1 and MSH 15-52, the recently
          discovered Vela X nebula, two new sources in the Kookaburra
          complex, and the association of HESS J1825-137 with PSR
          B1823-13. The properties of these better-established
          associations are reviewed. A number of other sources discovered
          by H.E.S.S. are located near high spin-down power pulsars, but
          the evidence for association is less complete. These possible
          associations are also discussed, in the context of the
          available multi-wavelength data and plausible PWN scenarios.

          the postshock flow displays a spiral pattern. Here we
          investigate the growth of these spiral modes using
          two-dimensional simulations of the post-bounce accretion flow
          in the equatorial plane of a core-collapse supernova. By
          perturbing a steady-state model we are able to excite both one,
          two and three-armed spiral modes that grow exponentially with
          time, demonstrating that these are linearly unstable modes
          closely related to the original axisymmetric sloshing modes. By
          tracking the distribution of angular momentum, we show that
          these modes are able to efficiently separate the angular
          momentum of the accretion flow (which maintains a net angular
          momentum of zero), leading to a significant spin-up of the
          underlying accreting proto-neutron star.

          Title: Turning Points in the Evolution of Isolated Neutron
          Stars' Magnetic Fields
          Authors: U. Geppert
          Comments: Comments: 37 pages and 14 figures. Paper presented
          (in part) at the 363-rd Heraeus Seminar in Bad Honef, Germany.
          The paper will be published as a Springer Lecture Notes.
          Submitted for refereeing
          During the life of isolated neutron stars (NSs) their magnetic
          field passes through a variety of evolutionary phases.
          Depending on its strength and structure and on the physical
          state of the NS (e.g. cooling, rotation), the field looks
          qualitatively and quantitatively different after each of these
          phases. Three of them, the phase of MHD instabilities
          immediately after NS's birth, the phase of fallback which may
          take place hours to months after NS's birth, and the phase when
          strong temperature gradients may drive thermoelectric
          instabilities, are concentrated in a period lasting from the
          end of the proto--NS phase until 100, perhaps 1000 years, when
          the NS has become almost isothermal. The further evolution of
          the magnetic field proceeds in general inconspicuous since the
          star is in isolation. However, as soon as the product of Larmor
          frequency and electron relaxation time, the so-called
          magnetization parameter, locally and/or temporally considerably
          exceeds unity, phases, also unstable ones, of dramatic changes
          of the field structure and magnitude can appear. An overview is
          given about that field evolution phases, the outcome of which
          makes a qualitative decision regarding the further evolution of
          the magnetic field and its host NS.

          We present a partial analysis of a multi-wavelength study of
          the X-ray binary Cir X-1, a system harboring the most
          relativistic outflow in our galaxy so far. The data were taken
          (almost) simultaneously in radio and X ray during a survey
          carried out in October 2000 and December 2002. Cir X-1 was
          observed at the radio frequencies of 4.8 and 8.6 GHz with the
          Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). In the X-ray spectral
          domain we used the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). We found
          strong evidence for flaring activity in radio not only at the
          periastron but also at the apoastron passages. A comparison of
          our data against different correlations between radio and X ray
          found in other neutron star systems shows that Cir X-1 does not
          seem to follow the general trend. However, the fact that Cir
          X-1 is an `exotic' X-ray binary makes any interpretation more
          complicated.

          We report the discovery of oscillations at 1122 +/- 0.3 Hz in
          an X-ray burst from the X-ray transient XTE J1739-285. The
          signal has a peak Leahy power of 42.8 and, after consideration
          of the number of trials, has a chance probability of occurrence
          of 4E-5 equivalent to a 4.2 sigma detection. The oscillation
          frequency suggests that XTE J1739-285 contains the fastest
          rotating neutron star yet found. We also found millisecond
          quasiperiodic oscillations in the persistent emission with
          frequencies ranging from 757 Hz to 862 Hz. We detected seven
          X-ray bursts and derive an upper limit on the source distance
          of about 10.6 kpc from the brightest burst.

          Title: Associations of Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Sources
          Discovered by H.E.S.S. with Pulsar Wind Nebulae
          Authors: Yves A. Gallant, for the H.E.S.S. Collaboration
          Comments: 5 pages, to appear in Astrophysics and Space Science
          (proceedings of "The Multi-Messenger Approach to High-Energy
          Gamma-Ray Sources")
          The H.E.S.S. array of imaging Cherenkov telescopes has
          discovered a number of previously unknown gamma-ray sources in
          the very high energy (VHE) domain above 100 GeV. The good
          angular resolution of H.E.S.S. (~0.1 degree per event), as well
          as its sensitivity (a few percent of the Crab Nebula flux) and
          wide 5-degree field of view, allow a much better constrained
          search for counterparts in comparison to previous instruments.
          In several cases, the association of the VHE sources revealed
          by H.E.S.S. with pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) is supported by a
          combination of positional and morphological evidence,
          multi-wavelength observations, and plausible PWN model
          parameters. These include the plerions in the composite
          supernova remnants G 0.9+0.1 and MSH 15-52, the recently
          discovered Vela X nebula, two new sources in the Kookaburra
          complex, and the association of HESS J1825-137 with PSR
          B1823-13. The properties of these better-established
          associations are reviewed. A number of other sources discovered
          by H.E.S.S. are located near high spin-down power pulsars, but
          the evidence for association is less complete. These possible
          associations are also discussed, in the context of the
          available multi-wavelength data and plausible PWN scenarios.

          Title: PSR B1828-11: a precession pulsar torqued by a quark
          planet?
          Authors: K. Liu (PKU), Y. L. Yue (PKU), R. X. Xu (PKU)
          Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures
          The pulsar PSR B1828-11 has long-term, highly periodic and
          correlated variations in both pulse shape and the rate of
          slow-down. This phenomenon may provide evidence for precession
          of the pulsar as suggested previously within the framework of
          free precession as well as forced one. Based on the presumption
          of forced precession, we propose a quark planet model to this
          precession phenomenon instead. In the model, the pulsar is
          torqued by a quark planet. We construct this model by
          constraining mass of the pulsar ($M_{\rm psr}), mass of the
          planet ($M_{\rm pl}$) and orbital radius of the planet ($r_{\rm
          pl}$). Five aspects are considered: derived relation between
          $M_{\rm psr}$ and $r_{\rm pl}$, movement of the pulsar around
          the center of mass, ratio of $M_{\rm psr}$ and $M_{\rm p}$,
          gravitational wave radiation timescale of the planetary system,
          and death-line criterion. We also calculate the range of
          precession period derivative and gravitational wave strength
          (at earth) by the model. Under reasonable parameters, the
          observed phenomenon can be understood by a pulsar
          ($10^{-4}\sim10^{-1}M_{\odot}$) with a quark planet
          ($10^{-8}\sim10^{-3}M_{\odot}$) orbiting it. According to the
          calculations presented, the pulsar would be a quark star
          because of its low mass, which might eject a lump of quark
          matter (to become a planet around) during its birth.

          Title: Models of alpha Centauri A and B with and without
          seismic constraints: time dependence of the mixing-length
          parameter
          Authors: M. Yildiz
          Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures, to be published in MNRAS
          The $\alpha$ Cen binary system is a well-known stellar system
          with very accurate observational constraints to structure of
          its component stars. In addition to the classical non-seismic
          constraints, there are also seismic constraints for the
          interior models of $\alpha$ Cen A and B. These two types of
          constraint give very different values for the age of the
          system. While we obtain 8.9 Gyr for the age of the system from
          the non-seismic constraints, the seismic constraints imply that
          the age is about 5.6-5.9 Gyr. There may be observational or
          theoretical reasons for this discrepancy, which can be found by
          careful consideration of similar stars. The $\alpha$ Cen binary
          system, with its solar type components, is also suitable for
          testing the stellar mass dependence of the mixing-length
          parameter for convection derived from the binaries of Hyades.
          The values of the mixing-length parameter for $\alpha$ Cen A
          and B are 2.10 and 1.90 for the non-seismic constraints. If we
          prioritize to the seismic constraints, we obtain 1.64 and 1.91
          for $\alpha$ Cen A and B, respectively. By taking into account
          of these two contrasting cases for stellar mass dependence of
          the mixing-length parameter, we derive two expressions for its
          time dependence, which are also compatible with the mass
          dependence of the mixing-length parameter derived from the
          Hyades stars. For assessment, these expressions should be
          tested in other stellar systems and clusters.

          Authors: S. Oslowski, R. Moderski, T. Bulik, K. Belczynski
          Comments: Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics
          The population of solitary compact objects in the Galaxy is
          very diffcult to investigate. In this paper we analyze the
          possibility of using microlensing searches to detect and to
          analyze the properties of the solitary black holes and neutron
          stars. Evolution of single and binary stars is considered using
          the StarTrack population synthesis code. We investigate the
          properties of the Galactic population of compact objects
          numerically. We find that the compact object lensing events are
          concentrated in a region with the radius of $\approx 5$ degrees
          around the Galactic center. The distribution of masses of the
          lenses for the models we consider differs but only slightly
          from the underlying massdistribution. The expected detection
          rates are of the order of a few per year.

          It is shown that behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy is the
          key quantity in the stability consideration in neutron star

          Comments: Invited talk at conference on "Solitary Neutron
          Stars", London, 2006
          X-ray emission following giant flares of magnetars can be
          categorized into three categories of time scales (a) short term
          afterglow (b) medium term afterglow and (c) long term
          afterglow. Short term afterglow, which declines over several
          hours, seems to correspond to gravitational resettling of
          uplifted material. Medium term afterglow, which declines over
          several weeks or months, appears to be the cooling of the
          heated outer crust, and long term afterglow, which declines
          over a period of many years, can be understood to be the
          cooling of the inner crust. The long term afterglow profile may
          be a very sensitive indicator of neutron star mass.

          We aim to investigate the nature of the high energy source KS
          1741-293 by revisiting the radio and infrared associations
          proposed in the early 1990s. Our work is mostly based on the
          analysis of modern survey and archive data, including the NRAO,
          MSX, 2MASS and Chandra archives, and catalogues. We also have
          obtained deep CCD optical observations by ourselves. The
          coincidence of KS 1741-293 with an extended radio and
          far-infrared source, tentatively suggested in 1994, is no
          longer supported by modern observational data. Instead, a
          Chandra source is the only peculiar object found to be
          consistent with all high-energy error circles of KS 1741-293
          and we propose it to be its most likely X-ray counterpart. We
          also report the existence of a non-thermal radio nebula in the
          vicinity of the KS 1741-293 position with the appearance of a
          supernova remnant. The possibility of being associated to this
          X-ray binary is discussed.

          Comments: 10 pages; 3 figures; accepted by A&A
          HD 167971 is a triple system consisting of a 3.3-day eclipsing
          binary (O5-8 V + O5-8 V) and an O8 supergiant. It is also a
          well known non-thermal radio emitter. We observed the radio
          emission of HD 167971 with the Very Large Array (VLA) and the
          Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). By combining these
          data with VLA archive observations we constructed a radio
          lightcurve covering a 20-yr time-range. We searched for, but
          failed to find, the 3.3-day spectroscopic period of the binary
          in the radio data. This could be due to the absence of
          intrinsic synchrotron radiation at the colliding-wind region
          between the two components of the eclipsing binary, or due to
          the large amount of free-free absorption that blocks the
          synchrotron radiation. We are able to explain many of the
          observed characteristics of the radio data if the non-thermal
          emission is produced in a colliding-wind region between the
          supergiant and the combined winds of the binary. Furthermore,
          if the system is gravitationally bound, the orbital motion
          occurs over a period of ~ 20 years, or longer, as suggested by
          the long-term variability in the radio data. We argue that the
          variability is due to the free-free absorption that changes
          with orbital phase or may also in part be due to changes in
          separation, should the orbit be eccentric.

          Based on the magnetorotational model of a supernova explosion
          with core collapse, we investigate the significant processes of
          neutrino heating of the supernova shock. These processes should
          be taken into account in self-consistent modeling, since the
          neutrino heating mechanism is capable of increasing the
          explosion efficiency. We show that, even in the presence of a
          strong magnetic field in the shock formation region, the
          heating rate is determined with good accuracy by the absorption
          and emission of neutrinos in direct URCA processes. Moreover,
          the influence on them of a magnetic field is reduced to
          insignificant corrections.

          From a long time series of high resolution (R=115,000) HARPS
          spectra and simultaneous broad-band photometry, we report new
          evidence for magnetospheric accretion as well as ejection
          processes in the nearly edge-on classical T Tauri star AA Tau.
          AA Tau's light curve is modulated with a period of 8.22d. The
          recurrent luminosity dips are due to the periodic occultation
          of the central star by the magnetically-warped inner disk edge
          located at about 9 Rstar. Balmer line profiles exhibit a clear
          rotational modulation of high-velocity redshifted absorption
          components with a period of 8.22 days as well, with a maximum
          strength when the main accretion funnel flow passes through the
          line of sight. At the same time, the luminosity of the system
          decreases by about 1 mag, indicative of circumstellar
          absorption of the stellar photosphere by the
          magnetically-warped, corotating inner disk edge. The
          photospheric and HeI radial velocities also exhibit periodic
          variations, and the veiling is modulated by the appearance of
          the accretion shock at the bottom of the accretion funnel.
          Diagnostics of hot winds and their temporal behaviour are also
          presented.
          The peculiar geometry of the young AA Tau system (nearly
          edge-on) allows us to uniquely probe the acretion-ejection
          region close to the star. We find that most spectral and
          photometric diagnostics vary as expected from models of
          magnetically-channelled accretion in young stars, with a large
          scale magnetosphere tilted by 20 deg onto the star's spin axis.
          We also find evidence for time variability of the
          magnetospheric accretion flow on a timescale of a few
          rotational periods.

          Title: Halo Wide Binaries and Moving Clusters as probes of the
          Dynamical and Merger History of our Galaxy
          Authors: Christine Allen, Arcadio Poveda, A.

          2006)
          Wide or fragile pairs are sensitive probes of the galactic
          potential, and they have been used to provide information about
          the galactic tidal field, the density of GMC and the masses of
          dark matter perturbers present in both the disk and the halo.
          Halo wide binaries and moving clusters, since they are likely
          to be the remains of past mergers or of dissolved clusters, can
          provide information on the dynamical and merger history of our
          Galaxy. Such remnants should continue to show similar motions
          over times of the order of their ages. We have looked for phase
          space groupings among the low-metallicity stars of Schuster et
          al. (2006) and have identified a number of candidate moving
          clusters. In several of the moving clusters we found a wide CPM
          binary already identified in our catalogue of wide binaries
          among high-velocity and metal-poor stars (Allen et al 2000a).
          Spectroscopic follow-up studies of these stars would confirm
          the physical reality of the groups, as well as allow us to
          distinguish whether their progenitors are dissolved clusters or
          accreted extragalactic systems

          Journal-ref: Astrophysical Journal, 652, 576 (2006)
          We have collected data spanning seven years of observations of
          the magnetar 4U 0142+61 in the infrared, optical and soft
          X-rays. These combine our own observations and analysis of
          archival data. We find that the source is variable in the
          optical, in contrast to what had been previously reported, that
          the K-band flux can vary by over a magnitude on the time-scale
          of days, and that the X-ray pulsed flux is not obviously
          correlated with either the total X-ray flux or infrared and
          optical fluxes. Furthermore, from multi-color photometry of the
          source within single nights, we conclude that there are two
          separate components to the infrared emission. The overall
          picture is unclear, and prompts the need for further, more
          frequent observations.

          Title: First attempt to dynamically constrain the quadrupole
          mass moment of millisecond pulsars
          Authors: Lorenzo Iorio
          Comments: LaTex2e, 11 pages, no figures, 4 tables, 25
          references
          In this paper we attempt to dynamically constrain the
          quadrupole mass moment Q of the millisecond PSR B1257+12 pulsar
          from the orbital periods of its three planets, assumed to be in
          equatorial and circular orbits. Given the present-day accuracy
          in knowing their ephemerides, no post-Newtonian corrections to
          their motions are required. By conservatively assuming 1% and
          10% uncertainties in the pulsar's mass and planets' semimajor
          axes, respectively, our determination of the adimensional
          parameter q=c^4 Q/G^2 M^3 is q=(-0.90 +/- 67.45) 10^12, so that
          Q=(-1.08 +/- 80.22) 10^49 kg m^2. As an independent check of
          such a result, we apply the same method to the binary system
          composed by the millisecond PSR J1909-3744 pulsar and a white
          dwarf in circular orbit. We find for such a pulsar q=(-0.76 +/-
          21.18) 10^12 and Q=(-0.98 +/- 27.26) 10^49 kg m^2, which are
          consistent with the estimates for PSR B1257+12.

          In this letter we dynamically determine the quadrupole mass
          moment Q of the magnetic white dwarf WD 0137-349 by analyzing
          the period of the recently discovered brown dwarf moving around
          it in a close 2-hr orbit. It turns out that a purely Newtonian
          model for the orbit of WD 0137-349B, assumed circular and
          equatorial, is adequate, given the present-day accuracy in
          knowing the orbital parameters of such a binary system. Our
          result is Q=(-1.4615 +/- 0.9004) 10^47 kg m^2. It is the first
          dynamical, model-independent measurement of the quadrupole mass
          moment of a white dwarf.

          Title: Mass Transfer in Close, Rapidly Accreting Protobinaries:
          An Origin for Massive Twins?
          Authors: Mark R. Krumholz, Todd A. Thompson (Princeton
          University)
          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, emulateapj format, submitted to
          ApJ
          Rapidly accreting massive protostars undergo a phase of
          deuterium shell burning during pre-main sequence evolution that
          causes them to swell to tenths of an AU in radius. During this
          phase, those with close binary companions will overflow their
          Roche lobes and begin transferring mass. Since massive stars
          frequently have companions at distances well under 1 AU, this
          process may affect the early evolution of a substantial
          fraction of massive stars. We use a simple protostellar
          evolution model to determine the range in accretion rates, mass
          ratios, and orbital separations for which mass transfer will
          occur, and we compute approximately the stability and final
          outcome of the transfer process. We discuss how mass transfer
          affects the demographics of massive binaries, and show that it
          provides a natural explanation for the heretofore unexplained
          population of massive "twins", high mass binaries with mass
          ratios very close to unity.

          Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ApJ
          [abridged] We report results from four recent observations of
          the ultracompact LMXB pulsar 4U 1626-67. All the observations
          obtained high-resolution X-ray spectra of the system, two from
          the Chandra X-ray Observatory using the HETGS, and two from the
          XMM-Newton Observatory using the RGS as well as the EPIC PN and
          MOS. These data allow us to study in detail the prominent Ne
          and O emission line complexes which make 4U 1626-67 unique
          among LMXBs. The observations were spaced over a period of 3
          years for a total observing time of 238 ks, allowing us to
          monitor the line regions as well as the overall source flux,
          continuum spectrum, and timing properties. The structure of the
          emission lines and the ratios of the components of the
          helium-like Ne IX and O VII triplets support the hypothesis
          that they are formed in the high-density environment of the
          accretion disk. We do not find any significant changes in the
          line widths or ratios over this time period, though we note
          that the line equivalent widths decrease. We are able to place
          constraints on the strengths of the Ne K, Fe L, and O K
          photoelectric absorption edges, and find that the data do not
          require an overabundance of Ne or O in the system relative to
          the expected ISM values. We find that the pulsar is still
          spinning down, and note that the pulse profile has changed
          significantly from what was found prior to the torque reversal
          in 1990, suggesting that this event may be linked to a change
          in the geometry of the accretion column. The flux of 4U 1626-67
          continues to decrease, in keeping with the trend of the last
          approximately 30 years over which it has been observed. Taking
          into consideration current theory on disk stability, we expect
          that 4U 1626-67 will enter a period of quiescence in 2-15
          years.

          Algol (Beta Persei) from the Analysis of Absorption Lines in
          the UV Spectra Obtained by the IUE Satellite
          Authors: Kristen Wecht
          Comments: Presented to the Graduate and Research Committee of
          Lehigh University in Candidacy for the Degree of Doctor of
          Philosophy in Physics, Lehigh University, April 2006
          The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) archive of
          high-resolution ultraviolet spectra of the eclipsing
          semi-detached binary star, Algol (Beta Persei, HD 19356), taken
          from September 1978 to September 1989, is analyzed in order to
          characterize the movement of gas within and from this system.
          Light curves are constructed, using a total of 1647 continuum
          level measurements. These results support the semidetached
          status of this interacting binary star. Radial velocities,
          residual intensities, full width half maxima (FWHM), line
          asymmetries, and equivalent widths of UV absorption lines for
          aluminum, magnesium, iron, and silicon in a range of ionization
          states are determined and analyzed. For selected epochs, we
          were able to isolate gas stream and photospheric contributions
          by an examination of the differences between spectral line
          shapes. We observed variations in line shape and strength, with
          orbital phase and epoch, indicating the presence of stable gas
          streams and circumstellar gas, and periods of increased
          mass-transfer activity associated with transient gas streams.
          The 1989 data indicates moderate activity. This epoch was
          examined most closely since it provides the greatest phase
          coverage. Spectral line profiles in 1978 and 1984 have the
          strongest gas-flow absorption components, indicating that these
          are the epochs of the greatest activity. The dense phase
          coverage in September 1989 allows us to measure the mass loss
          rate from Algol B into Algol A which is of order ~10E-14 solar
          masses per year. Since the highest gas-flow velocities are in
          the 100 kilometer per second range, well below escape velocity,
          we conclude that systemic mass loss due to gas flow is small
          for the Algol system.

          Radial-velocity measurements and sine-curve fits to the orbital
          radial velocity variations are presented for ten close binary
          systems: OO Aql, CC Com, V345 Gem, XY Leo, AM Leo, V1010 Oph,
          V2612 Oph, XX Sex, W UMa, and XY UMa. Most of these binaries
          have been observed spectroscopically before, but our data are
          of higher quality and consistency than in the previous studies.
          While most of the studied eclipsing pairs are contact binaries,
          V1010 Oph is probably a detached or semi-detached double-lined
          binary and XY UMa is a detached, chromospherically active
          system whose broadening functions clearly show well defined and
          localized dark spots on the primary component. A particularly
          interesting case is XY Leo, which is a member of visually
          unresolved quadruple system composed of a contact binary and a
          detached, non-eclipsing, active binary with 0.805 days orbital
          period. V345 Gem and AM Leo are known members of visual
          binaries. We found faint visual companions at about 2-3 arcsec
          from XX Sex and XY UMa.

          Authors: P.-E. Tremblay, P. Bergeron
          Comments: 41 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We review the available near- and mid-infrared photometry for
          white dwarfs obtained from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey
          (2MASS) and by the Spitzer Space Telescope. Both data sets have
          recently been used to seek white dwarfs with infrared excesses
          due to the presence of unresolved companions or circumstellar
          disks, and also to derive the atmospheric parameters of cool
          white dwarfs. We first attempt to evaluate the reliability of
          the 2MASS photometry by comparing it with an independent set of
          published JHK CIT magnitudes for 160 cool white dwarf stars,
          and also by comparing the data with the predictions of detailed
          model atmosphere calculations. The possibility of using 2MASS
          to identify unresolved M dwarf companions or circumstellar
          disks is then discussed. We also revisit the analysis of 46
          binary candidates from Wachter et al. using the synthetic flux
          method and confirm the large near-infrared excesses in most
          objects. We perform a similar analysis by fitting Spitzer 4.5
          and 8 micron photometric observations of white dwarfs with our
          grid of model atmospheres, and demonstrate the reliability of
          both the Spitzer data and the theoretical calculations up to 8
          micron. Finally, we search for massive disks resulting from the
          merger of two white dwarfs in a 2MASS sample composed of 57
          massive degenerates, and show that massive disks are uncommon
          in such stars.

          Title: Wave Modes in the Magnetospheres of Pulsars and
          Magnetars
          Authors: Chen Wang, Dong Lai
          Comments: 18 pages, 9 figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          We study the wave propagation modes in the relativistic
          streaming pair plasma of the magnetospheres of pulsars and
          magnetars, focusing on the effect of vacuum polarization. We
          show that the combined plasma and vacuum polarization effects
          give rise to a vacuum resonance, where ``avoided mode
          crossing'' occurs between the extraordinary mode and the
          (superluminous) ordinary mode. When a photon propagates from
          the vacuum-polarization-dominated region at small radii to the
          plasma-dominated region at large radii, its polarization state
          may undergo significant change across the vacuum resonance. We
          map out the parameter regimes (e.g., field strength, plasma
          density and Lorentz factor) under which the vacuum resonance
          occurs and examine how wave propagation is affected by the
          resonance. Some possible applications of our results are
          discussed, including high-frequency radio emission from pulsars
          and possibly magnetars, and optical/IR emission from neutron
          star surfaces and inner magnetospheres.

          We present photometric and spectroscopic studies of the white
          dwarf (WD) populations in the intermediate-age open clusters
          NGC 6633 and NGC 7063 as part of the ongoing Lick-Arizona White
          Dwarf Survey (LAWDS). Using wide-field CCD imaging, we locate
          41 candidate WDs in the two cluster fields: 32 in NGC 6633, and
          9 in NGC 7063. Spectroscopic observations confirm 13 of these
          candidates to be bona-fide WDs. We describe in detail our
          Balmer line fitting technique for deriving effective
          temperatures and surface gravities from optical DA WD spectra
          and apply the technique to the 11 DA WDs in the sample. Of
          these, only two DA WDs are at the cluster distance moduli, one
          in each cluster. Two more DAs lie 0.75 mag foreground to NGC
          6633, raising the possibility that these are double degenerate
          systems in the cluster. If nearly equal-mass binaries, both of
          these systems likely have combined masses above the
          Chandrasekhar limit. One DB WD is found to be consistent with
          membership in NGC 6633, which would make this the third
          confirmed He-atmosphere WD in an open cluster, though further
          data are needed to confirm cluster membership. The WD
          consistent with membership in the cluster NGC 7063 has a low
          mass (~0.4 Mo), suggesting it may be a He-core WD resulting
          from close binary evolution. Three of the eleven
          hydrogen-atmosphere WDs in this study are observed to have Ca
          II absorption; the number of DAZs in this study is consistent
          with previous observations that ~25% of field WDs are DAZs.

          Title: The diocotron instability in a pulsar cylindrical
          electrosphere
          Authors: J. Petri
          Comments: Accepted by A&A
          The physics of the pulsar inner magnetosphere remains poorly
          constrained by observations. Although about 2000 pulsars have
          been discovered to date, little is known about their emission
          mechanism. Large vacuum gaps probably exist and a non-neutral
          plasma made of electrons in some regions and of positrons in
          some other regions fills space to form an electrosphere. The
          purpose of this work is to study the stability properties of
          the differentially rotating equatorial disk in the pulsar's
          electrosphere for which the magnetic field is assumed to be
          dipolar. In contrast to previous studies, the magnetic field is
          not restricted to be uniform. A pseudo-spectral Galerkin method
          using Tchebyshev polynomials expansion is developed to compute
          the spectrum of the diocotron instability in a non-neutral
          plasma column confined between two cylindrically conducting
          walls. Moreover, the inner wall carries a given charge per unit
          length in order to account for the presence of a charged
          neutron star at the centre of the electrosphere. We show
          several eigenfunctions and eigenspectra obtained for different
          initial density profiles and electromagnetic field
          configurations useful for laboratory plasmas. The algorithm is
          very efficient in computing the fastest growing modes.
          Applications to a cylindrical electrosphere are also shown for
          several differential rotation profiles. It is found that the
          growth rates of the diocotron instability are of the same order
          of magnitude as the rotation rate.

          Title: General Relativistic Radiative Transfer
          Authors: S. Knop, P. H. Hauschildt, E. Baron
          We present a general method to calculate radiative transfer
          including scattering in the continuum as well as in lines in
          spherically symmetric systems that are influenced by the
          effects of general relativity (GR). We utilize a comoving
          wavelength ansatz that allows to resolve spectral lines
          throughout the atmosphere. The used numerical solution is an
          operator splitting (OS) technique that uses a characteristic
          formal solution. The bending of photon paths and the wavelength
          shifts due to the effects of GR are fully taken into account,
          as is the treatment of image generation in a curved spacetime.
          We describe the algorithm we use and demonstrate the effects of
          GR on the radiative transport of a two level atom line in a
          neutron star like atmosphere for various combinations of
          continuous and line scattering coefficients. In addition, we
          present grey continuum models and discuss the effects of
          different scattering albedos on the emergent spectra and the
          determination of effective temperatures and radii of neutron
          star atmospheres.

          Title: Accretion Disk Spectra of the Brightest Ultra-luminous
          X-ray Source in M82

          Comments: 17 pages, 2 figures; accepted by ApJ
          Emission spectra of hot accretion disks characteristic of
          advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) models are
          investigated for comparison with the brightest ultra-luminous
          source, X-1, in the galaxy M82. If the spectral state of the
          source is similar to the low luminosity hard state of stellar
          mass black holes in our Galaxy, a fit to the {\it Chandra}
          X-ray spectrum and constraints from the radio and infrared
          upper limits, require a black hole mass in the range of $9
          \times 10^4 - 5 \times 10^5 \msun$. Lower black hole masses
          ($\la 10^4 \msun$) are possible if M82 X-1 corresponds to the
          high luminosity hard state of Galactic black hole X-ray binary
          sources. Both of these spectrally degenerate hot accretion disk
          solutions lead to an intermediate mass black hole
          interpretation for M82 X-1. Since these solutions have
          different spectral variability with X-ray luminosity and
          predict different infrared emission, they can be distinguished
          by future off axis {\it Chandra} observations or simultaneous
          sensitive infrared detections.

          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, Accepted for publication by MNRAS
          We present a precise timing analysis of the accreting
          millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338 during its 2003 outburst,
          observed by RXTE. A full orbital solution is given for the
          first time; Doppler effects induced by the motion of the source
          in the binary system were corrected, leading to a refined
          estimate of the orbital period, P_orb=15388.7229(2)s, and of
          the projected semimajor axis, a sini/c= 390.633(9) lt-ms. We
          could then investigate the spin behaviour of the accreting
          compact object during the outburst. We report here a refined
          value of the spin frequency (nu=314.35610879(1) Hz) and the
          first estimate of the spin frequency derivative of this source
          while accreting (nu^dot=(-6.7 +/- 0.7) 10^(-14) Hz/s). This
          spin down behaviour arises when both the fundamental frequency
          and the second harmonic are taken into consideration. We
          discuss this in the context of the interaction between the disc
          and the quickly rotating magnetosphere, at accretion rates
          sufficiently low to allow a threading of the accretion disc in
          regions where the Keplerian velocity is slower than the
          magnetosphere velocity. We also present indications of a jitter
          of the pulse phases around the mean trend, which we argue
          results from movements of the accreting hotspots in response to
          variations of the accretion rate.

          Title: Recent Results from RHIC & Some Lessons for Cosmic-Ray
          Physicists
          Authors: Spencer R. Klein
          Comments: 8 pgs; invited talk presented at the XIVth
          International Symposium on Very High Energy Cosmic Ray
          Interactions (ISVHECRI 2006)
          The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) studies nuclear
          matter under a variety of conditions. Cold nuclear matter is
          probed with deuteron-gold collisions, while hot nuclear
          matter(possibly a quark-gluon plasma (QGP)) is created in
          heavy-ion collisions. The distribution of spin in polarized
          nucleons is measured with polarized proton collisions, and
          photoproduction is studied using the photons that accompany
          heavy nuclei.
          The deuteron-gold data shows less forward particle production
          than would be expected from a superposition of $pp$ collisions,
          as expected due to saturation/shadowing. Particle production in
          $AA$ collisions is well described by a model of an expanding
          fireball in thermal equilibrium. Strong hydrodynamic flow and
          jet quenching shows that the the produced matter interacts very
          strongly. These phenomena are consistent with new
          non-perturbative interactions near the transition temperature
          to the QGP.
          This writeup will discuss these results, and their implications
          for cosmic-ray physicists.

          We investigate the evolution over the last 6.3 Gyr of cosmic
          time (i.e., since z ~ 0.7) of the average X-ray properties of
          early-type galaxies within the Extended Chandra Deep
          Field-South (E-CDF-S). Our early-type galaxy sample includes
          539 objects with red-sequence colors and Sersic indices larger
          than n = 2.5, which were selected jointly from the COMBO-17
          (Classifying Objects by Medium-Band Observations in 17 Filters)
          and GEMS (Galaxy Evolution from Morphologies and SEDs) surveys.
          We utilize the deep Chandra observations over the E-CDF-S and
          X-ray stacking analyses to constrain primarily the average
          X-ray emission from "normal" early-type galaxies (i.e., those
          that are not dominated by luminous active galactic nuclei
          [AGNs]). In our analyses, we study separately optically
          luminous (L_B ~ 10^[10-11] L_B,sol) and faint (L_B ~
          10^[9.3-10] L_B,sol) galaxy samples, which we expect to have
          soft (0.5-2.0 keV) X-ray emission dominated by hot (~1 keV)
          interstellar gas and low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) populations,
          respectively. We detect individually 49 (~9%) of our galaxies
          in the X-ray band, and classify these sources as either normal
          early-type galaxies (17 galaxies) or AGN candidates (32
          galaxies). The AGN fraction of our optically luminous samples
          evolves with redshift in a manner consistent with the (1+z)^3
          evolution observed in other investigations of X-ray-selected
          AGNs. After removing potential AGNs from our samples, we find
          that the X-ray-to-B-band mean luminosity ratio (L_X/L_B) for
          optically luminous early-type galaxies does not evolve
          significantly over the redshift range z~0.0-0.7. This lack of
          X-ray evolution implies a general balance between the heating
          and cooling of the hot interstellar gas [Abridged].

          We present results of a multi-wavelength program to study the
          faint discrete X-ray source population discovered by Chandra in
          the Galactic Centre (GC). From IR imaging obtained with the VLT
          we identify candidate K-band counterparts to 75% of the X-ray
          sources in our sample. By combining follow-up VLT K-band
          spectroscopy of a subset of these candidate counterparts with
          the magnitude limits of our photometric survey, we suggest that
          only a small percentage of the sources are HMXBs, while the
          majority are likely to be canonical LMXBs and CVs at the
          distance of the GC. In addition, we present our discovery of
          highly structured small-scale (5-15") extinction towards the
          Galactic Centre. This is the finest-scale extinction study of
          the Galactic Centre to date. Finally, from these VLT
          observations we are able to place constraints on the stellar
          counterpart to the ``bursting pulsar'' GRO J1744-28.

          Comments: 15 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ApJ
          Is there a stellar upper mass limit? Recent statistical work
          seems to indicate that there is and that it is in the vicinity
          of 150 solar masses. In this paper we use HST and ground-based
          data to investigate the brightest members of the cluster Pismis
          24, which was previously inferred to have a mass greater than
          200 solar masses, in apparent disagreement with that limit. We
          determine that Pismis 24-1 is composed of at least three
          objects, the resolved Pismis 24-1SW and the unresolved
          spectroscopic binary Pismis 24-1NE. The evolutionary zero-age
          masses of those two objects and that of the nearby Pismis 24-17
          are all approximately 100 solar masses, very large but under
          the stellar upper mass limit.

          We investigate the long-term evolution and observability of
          remnants originating from the merger of compact binary systems
          and discuss the differences to supernova remnants. Compact
          binary mergers expel much smaller amounts of mass at much
          higher velocities, as compared to supernovae, which will affect
          the dynamical evolution of their remnants. The ejecta of
          mergers consist of very neutron rich nuclei. Some of these
          neutron rich nuclei will produce observational signatures in
          form of gamma ray lines during their decay. The composition of
          the ejecta might even give interesting constraints about the
          internal structure of the neutron star. We further discuss the
          possibility that merger remnants appear as recently discovered
          'dark accelerators' which are extended TeV sources which lack
          emission in other bands.

          We observed 69 A3-F8 main sequence binary star systems using
          the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer onboard the
          Spitzer Space Telescope. We find emission significantly in
          excess of predicted photospheric flux levels for 9(+4/-3)% and
          40(+7/-6)% of these systems at 24 and 70 microns, respectively.
          Twenty two systems total have excess emission, including four
          systems that show excess emission at both wavelengths. A very
          large fraction (nearly 60%) of observed binary systems with
          small (<3 AU) separations have excess thermal mission. We
          interpret the observed infrared excesses as thermal emission
          from dust produced by collisions in planetesimal belts. The
          incidence of debris disks around main sequence A3-F8 binaries
          is marginally higher than that for single old AFGK stars.
          Whatever combination of nature (birth conditions of binary
          systems) and nurture (interactions between the two stars)
          drives the evolution of debris disks in binary systems, it is
          clear that planetesimal formation is not inhibited to any great
          degree. We model these dust disks through fitting the spectral
          energy distributions and derive typical dust temperatures in
          the range 100--200 K and typical fractional luminosities around
          10^-5, with both parameters similar to other Spitzer-discovered
          debris disks. Our calculated dust temperatures suggest that
          about half the excesses we observe are derived from
          circumbinary planetesimal belts and around one third of the
          excesses clearly suggest circumstellar material. Three systems
          with excesses have dust in dynamically unstable regions, and we
          discuss possible scenarios for the origin of this short-lived
          dust.

          consequences for gravitational-wave detection
          Authors: Krzysztof Belczynski, Vassiliki Kalogera, Frederic A.
          Rasio, Ronald E. Taam, Tomasz Bulik
          Comments: 5 pages, submitted to ApJ Letters
          Double-black-hole binaries are among the most important sources
          of gravitational radiation for ground-based detectors such as
          LIGO or Virgo. Even if formed with lower efficiency than
          double-neutron-star binaries, they can dominate the predicted
          detection rates, since black holes are more massive than
          neutron stars and therefore could be detected at greater
          distances. Here we discuss a new binary evolution process that
          can very significantly limit the formation of close
          double-black-hole binaries: the vast majority of their
          potential progenitors undergo a common-envelope (CE) phase
          while the donor, one of the massive binary components, is
          evolving through the Hertzsprung gap. Our latest theoretical
          understanding of the CE process suggests that this will always
          leads to a merger, preventing the double-black-hole formation.
          Using population synthesis calculations, we find that the
          corresponding reduction in the merger rate of double black
          holes formed in galactic fields is so great (by \~500) that
          their contribution to inspiral detection rates for ground-based
          detectors could become relatively small (~ 1 in 20) compared to
          double-neutron-star binaries. Our predicted detection rates for
          Advanced LIGO are now much lower for double black holes (~2 per
          yr), but are still high for double neutron stars (~40 per yr).
          If double black holes were found to be dominant in the detected
          inspiral signals, this could indicate that they mainly
          originate from dense star clusters (not included here) or that
          our theoretical modeling of the CE phase needs significant
          revision.

          disc-blackbody model with a range of other models, namelly a
          more complex physical model based on a power-law component
          slightly modified at various energies by smeared
          emission/absorption lines from highly-ionized gas. Our main
          conclusion is that the presence of a soft excess, or a soft
          deficit, depends entirely on the energy range to which we
          choose to fit the ``true'' power-law continuum; hence, we argue
          that those components should not be taken as evidence for
          accretion disc emission, nor used to infer BH masses. We
          speculate that bright ULXs could be in a spectral state similar
          to (or an extension of) the steep-power-law state of Galactic
          BH candidates, in which the disc is completely comptonized and
          not directly detectable, and the power-law emission may be
          modified by the surrounding, fast-moving, ionized gas.

          Title: The instability of planetary systems in binaries: how
          the Kozai mechanism leads to strong planet-planet interactions
          Authors: D. Malmberg, M. B. Davies, John E. Chambers
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          In this letter we consider the evolution of a planetary system
          around a star inside a wide binary. We simulate numerically the
          evolution of the planetary orbits for both co-planar and
          highly-inclined systems. We find that the Kozai mechanism
          operates in the latter case. This produces a highly eccentric
          outer planet whose orbit crosses those of some of the inner
          planets. Strong planet-planet interactions then follow
          resulting in the ejection of one or more planets. We note that
          planetary systems resembling our solar system, formed around
          single stars in stellar clusters may exchange into binaries and
          thus will be vulnerable to planet stripping. This process will
          reduce the number of solar-system like planetary systems, and
          may produce at least some of the observed extra-solar planets.

          In recent years, an increasing number of proper motions have
          been measured for Galactic X-ray binaries. When supplemented
          with accurate determinations of the component masses, orbital
          period, and donor luminosity and effective temperature, these
          kinematical constraints harbor a wealth of information on the
          systems' past evolution. The constraints on compact object
          progenitors and kicks derived from this are of immense value
          for understanding compact object formation and exposing common

          Some recent results on rotating self-gravitating configurations
          composed with Bosons and Fermions are reported. Given a star
          composed of both Bosons and Fermions without interaction, it is
          shown that it is possible to obtain stable slowly rotating
          configurations by using the same perturbative relativistic
          method that usually describes neutron stars.

          A forefront area of research concerns the exploration of the
          properties of hadronic matter under extreme conditions of
          temperature and density, and the determination of the equation
          of state--the relation between pressure, temperature and
          density--of such matter. Experimentally, relativistic heavy-ion
          collision experiments enable physicists to cast a brief glance
          at hot and ultra-dense matter for times as little as about
          $10^{-22}$ seconds. Complementary to this, the matter that
          exists in the cores of neutron stars, observed as radio
          pulsars, X-ray pulsars, and magnetars, is at low temperatures
          but compressed permanently to ultra-high densities that may be
          more than an order of magnitude higher than the density of
          atomic nuclei. This makes pulsars superb astrophysical
          laboratories for medium and high-energy nuclear physics, as
          discussed in this paper.

          Title: Compact Binaries as Sources of Gravitational Radiation
          Authors: M. Coleman Miller (University of Maryland)
          Comments: To appear in the proceedings of the meeting "The
          Multicoloured Landscape of Compact Objects and their Explosive
          Origins", Cefalu, Italy, June 2006, to be published by AIP,
          Eds. L. Burderi et al
          With current terrestrial gravitational wave detectors working
          at initial design sensitivities, and upgrades and space
          missions planned, it is likely that in the next five to ten
          years gravitational radiation will be detected directly from a
          variety of classes of objects. The most confidently expected of
          these classes is compact binaries, involving neutron stars or
          black holes. Detection of their coalescence, or their long-term
          orbits, has the potential to inform us about the evolutionary
          history of compact binaries and possibly even star formation
          over the past several billion years. We review what is
          currently known about compact binaries as sources of
          gravitational radiation, as well as the current uncertainties
          and what we expect to learn from future detections of
          gravitational waves from these systems.

          Aims: Study the high-mass X-ray binary X-7 in M33 using
          broad-band optical data.
          Methods: We used recently published CFHT r' and i' data for
          variable stars in M33 to extract the light curve of the optical
          counterpart of X-7. We combined these data with DIRECT B and V
          measurements in order to search for an independent optical
          modulation with the X-ray periodicity. The periodic modulation
          is modelled with the ellipsoidal effect. We used UBVRr'i'
          magnitudes of the system to constrain the temperature and
          radius of the optical component.
          Results: The optical data revealed a periodicity of 3.4530 +-
          0.0014 days, which is consistent with the known X-ray period.
          Double modulation, which we attributed to ellipsoidal
          modulation, is clearly seen in four different optical bands.
          The absolute magnitude in six optical bands is most consistent
          with a stellar counterpart with 33000 < T_{eff} < 47000 K and
          15 < R < 20 R_{\sun}. We modelled the optical periodic
          modulation and derived the masses of the two components as a
          function of the orbital inclination and the radius of the
          stellar component. The resulting mass range for the compact
          object is 1.3 < M < 23 M_{\sun}.
          Conclusions: The system is probably a black hole HMXB, similar
          to Cyg X-1, LMC X-1 and LMC X-3.

          The recent discovery of burst oscillations at 1122 Hz in the
          x-ray transient XTE J1739-285, together with the measurement of
          the mass of the binary millisecond pulsar PSR J0751+1807 (2.1
          +- 0.2 solar masses) can finally allow us to put strong,
          model-independent observational constraints to the equation of
          state of compact stars. We show that the measurement of the
          moment of inertia of PSR J0737+3039A, together with these
          constraints, could allow to discriminate further the details of
          the inner structure of neutron stars. Moreover, we show that if
          XTE J1739-285 is constituted of nucleonic matter, any equation
          of state allows only a narrow range of very high masses, and
          this could explain why up to now compact stars spinning faster
          than a millisecond have been so difficult to detect.

          Coalescing binary black holes experience a ``kick'' due to
          anisotropic emission of gravitational waves with an amplitude
          as great as ~200 km/s. We examine the orbital evolution of
          black holes that have been kicked from the centers of triaxial
          galaxies. Time scales for orbital decay are generally longer in
          triaxial galaxies than in equivalent spherical galaxies, since
          a kicked black hole does not return directly through the dense
          center where the dynamical friction force is highest. We
          evaluate this effect by constructing self-consistent triaxial
          models and integrating the trajectories of massive particles
          after they are ejected from the center; the dynamical friction
          force is computed directly from the velocity dispersion tensor
          of the self-consistent model. We find return times that are
          several times longer than in a spherical galaxy with the same
          radial density profile, particularly in galaxy models with
          dense centers, implying a substantially greater probability of
          finding an off-center black hole.

          Authors: D. Blaschke (Wroclaw U. & Dubna, JINR), H. Grigorian
          (Dubna, JINR & Yerevan U.)
          Comments: 8 pages, 8 figures, Proceedings of the Erice School
          on 'Radioactive Beams, Nuclear Dynamics and Astrophysics' to be
          published in 'Prog. Part. Nucl. Phys.'
          We introduce a new tool for 'unmasking' the composition of
          neutron star (NS) interiors which is based on the fact that the
          state of matter at high densities determines the statistics of
          both NS observables, the temperature-age (TA) data as well as
          the mass distribution. We use modern cooling simulations to
          extract distributions of NS masses required to reproduce those
          of the yet sparse data in the TA plane. By comparing the
          results with a mass distribution for young, nearby NSs from
          population synthesis we can sharpen two NS cooling problems.
          The direct Urca (DU) problem consists in a narrowing of the NS
          population at the mass value for which the DU process as the
          most effective cooling mechanism in the hadronic layer of the
          star can occur. The Vela mass problem is a broadening of the
          population beyond the range of the typical mass window of 1.1 -
          1.5 M_sun. Applying this tool to modern EoS we discuss examples
          for pure hadronic stars which are in conflict with these
          constraints while hybrid stars with a color superconducting
          quark matter core can predict a satisfactory mass distribution,
          provided the smallest diquark pairing gap has a properly
          defined density dependence.

          Comments: 6 pages, including 3 figures. ApJ Letters, in press
          We present a timing analysis of the 2002 outburst of the
          accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. A study of the
          phase delays of the entire pulse profile shows a behavior that
          is surprising and difficult to interpret: superposed to a
          general trend, a big jump by about 0.2 in phase is visible,
          starting at day 14 after the beginning of the outburst. An
          analysis of the pulse profile indicates the presence of a
          significant first harmonic. Studying the fundamental and the
          first harmonic separately, we find that the phase delays of the
          first harmonic are more regular, with no sign of the jump
          observed in the fundamental. The fitting of the phase delays of
          the first harmonic with a model which takes into account the
          observed exponential decay of the X-ray flux (and therefore of
          the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star) gives important
          information on the torque acting on the neutron star during the
          outburst. We find that the source shows spin-up in the first
          part of the outburst, while a spin-down dominates at the end.
          From these results we derive an estimate of the neutron star
          magnetic field strength.

          We have detected occasional, short-lived ``echoes'' of giant
          pulses from the Crab pulsar. These echo events remind us of
          previously reported echoes from this pulsar, but they differ
          significantly in detail. Our echo events last at most only a
          few days; the echo emission lags the primary emission by only
          40-100 musec. The echoes are consistently weaker and broader
          than the primary emission, and appear only at the lower of our
          two simultaneous observing frequencies. We suggest that these
          echoes are created by refraction in small plasma structures --
          plasma clouds or magnetic flux ropes -- deep within the Crab
          nebula. If this is true, our echoes provide a new probe of
          small-scale structures within the inner synchrotron nebula.

          Lambda Virginis (LamVir) is a well-known double-lined
          spectroscopic Am binary with the interesting property that both
          stars are very similar in abundance but one is sharp-lined and
          the other is broad-lined. We present combined interferometric
          and spectroscopic studies of LamVir. The small scale of the
          LamVir orbit (~20 mas) is well resolved by the Infrared Optical
          Telescope Array (IOTA), allowing us to determine its elements
          as well as the physical properties of the components to high
          accuracy. The masses of the two stars are determined to be
          1.897 Msun and 1.721 Msun, with 0.7% and 1.5% errors
          respectively, and the two stars are found to have the same
          temperature of 8280 +/- 200 K. The accurately determined
          properties of LamVir allow comparisons between observations and
          current stellar evolution models, and reasonable matches are
          found. The best-fit stellar model gives LamVir a subsolar
          metallicity of Z=0.0097, and an age of 935 Myr. The orbital and
          physical parameters of LamVir also allow us to study its tidal
          evolution time scales and status. Although currently atomic
          diffusion is considered to be the most plausible cause of the
          Am phenomenon, the issue is still being actively debated in the
          literature. With the present study of the properties and
          evolutionary status of LamVir, this system is an ideal
          candidate for further detailed abundance analyses that might
          shed more light on the source of the chemical anomalies in
          these A stars.

          RX J1856.5-3754 is one of the brightest nearby isolated neutron
          stars, and considerable observational resources have been
          devoted to it. However, current models are unable to
          satisfactorily explain the data. We show that our latest models
          of a thin, magnetic, partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere on
          top of a condensed surface can fit the entire spectrum, from
          X-rays to optical, of RX J1856.5-3754, within the
          uncertainties. In our simplest model, the best-fit parameters
          are an interstellar column density N_H \approx 1x10^20 cm^-2
          and an emitting area with R^infty \approx 17 km (assuming a
          distance to RX J1856.5-3754 of 140 pc), temperature T^infty
          \approx 4.3x10^5 K, gravitational redshift z_g \sim 0.22,
          atmospheric hydrogen column y_H \approx 1 g cm^-2, and magnetic
          field B \approx (3-4)x10^12 G; the values for the temperature
          and magnetic field indicate an effective average over the
          surface. We also calculate a more realistic model, which
          accounts for magnetic field and temperature variations over the
          neutron star surface as well as general relativistic effects,
          to determine pulsations; we find there exist viewing geometries
          that produce pulsations near the currently observed limits. The
          origin of the thin atmospheres required to fit the data is an
          important question, and we briefly discuss mechanisms for
          producing these atmospheres. Our model thus represents the most
          self-consistent picture to date for explaining all the
          observations of RX J1856.5-3754.

          Title: Late-Time Convection in the Collapse of a 23 Solar Mass
          Star
          Authors: C.L. Fryer, P.A. Young (LANL/UArizona)
          Comments: 31 pages (including 13 figures), submitted to ApJ
          The results of a 3-dimensional SNSPH simulation of the core
          collapse of a 23 solar mass star are presented. This simulation
          did not launch an explosion until over 600ms after collapse,
          allowing an ideal opportunity to study the evolution and
          structure of the convection below the accretion shock to late
          times. This late-time convection allows us to study several of
          the recent claims in the literature about the role of
          convection: is it dominated by an l=1 mode driven by
          vortical-acoustic (or other) instability, does it produce
          strong neutron star kicks, and, finally, is it the key to a new
          explosion mechanism? The convective region buffets the neutron
          star, imparting a 150-200 km/s kick. Because the l=1 mode does
          not dominate the convection, the neutron star does not achieve
          large (>450 km/s) velocities. Finally, the neutron star in this
          simulation moves, but does not develop strong oscillations, the
          energy source for a recently proposed supernova engine. We
          discuss the implications these results have on supernovae,
          hypernovae (and gamma-ray bursts), and stellar-massed black
          holes.

          We report on the direct detection of a close companion to HD
          160934, a young active star, SB1 spectroscopic binary, and
          suggested member of the AB Doradus moving group. High angular
          resolution at the Calar Alto 2.2m telescope was achieved by
          means of the Lucky Imaging technique, allowing direct imaging
          close to the diffraction limit in the SDSS z' band. Our results
          are combined with pre-discovery HST archive data, own UBVRI
          broadband photometry, published JHK magnitudes, and available
          radial velocity measurements to constrain the physical
          properties of the HD 160934 close binary. We suggest that the
          direct detection may be identical to the spectroscopically
          discovered companion.

          Comments: 35 pages (emulateapj text + 16 figures), accepted for
          publication in ApJ
          We present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of HE
          1300+0157, a subgiant with [Fe/H]=-3.9. From a high-resolution,
          high-S/N Subaru/HDS spectrum we find the star to be enriched in
          C ([C/Fe]_1D ~ +1.4) and O ([O/Fe]_1D ~ +1.8). With the
          exception of these species, HE 1300+0157 exhibits an elemental
          abundance pattern similar to that found in many other very and
          extremely metal-poor stars. The Li abundance is lower than the
          Spite-plateau value, in agreement with expectation for its
          evolutionary status. Of particular interest, no neutron-capture
          elements are detected in HE 1300+0157. This type of abundance
          pattern has been found by recent studies in several other
          metal-poor giants. We suggest that HE 1300+0157 is an unevolved
          example of this group of stars, which exhibit high C abundances
          together with low (or absent) abundances of neutron-capture
          elements. Several potential enrichment scenarios are presented.
          The low neutron-capture elements, including Sr, Ba, and Pb,
          suggests that the carbon excess observed in HE 1300+0157 is not
          due to mass transfer across a binary system. Such a scenario is
          applied to carbon-rich objects with excesses of s-process
          elements. The normal observed Li abundance supports this
          interpretation. Most likely, the high levels of C and O were
          produced prior to the birth of this star. It remains unclear
          whether a single hypernova is responsible for its overall
          chemical pattern, or whether one requires a superposition of
          yields from a massive Population III object and a normal Type
          II SN. These scenarios provide important information on the C
          production in the early Universe, and on the formation of
          C-rich stars in the early Galaxy.

          Title: Dynamical determination of the quadrupole mass moment of
          the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039 system

          Small changes in the abstract. More details released on the
          discrepancy between the measured orbital period and the
          calculated Keplerian one
          In this paper we dynamically determine the quadrupole mass
          moment Q of the two-pulsars system PSR J0737-3039A/B by
          analyzing the orbital period of the relative motion occurring
          along a close 2.4-hr, elliptic orbit. Our result is
          Q=(-7.674347 +/- 4.638619) 10^45 kg m^2. It turns out that the
          major source of systematic error is the uncertainty in the
          semimajor axis a mainly due, in turn, to the error in sin i.
          Our result is capable to accommodate the observed discrepancy
          of -25.894452 +/- 15.662082 s between the phenomenologically
          measured orbital period P_b and the purely Keplerian period
          P^(0)=2pi\sqrt{a^3/G(m_A+m_B)} calculated with the system's
          parameters which have been determined independently of the

          Title: Discovering Light Pseudoscalar Bosons in Double-Pulsar
          Observations
          Authors: Arnaud Dupays, Marco Roncadelli
          Comments: Talk given by M. R. at the "Third International
          Workshop on Neutrino Oscillations in Venice"
          The axion is just one from a general class of new particles --
          called Light Pseudoscalar Bosons (LPBs) -- predicted by many
          realistic extensions of the Standard Model. We offer a somewhat
          pedagogical review of their main properties, with particular
          emphasis on the effects they induce in a light beam travelling
          in an external magnetic field, like photon-LPB oscillations,
          birefringence and dichroism. Moreover, we discuss a new
          strategy whereby LPBs can be discovered by high-precision
          observations of certain binary neutron-star systems. Basically,
          in a double pulsar seen almost edge-on, photon-LPB oscillations
          can give rise to a characteristic attenuation pattern of the
          light beam emitted by one of the pulsars when it goes through
          the magnetosphere of the companion. Depending on the actual
          values of the LPB mass and its two-photon coupling constant,
          the effect can be seen in the $\gamma$-ray band with the
          upcoming GLAST mission. We also shown that this method provides
          a remarkable cross-check for the recent claim by the PVLAS
          collaboration about the existence of a new LPB.

          While until recently they were often considered as exotic
          objects of dubious existence, in the last decades there have
          been overwhelming observational evidences for the presence of
          stellar mass black holes in binary systems, supermassive black
          holes at the centers of galaxies, and possibly,
          intermediate-mass black holes observed as ultraluminous X-ray
          sources in nearby galaxies. Black holes are now widely accepted
          as real physical entities that play an important role in
          several areas of modern astrophysics.

          Title: On the peculiarities in the rotational frequency
          evolution of isolated neutron stars
          Authors: A. Biryukov, G. Beskin, S. Karpov
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures. Accepted for publication in ApSS,
          in the proceedings of the conference "Isolated Neutron Stars:
          from the Interior to the Surface", London, April 2006; eds. S.
          Zane, R. Turolla and D. Page
          The measurements of pulsar frequency second derivatives have
          shown that they are $10^2-10^6$ times larger than expected for
          standard pulsar spin-down law, and are even negative for about
          half of pulsars. We explain these paradoxical results on the
          basis of the statistical analysis of the rotational parameters
          $\nu$, $\dot \nu$ and $\ddot \nu$ of the subset of 295 pulsars
          taken mostly from the ATNF database. We have found a strong
          correlation between $\ddot \nu$ and $\dot \nu$ for both
          $\ddot\nu > 0$ and $\ddot\nu < 0$, as well as between $\nu$ and
          $\dot\nu$. We interpret these dependencies as evolutionary ones
          due to $\dot\nu$ being nearly proportional to the pulsars' age.
          The derived statistical relations as well as "anomalous" values
          of $\ddot\nu$ are well described by assuming the long-time
          variations of the spin-down rate. The pulsar frequency
          evolution, therefore, consists of secular change of
          $\nu_{ev}(t)$, $\dot\nu_{ev}(t)$ and $\ddot\nu_{ev}(t)$
          according to the power law with $n \approx 5$, the
          irregularities, observed within a timespan as a timing noise,
          and the variations on the timescale larger than that timespan
          -- several tens of years.

          We study quasar clustering on small scales, modeling clustering
          amplitudes using halo-driven dark matter descriptions. From 91
          pairs on scales <35 kpc/h, we detect only a slight excess in
          quasar clustering over our best-fit large-scale model.
          Integrated across all redshifts, the implied quasar bias is b_Q
          = 4.21+/-0.98 (b_Q = 3.93+/-0.71) at ~18 kpc/h (~28 kpc/h). Our
          best-fit (real-space) power index is ~-2 (i.e., $\xi(r) \propto
          r^{-2}$), implying steeper halo profiles than currently found
          in simulations. Alternatively, quasar binaries with separation
          <35 kpc/h may trace merging galaxies, with typical dynamical
          merger times t_d~(610+/-260)m^{-1/2} Myr/h, for quasars of host
          halo mass m x 10^{12} Msolar/h. We find UVX quasars at ~28
          kpc/h cluster >5 times higher at z > 2, than at z < 2, at the
          $2.0\sigma$ level. However, as the space density of quasars
          declines as z increases, an excess of quasar binaries (over
          expectation) at z > 2 could be consistent with reduced merger
          rates at z > 2 for the galaxies forming UVX quasars. Comparing
          our clustering at ~28 kpc/h to a $\xi(r)=(r/4.8\Mpch)^{-1.53}$
          power-law, we find an upper limit on any excess of a factor of
          4.3+/-1.3, which, noting some caveats, differs from large
          excesses recently measured for binary quasars, at $2.2\sigma$.
          We speculate that binary quasar surveys that are biased to z >
          2 may find inflated clustering excesses when compared to models
          fit at z < 2. We provide details of 111 photometrically
          classified quasar pairs with separations <0.1'. Spectroscopy of
          these pairs could significantly constrain quasar dynamics in
          merging galaxies.

          Authors: W. Bednarek, F. Giovannelli
          Comments: 11 pages, 6 figures, accepted Astron./Astrophys
          We apply the IC e$^\pm$ pair cascade model in order to
          investigate the possible $\gamma$-ray emission features from
          another compact massive binary of the microquasar type, Cyg
          X-1. We conclude that the observational constraints at lower
          energies (from MeV to GeV) suggest that the spectrum of
          electrons injected in the jet is likely steeper than in other
          TeV $\gamma$-ray microquasars. The cascade $\gamma$-ray
          spectrum produced by electrons with such spectrum in Cyg X-1
          should be below the sensitivities of the MAGIC and VERITAS
          class Cherenkov telescopes. However, if the electron spectrum
          is flatter, then the highest TeV $\gamma$-ray fluxes are
          predicted at $\sim$7 hrs before and after the phase when the
          compact object is in front of the massive star. We suggest that
          Cherenkov telescopes should concentrate on these range of
          phases since the TeV flux can vary by a factor of $\sim$20 with
          the period of the Cyg X-1 binary system. Moreover, the model
          predicts clear anticorrelation of the GeV and TeV $\gamma$-ray
          emission. This feature can be tested by the future
          multiwavelength observations with the AGILE and GLAST
          telescopes in the GeV energy range and the MAGIC and VERITAS
          telescopes in the TeV energy range.

          There is currently a clear discrepancy in the proper motions
          measured on different angular scales in the approaching radio
          jets of the black hole X-ray binary GRS1915+105. Lower
          velocities were measured with the Very Large Array (VLA) prior
          to 1996 than were subsequently found from higher-resolution
          observations made with the Very Long Baseline Array and the
          Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network. We initiated
          an observing campaign to use all three arrays to attempt to
          track the motion of the jet knots from the 2006 February
          outburst of the source, giving us unprecedented simultaneous
          coverage of all angular scales, from milliarcsecond scales out
          to arcsecond scales. The derived proper motion, which was
          dominated by the VLA measurements, was found to be 17.0 mas per
          day, demonstrating that there has been no significant permanent
          change in the properties of the jets since 1994. We find no
          conclusive evidence for deceleration of the jet knots, unless
          this occurs within 70 mas of the core. We discuss possible
          causes for the varying proper motions recorded in the
          literature.

          We present preliminary results on the radial velocity follow-up
          of a planetary transit candidate (P=2.43d, V=15.4) detected
          during the MACHO project. The photometry is consistent with a
          grazing transit of an object with radius >=1.8RJ orbiting a K
          dwarf star, and is the brightest best candidate detected from
          MACHO. Results from the 2.2m MPG/ESO telescope and FEROS
          (R=48,000) in May 2006 display an apparent radial velocity
          variation with amplitude ~650m/s with the same period as the
          transit, and a solar-type primary. This is consistent with an
          orbiting companion of mass ~4MJ. However, further observations
          display an additional secondary long-period variation with
          amplitude of several km/s, indicating the presence of a third
          body. The system is likely a low mass eclipsing binary orbiting
          the solar-type primary. Further observations are planned to
          fully characterize the system.

          Title: Rotation at 1122 Hz and the neutron star structure
          Authors: M. Bejger, P. Haensel, J.L. Zdunik
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, submitted to A&A Letters
          Recent observations of XTE J1739-285 suggest that it contains a
          neutron star rotating at 1122 Hz. Such rotation imposes bounds
          on the structure of neutron star in XTE J1739-285. These bounds
          may be used to constrain poorly known equation of state of
          dense matter. One-parameter families of stationary
          configurations rotating rigidly at 1122 Hz are constructed,
          using a precise 2-D code solving Einstein equations.
          Hydrostatic equilibrium solutions are tested for stability with
          respect to axi-symmetric perturbations. A set of ten diverse
          EOSs of neutron stars is considered. Hypothetical strange stars
          are also studied. For each EOS, the family of possible neutron
          star models is limited by the mass shedding limit,
          corresponding to maximum allowed equatorial radius, R_max, and
          by the instability with respect to the axi-symmetric
          perturbations, reached at the minimum allowed equatorial
          radius, R_min. We get R_min \simeq 10-13km, and R_max \simeq
          16-18km, with allowed mass 1.4-2.3 M_\odot. Allowed stars with
          hyperonic or exotic-phase core are supramassive and have a very
          narrow mass range. Quark star with accreted crust might be
          allowed, provided such a model is able to reproduce X-ray
          bursts from XTE J1739-285.

          Title: Defining the instability strip of pulsating post-AGB
          binary stars from ASAS and NSVS photometry

          Comments: 11 pages & 9 figures, accepted for publication in
          MNRAS (Dec. 8)
          We analyse public domain time-series photometric observations
          of 30 known and candidate binary post-AGB stars for measuring
          pulsation and orbital periods. We derive periodicities for 17
          stars for the first time in the literature. Besides identifying
          five new RV Tauri type pulsating variables (three with the RVb
          phenomenon, i.e. long-term changes of the mean brightness), we
          find multiply periodic (or possibly irregular) post-AGB stars
          on the two edges of the instability strip. The temperature
          dependence of the peak-to-peak light curve amplitudes clearly
          indicates the changes in excitation as post-AGB stars evolve
          through the strip. One object, the peculiar Type II Cepheid ST
          Pup, showed a period increase from 18.5 to 19.2 d, which is
          consistent with the known period fluctuations in the past. In
          HD 44179, the central star of the Red Rectangle nebula, we see
          very similar asymmetric light curve than was measured 10-15
          years ago, suggesting a very stable circumstellar environment.
          In contrast to this, HD 213985 shows coherent but highly
          non-repetitive brightness modulation, indicating changes in the
          circumstellar cloud on a similar time-scale to the orbital
          period.

          A long standing and unverified prediction of binary star
          evolution theory is the existence of a population of white
          dwarfs accreting from sub-stellar donor stars. Such systems
          ought to be common, but the difficulty of finding them,
          combined with the challenge of detecting the donor against the
          light from accretion means that no donor star to date has a
          measured mass below the hydrogen burning limit. Here we apply a
          technique which allows us to reliably measure the mass of the
          unseen donor star in eclipsing systems. We are able to identify
          a brown dwarf donor star, with a mass of 0.052+/-0.002 Msun.
          The relatively high mass of the donor star for its orbital
          period suggests that current evolutionary models may
          underestimate the radii of brown dwarfs.

          Title: X-ray pulsar radiation from polar cap heated by
          back-flow bombardment
          Authors: J. Gil, G. I. Melikidze, B. Zhang
          We consider the problem of the thermal X-ray radiation from the
          hot polar cap of radio pulsars showing evidence of \EB subpulse
          drift in radio band. In our resent Paper I, within the
          partially screened gap (PSG) model of inner acceleration region
          we derived a simple relationship between the drift rate of
          subpulses observed in a radio-band and the thermal X-ray
          luminosity from polar caps heated by the back-flow particle
          bombardment. This relationship can be tested for pulsars in
          which the so-called carousel rotation time $P_4$, reflecting
          the \EB plasma drift, and the thermal X-ray luminosity $L_x$
          from the hot polar cap are known. To test the model we used two
          only available pulsars: PSRs B0943+10 and B1133+16. They both
          satisfied the model prediction, although due to low photon
          statistics the thermal component could not be firmly identified
          from the X-ray data. Nevertheless, these pulsars were at least
          consistent with PSG pulsar model.
          In the present paper we consider two more pulsars: PSRs
          B0656+14 and B0628-28, whose data have been recently become
          available. In PSR B0656+14 the thermal radiation from the hot
          polar cap was clearly detected, as for PSR B0628-28, it also
          seems to be having such a component.
          It is important to note, that in all cases for which both $P_4$
          and $L_x$ are presently known, the PSG pulsar model seems to be
          fully confirmed. Other available models of inner acceleration
          region fail to explain the observed relationship between radio
          and X-ray data. The pure vacuum gap model predicts too high
          $L_x$ and too low $P_4$, while the space charge limited model
          predicts too low $L_x$ and the origin of the subpulse drift has
          no natural explanation.

          Title: Light Pseudoscalar Bosons, PVLAS and the Double Pulsar
          J0737-3039

          Comments: Talk given by M. R. at the "Neutrino Oscillation
          Workshop" (to appear in the Proceedings)
          Light Pseudoscalar Bosons (LPBs) coupled to two photons are
          predicted by many realistic extensions of the Standard Model
          and give rise to birefringence and dichroism in a light beam
          travelling in an external magnetic field. These effects have
          recently been detected by the PVLAS collaboration, thereby
          strongly suggesting the existence of a LPB. We provide an
          astrophysical cross-check for such a claim. Actually, we show
          that in the double pulsar J0737-3039 photon-LPB conversion can
          give rise to a characteristic attenuation pattern of the light
          beam emitted by one of the pulsars when it goes through the
          magnetosphere of the companion. The effect under consideration
          shows up in the $\gamma$-ray band and can be detected by the
          upcoming GLAST mission.

          of Sciences
          The origin of the strong magnetic fields observed in chemically
          peculiar Ap and Bp stars stars has long been debated. The
          recent discovery of magnetic fields in the intermediate mass
          pre-main sequence Herbig Ae and Be stars links them to Ap and
          Bp stars, providing vital clues about Ap and Bp stars and the
          origin and evolution of magnetic fields in intermediate and
          high mass stars. A detailed study of one young magnetic B star,
          HD 72106A, is presented. This star appears to be in a binary
          system with an apparently normal Herbig Ae star. A maximum
          longitudinal magnetic field strength of +391 +/- 65 G is found
          in HD 72106A, as are strong chemical peculiarities, with
          photospheric abundances of some elements ranging up to 100x
          above solar.

          Emission
          Authors: C. O. Heinke, P. G. Jonker, R. Wijnands, R. E. Taam
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures; submitted to ApJ
          Thermal X-ray radiation from neutron star soft X-ray transients
          in quiescence provides the strongest constraints on the cooling
          rates of neutron stars, and thus on the interior composition
          and properties of matter in the cores of neutron stars. We
          analyze new (2006) and archival (2001) XMM-Newton observations
          of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 in
          quiescence, which provide the most stringent constraints to
          date. The X-ray spectrum of SAX J1808.4-3658 in the 2006
          observation is consistent with a power-law of photon index
          1.83\pm0.16, without requiring the presence of a blackbody-like
          component from a neutron star atmosphere. Our 2006 observation
          shows a slightly lower 0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity, at a level
          of 68^{+15}_{-13}% that inferred from the 2001 observation.
          Simultaneous fitting of all available XMM data allows a
          constraint on the quiescent bolometric (0.01-10 keV) neutron
          star luminosity of L_{q,bol}<1.1*10^{31} erg/s. This limit
          excludes some current models of neutrino emission mediated by
          pion condensates, and provides evidence for additional cooling
          processes, such as neutrino emission via direct Urca processes
          involving protons or hyperons, in the cores of massive neutron
          stars.

          Title: The widest ultracool binary
          Authors: Jose A. Caballero
          Comments: Submitted to A&A Letters on Nov 26. Comments by
          referee already introduced
          Aims: I test the ejection scenario of formation of brown dwarfs
          and very low-mass stars through the detection of a very wide
          ultracool binary.
          Methods: LEHPM 494 (M6.0 +/- 1.0 V) and DENIS-P J0021.0-4244
          (M9.5 +/- 0.5 V) are separated by 1.3 arcmin and are high
          proper motion co-moving ultracool stars. I have used six
          astrometric epochs spaced 22 years to confirm their common
          tangential velocity.
          Results: The angular separation between both low-mass stars
          keeps constant with an uncertainty less than 0.1 %. I have also
          derived their most probable heliocentric distance (23 +/- 2
          pc), age interval (2-10 Ga) and masses (0.103 +/- 0.006 and
          0.079 +/- 0.004 Msol). The pair, with a projected physical
          separation of 1800 +/- 170 AU, is by far the widest ultracool
          binary ever found in the field.
          Conclusions: This serendipitous and simple detection is
          inconsistent with ultra low-mass formation ejection scenarios
          and complements current searches of low-mass tight binaries.

          After an X-ray binary experiences a transient jet ejection, it
          undergoes a phase in which its X-ray light curve is dominated,
          for some time, by thermal emission from an accretion disk
          surrounding the black hole. The accretion physics in the
          thermal-dominant state is understood better than in any other,
          and it is therefore the best state for comparing observations
          to theoretical models. Here, I present simulations that study
          the way a thermally-emitting disk might be expected to behave
          immediately after a large-scale, steady jet has been removed
          from the system in the form of a sudden ejection. I simulate
          the ejection's effect on the disk by allowing the strength of
          turbulence (modeled by the alpha parameter of Shakura and
          Sunyaev) to increase rapidly in time, and I show how this
          change can lead to an outburst in an otherwise-steady disk. The
          motivation for treating the jet removal in this way is the fact
          that many models for jets involve large-scale magnetic fields
          that should inhibit the magnetorotational instability believed
          to drive turbulence; this should naturally lead to a rapid
          increase in turbulence when the magnetic field is ejected from
          the system or otherwise destroyed during the ejection event. I
          show how the timescale and luminosity of the outburst can be
          controlled by the manner in which alpha is allowed to change,
          and I briefly discuss ways in which these simulations can be
          compared to observations of X-ray binaries, in particular GRS
          1915+105, which shows the most complex and variable behavior of
          any black hole system in outburst.

          We present models of the shapes of four Kuiper belt objects
          (KBOs) and Jovian Trojan (624) Hektor as ellipsoidal figures of
          equilibrium and Roche binaries. Our simulations select those
          figures of equilibrium whose lightcurves best match the
          measured rotational data. The best fit shapes, combined with
          the knowledge of the spin period of the objects provide
          estimates of the bulk densities of these objects. We find that
          the lightcurves of KBOs (20000) Varuna and 2003 EL61 are well
          matched by Jacobi triaxial ellipsoid models with bulk densities
          992 (-15,+86) kg/m^3 and 2551 (-10,+115) kg/m^3, respectively.
          The lightcurves of (624) Hektor and KBO 2001 QG298 are
          well-described by Roche contact binary models with densities
          2480 (-80,+292) kg/m^3 and 590 (-47,+143) kg/m^3, respectively.
          The nature of 2000 GN171 remains unclear: Roche binary and
          Jacobi ellipsoid fits to this KBO are equivalent, but predict
          different densities, ~2000 kg/m^3 and ~650 kg/m^3,
          respectively. Our density estimates suggest a trend of
          increasing density with size.

          Authors: Martin E. Beer, Lynnette M. Dray, Andrew R. King,
          Graham A. Wynn
          Comments: MNRAS accepted
          We investigate the evolution of interacting binaries where the
          donor star is a low-mass giant more massive than its companion.
          It is usual to assume that such systems undergo common-envelope
          (CE) evolution, where the orbital energy is used to eject the
          donor envelope, thus producing a closer binary or a merger. We
          suggest instead that because mass transfer is super-Eddington
          even for non-compact companions, a wide range of systems avoid
          this type of CE phase. The accretion energy released in the
          rapid mass transfer phase unbinds a significant fraction of the
          giant's envelope, reducing the tendency to dynamical
          instability and merging. We show that our physical picture
          accounts for the success of empirical parametrizations of the
          outcomes of assumed CE phases.

          Comments: Proceedings of the 2006 Beijing COSPAR assembly, to
          appear in Advances in Space Research
          The high frequency oscillations discovered in the tails of
          giant flares from two magnetars are thought to be the first
          direct detections of seismic vibrations from neutron stars. The
          possibility of starquakes associated with the giant flares
          triggering global vibrations opens up the prospect of using
          seismology to study the interior structure and composition of
          neutron stars. This is a major breakthrough in the study of the
          nature of matter under conditions of extreme pressure. In this
          paper we provide an up to date summary of the observations and
          the theoretical framework, including a brief discussion of
          gravitational wave searches for the QPOs. We summarize the
          status of alternative non-seismic mechanisms, and give a
          critique of a recent paper by Levin that argued against seismic
          vibrations as a viable mechanism. We conclude with an overview
          of current results using the seismological technique that
          constrain parameters such as the equation of state and crust
          structure.

          decay
          Authors: A. Sesana, F. Haardt, P. Madau
          Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We study the long-term evolution of massive black hole binaries
          (MBHBs) at the centers of galaxies using detailed full
          three-body scattering experiments. Ambient stars drawn from a
          isotropic Maxwellian distribution unbound to the binary are
          ejected by the gravitational slingshot. We construct a minimal,
          hybrid model for the depletion of the loss cone and the orbital
          decay of the binary, and show that secondary slingshots - stars
          returning on small impact parameter orbits to have a second
          super-elastic scattering with the MBHB - may considerably help
          the shrinking of the pair in the case of large binary mass
          ratios. In the absence of loss-cone refilling by two-body
          relaxation or other processes, the mass ejected before the
          stalling of a MBHB is half the binary reduced mass. About 50%
          of the ejected stars are expelled ejected in a "burst" lasting
          ~1E4 yrs M_6^1/4, where M_6 is the binary mass in units of 1E6
          Msun. The loss cone is completely emptied in a few bulge
          crossing timescales, 1E7 yrs M_6^1/4. Even in the absence of
          two-body relaxation or gas dynamical processes, unequal mass
          and/or eccentric binaries with M_6 >0.1 can shrink to the
          gravitational wave emission regime in less than a Hubble time,
          and are therefore "safe" targets for the planned Laser
          Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

          G351.7+0.8 has a flux density of 8.4+-0.7 Jy at 1420 MHz. Its
          spectral index is 0.52+-0.25 between 1420 MHz and 843 MHz,
          typical of adiabatically expanding shell-like remnants. HI
          observations show structures possibly associated with the SNR
          in the radial velocity range of -10 to -18 km/s, and suggest a
          distance of 13.2 kpc and a radius of 30.7 pc. The estimated
          Sedov age for G351.7+0.8 is less than 6.8x10e4 yrs. An old
          radio pulsar PSR J1721-3532 lies close to the SNR G351.7+0.8 on
          the sky. The new distance and age of G351.7+0.8 and recent
          proper-motion measurements of the pulsar strongly argue against
          a possibility of associations between SNR G351.7+0.8 and PSR
          J1721-3532. There is an unidentified, faint X-ray point source
          1RXS J172055.3-353937 which is close to G351.7+0.8. It may be a
          potential neutron star to associate with G351.7+0.8.

          A class of low-mass X-ray binary sources are known to be both
          X-ray burst sources and millisecond pulsars at the same time. A
          new source of this class was discovered by High Energy
          Transient Explorer 2 (HETE-2) on 14 June 2005 as a source of
          type-I X-ray bursts, which was named HETE J1900.1-2455. Five
          X-ray bursts from HETE J1900.1-2455 were observed during the
          summer of 2005. The time resolved spectral analysis of these
          bursts have revealed that their spectra are consistent with the
          blackbody radiation throughout the bursts. The bursts show the
          indication of radius expansion. The bolometric flux remains
          almost constant during the photospheric radius expansion while
          blackbody temperature dropped during the same period. Assuming
          that the flux reached to the Eddington limit on a standard 1.4
          solar mass neutron star with a helium atmosphere, we estimate
          the distance to the source to be $\sim$ 4 kpc.

          Title: Solving GRBs and SGRs puzzles by precessing Jets
          Authors: D.Fargion, O.Lanciano, P.Oliva
          Comments: 10 pages, 16 figures
          A persistent, thin, micro-nano sr. beamed gamma jet, may be
          ejected from BH and Pulsars, powered by ultra-relativistic
          electron pairs. These jet while precessing and spinning are
          originated by Inverse Compton and-or Synchrotron Radiation at
          pulsars or micro-quasars sources. They are most powerful at
          Supernova birth, blazing, once on axis, to us and flashing GRB
          detector. The trembling of thin jets explains naturally the
          observed erratic multi-explosive structure of different GRBs.
          The jets are precessing and decaying on time scales of a few
          hours surviving as long as thousands of years, linking huge
          GRB-SN jet apparent Luminosity to more modest SGR relic Jets.
          Therefore long-life SGR may be repeating and if they are around
          our galaxy they might be observed again as the few known ones
          and a few rarer extragalactic XRFs. The orientation of the beam
          respect to the line of sight plays a key role in
          differentiating the wide GRB morphology. The relativistic cone
          is as small as the inverse of the electron progenitor Lorentz
          factor. The hardest and brightest gamma spectra are hidden
          inside the inner gamma jet axis. To observe the inner beamed
          GRB events one needs the widest SN sample and largest cosmic
          volumes. The most beamed are hardest.The nearest ones, within
          tens Mpc distances, are mostly observable on cone jet periphery
          leading to longest SN-GRB duration, with lowest fluency and the
          softest spectra, as in earliest GRB98425 and recent GRB 060218
          signature. Conical shape of few nebulae describe in space the
          model signature. Recent X-ray precursor, like in GRB060124, ten
          minutes before the GRB event, or in SGR1806-20 two minutes
          before the main giant burst cannot be understood otherwise.

          Comments: Submitted to Nuclear Physics A
          Because of the presence of a liquid-gas phase transition in
          nuclear matter, compact-star matter can present a region of
          instability against the formation of clusters. We investigate
          this phase separation in a matter composed of neutrons, protons
          and electrons, within a Skyrme-Lyon mean-field approach. Matter
          instability and phase properties are characterized through the
          study of the free-energy curvature. The effect of
          beta-equilibrium is also analyzed in detail, and we show that
          the opacity to neutrinos has an influence on the presence of
          clusterized matter in finite-temperature proto-neutron stars.

          Authors: Richard Dodson, Dion Lewis, Peter McCulloch
          Comments: Isolated Neutron Stars conference, London, April
          24-28 2006
          Pulsar timing at the Mt Pleasant observatory has focused on
          Vela, which can be tracked for 18 hours of the day. These
          nearly continuous timing records extend over 24 years allowing
          a greater insight into details of timing noise, micro glitches
          and other more exotic effects. In particular we report the
          glitch parameters of the 2004 event, along with the
          reconfirmation that the spin up for the Vela pulsar occurs
          instantaneously to the accuracy of the data. This places a
          lower limit of about 30 seconds for the acceleration of the
          pulsar to the new rotational frequency. We also confirm of the
          low braking index for Vela, and the continued fall in the DM
          for this pulsar.

          Comments: 14 pages, 15 figures, MNRAS accepted
          We have begun a large-scale photometric survey of nearby open
          clusters and star-forming regions, the Monitor project, aiming
          to measure time-series photometry for >10,000 cluster members
          over >10 sq.deg of sky, to find low-mass eclipsing binary and
          planet systems. We describe the software pipeline we have
          developed for this project, showing that we can achieve peak
          RMS accuracy over the entire data-set of better than 2 mmag
          using aperture photometry, with RMS < 1% over 4 mag, in data
          from 2 and 4m class telescopes with wide-field mosaic cameras.
          We investigate the noise properties of our data, finding
          correlated `red' noise at the 1 - 1.5 mmag level in bright
          stars, over transit-like timescales of 2.5 hours. An important
          source of correlated noise in aperture photometry is image
          blending, which produces variations correlated with the seeing.
          We present a simple blend index based on fitting polynomials to
          these variations, and find that subtracting the fit from the
          data provides a method to reduce their amplitude, in lieu of
          using techniques such as point spread function fitting
          photometry which tackle their cause. Finally, we use the Sysrem
          algorithm to search for any further systematic effects.

          Title: Intrinsic electronic superconducting phases at 60 K and
          90 K in double-layer YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$
          Authors: T. Honma, P.H. Hor
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures
          Subj-class: Superconductivity; Strongly Correlated Electrons
          We study superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of
          oxygen-doped double-layer high-temperature superconductors
          YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$ (0 $\le$ $\delta$ $\le$ 1) as a
          function of the oxygen dopant concentration ($\delta$) and
          planar hole-doping concentration ($P_{pl}$). We find that
          $T_c$, while clearly influenced by the development of the chain
          ordering as seen in the $T_c$ $vs.$ $\delta$ plot, lies on a
          universal curve originating at the critical hole concentration
          ($P_c$) = 1/16 in the $T_c$ $vs.$ $P_{pl}$ plot. Our analysis
          suggests that the universal behavior of $T_c$($P_{pl}$) can be
          understood in terms of the competition and collaboration of
          chemical-phases and electronic-phases that exist in the system.
          We conclude that the global superconductivity behavior of
          YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$ as a function of doping is
          electronically driven and dictated by pristine electronic
          phases at magic doping numbers that follow the hierarchical
          order based on $P_c$, such as 2 $\times$ $P_c$, 3 $\times$
          $P_c$ and 4 $\times$ $P_c$. We find that there are at least two
          intrinsic electronic superconducting phases of $T_c$ = 60 K at
          2 $\times$ $P_c$ = 1/8 and $T_c$ = 90 K at 3 $\times$ $P_c$ =
          3/16.

          Comments: Revtex4, 17 figures, 14 pages. Minor fixes
          We use the `moving puncture' approach to perform fully
          non-linear evolutions of spinning quasi-circular black-hole
          binaries with individual spins not aligned with the orbital
          angular momentum. We evolve configurations with the individual
          spins (parallel and equal in magnitude) pointing in the orbital
          plane and 45-degrees above the orbital plane. We introduce a
          technique to measure the spin direction and track the
          precession of the spin during the merger, as well as measure
          the spin flip in the remnant horizon. The former configuration
          completes 1.75 orbits before merging, with the spin precessing
          by 98-degrees and the final remnant horizon spin flipped by
          ~72-degrees with respect to the component spins. The latter
          configuration completes 2.25 orbits, with the spins precessing
          by 151-degrees and the final remnant horizon spin flipped
          ~34-degrees with respect to the component spins. These
          simulations show for the first time how the spins are
          reoriented during the final stage of binary black hole mergers
          verifying the hypothesis of the spin-flip phenomenon. We also
          compute the track of the holes before merger and observe a
          precession of the orbital plane with frequency similar to the
          orbital frequency and amplitude increasing with time.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in Advances in Space
          Research
          We describe our recent progress in modeling supernova-fallback
          disks and neutron star (NS) atmospheres.
          We present a first detailed spectrum synthesis calculation of a
          SN-fallback disk composed of iron. We assume a thin disk with a
          radial structure described by the alpha-disk model. The
          vertical structure and emission spectrum are computed
          self-consistently by solving the structure equations
          simultaneously with the radiation transfer equations under
          non-LTE conditions. We describe the properties of a specific
          disk model and discuss various effects on the emergent
          UV/optical spectrum.
          We investigate Compton scattering effects on the thermal
          spectrum of NSs. In addition, we constructed a new generation
          of metal line-blanketed non-LTE model atmospheres for NSs. It
          is compared to X-ray burst spectra of EXO0748-676. It is
          possible that the gravitational redshift, deduced from
          absorption lines, is lower (z=0.24) than hitherto assumed
          (z=0.35). Accordingly, this would result in NS mass and radius
          lower limits of M>1.63Msun and R>13.8 km.

          Phase-resolved high resolution optical spectroscopy has
          revealed narrow N III and He II emission lines from the soft
          X-ray transient Aquila X-1 during its 2004 outburst that move
          as a function of the orbit consistent with the phasing of the
          donor star. Under the assumption that these lines come from the
          irradiated side of the donor star, we can constrain its K_2
          velocity to >247+/-8 km/s, and derive a mass function of
          f(M_1)>1.23+/-0.12M_sun. Estimates for the rotational
          broadening based on the emission components suggest a possible
          massive neutron star of >1.6M_sun (at 95% confidence). However,
          an updated ephemeris and additional high resolution
          spectroscopy of Aql X-1 during a future outburst are warranted
          in order to confirm that the narrow lines indeed originate on
          the donor star surface, and reliably characterise the system
          parameters of this important X-ray binary. Spectra taken during
          the end of the outburst show that the morphology of the
          emission lines changed dramatically. No donor star signature
          was present anymore, while the presence of narrow low-velocity
          emission lines became clear, making Aql X-1 a member of the
          slowly growing class of low-velocity emission line sources.

          2006
          The binary nature of the bright (V = 4.2 mag) Mercury-Manganese
          star Phi Her has been known since 1976 and it was considered a
          low-amplitude single-lined SB. In a recent study we found
          evidence for lines of the secondary star. Other recent results
          from interferometry provide a good measure of the light ratio.
          It is very plausible that the secondary is a late main-sequence
          A star. We find the rotational velocity of the secondary to be
          ~42 +/- 5 km/s.

          We investigate how current and proposed observations of neutron
          stars can lead to an understanding of the state of their
          interiors and the key unknowns: the typical neutron star radius
          and the neutron star maximum mass. A theoretical analysis of
          neutron star structure, including general relativistic limits
          to mass, compactness, and spin rates is made. We consider
          observations made not only with photons, ranging from radio
          waves to X-rays, but also those involving neutrinos and gravity
          waves. We detail how precision determinations of structural
          properties would lead to significant restrictions on the poorly
          understood equation of state near and beyond the equilibrium
          density of nuclear matter.

          unrecognised orbital motion will then add to the proper motion.
          A list of candidate proper motion binaries is constructed from
          a chi^2 test evaluating the statistical significance of the
          difference between the Tycho-2 and Hipparcos proper motions for
          103134 stars in common between the two catalogues (excluding
          components of visual systems). The paper focuses on the
          evaluation of the detection efficiency of proper-motion
          binaries, using different kinds of control data (mostly radial
          velocities). The detection rate for entries from the Ninth
          Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits (SB9) is evaluated, as
          well as for stars like barium stars, which are known to be all
          binaries. Proper motion binaries are efficiently detected for
          systems with parallaxes in excess of ca. 20 mas, and periods in
          the range 1000 - 30000 d. The shortest periods in this range
          (1000 - 2000 d) may appear only as DMSA/G binaries (accelerated
          proper motion in the Hipparcos Double and Multiple System
          Annex). Proper motion binaries detected among SB9 systems
          having periods shorter than about 400 d hint at triple systems.
          A list of 19 candidate triple systems is provided. Binaries
          suspected of having low-mass (brown-dwarf-like) companions are
          listed as well. Among the 37 barium stars with parallaxes
          larger than 5 mas, only 7 exhibit no evidence for duplicity
          whatsoever (be it spectroscopic or astrometric). Finally, the
          fraction of proper-motion binaries shows no significant
          variation among the various (regular) spectral classes, when
          due account is taken for the detection biases.

          Title: A Universal Intrinsic Scale of Hole Concentration for
          High-Tc Cuprates
          Authors: T. Honma, P.H. Hor, H.H. Hsieh, M. Tanimoto
          Comments: 11 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in
          Physical Review B
          Subj-class: Superconductivity; Strongly Correlated Electrons;
          Materials Science
          Journal-ref: Phys. Rev. B 70, 214517 (2004).
          We have measured thermoelectric power (TEP) as a function of
          hole concentration per CuO2 layer, Ppl, in Y1-xCaxBa2Cu3O6 (Ppl
          = x/2) with no oxygen in the Cu-O chain layer. The
          room-temperature TEP as a function of Ppl, S290(Ppl), of
          Y1-xCaxBa2Cu3O6 behaves identically to that of La2-zSrzCuO4
          (Ppl = z). We argue that S290(Ppl) represents a measure of the
          intrinsic equilibrium electronic states of doped holes and,
          therefore, can be used as a common scale for the carrier
          concentrations of layered cuprates. We shows that the Ppl
          determined by this new universal scale is consistent with both
          hole concentration microscopically determined by NQR and the
          hole concentration macroscopically determined by the Cu
          valency. We find two characteristic scaling temperatures, TS*
          and TS2*, in the TEP vs. temperature curves that change
          systematically with doping. Based on the universal scale, we
          uncover a universal phase diagram in which almost all the
          experimentally determined pseudogap temperatures as a function
          of Ppl fall on two common curves; upper pseudogap temperature
          defined by the TS* versus Ppl curve and lower pseudogap
          temperature defined by the TS2* versus Ppl curve. We find that
          while pseudogaps are intrinsic properties of doped holes of a
          single CuO2 layer for all high-Tc cuprates, Tc depends on the
          number of layers, therefore the inter-layer coupling, in each
          individual system.

          Comments: to appear in the Proceedings of the Eleventh Marcel

          The radial component of the motion of compact binary systems
          composed of neutron stars and/or black holes on eccentric orbit
          is integrated. We consider all type of perturbations that
          emerge up to second post-Newtonian order. These perturbations
          are either of relativistic origin or are related to the spin,
          mass quadrupole and magnetic dipole moments of the binary
          components. We derive a generalized Kepler equation and
          investigate its domain of validity, in which it properly
          describes the radial motion.

          Title: Multi-Dimensional Explorations in Supernova Theory
          Authors: Adam Burrows, Luc Dessart, Christian D. Ott, Eli Livne
          Comments: To be published in the "Centennial Festschrift for
          Hans Bethe," Physics Reports (Elsevier: Holland), ed. G.E.
          Brown, E. van den Heuvel, and V. Kalogera, 2006
          In this paper, we bring together various of our published and
          unpublished findings from our recent 2D multi-group,
          flux-limited radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the collapse
          and explosion of the cores of massive stars. Aided by 2D and 3D
          graphical renditions, we motivate the acoustic mechanism of
          core-collapse supernova explosions and explain, as best we
          currently can, the phases and phenomena that attend this
          mechanism. Two major foci of our presentation are the outer
          shock instability and the inner core g-mode oscillations. The
          former sets the stage for the latter, which damp by the
          generation of sound. This sound propagates outward to energize
          the explosion and is relevant only if the core has not exploded
          earlier by some other means. Hence, it is a more delayed
          mechanism than the traditional neutrino mechanism that has been
          studied for the last twenty years since it was championed by
          Bethe and Wilson. We discuss protoneutron star convection,
          accretion-induced-collapse, gravitational wave emissions,
          pulsar kicks, the angular anisotropy of the neutrino emissions,
          a subset of numerical issues, and a new code we are designing
          that should supercede our current supernova code VULCAN/2D.
          Whatever ideas last from this current generation of numerical
          results, and whatever the eventual mechanism(s), we conclude
          that the breaking of spherical symmetry will survive as one of
          the crucial keys to the supernova puzzle.

          Comments: Accepted paper; to appear in the Astronomical Journal
          (abridged) We present new absolute trigonometric parallaxes and
          relative proper motions for nine Galactic Cepheid variable
          stars: l Car, zeta Gem, beta Dor, W Sgr, X Sgr, Y Sgr, FF Aql,
          T Vul, and RT Aur. We obtain these results with astrometric
          data from Fine Guidance Sensor 1r, a white-light interferometer
          on Hubble Space Telescope. We find absolute parallaxes with an
          average sigma_pi/pi = 8%. Two stars (FF Aql and W Sgr) required
          the inclusion of binary astrometric perturbations, providing
          Cepheid mass estimates. With these parallaxes we compute
          absolute magnitudes in V, I, K, and Wesenheit W_{VI} bandpasses
          corrected for interstellar extinction and Lutz-Kelker-Hanson
          bias. Adding our previous absolute magnitude determination for
          delta Cep, we construct Period-Luminosity relations for ten
          Galactic Cepheids.
          We compare our new Period-Luminosity relations with those
          adopted by several recent investigations, including the
          Freedman and Sandage H_0 projects. Adopting our
          Period-Luminosity relationship would tend to increase the
          Sandage H_$ value, but leave the Freedman H_0 unchanged.
          Comparing our Galactic Cepheid PLR with those derived from LMC
          Cepheids, we find the slopes for K and W_{VI} identical in the
          two galaxies within their respective errors. Our data lead to a
          W_{VI} distance modulus for the Large Magellanic Cloud, m-M =
          18.50\pm0.03, uncorrected for any metallicity effects. Applying
          recently derived metalllcity corrections yields a corrected LMC
          distance modulus of (m-M)_0=18.40\pm0.05. Comparing our
          Period-Luminosity relationship to solar-metallicity Cepheids in
          NGC 4258 results in a distance modulus, 29.28 \pm 0.08, which
          agrees with that derived from maser studies.

          Binary stars are important for a full understanding of stellar

          relative supernova rates varies between single and binary
          stars. We also show how the parameter space of different
          supernova types differs between single and binary stars. We
          then consider an important question of how to infer a supernova
          progenitor's properties from pre-explosion imaging and present
          rescent work of producing synthe tic colours for our stellar
          models to make a direct comparison with any detections or

          Title: A new paradigm for the X-ray emission of O stars from
          XMM-Newton observations of the O9.7 supergiant zeta Orionis
          Authors: A. M. T. Pollock
          Comments: 34 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables, accepted by Astronomy
          & Astrophysics
          XMM-Newton observations of the O supergiant zeta Orionis (O9.7
          Ib) extend knowledge of its high-resolution spectrum beyond the
          CVI line at 33.7 Angstroms and suggest a new framework for the
          interpretation of the X-ray spectra of single hot stars. All
          the lines are broad and asymmetric with similar velocity
          profiles. X-rays probably originate in the wind's terminal
          velocity regime in collisionless shocks controlled by magnetic
          fields rather than in cooling shocks in the acceleration zone.
          During post-shock relaxation, exchange of energy between ions
          and electrons is so slow that electron heating does not take
          place before hot gas is quenched by the majority cool gas. The
          observed plasma is not in equilibrium and the electron
          bremsstrahlung continuum is weak. Charge exchange, ionization
          and excitation are likely to be produced by protons. Fully
          thermalized post-shock velocities ensure high cross-sections
          and account for the observed line widths, with some allowance
          probably necessary for non-thermal particle acceleration. In
          general, the form of X-ray spectra in both single and binary
          stars is likely to be determined principally by the amount of
          post-shock electron heating: magnetically confined X-ray plasma
          in binary systems can evolve further towards the higher
          electron temperatures of equilibrium while in single stars this
          does not take place. The long mean-free path for Coulomb energy
          exchange between fast-moving ions may also inhibit the
          development of line-driven instabilities.

          Title: XMM-Newton discovery of 7 s pulsations in the isolated
          neutron star RX J1856.5-3754
          Authors: Andrea Tiengo, Sandro Mereghetti
          Comments: Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters
          Thanks to the high counting statistics provided by a recent
          XMM-Newton observation of RX J1856.5-3754, we have discovered
          that this isolated neutron star pulsates at a period of 7.055
          s. This confirms that RX J1856.5-3754 is similar in nature to
          the the other six thermally emitting, nearby neutron stars
          discovered in soft X-rays with ROSAT. The pulsations are
          detected at consistent periods in several XMM-Newton
          observations spanning from April 2002 to October 2006, yielding
          an upper limit of Pdot<1.9x10e-12 s/s (90% c.l.) on the period
          derivative. This implies a surface magnetic field smaller than
          1.2x10^14 G, under the usual assumption of vacuum dipole
          magnetic braking. The pulse profile is nearly sinusoidal with a
          pulsed fraction of only ~1.5%, the smallest ever seen in an
          isolated X-ray pulsar.

          High resolution data in the region of the line Halpha have been
          obtained at the time of the light maximum and after it of the
          2006 optical outburst of the symbiotic binary Z And. A
          blue-shifted absorption component indicating outflow velocity
          of about 1400 km/s as well as additional emission components
          with similar velocities, situated on the two sides of the main
          peak of the line were observed during that time. It is
          suggested that all of them are spectral signature of bipolar
          outflow, observed for the first time in the optical spectrum of
          this binary. The emission measure and the mass of the nebular
          part of the streams were estimated approximately.

          We study the structure of protoneutron stars within the finite
          temperature Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone many-body theory. If
          nucleons, hyperons, and leptons are present in the stellar
          core, we find that neutrino trapping stiffens considerably the
          equation of state, because hyperon onsets are shifted to larger
          baryon density. However, the value of the critical mass turns
          out to be smaller than the ``canonical'' value 1.44 $M_\odot$.
          We find that the inclusion of a hadron-quark phase transition
          increases the critical mass and stabilizes it at about 1.5--1.6
          $M_\odot$.

          Authors: M. Dotti, M. Colpi, F. Haardt, L. Mayer
          Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          The dynamics of two massive black holes in a rotationally
          supported nuclear disc of 10^8 solar masses is explored using
          N-Body/SPH simulations. Gas and star particles are co-present
          in the disc. Described with a Mestel profile, the disc has a
          vertical support provided by turbulence of the gas, and by
          stellar velocity dispersion. A 4 million solar masses primary
          black hole is placed at the centre of the disc, while a
          secondary black hole is set initially on an eccentric
          co-rotating orbit in the disc plane. Its mass is in a 1 to 1, 1
          to 4, and to 10 ratio, relative to the primary. With this
          choice, we mimic the dynamics of black hole pairs released in
          the nuclear region at the end of a gas-rich galaxy merger. It
          is found that, under the action of dynamical friction, the two
          black holes form a close binary in ~10 Myrs. The inspiral
          process is insensitive to the mass fraction in stars and gas
          present in the disc and is accompanied by the circularization
          of the orbit. We have revealed the occurrence of radial inflows
          around each individual black hole that can create small gaseous
          Keplerian disc weighing ~2 % of the black hole mass, and of
          size ~0.01 pc. The mass of the tightly (loosely) bound
          particles increases (decreases) with time as the black holes
          spiral into closer and closer orbits. Double AGN activity is
          expected to occur on an estimated timescale of ~10 Myrs,
          comparable to the inspiral timescale. The double nuclear
          point-like sources that may appear during dynamical evolution
          have typical separations of ~10 pc.

          Comments: 12 pages, 10 figures, 2 Tables, Submitted to the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We investigate the existence and properties of equipotential
          surfaces and Lagrangian points in non-synchronous, eccentric
          binary star and planetary systems under the assumption of
          quasi-static equilibrium. We adopt a binary potential that
          accounts for non-synchronous rotation and eccentric orbits, and
          calculate the positions of the Lagrangian points as functions
          of the mass ratio, the degree of asynchronism, the orbital
          eccentricity, and the position of the stars or planets in their
          relative orbit. We find that the geometry of the equipotential
          surfaces may facilitate non-conservative mass transfer in
          non-synchronous, eccentric binary star and planetary systems,
          especially if the component stars or planets are rotating
          super-synchronously at the periastron of their relative orbit.
          We also calculate the volume-equivalent radius of the Roche
          lobe as a function of the four parameters mentioned above.
          Contrary to common practice, we find that replacing the radius
          of a circular orbit in the fitting formula of Eggleton (1983)
          with the instantaneous distance between the components of
          eccentric binary or planetary systems does not always lead to a
          good approximation to the volume-equivalent radius of the
          Roche-lobe. We therefore provide a generalized semi-analytical
          fitting formula for the volume-equivalent Roche lobe radius
          appropriate for non-synchronous, eccentric binary star and
          planetary systems.

          We present the results of a VLA search for HI emission in the
          circumstellar envelopes of five nearby AGB stars: RS Cnc,
          IRC+10216, EP Aqr, R Cas, and R Aqr. We have detected emission
          coincident in both position and velocity with RS Cnc, implying
          that the emission arises from its extended envelope. For R Cas,
          we detected weak emission that peaks at the stellar systemic
          velocity and overlaps with the location of its circumstellar
          dust shell and thus is probably related to the star. Toward
          IRC+10216 and EP Aqr, we detected multiple, arcminute-scale HI
          emission features at velocities consistent with the
          circumstellar envelopes, but spatially offset from the stellar
          positions; in these cases we cannot determine unambiguously if
          the emission is associated with the stars. In the case of
          IRC+10216, we were unable to confirm the detection of HI in
          absorption against the cosmic background previously reported by
          Le Bertre & Gerard. We detected our fifth target, R Aqr (a
          symbiotic binary), in the 1.4 GHz continuum.

          Title: Dynamics of triple black hole systems in hierarchically
          merging massive galaxies
          Authors: Loren Hoffman, Abraham Loeb
          Comments: 27 pages, 19 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Galaxies with stellar bulges are generically observed to host
          supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The hierarchical merging of
          galaxies should therefore lead to the formation of SMBH
          binaries. Merging of old massive galaxies with little gas
          promotes the formation of low-density nuclei where SMBH
          binaries are expected to survive over long times. If the binary
          lifetime exceeds the typical time between mergers, then
          triple-black-hole systems may form. Such systems can lead to
          the ejection of one of the black holes (BHs) at a speed
          exceeding 1000 km/s, far greater than attainable through
          gravitational radiation recoil. We study the statistics of
          close triple-SMBH encounters in galactic nuclei by computing a
          series of three-body orbits with physically-motivated initial
          conditions appropriate for giant elliptical galaxies. Our
          simulations include a smooth background potential consisting of
          a stellar bulge plus a dark matter halo, drag forces due to
          gravitational radiation and dynamical friction on the stars and
          dark matter, and a simple model of the time evolution of the
          inner density profile under heating and mass ejection by the
          SMBHs. We find that the binary pair coalesces as a result of
          repeated close encounters in ~85% of our runs. In about 40% of
          the runs the lightest BH is left wandering through the galactic
          halo or escapes the galaxy altogether, but escape of all three
          SMBHs is exceedingly rare. The triple systems typically scour
          out cores with mass deficits ~1-2 times their total mass, which
          can help to account for the large cores observed in some
          massive elliptical galaxies, such as M87. The high coalescence
          rate, prevalence of very high-eccentricity orbits, and
          gravitational radiation ``spikes'' during close encounters may
          provide interesting signals for the future Laser Interferometer
          Space Antenna (LISA).

          We investigate the accretion flows onto the supermassive binary
          black holes (SMBBHs) from the circumbinary disk with the equal
          mass, eccentric binary on the subparsec scale, using Smoothed
          Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We find that the material
          can be supplied from circumbinary disk, which leads to the
          formation of two accretion disks around the SMBBHs. The mass
          accretion rates significantly modulate with the binary orbital
          motion. These could provide the observable diagnosis of the
          existence of the supermassive binary black holes (e.g. OJ287)
          on the subparsec scale in merged galactic nuclei.

          Supernova Type Ia progenitor candidate

          the 15th European Workshop on White Dwarfs, Leicester, UK,
          August 7-11, 2006
          The nature of the progenitors of type Ia supernovae is still
          under controversial debate. KPD 1930+2752 is one of the best SN
          Ia progenitor candidates known today. The object is a double
          degenerate system consisting of a subluminous B star and a
          massive white dwarf. Maxted et al. 2000 conclude that the
          system mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass. This conclusion,
          however, rests on the assumption that the sdB mass is 0.5 Mo.
          However, recent binary population synthesis calculations
          suggest that the mass of an sdB star may range from 0.3 Mo to
          more than 0.7 Mo. It is therefore important to measure the mass
          of the sdB star simultaneously with that of the white dwarf.
          Since the rotation of the sdB star is tidally locked to the
          orbit the inclination of the system can be constrained. An
          analysis of the ellipsoidal variations in the light curve
          allows to tighten the constraints derived from spectroscopy. We
          derive the mass-radius relation for the sdB star from a
          quantitative spectral analysis. The projected rotational
          velocity is determined for the first time from high-resolution
          spectra. In addition a reanalysis of the published light curve
          is performed. The atmospheric and orbital parameters are
          measured with unprecedented accuracy. In particular the
          projected rotational velocity vrotsini = 92.3 +/- 1.5 km/s is
          determined. The mass of the sdB is limited between 0.45 Mo and
          0.52 Mo. The total mass of the system ranges from 1.36 Mo to
          1.48 Mo and hence is likely to exceed the Chandrasekhar mass.
          So KPD 1930+2752 qualifies as an excellent double degenerate
          supernova Ia progenitor candidate.

          August 7-11, 2006
          The masses of compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars
          and black holes are fundamental to astrophysics, but very
          difficult to measure. We present the results of an analysis of
          subluminous B (sdB) stars in close binary systems with unseen
          compact companions to derive their masses and clarify their
          nature. Radial velocity curves were obtained from time resolved
          spectroscopy. The atmospheric parameters were determined in a
          quantitative spectral analysis. Based on high resolution
          spectra we were able to measure the projected rotational
          velocity of the stars with high accuracy. The assumption of
          orbital synchronization makes it possible to constrain
          inclination angle and companion mass of the binaries. Five
          invisible companions have masses that are compatible with that
          of normal white dwarfs or late type main sequence stars. But
          four sdBs have very massive companions like heavy white dwarfs
          > 1 Mo, neutron stars or even black holes. Such a high fraction
          of massive compact companions is not expected from current
          models of binary evolution.

          Title: On Rejuvenation in Massive Binary Systems
          Authors: L. M. Dray, C. A. Tout
          Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures, MNRAS accepted
          We introduce a set of stellar models for massive stars whose
          evolution has been affected by mass transfer in a binary
          system, at a range of metallicities. As noted by other authors,
          the effect of such mass transfer is frequently more than just
          rejuvenation. We find that, whilst stars with convective cores
          which have accreted only H-rich matter rejuvenate as expected,
          those stars which have accreted He-rich matter (for example at
          the end stages of conservative mass transfer) evolve in a way
          that is qualitatively similar to rejuvenated stars of much
          higher metallicity. Thus the effects of non-conservative
          evolution depend strongly on whether He-rich matter is amongst
          the portion accreted or ejected. This may lead to a significant
          divergence in binary evolution paths with only a small
          difference in initial assumptions. We compare our models to
          observed systems and find approximate formulae for the effect
          of mass accretion on the effective age and metallicity of the
          resulting star.

          Title: Hardness-Intensity Correlations in Magnetar Afterglows
          Authors: Feryal Ozel, Tolga Guver
          Comments: Submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters
          We explore the hardness-intensity correlations observed in
          several AXPs and SGRs within the framework of a thermally
          emitting magnetar model. Using our detailed atmosphere models
          and taking into account reprocessing of the surface emission by
          the magnetosphere, we show that the hardness of the surface
          spectra increases with increasing temperature and hence the
          changes in the effective temperatures of the outer layers of
          the star alone can account for the observed correlations. We
          conclude that the slow release of the heat deposited in the
          deep crust during a magnetar burst naturally accounts for the
          spectral changes during the afterglow. The correlations are
          further enhanced by changes in the structures of the magnetic
          currents during or following a burst. However, the additional
          hardening produced by scattering of the surface photons off the
          magnetospheric charges saturates at moderate values of the
          scattering optical depth.

          The first detections of afterglows from short gamma-ray bursts
          (GRBs) have confirmed the previous suspicion that they are
          triggered by a different central engine than long bursts. In
          particular, the recent detections of short GRBs in galaxies
          without star formation lends support to the idea that an old
          stellar population is involved. Most prominent are mergers of
          either double neutron stars or of a neutron star with a
          stellar-mass black hole companion. Since the final
          identification of the central engine will only come from an
          integral view of several properties, we review the observable
          signatures that can be expected from both double neutron stars
          and neutron star black hole systems. We discuss the
          gravitational wave emission, the structure of the
          neutrino-cooled accretion disks, the resulting neutrino signal
          and possible mechanisms to launch a GRB. In addition, we
          address the speculative idea that in some cases a magnetar-like
          object may be the final outcome of a double neutron star
          merger. We also discuss possibilities to explain the late-time
          X-ray activity that has been observed in several bursts.

          Astrophysics
          We investigate the behavior and consequences of the reverse
          shock that terminates the supersonic expansion of the baryonic
          wind which is driven by neutrino heating off the surface of
          (non-magnetized) new-born neutron stars in supernova cores. To
          this end we perform long-time hydrodynamic simulations in
          spherical symmetry. In agreement with previous relativistic
          wind studies, we find that the neutrino-driven outflow
          accelerates to supersonic velocities and in case of a compact,
          about 1.4 solar mass (gravitational mass) neutron star with a
          radius of about 10 km, the wind reaches entropies of about 100
          k_B per nucleon. The wind, however, is strongly influenced by
          the environment of the supernova core. It is decelerated and
          shock-heated abruptly by a termination shock that forms when
          the supersonic outflow collides with the slower preceding
          supernova ejecta. The radial position of this reverse shock
          varies with time and depends on the strength of the neutrino
          wind and the different conditions in progenitor stars with
          different masses and structure. Its basic properties and
          behavior can be understood by simple analytic considerations.
          We demonstrate that the entropy of matter going through the
          reverse shock can increase to a multiple of the asymptotic wind
          value. Seconds after the onset of the explosion it therefore
          can exceed 400 k_B per nucleon. The temperature of the shocked
          wind has typically dropped to about or less than 10^9 K, and
          density and temperature in the shock-decelerated matter
          continue to decrease only very slowly. Such conditions might
          strongly affect the important phases of supernova
          nucleosynthesis in a time and progenitor dependent way.

          The anomalous X-ray pulsar 4U 0142+61 was recently detected in

          Chakrabarty & Kaplan 2006). This observation is the first
          instance for a disk around an AXP. From a reanalysis of optical
          and infrared data, we show that the observations indicate that
          the disk is likely to be an active disk rather than a passive
          dust disk beyond the light cylinder, as proposed in the
          discovering paper. Furthermore, we show that the irradiated
          accretion disk model can also account for all the optical and
          infrared observations of the anomalous X-ray pulsars in the
          persistent state.

          The majority of X-ray-detected rotation-powered millisecond
          pulsars (MSPs) appear to exhibit predominantly thermal
          emission, believed to originate from the heated magnetic polar
          caps of the pulsar. In the nearest MSP, J0437--4715 a faint PL
          is also observed at >3 keV, usually associated with
          magnetospheric emission processes. However, the hard emission
          in this and other similar MSPs may instead be due to weak
          Comptonization of the thermal polar cap emission by energetic
          electrons/positrons of small optical depth most likely in the
          pulsar magnetosphere. This spectral model implies that all soft
          X-rays are of purely thermal origin, which has important
          implications in the study of neutron stars.

          We report on XMM-Newton observations of the Black Widow pulsar,
          PSR B1957+20. The pulsar's X-ray emission is non-thermal and
          best modeled with a single powerlaw spectrum of photon index
          2.03^{+0.51}_{-0.36}. No coherent X-ray pulsations at the
          pulsar's spin-period could be detected, though a strong
          binary-phase dependence of the X-ray flux is observed for the
          first time. The data suggest that the majority of the pulsar's
          X-radiation is emitted from a small part of the binary orbit
          only. We identified this part as being near to where the radio
          eclipse takes place. This could mean that the X-rays from PSR
          B1957+20 are mostly due to intra-shock emission which is
          strongest when the pulsar wind interacts with the ablated
          material from the companion star.

          The contact binary AW UMa has an extreme mass ratio, with the
          more massive component close to the main sequence, while the
          low mass star at q ~ 0.1 has a much larger radius than a main
          sequence star of a comparable mass. We propose that the
          secondary has almost exhausted hydrogen in its center and is
          much more advanced in its evolution, as suggested by Stepien.
          Presumably the secondary lost most of its mass during its
          evolution with part of it transferred to the present primary.
          After losing a large fraction of its angular momentum, the
          binary will evolve into a system of FK Com type.

          Methods. Photometric monitoring as well as spectroscopic
          observations of Westerlund2 are used to search for light
          variability and to establish the spectral types of the
          early-type stars in the cluster core.
          Results. The first light curves of the eclipsing binary WR20a
          in B and V filters are analysed and a distance of 8kpc is
          inferred. Three additional eclipsing binaries, which are
          probable late O or early B-type cluster members, are
          discovered, but none of the known early O-type stars in the
          cluster displays significant photometric variability above 1%
          at the 1-sigma level. The twelve brightest O-type stars are
          found to have spectral types between O3 and O6.5, significantly
          earlier than previously thought.
          Conclusions. The distance of the early-type stars in
          Westerlund2 is established to be in excellent agreement with
          the distance of WR20a, indicating that WR20a actually belongs
          to the cluster. Our best estimate of the cluster distance thus
          amounts to 8.0pm1.4kpc. Despite the earlier spectral types, the
          currently known population of early-type stars in Westerlund2
          does not provide enough ionizing photons to account for the
          radio emission of the RCW49 complex. This suggests that there
          might still exist a number of embedded early O-stars in RCW49.

          Utilizing two Chandra High Resolution Camera (HRC-I)
          observations with an epoch separation of somewhat more than
          five years, we have measured the proper motion of the central
          compact object, RX J0822-4300, in the supernova remnant
          Puppis-A for the first time. The position of RX J0822-4300 is
          found to be different by 0.574 +/- 0.184 arcsec, implying a
          proper motion of 107.49 +/- 34.46 mas/yr with a position angle
          of 241 degree +/- 24 degree. For a distance of 2.2 kpc, this
          proper motion is equivalent to a recoil velocity of 1121.79 +/-
          359.60 km/s. Both the magnitude and the direction of the proper
          motion are in agreement with the birth place of RX J0822-4300
          being near to the optical expansion center of the supernova
          remnant. Although the positional shift inferred from the
          current data is significant at a ~ 3 sigma level only, one or
          more future HRC-I observations can obtain a much larger
          positional separation and further constrain the measurement.

          We report the discovery of an X-ray nebula associated with the
          nearby millisecond pulsar PSR J2124-3358. This is the first
          time that extended emission from a solitary millisecond pulsar
          is detected. The emission extends from the pulsar to the
          northwest by ~ 0.5 arcmin. The spectrum of the nebular emission
          can be modeled by a power law spectrum with photon index of 2.2
          +/-0.4. This is inline with the emission being originated from
          accelerated particles in the post shock flow.

          The neutrino-driven wind from a nascent neutron star at the
          center of a supernova expands into the earlier ejecta of the
          explosion. Upon collision with this slower matter the wind
          material is decelerated in a wind termination shock. By means
          of hydrodynamic simulations in spherical symmetry we
          demonstrate that this can lead to a large increase of the wind
          entropy, density, and temperature, and to a strong deceleration
          of the wind expansion. The consequences of this phenomenon for
          the possible r-process nucleosynthesis in the late wind still
          need to be explored in detail. Two-dimensional models show that
          the wind-ejecta collision is highly anisotropic and could lead
          to a directional dependence of the nucleosynthesis even if the
          neutrino-driven wind itself is spherically symmetric.

          Thermal radiation from hot polar caps is examined in radio
          pulsars with drifting subpulses. It is argued that if these
          subpulses correspond to sparking discharges of the inner
          acceleration region right above the polar cap surface then a
          simple relationship between the observed subpulse drift rate in
          radio and thermal X-ray luminosity from the polar cap heated by
          sparks should exist. This relationship is derived and tested in
          pulsars for which an appropriate good quality data is
          available.

          The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) is a system of
          four, imaging, atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes in Namibia,
          designed to detect very-high-energy gamma rays above ~ 100 GeV.
          During 2002--2003, H.E.S.S. collected data from two, young and
          energetic radio pulsars: the Crab and PSR B1706-44. We searched
          for pulsations at the lowest energies that H.E.S.S. is capable
          of detecting, aiming at a detection that would potentially
          differentiate between the two popular models of pulsar
          high-energy emission: the Polar Cap and the Outer Gap. No
          evidence for pulsed emission was found in the data, and
          upperlimits were derived to a 99.95% confidence level. Our
          assumptions and upper limit values for the two pulsars are
          reported.

          Observations of a strong and extended positron-electron
          annihilation line emission in the Galactic center (GC) region
          by the SPI/INTEGRAL are challenging to the existing models of
          positron sources in the Galaxy. In this paper, we study the
          possibility that pulsar winds from a millisecond pulsar
          population in the GC produce the 511 keV line. Our preliminary
          estimations predict that the e+/- annihilation rate in the GC
          is around 5 x 10E+42 sE-1, which is consistent with the present
          observational constraints. Therefore, the e+/- pairs from
          pulsar winds can contribute significantly to the positron
          sources in the Galactic center region. Furthermore, since the
          diffusion length of positrons is short in the magnetic field,
          we predict that the intensity distribution of the annihilation
          line should follow the distribution of millisecond pulsars,
          which should then correlate to the mass distribution in the GC.

          We present here the current status of pulsar simulations for

          mission. We present "PulsarSpectrum", a pulsar simulator that
          can reproduce with high detail gamma-ray emission from pulsars.
          "PulsarSpectrum" takes into account advanced timing effects,
          e.g. period changes with time, barycentering effects and
          glitches. Other ancillary tools have been built to provide the
          simulator with a realistic population of pulsars and their
          ephemerides. All these tools are currently used in the GLAST
          collaboration for testing the LAT Science Analysis Tools and
          for studying LAT capabilities for pulsar science. They have
          been used also for generating a simulated pulsar population for
          the "Data Challenge 2 (DC2)", one of the most important
          milestones in the development of the GLAST software. During the
          DC2, scientists analyzed a set of 55 days of simulated data in
          order to validate LAT MonteCarlo, study instrument response
          functions, exercise analysis tools and study LAT capabilities.
          This contribution also contains results of some analysis

          We investigate the role of massive perturbers, such as giant
          molecular clouds or stellar clusters, in supplying low-angular
          momentum stars that pass very close to the central massive
          black hole (MBH) or fall into it. We show that massive pe
          rturbers can play an important role in supplying both binaries
          and single stars to the vicinity of the MBH. We discuss
          possible implications for the ejection of high velocity stars;
          for the capture of stars on tight orbits around the MBH; for
          the emission of gravitational waves from low-eccentricity
          inspiraling stars; and for the origin of the young main
          sequence B stars observed very near the Gal actic MBH. Massive
          perturbers may also enhance the the growth rate of MBHs, and
          may accelerate the dynamical orbital decay of coalescing binary
          MBHs.

          Theory vs. Observations, Cefalu', 11-24 June 2006, to be
          published in AIP Conf.Proc
          We summarize the status of art of the secular evolution of low
          mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and take a close look at the
          orbital period distribution of LMXBs and of binary millisecond
          pulsars (MSP), in the hypothesis that this latter results from
          the LMXB evolution. The deficiency of systems below the period
          gap, which in cataclysmic binaries occurs between ~ 2 and 3 hr,
          points to a very different secular evolution of LMXBs with
          respect to their counterparts containing a white dwarf compact
          object. The presence of several ultrashort period LMXBs (some
          of which are also X-ray millisecond pulsars), the important
          fraction of binary MSPs at periods between 0.1 and 1 day, the
          periods (26 and 32hr) of two ``interacting'' MSPs in Globular
          Clusters are other pieces of the puzzle in the period
          distribution. We consider the possible explanations for these
          peculiarities, and point out that Grindlay's old proposal that
          all (most of) LMXBs in the field were originally born in
          globular clusters must be carefully reconsidered.

          Radio, X-ray, and HESS gamma-ray observations of the Galactic
          Center (GC) composite supernova remnant SNR G0.9+0.1 are used
          to constrain a time-dependent injection model of the downstream
          electron spectrum responsible for the total multiwavelength
          spectrum. The effect of spindown power evolution aswell as
          nebular field evolution is employed to reproduce the
          present-day multiwavelength spectrum. Assuming a nebular
          magnetic field decay model of typical HESS-type pulsar wind
          nebulae (PWN), ending with a present-day field strength of
          6muG, we obtain an initial spindown power of ~ 10E+38 ergs/s if
          we assume a birth period and age of 43ms and 6,500 yr
          respectively to reproduce the properties of the SNR shell. This
          gives a present-day spindown power of ~ 10E+37 ergs/s, which
          agrees well with the present-day spindown power derived from
          X-ray observations.

          In this thesis, I study the phase diagram of dense, locally
          neutral three-flavor quark matter as a function of the strange
          quark mass, the quark chemical potential, and the temperature,
          employing a general nine-parameter ansatz for the gap matrix. I
          also study the phase diagram of dense, locally neutral
          three-flavor quark matter within the framework of a
          Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. In the analysis, dynamically
          generated quark masses are taken into account
          self-consistently. The phase diagram in the plane of
          temperature and quark chemical potential is presented. In
          addition, I study the effect of neutrino trapping on the phase
          diagram of dense, locally neutral three-flavor quark matter
          within the same NJL model. The phase diagrams in the plane of
          temperature and quark chemical potential, as well as in the
          plane of temperature and lepton-number chemical potential are
          presented. The implications of these results for the evolution
          of protoneutron stars are briefly discussed.

          Title: A hypervelocity star from the Large Magellanic Cloud
          Authors: Alessia Gualandris, Simon Portegies Zwart
          Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures, MNRAS Letters, in press
          We study the acceleration of the star HE0437-5439, to
          hypervelocity and discuss its possible origin in the Large
          Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The star has a radial velocity of 723
          km/s and is located at a distance of 61 kpc from the Sun. With
          a mass of about 8 Msun, the travel time from the Galactic
          centre is of about 100 Myr, much longer than its main sequence
          lifetime. Given the relatively small distance to the LMC (18
          kpc), we consider it likely that HE0437-5439 originated in the
          cloud rather than in the Galactic centre, like the other
          hypervelocity stars. The minimum ejection velocity required to
          travel from the LMC to its current location within its lifetime
          is of about 500 kms. Such a high velocity can only be obtained
          in a dynamical encounter with a massive black hole. We perform
          3-body scattering simulations in which a stellar binary
          encounters a massive black hole and find that a black hole more
          massive than 1000 Msun is necessary to explain the high
          velocity of HE0437-5439. We argue that the most likely birth
          place for HE0437-5439 in the LMC is the star cluster NGC 330,
          which is young enough to host stars coeval to HE0437-5439, and
          dense enough to produce an intermediate mass black hole able to
          eject an 8 Msun star with hypervelocity.

          We present a model of Fourier Power Density Spectrum (PDS)
          formation in accretion powered X-ray binary systems derived
          from the first principles of the diffusion theory. Timing
          properties of X-ray emission are considered to be a result of
          diffusive propagation of the driving perturbations in a bounded
          medium. We prove that the integrated power P_x of the resulting
          PDS is only a small fraction of the integrated power P_dr of
          the driving oscillations, which is distributed over the disk.
          The resulting PDS continuum is a sum of two components, a low
          frequency (LF) component which presumably originates in an
          extended accretion disk and a high frequency (HF) component
          which originates in the innermost part of the source (Compton
          cloud or corona). The LF PDS component has a power-law shape
          with index of 1.0-1.5 at higher frequencies (``red'' noise) and
          a flat spectrum below a characteristic (break) frequency
          (``white'' noise). This white-red noise (WRN) continuum
          spectrum holds information about the physical parameters of the
          bounded extended medium, diffusion time scale and the

          To derive physical properties of the neutron star surface with
          observed spectra, a realistic model spectrum of neutron star
          surface emission is essential. Limited by computing resources,
          a full computation of the radiative transfer equations without
          the diffusion approximation has been conducted up to date only
          for the case of local magnetic fields being perpendicular to
          the stellar surface. In this paper we report the
          full-computation result for an arbitrary field direction. For
          comparison we also compute the radiative transfer equation
          using the diffusion approximation. For a given effective
          temperature, the computed spectrum with the diffusion
          approximation is always softer than that of a full computation
          at a non-negligible level. It leads to an over-estimate of the
          effective temperature if the diffusion approximation spectrum
          is employed in the spectral fitting. Other characteristics for
          different magnetic field orientations, such as the beaming
          pattern of the two polarization modes and the structure of the
          atmosphere, are also discussed.

          We investigate a pair creation cascade in the magnetosphere of
          a rapidly rotating neutron star. We solve the set of the
          Poisson equation for the electro-static potential and the
          Boltzmann equations for electrons, positrons, and gamma-ray
          photons simultaneously. In this paper, we first examine the
          time-dependent nature of particle accelerators by solving the
          non-stationary Boltzmann equations on the two-dimensional
          poloidal plane in which both the rotational and magnetic axes
          reside. Evaluating the temperature of the heated polar cap
          surface, which is located near the magnetic pole, by the
          bombardment of gap-accelerated particles, and applying the
          scheme to millisecond pulsar parameters, we demonstrate that
          the solution converges to a stationary solution of which
          pair-creation cascade is maintained by the heated polar-cap
          emission, in a wide range of three-dimensional parameter space
          (period, period derivative, magnetic inclination angle). We
          also present the deathlines of millisecond pulsars.

          Electrostatic oscillations in cold electron-positron plasmas
          can be coupled to a propagating electromagnetic mode if the
          background magnetic field is inhomogeneous. Previous work
          considered this coupling in the quasi-linear regime,
          successfully simulating the electromagnetic mode. Here we
          present a stability analysis of the non-linear problem,
          perturbed from dynamical equilibrium, in order to gain some
          insight into the modes present in the system.

          Comments: 11 pages, accepted for publication in ApJ
          The spin periods of the neutron stars in most Low Mass X-ray
          Binary (LMXB) systems still remain undetected. One of the
          models to explain the absence of coherent pulsations has been
          the suppression of the beamed signal by Compton scattering of
          X-ray photons by electrons in a surrounding corona. We point
          out that simultaneously with wiping out the pulsation signal,
          such a corona will upscatter (pulsating or not) X-ray emission
          originating at and/or near the surface of the neutron star
          leading to appearance of a hard tail of Comptonized radiation
          in the source spectrum. We analyze the hard X-ray spectra of a
          selected set of LMXBs and demonstrate that the optical depth of
          the corona is not likely to be large enough to cause the
          pulsations to disappear.

          It is shown that the slow glitches in the spin rate of the
          pulsar B1822-09 can be explained by the reconstruction of the
          neutron star shape, which is not matched with the star rotation
          axis. Owing to the evolution of the inclination angle, i.e. the
          angle between the rotation axis and the axis of the magnetic
          dipole, under the action of the braking torque, there appears
          the disagreement between the rotation axis and the symmetry
          axis. After the angle between the axis of symmetry and the axis
          of the rotation achieves the maximum value of alpha ~ 2x10^-4
          the shape of the neutron star becomes matching with the
          rotation axis. Such reconstruction is observed as the slow
          glitch.

          We solve the time-dependent dynamics of axisymmetric, general
          relativistic MHD winds from rotating neutron stars. The mass
          loss rate is obtained self consistently as a solution of the
          MHD equations, subject to a finite thermal pressure at the
          stellar surface. Conditions are chosen to be representative of
          the neutrino driven phase in newly born magnetars, which have
          been considered as a possible engine for GRBs. We compute the
          angular momentum and energy losses as a function of $\sigma$
          and compare them with the analytic expectation from the
          classical theory of pulsar winds. We observe the convergence to
          the force-free limit in the energy loss and we study the
          evolution of the closed zone for increasing magnetization.
          Results also show that the dipolar magnetic field and the
          presence of a closed zone do not modify significantly the
          acceleration and collimation properties of the wind.

          We propose a model, which naturally explains an unusual thermal
          X-ray emission, observed from PSR J1119-6127. The model is
          based on the assumption that the pulsar magnetic field near the
          stellar surface differs significantly from the pure dipole
          field. We show that the structure and curvature of the field
          lines can be of the kind that allows the pair creation in the
          closed field line region. The created pairs propagate along the
          closed field lines and heat the stellar surface beyond the
          local poles. It is demonstrated that such a configuration can
          be easily realized.

          reproduces many of the observed characteristics. The model

          Accretion of interstellar material by a magnetized, slowly
          rotating isolated neutron star is discussed. We show that the
          average persistent X-ray luminosity of these objects is
          unlikely to exceed 4x10^26 erg/s. They can also appear as X-ray
          bursters with the burst duration of ~30 minutes and repetition
          time of \~10^5 yr. This indicates that the number of the
          accreting isolated neutron stars which could be observed with
          recent X-ray missions is a few orders of magnitude smaller than
          that previously estimated. Our findings argue against models in
          which the magnetic field of neutron stars is assumed to decay
          exponentially on a time scale shorter than 500 Myr.

          Raytracing computations for light emitted from the surface of a
          rapidly rotating neutron star are carried out in order to
          construct light curves for accreting millisecond pulsars. These
          calculations are for realistic models of rapidly rotating
          neutron stars which take into account both the correct exterior
          metric and the oblate shape of the star. We find that the most
          important effect, comparing the full raytracing computations
          with simpler approximations currently in use, arises from the
          oblate shape of the rotating star. Approximating a rotating
          neutron star as a sphere introduces serious errors in fitted
          values of the star's radius and mass if the rotation rate is
          very large. However, for lower rotation rates acceptable mass
          and radius values can be obtained using the spherical
          approximation.

          Model atmospheres of isolated neutron stars with low magnetic
          field are calculated with Compton scattering taking into
          account. Models with effective temperatures 1, 3 and 5 MK, with
          two values of surface gravity log(g)g = 13.9 and 14.3), and
          different chemical compositions are calculated. Radiation
          spectra computed with Compton scattering are softer than the
          computed with Thomson scattering at high energies (E > 5 keV)
          for hot (T_eff > 1 MK) atmospheres with hydrogen-helium
          composition. Compton scattering is more significant to hydrogen
          models with low surface gravity. The emergent spectra of the
          hottest (T_eff > 3 MK) model atmospheres can be described by
          diluted blackbody spectra with hardness factors ~ 1.6 - 1.9.
          Compton scattering is less important for models with solar
          abundance of heavy elements.

          Title: A hypervelocity star from the Large Magellanic Cloud
          Authors: Alessia Gualandris, Simon Portegies Zwart
          Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures, MNRAS Letters, in press
          We study the acceleration of the star HE0437-5439, to
          hypervelocity and discuss its possible origin in the Large
          Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The star has a radial velocity of 723
          km/s and is located at a distance of 61 kpc from the Sun. With
          a mass of about 8 Msun, the travel time from the Galactic
          centre is of about 100 Myr, much longer than its main sequence
          lifetime. Given the relatively small distance to the LMC (18
          kpc), we consider it likely that HE0437-5439 originated in the
          cloud rather than in the Galactic centre, like the other
          hypervelocity stars. The minimum ejection velocity required to
          travel from the LMC to its current location within its lifetime
          is of about 500 kms. Such a high velocity can only be obtained
          in a dynamical encounter with a massive black hole. We perform
          3-body scattering simulations in which a stellar binary
          encounters a massive black hole and find that a black hole more
          massive than 1000 Msun is necessary to explain the high
          velocity of HE0437-5439. We argue that the most likely birth
          place for HE0437-5439 in the LMC is the star cluster NGC 330,
          which is young enough to host stars coeval to HE0437-5439, and
          dense enough to produce an intermediate mass black hole able to
          eject an 8 Msun star with hypervelocity.

          We present a model of Fourier Power Density Spectrum (PDS)
          formation in accretion powered X-ray binary systems derived
          from the first principles of the diffusion theory. Timing
          properties of X-ray emission are considered to be a result of
          diffusive propagation of the driving perturbations in a bounded
          medium. We prove that the integrated power P_x of the resulting
          PDS is only a small fraction of the integrated power P_dr of
          the driving oscillations, which is distributed over the disk.
          The resulting PDS continuum is a sum of two components, a low
          frequency (LF) component which presumably originates in an
          extended accretion disk and a high frequency (HF) component
          which originates in the innermost part of the source (Compton
          cloud or corona). The LF PDS component has a power-law shape
          with index of 1.0-1.5 at higher frequencies (``red'' noise) and
          a flat spectrum below a characteristic (break) frequency
          (``white'' noise). This white-red noise (WRN) continuum
          spectrum holds information about the physical parameters of the
          bounded extended medium, diffusion time scale and the
          dependence law of viscosity vs radius. We apply our model of
          the PDS to a sample of RXTE and EXOSAT timing data from Cyg X-1
          and Cyg X-2 which describes adequately the spectral transitions

          using the diffusion approximation. For a given effective
          temperature, the computed spectrum with the diffusion
          approximation is always softer than that of a full computation
          at a non-negligible level. It leads to an over-estimate of the
          effective temperature if the diffusion approximation spectrum
          is employed in the spectral fitting. Other characteristics for

          Electrostatic oscillations in cold electron-positron plasmas
          can be coupled to a propagating electromagnetic mode if the
          background magnetic field is inhomogeneous. Previous work
          considered this coupling in the quasi-linear regime,
          successfully simulating the electromagnetic mode. Here we
          present a stability analysis of the non-linear problem,
          perturbed from dynamical equilibrium, in order to gain some
          insight into the modes present in the system.

          Title: Is the Lack of Pulsations in Low Mass X-Ray Binaries due
          to Comptonizing Coronae?

          The spin periods of the neutron stars in most Low Mass X-ray
          Binary (LMXB) systems still remain undetected. One of the
          models to explain the absence of coherent pulsations has been
          the suppression of the beamed signal by Compton scattering of
          X-ray photons by electrons in a surrounding corona. We point
          out that simultaneously with wiping out the pulsation signal,
          such a corona will upscatter (pulsating or not) X-ray emission
          originating at and/or near the surface of the neutron star
          leading to appearance of a hard tail of Comptonized radiation
          in the source spectrum. We analyze the hard X-ray spectra of a
          selected set of LMXBs and demonstrate that the optical depth of
          the corona is not likely to be large enough to cause the
          pulsations to disappear.

          It is shown that the slow glitches in the spin rate of the
          pulsar B1822-09 can be explained by the reconstruction of the
          neutron star shape, which is not matched with the star rotation
          axis. Owing to the evolution of the inclination angle, i.e. the
          angle between the rotation axis and the axis of the magnetic
          dipole, under the action of the braking torque, there appears
          the disagreement between the rotation axis and the symmetry
          axis. After the angle between the axis of symmetry and the axis
          of the rotation achieves the maximum value of alpha ~ 2x10^-4
          the shape of the neutron star becomes matching with the
          rotation axis. Such reconstruction is observed as the slow
          glitch.

          We solve the time-dependent dynamics of axisymmetric, general
          relativistic MHD winds from rotating neutron stars. The mass
          loss rate is obtained self consistently as a solution of the
          MHD equations, subject to a finite thermal pressure at the
          stellar surface. Conditions are chosen to be representative of
          the neutrino driven phase in newly born magnetars, which have
          been considered as a possible engine for GRBs. We compute the
          angular momentum and energy losses as a function of $\sigma$
          and compare them with the analytic expectation from the
          classical theory of pulsar winds. We observe the convergence to
          the force-free limit in the energy loss and we study the
          evolution of the closed zone for increasing magnetization.
          Results also show that the dipolar magnetic field and the
          presence of a closed zone do not modify significantly the
          acceleration and collimation properties of the wind.

          We propose a model, which naturally explains an unusual thermal
          X-ray emission, observed from PSR J1119-6127. The model is
          based on the assumption that the pulsar magnetic field near the
          stellar surface differs significantly from the pure dipole
          field. We show that the structure and curvature of the field
          lines can be of the kind that allows the pair creation in the
          closed field line region. The created pairs propagate along the
          closed field lines and heat the stellar surface beyond the
          local poles. It is demonstrated that such a configuration can
          be easily realized.

          have constructed a geometrical model, based on an empirical
          relationship between height and frequency of emission, that
          reproduces many of the observed characteristics. The model
          suggests very low emission altitudes for this pulsar of only a
          few kilometers above the star's surface.

          Accretion of interstellar material by a magnetized, slowly
          rotating isolated neutron star is discussed. We show that the
          average persistent X-ray luminosity of these objects is
          unlikely to exceed 4x10^26 erg/s. They can also appear as X-ray
          bursters with the burst duration of ~30 minutes and repetition
          time of \~10^5 yr. This indicates that the number of the
          accreting isolated neutron stars which could be observed with
          recent X-ray missions is a few orders of magnitude smaller than
          that previously estimated. Our findings argue against models in
          which the magnetic field of neutron stars is assumed to decay
          exponentially on a time scale shorter than 500 Myr.

          Raytracing computations for light emitted from the surface of a
          rapidly rotating neutron star are carried out in order to
          construct light curves for accreting millisecond pulsars. These
          calculations are for realistic models of rapidly rotating
          neutron stars which take into account both the correct exterior
          metric and the oblate shape of the star. We find that the most
          important effect, comparing the full raytracing computations
          with simpler approximations currently in use, arises from the
          oblate shape of the rotating star. Approximating a rotating
          neutron star as a sphere introduces serious errors in fitted
          values of the star's radius and mass if the rotation rate is
          very large. However, for lower rotation rates acceptable mass
          and radius values can be obtained using the spherical
          approximation.

          Model atmospheres of isolated neutron stars with low magnetic
          field are calculated with Compton scattering taking into
          account. Models with effective temperatures 1, 3 and 5 MK, with
          two values of surface gravity log(g)g = 13.9 and 14.3), and
          different chemical compositions are calculated. Radiation
          spectra computed with Compton scattering are softer than the
          computed with Thomson scattering at high energies (E > 5 keV)
          for hot (T_eff > 1 MK) atmospheres with hydrogen-helium
          composition. Compton scattering is more significant to hydrogen
          models with low surface gravity. The emergent spectra of the
          hottest (T_eff > 3 MK) model atmospheres can be described by
          diluted blackbody spectra with hardness factors ~ 1.6 - 1.9.
          Compton scattering is less important for models with solar
          abundance of heavy elements.

          Title: A hypervelocity star from the Large Magellanic Cloud
          Authors: Alessia Gualandris, Simon Portegies Zwart
          Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures, MNRAS Letters, in press
          We study the acceleration of the star HE0437-5439, to
          hypervelocity and discuss its possible origin in the Large
          Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The star has a radial velocity of 723
          km/s and is located at a distance of 61 kpc from the Sun. With
          a mass of about 8 Msun, the travel time from the Galactic
          centre is of about 100 Myr, much longer than its main sequence
          lifetime. Given the relatively small distance to the LMC (18
          kpc), we consider it likely that HE0437-5439 originated in the
          cloud rather than in the Galactic centre, like the other
          hypervelocity stars. The minimum ejection velocity required to
          travel from the LMC to its current location within its lifetime
          is of about 500 kms. Such a high velocity can only be obtained
          in a dynamical encounter with a massive black hole. We perform
          3-body scattering simulations in which a stellar binary
          encounters a massive black hole and find that a black hole more
          massive than 1000 Msun is necessary to explain the high
          velocity of HE0437-5439. We argue that the most likely birth
          place for HE0437-5439 in the LMC is the star cluster NGC 330,
          which is young enough to host stars coeval to HE0437-5439, and
          dense enough to produce an intermediate mass black hole able to
          eject an 8 Msun star with hypervelocity.

          We present a model of Fourier Power Density Spectrum (PDS)
          formation in accretion powered X-ray binary systems derived
          from the first principles of the diffusion theory. Timing
          properties of X-ray emission are considered to be a result of
          diffusive propagation of the driving perturbations in a bounded
          medium. We prove that the integrated power P_x of the resulting
          PDS is only a small fraction of the integrated power P_dr of
          the driving oscillations, which is distributed over the disk.
          The resulting PDS continuum is a sum of two components, a low
          frequency (LF) component which presumably originates in an
          extended accretion disk and a high frequency (HF) component
          which originates in the innermost part of the source (Compton
          cloud or corona). The LF PDS component has a power-law shape
          with index of 1.0-1.5 at higher frequencies (``red'' noise) and
          a flat spectrum below a characteristic (break) frequency
          (``white'' noise). This white-red noise (WRN) continuum
          spectrum holds information about the physical parameters of the
          bounded extended medium, diffusion time scale and the
          dependence law of viscosity vs radius. We apply our model of
          the PDS to a sample of RXTE and EXOSAT timing data from Cyg X-1
          and Cyg X-2 which describes adequately the spectral transitions
          in these sources.

          To derive physical properties of the neutron star surface with
          observed spectra, a realistic model spectrum of neutron star
          surface emission is essential. Limited by computing resources,
          a full computation of the radiative transfer equations without
          the diffusion approximation has been conducted up to date only
          for the case of local magnetic fields being perpendicular to
          the stellar surface. In this paper we report the
          full-computation result for an arbitrary field direction. For
          comparison we also compute the radiative transfer equation
          using the diffusion approximation. For a given effective
          temperature, the computed spectrum with the diffusion
          approximation is always softer than that of a full computation
          at a non-negligible level. It leads to an over-estimate of the
          effective temperature if the diffusion approximation spectrum
          is employed in the spectral fitting. Other characteristics for
          different magnetic field orientations, such as the beaming
          pattern of the two polarization modes and the structure of the
          atmosphere, are also discussed.

          We investigate a pair creation cascade in the magnetosphere of
          a rapidly rotating neutron star. We solve the set of the
          Poisson equation for the electro-static potential and the
          Boltzmann equations for electrons, positrons, and gamma-ray
          photons simultaneously. In this paper, we first examine the
          time-dependent nature of particle accelerators by solving the
          non-stationary Boltzmann equations on the two-dimensional
          poloidal plane in which both the rotational and magnetic axes
          reside. Evaluating the temperature of the heated polar cap
          surface, which is located near the magnetic pole, by the
          bombardment of gap-accelerated particles, and applying the
          scheme to millisecond pulsar parameters, we demonstrate that
          the solution converges to a stationary solution of which
          pair-creation cascade is maintained by the heated polar-cap
          emission, in a wide range of three-dimensional parameter space

          angle between the rotation axis and the axis of the magnetic
          dipole, under the action of the braking torque, there appears
          the disagreement between the rotation axis and the symmetry

          the shape of the neutron star becomes matching with the

          glitch.

          We solve the time-dependent dynamics of axisymmetric, general
          relativistic MHD winds from rotating neutron stars. The mass
          loss rate is obtained self consistently as a solution of the
          MHD equations, subject to a finite thermal pressure at the
          stellar surface. Conditions are chosen to be representative of
          the neutrino driven phase in newly born magnetars, which have
          been considered as a possible engine for GRBs. We compute the
          angular momentum and energy losses as a function of $\sigma$
          and compare them with the analytic expectation from the
          classical theory of pulsar winds. We observe the convergence to
          the force-free limit in the energy loss and we study the
          evolution of the closed zone for increasing magnetization.
          Results also show that the dipolar magnetic field and the
          presence of a closed zone do not modify significantly the
          acceleration and collimation properties of the wind.

          We propose a model, which naturally explains an unusual thermal
          X-ray emission, observed from PSR J1119-6127. The model is
          based on the assumption that the pulsar magnetic field near the
          stellar surface differs significantly from the pure dipole
          field. We show that the structure and curvature of the field
          lines can be of the kind that allows the pair creation in the
          closed field line region. The created pairs propagate along the
          closed field lines and heat the stellar surface beyond the
          local poles. It is demonstrated that such a configuration can
          be easily realized.

          Here we present the results from an analysis of a
          multifrequency simultaneous observation of PSR B0031$-$07. We
          have constructed a geometrical model, based on an empirical
          relationship between height and frequency of emission, that
          reproduces many of the observed characteristics. The model
          suggests very low emission altitudes for this pulsar of only a
          few kilometers above the star's surface.

          Accretion of interstellar material by a magnetized, slowly
          rotating isolated neutron star is discussed. We show that the
          average persistent X-ray luminosity of these objects is
          unlikely to exceed 4x10^26 erg/s. They can also appear as X-ray
          bursters with the burst duration of ~30 minutes and repetition
          time of \~10^5 yr. This indicates that the number of the
          accreting isolated neutron stars which could be observed with
          recent X-ray missions is a few orders of magnitude smaller than
          that previously estimated. Our findings argue against models in
          which the magnetic field of neutron stars is assumed to decay
          exponentially on a time scale shorter than 500 Myr.

          Raytracing computations for light emitted from the surface of a
          rapidly rotating neutron star are carried out in order to
          construct light curves for accreting millisecond pulsars. These
          calculations are for realistic models of rapidly rotating
          neutron stars which take into account both the correct exterior
          metric and the oblate shape of the star. We find that the most
          important effect, comparing the full raytracing computations
          with simpler approximations currently in use, arises from the
          oblate shape of the rotating star. Approximating a rotating
          neutron star as a sphere introduces serious errors in fitted
          values of the star's radius and mass if the rotation rate is
          very large. However, for lower rotation rates acceptable mass
          and radius values can be obtained using the spherical
          approximation.

          Model atmospheres of isolated neutron stars with low magnetic
          field are calculated with Compton scattering taking into
          account. Models with effective temperatures 1, 3 and 5 MK, with
          two values of surface gravity log(g)g = 13.9 and 14.3), and
          different chemical compositions are calculated. Radiation
          spectra computed with Compton scattering are softer than the
          computed with Thomson scattering at high energies (E > 5 keV)
          for hot (T_eff > 1 MK) atmospheres with hydrogen-helium
          composition. Compton scattering is more significant to hydrogen
          models with low surface gravity. The emergent spectra of the
          hottest (T_eff > 3 MK) model atmospheres can be described by
          diluted blackbody spectra with hardness factors ~ 1.6 - 1.9.
          Compton scattering is less important for models with solar
          abundance of heavy elements.

          Title: On the theory of magnetar QPOs
          Authors: Yuri Levin (Leiden University)
          Comments: 10 pages, submitted to MNRAS
          We consider torsional oscillations of magnetars. This problem
          features rich dynamics due to the strong interaction between
          the normal modes of a magnetar's crust and a continuum of
          Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic (MHD) modes in its fluid core. We study
          the dynamics using a simple model of a magnetar possessing a
          uniform magnetic field and a thin spherical crust. Firstly, we
          show that global torsional modes only exist when one introduces
          unphysically large dissipative terms into the equations of
          motion; thus global modes are not helpful for understanding the
          magnetar Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs). Secondly, we solve
          the initial-value problem by simulating the sudden release of
          an initially strained crust and monitoring the subsequent
          crustal motion. We find that the crustal torsional modes
          quickly exchange their energy with the MHD continuum in the
          core, and decay by several orders of magnitude over the course
          of about 10 oscillation periods. After the initial rapid decay,
          the crustal motion is stabilized and several time-varying QPOs
          are observed. The dynamical spectrum of the simulated crustal
          motion is in qualitative agreement with that of the x-ray
          light-curve in the tail of a giant magnetar flare. The
          asymptotic frequencies of some of the QPOs are associated with
          the special spectral points--the turning points or edges--of
          the MHD continuum, and are not related to those of the crust.
          The observed steady low-frequency QPO at 18 Hz is almost
          certainly associated with the lowest frequency of the MHD
          continuum, or its first overtone. We also find that drifting
          QPOs get amplified when they come near the frequencies of the
          crustal modes. This explains why some of the observed QPOs have
          frequencies close to the expected crustal frequencies, and why
          these QPOs are highly variable with time.

          Title: Circumstellar Interaction Around Type Ib/c Supernovae
          and the GRB Connection
          Authors: R. A. Chevalier
          Comments: 8 pages, to appear in Circumstellar Media and Late
          Stages of Massive Stellar Evolution, RevMexAA
          Radio observations of Type Ib/c supernovae suggest that
          circumstellar interaction takes place with a wide range of wind
          densities, comparable to that seen in Galactic Wolf-Rayet
          stars. Efficient production of magnetic field in the shocked
          region is needed. The X-ray emission observed from some Type
          Ib/c supernovae is higher than would be expected by the thermal
          or inverse Compton mechanisms; a synchrotron interpretation
          requires a flattening of the electron energy spectrum at high
          energies, as might occur in a cosmic ray dominated shock wave.
          The wind density variations that are indicated in two
          supernovae may be due to a binary companion, although variable
          mass loss from a single star remains a possibility. Other than
          the optical supernova radiation, the emission from the nearby
          SN 2006aj/GRB 060218 appears to be powered by a central engine,
          while that from SN 1998bw/GRB 980425 could be powered by either
          a central engine or the outer supernova ejecta.

          Title: Gravitational Dynamics of an Infinite Shuffled Lattice:
          Particle Coarse-grainings, Non-linear Clustering and the

          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          We study the evolution under their self-gravity of infinite
          ``shuffled lattice'' particle distributions, focussing
          specifically on the comparison of this evolution with that of
          ``daughter'' particle distributions, defined by a simple
          coarse-graining procedure. We consider both the case that such
          coarse-grainings are performed (i) on the initial conditions,
          and (ii) at a finite time with a specific additional
          prescription. In numerical simulations we observe that, to a
          first approximation, these coarse-grainings represent well the
          evolution of the two-point correlation properties over a
          significant range of scales. We note, in particular, that the
          form of the two-point correlation function in the original
          system, when it is evolving in the asymptotic ``self-similar''
          regime, may be reproduced well in a daughter coarse-grained
          system in which the dynamics are still dominated by two-body
          (nearest neighbor) interactions. Using analytical results on
          the early time evolution of these systems, however, we show
          that small observed differences between the evolved system and
          its coarse-grainings at the initial time will in fact diverge
          as the ratio of the coarse-graining scale to the original
          inter-particle distance increases. The second coarse-graining
          studied, performed at a finite time in a specified manner,
          circumvents this problem. It also makes more physically
          transparent why gravitational dynamics from these initial
          conditions tends toward a ``self-similar'' evolution. We
          finally discuss the precise definition of a limit in which a
          continuum (specifically Vlasov-like) description of the
          observed linear and non-linear evolution should be applicable.

          The three objects have been identified as members of the
          recently recognized class of Gamma Doradus stars, which exhibit
          multi-periodic photometric variations that are thought to arise
          from non-radial pulsation. The particular objects treated here
          also prove to be spectroscopic binaries, for which we provide
          reliable orbits. The radial velocities exhibit unusually large
          residuals, in which some of the photometric periodicities can
          be traced. Some of the same periodicities are also demonstrated
          by the observed variations in the line profiles, which are
          quantified here simply in terms of the line-widths.

          W.Becker, H.H.Huang, MPE Report 291, pp.185-188
          We discuss the "basic" condition for an accreting neutron star
          to become a microquasar, i.e. ejecting relativistic particles
          orthogonal to the accretion disk instead of confining
          disk-material down to the magnetic poles and creating the two
          emitting caps typical for a X-ray pulsar. Jet creation is
          prevented for B >/= 10^12 G independent of the accretion rate.
          This excludes the possibility for a classic X-ray pulsar to
          develop a "microquasar-phase" and is consistent with the lack
          of radio emission from such pulsar systems. Millisecond
          accretion-powered pulsars, on the contrary, may show a
          "microquasar-phase", where B < 10^7.5 G is valid, whereas the
          limit for Z sources is B < 10^8.2 G. The implication of our
          analysis is that the jet might be the suitable agent of angular
          momentum sink for millisecond accretion-powered pulsars.

          W.Becker, H.H.Huang, MPE Report 291, pp.189-192
          In this work we explore the idea that the high frequency QPOs
          observed in LMXBs may be explained as a resonant coupling
          between the neutron star spin and epicyclic modes of accretion
          disk oscillations. We propose a new model for these QPOs based
          on forced oscillations induced in the accretion disk due to a
          stellar asymmetric rotating gravitational or magnetic field. It
          is shown that particles evolving in a rotating non-axisymmetric
          field are subject to three kinds of resonances: a corotation
          resonance, a Lindblad resonance due to a driving force, and a
          parametric resonance due to the time varying epicyclic
          frequencies. These results are extends by means of 2D numerical
          simulations of a simplified version of the accretion disk. The
          simulations are performed for the Newtonian gravitational
          potential, as well as for a pseudo-general relativistic
          potential, which enables us to explore the behavior of the
          resonances around both rotating neutron stars and black holes.
          Density perturbations are only significant in the region
          located close to the inner edge of the disk near the ISCO where
          the gravitational or magnetic perturbation is maximal. It is
          argued that the nearly periodic motion induced in the disk will
          produce high quality factor QPOs.
          Finally, applying this model to a typical neutron star, we
          found that the strongest response occurs when the frequency
          difference of the two modes equals either the spin frequency
          (for "slow rotators") or half of it (for "fast rotators"). The
          two main excited modes may both be connected to vertical
          oscillations of the disk. We emphasize that strong gravity is
          not needed to excite the modes.

          A new scheme for testing the nuclear matter (NM) equation of
          state (EoS) at high densities using constraints from compact
          star (CS) phenomenology is applied to neutron stars with a core
          of deconfined quark matter (QM). An acceptable EoS shall not to
          be in conflict with the mass measurement of 2.1 +/- 0.2 solar
          mass (1 sigma level) for PSR J0751+1807 and the mass radius
          relation deduced from the thermal emission of RX J1856-3754.
          Further constraints for the state of matter in CS interiors
          come from temperature-age data for young, nearby objects. The
          CS cooling theory shall agree not only with these data, but
          also with the mass distribution inferred via population
          synthesis models as well as with LogN-LogS data. The scheme is
          applied to a set of hybrid EsoS with a phase transition to
          stiff, color superconducting QM which fulfills all above
          constraints and is constrained otherwise from NM saturation
          properties and flow data of heavy-ion collisions. We
          extrapolate our description to low temperatures and draw
          conclusions for the QCD phase diagram to be explored in
          heavy-ion collision experiments.

          Almost 40 years after the discovery of pulsars -- and despite a
          plethora of secured data on them -- pulsar theory is still
          beset by a number of fundamental inconsistencies. In this short
          contribution, I will argue that (i) magnetars do not exist,
          (ii) (ordinary) pulsars turnoff (or 'die') when their wind
          pressure falls short of keeping the CSM at a safe distance,
          exceeding 10^15 cm, whereupon they can mimic magnetars, (iii)
          msec pulsars are born fast (in core-collapse SNe), and are much
          older inside globular clusters than outside of them, (iv)
          neutron-star corotating magnetospheres can oscillate almost in
          resonance with their spin frequency, giving rise to pulse
          drifting, and to QPOs of accreting binary X-ray sources, and
          (v) the dying pulsars are the dominant sources of the cosmic
          rays, and of the GRBs.

          We present a systematic analysis of all the BeppoSAX data of
          SGR 1900+14. The observations spanning five years show that the
          source was brighter than usual on two occasions: ~20 days after
          the August 1998 giant flare and during the 10^5 sec long X-ray
          afterglow following the April 2001 intermediate flare. In the
          latter case, we explore the possibility of describing the
          observed short term softening only with a change of the
          temperature of a blackbody-like component. In the only BeppoSAX
          observation performed before the giant flare, the spectrum of
          the SGR 1900+14 persistent emission was significantly harder
          and possibly detected also above 10 keV with the PDS
          instrument. In the last BeppoSAX observation (April 2002) the
          flux was ~25 % lower than the historical level, suggesting that
          the source was entering a quiescent period.

          The soft gamma repeater (SGR) 1900+14 emitted the giant flare
          on 27 August 1998. Most gamma-ray detectors saturated during
          the initial spike of the giant flare because of the intense
          flux. However the plasma particle detector onboard GEOTAIL
          observed the first 300 ms time profile with a time resolution
          of 5.577 ms and the initial spike of the giant flare was first
          resolved. The time profile shows some similarities to that of
          the SGR 1806-20 giant flare in 2004: the clear exponential
          decay and the small hump in the decay phase around 300 or 400
          ms.

          Both superbursters and soft X-ray transients probe the thermal
          structure of the crust on compact stars and are sensitive to
          the process of deep crustal heating. It was recently shown that
          the transfer of matter from crust to core in a strange star can
          heat the crust by deconfinement and ignite superbursts provided
          certain constraints on the strange quark matter equation of
          state are fulfilled. Corresponding constraints are derived for
          soft X-ray transients in a simple parameterized model assuming
          their quiescent emission is powered in the same way, and the
          time dependence of this heating mechanism in transient systems
          is discussed.

          We have performed an analysis and interpretation of the X-ray
          light curve of the accreting neutron star Her X-1 obtained with
          the ASM RXTE over the period 1996 February to 2004 September.
          The averaged X-ray light curves are constructed by means of
          adding up light curves corresponding to different 35 day
          cycles. A numerical model is introduced to explain the
          properties of the averaged light curves. We argue that a change
          of the tilt of the accretion disk over the 35 day period is
          necessary to account for the observed features and show that
          our numerical model can explain such a behavior of the disk and
          reproduce the details of the light curve.

          Observations of Millisecond Pulsars
          Authors: Slavko Bogdanov, George B. Rybicki, Jonathan E.
          Grindlay
          Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures; submitted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We present model spectra and lightcurves of thermal emission
          from hot spots on the surface of a compact star with an
          unmagnetized light-element atmosphere. An application to X-ray
          observations of the nearest known rotation-powered millisecond
          pulsar (MSP) PSR J0437--4715 reveals that the thermal emission
          from this pulsar is fully consistent with such a model,
          enabling constraints on important properties of the underlying
          neutron star. We demonstrate that the observed thermal X-ray
          pulsations from J0437--4715 are incompatible with blackbody
          emission and require the presence of a limb-darkened, light
          element (most likely hydrogen) atmosphere on the neutron star
          surface. The morphology of the X-ray pulse profile is
          consistent with a global dipole configuration of the pulsar
          magnetic field but suggests an off-center magnetic axis, with a
          displacement of $\gtrsim$1 km from the stellar center. For an
          assumed mass of 1.4 M$_{\odot}$, the model restricts the
          allowed stellar radii to R=6.8-13.8 km (90% confidence) and
          R>6.7 km (99.9% confidence), which is consistent with standard
          NS equations of state and rules out an ultra-compact star.
          Deeper spectroscopic and timing observations of this and other
          nearby radio MSPs with current and future X-ray facilities
          (e.g., Constellation-X and XEUS) can provide further insight
          into the fundamental properties of neutron stars.

          The puzzling phenomenon of pulsar kicks, i.e. the observed
          large escape velocities of pulsars out of supernova remnants,
          is examined for compact stars with a strange quark matter core.
          The direct Urca process in quark matter is studied in the
          presence of a strong magnetic field. Conditions for an
          asymmetric emission of the produced neutrinos are worked out in
          detail, giving constraints on the temperature, the strength of
          the magnetic field and the electron chemical potential in the
          quark matter core. In addition, the neutrino mean free paths
          for quark matter and a possible hadronic mantle are considered.

          Neutron Stars and Pulsars (Posters and contributed talks)
          Physikzentrum Bad Honnef, Germany, May.14-19, 2006, eds.
          W.Becker, H.H.Huang, MPE Report 291, pp.185-188
          We discuss the "basic" condition for an accreting neutron star
          to become a microquasar, i.e. ejecting relativistic particles
          orthogonal to the accretion disk instead of confining
          disk-material down to the magnetic poles and creating the two
          emitting caps typical for a X-ray pulsar. Jet creation is
          prevented for B >/= 10^12 G independent of the accretion rate.
          This excludes the possibility for a classic X-ray pulsar to
          develop a "microquasar-phase" and is consistent with the lack
          of radio emission from such pulsar systems. Millisecond
          accretion-powered pulsars, on the contrary, may show a
          "microquasar-phase", where B < 10^7.5 G is valid, whereas the
          limit for Z sources is B < 10^8.2 G. The implication of our
          analysis is that the jet might be the suitable agent of angular
          momentum sink for millisecond accretion-powered pulsars.

          Neutron Stars and Pulsars (Posters and contributed talks)
          Physikzentrum Bad Honnef, Germany, May.14-19, 2006, eds.
          W.Becker, H.H.Huang, MPE Report 291, pp.189-192
          In this work we explore the idea that the high frequency QPOs
          observed in LMXBs may be explained as a resonant coupling
          between the neutron star spin and epicyclic modes of accretion
          disk oscillations. We propose a new model for these QPOs based
          on forced oscillations induced in the accretion disk due to a
          stellar asymmetric rotating gravitational or magnetic field. It
          is shown that particles evolving in a rotating non-axisymmetric
          field are subject to three kinds of resonances: a corotation
          resonance, a Lindblad resonance due to a driving force, and a
          parametric resonance due to the time varying epicyclic
          frequencies. These results are extends by means of 2D numerical
          simulations of a simplified version of the accretion disk. The
          simulations are performed for the Newtonian gravitational
          potential, as well as for a pseudo-general relativistic
          potential, which enables us to explore the behavior of the
          resonances around both rotating neutron stars and black holes.
          Density perturbations are only significant in the region
          located close to the inner edge of the disk near the ISCO where
          the gravitational or magnetic perturbation is maximal. It is
          argued that the nearly periodic motion induced in the disk will
          produce high quality factor QPOs.
          Finally, applying this model to a typical neutron star, we
          found that the strongest response occurs when the frequency
          difference of the two modes equals either the spin frequency
          (for "slow rotators") or half of it (for "fast rotators"). The
          two main excited modes may both be connected to vertical
          oscillations of the disk. We emphasize that strong gravity is
          not needed to excite the modes.

          observed the first 300 ms time profile with a time resolution
          of 5.577 ms and the initial spike of the giant flare was first
          resolved. The time profile shows some similarities to that of
          the SGR 1806-20 giant flare in 2004: the clear exponential
          decay and the small hump in the decay phase around 300 or 400
          ms.

          Title: Testing consistency of deconfinement heating of strange
          stars in superbursters and soft X-ray transients

          Both superbursters and soft X-ray transients probe the thermal
          structure of the crust on compact stars and are sensitive to
          the process of deep crustal heating. It was recently shown that
          the transfer of matter from crust to core in a strange star can
          heat the crust by deconfinement and ignite superbursts provided
          certain constraints on the strange quark matter equation of
          state are fulfilled. Corresponding constraints are derived for
          soft X-ray transients in a simple parameterized model assuming
          their quiescent emission is powered in the same way, and the
          time dependence of this heating mechanism in transient systems
          is discussed.

          We have performed an analysis and interpretation of the X-ray
          light curve of the accreting neutron star Her X-1 obtained with
          the ASM RXTE over the period 1996 February to 2004 September.
          The averaged X-ray light curves are constructed by means of
          adding up light curves corresponding to different 35 day
          cycles. A numerical model is introduced to explain the
          properties of the averaged light curves. We argue that a change
          of the tilt of the accretion disk over the 35 day period is
          necessary to account for the observed features and show that
          our numerical model can explain such a behavior of the disk and
          reproduce the details of the light curve.

          Observations of Millisecond Pulsars
          Authors: Slavko Bogdanov, George B. Rybicki, Jonathan E.
          Grindlay
          Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures; submitted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We present model spectra and lightcurves of thermal emission
          from hot spots on the surface of a compact star with an
          unmagnetized light-element atmosphere. An application to X-ray
          observations of the nearest known rotation-powered millisecond
          pulsar (MSP) PSR J0437--4715 reveals that the thermal emission
          from this pulsar is fully consistent with such a model,
          enabling constraints on important properties of the underlying
          neutron star. We demonstrate that the observed thermal X-ray
          pulsations from J0437--4715 are incompatible with blackbody
          emission and require the presence of a limb-darkened, light
          element (most likely hydrogen) atmosphere on the neutron star
          surface. The morphology of the X-ray pulse profile is
          consistent with a global dipole configuration of the pulsar
          magnetic field but suggests an off-center magnetic axis, with a
          displacement of $\gtrsim$1 km from the stellar center. For an
          assumed mass of 1.4 M$_{\odot}$, the model restricts the
          allowed stellar radii to R=6.8-13.8 km (90% confidence) and
          R>6.7 km (99.9% confidence), which is consistent with standard
          NS equations of state and rules out an ultra-compact star.
          Deeper spectroscopic and timing observations of this and other
          nearby radio MSPs with current and future X-ray facilities
          (e.g., Constellation-X and XEUS) can provide further insight
          into the fundamental properties of neutron stars.

          Comments: Accepted to ApJ, 11 pages
          The production of runaway massive binaries offers key insights
          into the evolution of close binary stars and open clusters. The
          stars HD 14633 and HD 15137 are rare examples of such runaway
          systems, and in this work we investigate the mechanism by which
          they were ejected from their parent open cluster, NGC 654. We
          discuss observational characteristics that can be used to
          distinguish supernova ejected systems from those ejected by
          dynamical interactions, and we present the results of a new
          radio pulsar search of these systems as well as estimates of
          their predicted X-ray flux assuming that each binary contains a
          compact object. Since neither pulsars nor X-ray emission are
          observed in these systems, we cannot conclude that these
          binaries contain compact companions. We also consider whether
          they may have been ejected by dynamical interactions in the
          dense environment where they formed, and our simulations of
          four-body interactions suggest that a dynamical origin is
          possible but unlikely. We recommend further X-ray observations
          that will conclusively identify whether HD 14633 or HD 15137
          contain neutron stars.

          noise in the range $3 \simeq 10^{-4}$ - $1 \times 10^{-2}$ Hz
          and overwhelm the galactic WD-WD confusion noise at frequencies

          Workshop, held at Leicester on August 7-11, 2006
          The photospheric emission of a white dwarf (WD) is not expected
          to be detectable in hard X-rays or the mid-IR. Hard X-ray (~1
          keV) emission associated with a WD is usually attributed to a
          binary companion; however, emission at 1 keV has been detected
          from three WDs without companions: KPD 0005+5106, PG 1159, and
          WD 2226-210. The origin of their hard X-ray emission is
          unknown, although it has been suggested that WD 2226-210 has a
          late-type companion whose coronal activity is responsible for
          the hard X-rays. Recent Spitzer observations of WD 2226-210
          revealed mid-IR excess emission indicative of the existence of
          a dust disk. It now becomes much less clear whether WD
          2226-210's hard X-ray emission originates from the corona of a
          late-type companion or from the accretion of the disk material.
          High-quality X-ray observations and mid-IR observations of KPD
          0005+5106 and PG 1159 are needed to help us understand the
          origin of their hard X-ray emission.

          Title: Accretion disc dynamics in extreme mass ratio compact
          binaries
          Authors: Michael Truss (Durham University, UK)

          @arXiv problems with mn2e.sty
          An analysis is presented of a numerical investigation of the
          dynamics and geometry of accretion discs in binary systems with
          mass ratios q < 0.1, applicable to ultra-compact X-ray
          binaries, AM CVn stars and very short period cataclysmic
          variables. The steady-state geometry of the disc in the binary
          reference frame is found to be quite different from that
          expected at higher mass ratios. For q ~ 0.1, the disc takes on
          the usual elliptical shape, with the major axis aligned
          perpendicular to the line of centres of the two stars. However,
          at smaller mass ratios the elliptical gaseous orbits in the
          outer regions of the disc are rotated in the binary plane. The
          angle of rotation increases with gas temperature, but is found
          to vary inversely with q. At q = 0.01, the major axis of these
          orbits is aligned almost parallel to the line of centres of the
          two stars. These effects may be responsible for the similar
          disc structure inferred from Doppler tomography of the AM CVn
          star GP Com (Morales-Rueda et al. 2003), which has q = 0.02.
          The steady-state geometry at low mass ratios is not predicted
          by an inviscid, restricted three-body model of gaseous orbits;
          it is related to the effects of tidal-viscous truncation of the
          disc near the Roche lobe boundary. Since the disc geometry can
          be inferred observationally for some systems, it is proposed
          that this may offer a useful diagnostic for the determination
          of mass ratios in ultra-compact binaries.

          Authors: Hirotaka Sugawara
          Comments: 23 pages total with 2 figures
          The concept of Euclidean time is proposed which is dual to the
          usual Minkowski time. The De Sitter solution is shown to be
          dual to the anti-De Sitter solution under the dual
          transformation in which Euclidean time and Minkowski time are
          interchanged. This observation enables us to make a proposal in
          which supersymmetry is broken, but the four dimensional
          cosmological constant remains zero. An explicit model is
          proposed in which we calculate the cosmological constant. The
          phenomenology based on this model is presented, including the
          issue of the quark-lepton-Higgs mass matrix.

          We review the formation and evolution of compact binary stars
          consisting of white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs), and
          black holes (BHs). Binary NSs and BHs are thought to be the
          primary astrophysical sources of gravitational waves (GWs)
          within the frequency band of ground-based detectors, while
          compact binaries of WDs are important sources of GWs at lower
          frequencies to be covered by space interferometers (LISA).
          Major uncertainties in the current understanding of properties
          of NSs and BHs most relevant to the GW studies are discussed,
          including the treatment of the natal kicks which compact
          stellar remnants acquire during the core collapse of massive
          stars and the common envelope phase of binary evolution. We
          discuss the coalescence rates of binary NSs and BHs and
          prospects for their detections, the formation and evolution of
          binary WDs and their observational manifestations. Special
          attention is given to AM CVn-stars -- compact binaries in which
          the Roche lobe is filled by another WD or a low-mass partially
          degenerate helium-star, as these stars are thought to be the
          best LISA verification binary GW sources.

          The field of the extended TeV source HESS J1804-216 was
          serendipitously observed with the Chandra ACIS detector. The
          data reveal several X-ray sources within the bright part of
          HESS J1804-216. The brightest of these objects, CXOU
          J180432.4-214009, which has been also detected with Swift and
          Suzaku, is consistent with being a point-like source, with the
          0.3-7 keV flux of (1.7\pm0.2)\times10^{-13} ergs s^{-1}
          cm^{-2}. Its hard and strongly absorbed spectrum can be fitted
          by the absorbed power-law model with the best-fit photon index
          of 0.45 and hydrogen column density of 4\times10^{22} cm^{-2},
          both with large uncertainties due to the strong correlation
          between these parameters. A search for pulsations resulted in a
          106 s period candidate, which however has a low significance of
          97.9%. We found no infrared-optical counterparts for this
          source. The second brightest source, CXOU J180441.9-214224,
          which has been detected with Suzaku, is either extended or
          multiple, with the flux of about 10^{-13} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}.
          We found a nearby M dwarf within the X-ray source extension,
          which could contribute a fraction of the observed X-ray flux.
          The remaining sources are very faint (<3\times 10^{-14} ergs
          cm^{-2} s^{-1}), and at least some of them are likely
          associated with nearby stars. Although one or both of the two
          brighter X-ray sources could be faint accreting binaries or
          remote pulsars with pulsar wind nebulae (hence possible TeV
          sources), their relation to HESS J1804-216 remains elusive. The
          possibility that HESS J1804-216 is powered by the relativistic
          wind from the young pulsar B1800-21, located at a distance of
          about 10 pc from the TeV source, still remains a more plausible
          option.

          We report on the discovery and analysis of the transient X-ray
          pulsar CXO/XMMU J073709.13+653544 detected in the 2004
          August-October Chandra and XMM observations of the nearby
          spiral galaxy NGC2403. The source exhibits X-ray pulsations
          with a period P~18 s, a nearly sinusoidal pulse shape and
          pulsed fraction 46-70%. The source shows a rapid decrease of
          the pulsation period from 18.25 s on Aug. 9 to 17.93 s on Sep.
          12 and 17.56 s on Oct. 3, 2004. The X-ray spectra of the source
          are hard and are well fitted with an absorbed simple power law
          of photon index 0.9~1.2. The X-ray properties of the source and
          the absence of an optical/UV counterpart allow us to identify
          CXO/XMMU J073709.13+653544 as accreting X-ray pulsar in
          NGC2403. The maximum unabsorbed luminosity of the source in the
          0.3-7 keV range, ~2.6x10e38 erg/s at 3.2 Mpc, is at least 260
          times higher than its quiescent luminosity. The corresponding
          luminosity in the 0.3-100 keV energy range could be as high as
          ~1.2x10e39 erg/s, assuming the typical pulsar energy spectrum
          with high-energy cut-off at 10-20 keV. The rate of decrease of
          the pulsation period of the source (-10e-7 s/s) is the fastest
          observed among accreting pulsars. The evolution of the
          pulsation period suggests that it is dominated by the intrinsic
          spin-up of the compact object. The accretion rate implied by
          X-ray luminosity of CXO/XMMU J073709.13+653544 could account
          for the observed spin-up rate, assuming that the X-ray source
          is powered by disk accretion onto highly magnetized neutron
          star. Based on the transient behavior and overall X-ray
          properties of the source, we conclude that it could be an X-ray
          pulsar belonging to either a Be binary system or a low-mass
          system similar to GRO J1744-28.

          Title: Variability of Nineteen Millisecond Pulsars in 47
          Tucanae with CHANDRA/HRC-S

          Comments: 21 pages, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We present results from our 830 ksec observation of the
          globular cluster 47 Tucanae with the Chandra X-ray
          Observatory's High Resolution Camera-S. We limit our analysis
          here to the 19 previously known, localized millisecond pulsars
          (MSPs) in the cluster. This work more than doubles the sample
          of X-ray-detected MSPs observed with sensitivity to rotational
          variability; it is also the first survey of a large group of
          radio-discovered MSPs for which no previous X-ray pulsations
          have been detected and is therefore an unbiased survey of the
          X-ray properties of radio-discovered MSPs. We find that only 47
          Tuc D, O and R show significant pulsations at the >~ 4-sigma
          level, but there is statistical evidence for rotational
          variability in five additional MSPs. Furthermore, we constrain
          the pulsed magnetospheric emission of 7 more MSPs using Monte
          Carlo simulations. The result is that the majority of the 47
          Tuc MSPs are characterized by low pulsed fractions, <~ 50%. In
          cases where larger pulsed fractions are measured the folded
          pulse profiles show relatively large duty cycles. When
          considered with previous spectroscopic studies, this suggests
          that the X-ray emission arises from the neutron star's heated
          polar caps, and in some cases, from intra-binary shocks, but
          generally not directly from the star's magnetosphere. We
          discuss the impact of these results on our understanding of
          high energy emission from MSPs.

          Title: Investigating Binary Properties with Next-Generation
          Microlensing Surveys
          Authors: Cheongho Han (Chungbuk Natl. Univ., Korea)
          Comments: total 6 pages, including 4 figures, ApJ, in press
          We explore the usefulness of future gravitational microlensing
          surveys in the study of binary properties such as the binary
          fraction and the distributions of binary separation and mass
          ratio by using the binary sample detectable through a channel
          of repeating events. For this, we estimate the rate of
          repeating microlensing eventstoward the Galactic bulge field
          based on standard models of dynamical and physical
          distributions of Galactic matter combined with models of binary
          separation and mass function. From this, we find that the total
          number of repeating events expected to be detected from $\sim
          4$-year space-based surveys will be $\sim 200$--400, that is
          $\sim 40$--50 times higher than the rate of current surveys. We
          find that the high detection rate is due to the greatly
          improved sensitivity to events associated with faint source
          stars and low-magnification events. We find that the separation
          range of the binaries to be covered by the repeating events
          will extend up to 100 AU. Therefore, the future lensing surveys
          will provide a homogeneous sample that will allow to
          investigate the statistical properties of Galactic binaries
          unbiased by brightness of the binary components.

          Morris
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ (to appear in 10 Apr
          2007, vol. 659 issue), 18 pages and 15 figures
          We report the results of a diffraction-limited, photometric
          variability study of the central 5"x5" of the Galaxy conducted
          over the past 10 years using speckle imaging techniques on the
          W. M. Keck I 10 m telescope. Within our limiting magnitude of
          mK < 16 mag for images made from a single night of data, we
          find a minimum of 15 K[2.2 micron]-band variable stars out of
          131 monitored stars. The only periodic source in our sample is
          the previously identified variable IRS 16SW, for which we
          measure an orbital period of 19.448 +- 0.002 days. In contrast
          to recent results, our data on IRS 16SW show an asymmetric
          phased light curve with a much steeper fall-time than
          rise-time, which may be due to tidal deformations caused by the
          proximity of the stars in their orbits. We also identify a
          possible wind colliding binary (IRS 29N) based on its
          photometric variation over a few year time-scale which is
          likely due to episodic dust production. None of the 4 LBV
          candidates in our sample show the characteristic large increase
          or decrease in luminosity, however, our time baseline is too
          short to rule them out as LBVs. Among the remaining variable
          stars, the majority are early-type stars and three are possibly
          variable due to line of sight extinction variations. For the 7
          OB stars at the center of our field of view that have
          well-determined 3-dimensional orbits, we see no evidence of
          flares or dimming of their light, which limits the possibility
          of a cold, geometrically-thin inactive accretion disk around
          the supermassive black hole, Sgr A*.

          Title: Fallback and Black Hole Production in Massive Stars
          Authors: Weiqun Zhang, S. E. Woosley, A. Heger
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          The compact remnants of core collapse supernovae - neutron
          stars and black holes - have properties that reflect both the
          structure of their stellar progenitors and the physics of the
          explosion. In particular, the masses of these remnants are
          sensitive to the density structure of the presupernova star and
          to the explosion energy. To a considerable extent, the final
          mass is determined by the ``fallback'', during the explosion,
          of matter that initially moves outwards, yet ultimately fails
          to escape. We consider here the simulated explosion of a large
          number of massive stars (10 to 100 \Msun) of Population I
          (solar metallicity) and III (zero metallicity), and find
          systematic differences in the remnant mass distributions. As
          pointed out by Chevalier(1989), supernovae in more compact
          progenitor stars have stronger reverse shocks and experience
          more fallback. For Population III stars above about 25 \Msun
          and explosion energies less than $1.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg,
          black holes are a common outcome, with masses that increase
          monotonically with increasing main sequence mass up to a
          maximum hole mass of about 35 \Msun. If such stars produce
          primary nitrogen, however, their black holes are systematically
          smaller. For modern supernovae with nearly solar metallicity,
          black hole production is much less frequent and the typical
          masses, which depend sensitively on explosion energy, are
          smaller. We explore the neutron star initial mass function for
          both populations and, for reasonable assumptions about the
          initial mass cut of the explosion, find good agreement with the
          average of observed masses of neutron stars in binaries. We
          also find evidence for a bimodal distribution of neutron star
          masses with a spike around 1.2 \Msun (gravitational mass) and a
          broader distribution peaked around 1.4 \Msun.

          Comments: 9 pages, 9 figures. Submitted to ApJ
          Using archival X-ray data, we find that the catalog location of
          the X-ray binary Scutum X-1 (Sct X-1) is incorrect, and that
          the correct location is that of the X-ray source AX
          J183528-0737, which is 15' to the west. Our identification is
          made on the basis of the 112-s pulse period for this object
          detected in an XMM-Newton observation, as well as spatial
          coincidence between AX J183528-0737 and previous X-ray
          observations. Based on the XMM-Newton data and archival RXTE
          data, we confirm secular spin-down of three observations over
          17 years with period derivative Pdot~3.9e-9 s/s, but do not
          detect a previously reported X-ray iron fluorescence line. We
          identify a bright (Ks=6.55), red (J-Ks=5.51), optical and
          infrared counterpart to AX J183528-0737 from 2MASS, a number of
          mid-IR surveys, and deep optical observations, which we use to
          constrain the extinction to and distance of Sct X-1. From these
          data, as well as limited near-IR spectroscopy, we conclude that
          Sct X-1 is most likely a binary system comprised of a late-type
          giant or supergiant and a neutron star.

          We report on optical and NIR observations obtained during and
          after the 2004 December discovery outburst of the X-ray
          transient and accretion-powered millisecond pulsar IGR
          J00291+5934. Our observations monitored the evolution of the
          brightness and the spectral properties of J00291 during the
          outburst decay towards quiescence. We also present optical, NIR
          and Chandra observations obtained during true quiescence.
          Photometry of the field during outburst reveals an optical and
          NIR counterpart that brightened from R~23 to R~17 and from K=19
          to K~16. Spectral analysis of the RIJHK broadband photometry
          shows excess in the NIR bands that may be due to synchrotron
          emission. The Halpha emission line profile suggests the orbital
          inclination is ~22-32 degrees. The preferred range for the
          reddening towards the source is 0.7 < E(B-V) < 0.9, which is
          equivalent to 4.06E21 cm^-2 < NH < 5.22E21 cm^-2. The Chandra
          observations of the pulsar in its quiescent state gave an
          unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux for the best-fitting power-law model
          to the source spectrum of (7.0 +/- 0.9)E-14 ergs/cm^2/s
          (adopting a hydrogen column of 4.6E21 cm^-2. The fit resulted
          in a power-law photon index of 2.4 +/- 0.5. The (R-K)o color
          observed during quiescence supports an irradiated donor star
          and accretion disk. We estimate a distance of 2 to 4 kpc
          towards J00291 by using the outburst X-ray light curve and the
          estimated critical X-ray luminosity necessary to keep the outer
          parts of the accretion disk ionized. Using the quiescent X-ray
          luminosity and the spin period, we constrain the magnetic field
          of the neutron star to be < 3E8 Gauss.

          The Hough transformation has been used successfully for more
          than four decades. Originally used for tracking particle traces
          in bubble chamber images, this work shows a novel approach
          turning the initial idea into a powerful tool to incoherently
          detect millisecond pulsars in binary orbits.
          This poster presents the method used, a discussion on how to
          treat the time domain data from radio receivers and create the
          input "image" for the Hough transformation, details about the

          Relational databases (DBs) are ideal tools to manage bulky and
          structured data archives. In particular for Astronomy they can
          be used to fulfill all the requirements of a complex project,
          i.e. the management of: documents, software (s/w) packages and
          logs, observation schedules, object catalogues, quick-look,
          simulated, raw and processed data, etc. All the information
          gathered in a relational DB is easily and simultaneously
          accessible either from an interactive tool or a batch program.
          The user does not need to deal with traditional files I/O or
          editing, but has only to build the appropriate (SQL) query
          which will return the desired information/data, eventually
          producing the aforementioned files or even plots, tables, etc.
          in a variety of formats. What is then important for a generic
          user is to have the tools to easily and quickly develop, in any
          desired programming language, the custom s/w which can
          import/export the information into/from the DB. An example
          could be a Web interface which presents the available data and
          allows the user to select/retrieve (or even process) the data
          subset of interest.
          In the last years we have been implementing a package called
          MCS (see dedicated paper in this proceedings) which allows
          users to interact with MySQL based DBs through any programming
          language. MCS has a multi-thread (socket) architecture which
          means that several clients can submit queries to a server which
          in turn manages the communication with the MySQL server and
          other MCS servers. Here we'll focus on a the real-world case of
          the robotic IR-optical telescope REM (placed at La Silla,
          Chile) which performs real time images acquisition, processing
          and archiving by using some of the MCS capabilities.

          The Pulsar Virtual Observatory will provide a means for
          scientists in all fields to access and analyze the large data
          sets stored in pulsar surveys without specific knowledge about
          the data or the processing mechanisms. This is achieved by
          moving the data and processing tools to a grid resource where
          the details of the processing are seen by the users as abstract
          tasks. By developing intelligent scheduling middle-ware the
          issues of interconnecting tasks and allocating resources are
          removed from the user domain. This opens up large sets of radio
          time-series data to a wider audience, enabling greater cross
          field astronomy, in line with the virtual observatory concept.
          Implementation of the Pulsar Virtual Observatory is underway,
          utilising the UK National Grid Service as the principal grid
          resource.

          Today's astronomical projects need computational systems

          to effectively share data with other research Institutes and to
          easily implement information services to present data for
          different purposes (scientific, maintenance, outreach, etc.).
          Due to the wide scenario of astronomical projects there isn't
          yet a standardized approach to implement the software needed to
          support all the requirements of a project. The new approach we
          propose here is the use of a unified model where all data are
          stored into the same data base becoming available in different
          forms, to different users with different privileges.

          We report the results of simultaneous observations of the Vela
          pulsar in X-rays and radio from the RXTE satellite and the
          Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory in Tasmania. We sought
          correlations between the Vela's X-ray and radio flux densities
          and radio arrival times on a pulse by pulse basis. We found
          significantly higher flux density in Vela's main X-ray peak
          during radio pulses that arrived early. This excess flux shifts
          to the 'trough' following the 2nd X-ray peak during radio
          pulses that arrive later. We suggest that the mechanism
          producing the radio pulses is intimately connected to the
          mechanism producing X-rays. Current models using resonant
          absorption in the outer magnetosphere as a cause of the radio
          emission, and less directly of the X-ray emission, are explored
          as a possible explanation for the correlation.

          Pulse-to-pulse intensity variations are a common property of
          pulsar radio emission. For some of the objects single pulses
          are often 10-times stronger than their average pulse. The most
          dramatic events are so-called giant radio pulses (GRPs). They
          can be thousand times stronger than the regular single pulses
          from the pulsar. Giant pulses are a rare phenomenon, occurring
          in very few pulsars which split into two groups. The first
          group contains very young and energetic pulsars like the Crab
          pulsar, and its twin (PSR B0540-69) in the Large Magellanic
          Cloud (LMC), while the second group is represented by old,
          recycled millisecond pulsars like PSR B1937+21, PSR B1821-24,
          PSR B1957+20 and PSR J0218+4232 (the only millisecond pulsar
          detected in gamma-rays). We compare the characteristics of GRPs
          for these two pulsar groups. Moreover, our latest findings of
          new features in the Crab GRPs are presented. Analysis of our
          Effelsberg data at 8.35 GHz shows that GRPs do occur in all
          phases of its ordinary radio emission, including the phases of
          the two high frequency components (HFCs) visible only between 5
          and 9 GHz.

          The Parkes Multibeam Survey led to the identification of a
          number of long-period radio pulsars with magnetic field well
          above the 'quantum critical field' of ~ 4.4x10^13 G (HBRPs).
          The HBRPs have similar spin parameters to magnetars, but their
          emission properties are different, and contradict those
          theories that predict that radio emission should be suppressed
          above this critical field. Our observations support the
          suggestion that initial neutron star spin periods depend on
          their magnetic fields; in particular, there is a tendency for
          high-field systems to be born as slow rotators. The aim of this
          project is to understand the emission properties of HBRPs,
          using multiple radio frequencies and high time resolution data.
          One specific objective is to identify HBRPs radio emission
          characteristics that are different from those of normal
          pulsars.

          We perform a brief census of velocities of isolated versus
          binary millisecond pulsars. We find the velocities of the two
          populations are indistinguishable. However, the scale height of
          the binary population is twice that of the isolated population
          and the luminosity functions of the two populations are
          different. We suggest that the scale height difference may be
          an artifact of the luminosity difference. We examine the
          magnetic fields of the two populations as a possible source of
          the luminosity difference.

          Title: Comparisons of binary black hole merger waveforms
          Authors: John G. Baker, Manuela Campanelli, Frans Pretorius,
          Yosef Zlochower
          Comments: Revtex 4, 5 pages
          This a particularly exciting time for gravitational wave
          physics. Ground-based gravitational wave detectors are now
          operating at a sensitivity such that gravitational radiation
          may soon be directly detected, and recently several groups have
          independently made significant breakthroughs that have finally
          enabled numerical relativists to solve the Einstein field
          equations for coalescing black-hole binaries, a key source of
          gravitational radiation. The numerical relativity community is
          now in the position to begin providing simulated merger
          waveforms for use by the data analysis community, and it is
          therefore very important that we provide ways to validate the
          results produced by various numerical approaches. Here, we
          present a simple comparison of the waveforms produced by two
          very different, but equally successful approaches--the
          generalized harmonic gauge and the moving puncture methods. We
          compare waveforms of equal-mass black hole mergers with minimal
          or vanishing spins. The results show exceptional agreement for
          the final burst of radiation, with some differences
          attributable to small spins on the black holes in one case.

          ChJAA
          By analyzing the Chandra ACIS S3 data we studied the X-ray
          properties of the low-mass and high-mass X-ray binary
          populations in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 5055. A total of 43
          X-ray point sources were detected within the 2 effective radii,
          with 31 sources located on the disk and the rest 12 sources in
          the bulge. The resolved point sources dominate the total X-ray
          emission of the galaxy by accounting for about 80% of the total
          counts in 0.3--10 keV. By carrying out the spectral fittings we
          calculated the 0.3--10.0 keV luminosities of all the detected
          X-ray point sources and found that they span a wide range from
          a few 10^{37} erg s^{-1} to over 10^{39} erg s^{-1}. After
          compensating for the incompleteness at the low luminosity end,
          we find that the corrected XLF of the bulge population is well
          fitted with a broken power-law model with a break at
          1.57^{+0.21}_{-0.20}\times 10^{38} erg s^{-1}, while the
          profile of the disk population's XLF agrees with a single
          power-law distribution with a slope of 0.93^{+0.07}_{-0.06}.
          The disk population is significantly richer at
          {}^{>}_{\sim}2\times10^{38} erg s^{-1} than the bulge
          population, inferring that the disk may have undergone
          relatively recent, strong starbursts that significantly
          increased the HMXB population, although ongoing starbursts are
          also observed in the nuclear region. Similar XLF profiles of
          the bulge and disk populations were found in M81. However, in
          most other spiral galaxies different patterns of the spatial
          variation of the XLF profiles from the bulge to the disk have
          been observed, indicating that the star formation and evolution
          history may be more complex than we have expected.

          Title: A Particle Simulation for the Global Pulsar
          Magnetosphere: the Pulsar Wind linked to the Outer Gaps
          Authors: Tomohide Wada, Shinpei Shibata
          Soon after the discovery of radio pulsars in 1967, the pulsars
          are identified as strongly magnetic (typically $10^{12}$G)
          rapidly rotating ($\sim 10^{2}-0.1$ Hz) neutron stars. However,
          the mechanism of particle acceleration in the pulsar
          magnetosphere has been a longstanding problem. The central
          problem is why the rotation power manifests itself in both
          gamma-ray beams and a highly relativistic wind of
          electron-positron plasmas, which excites surrounding nebulae
          observed in X-ray. Here we show with a three dimensional
          particle simulation for the global axisymmetric magnetosphere
          that a steady outflow of electron-positron pairs is formed with
          associated pair sources, which are the gamma-ray emitting
          regions within the light cylinder. The magnetic field is
          assumed to be dipole, and to be consistent, pair creation rate
          is taken to be small, so that the model might be applicable to
          old pulsars such as Geminga. The pair sources are
          charge-deficient regions around the null surface, and we
          identify them as the outer gap. The wind mechanism is the
          electromagnetic induction which brings about fast azimuthal
          motion and eventually trans-field drift by radiation drag in
          close vicinity of the light cylinder and beyond. The wind
          causes loss of particles from the system. This maintains charge
          deficiency in the outer gap and pair creation. The model is
          thus in a steady state, balancing loss and supply of particles.
          Our simulation implies how the wind coexists with the gamma-ray
          emitting regions in the pulsar magnetosphere.

          binary LSI +61 303
          Authors: A.Neronov, M.Chernyakova
          Comments: submitted to MNRAS
          We show that radio-to-TeV properties of the binary system LSI
          +61 303 can be explained by interaction of the compact object
          (a young pulsar) with the inhomogeneities of the wind from
          companion Be star. We develop a model scenario of
          "compactified" pulsar wind nebula formed in result of such
          interaction. To test the model assumptions about geometry of
          the system we re-analyze the available X-ray observations to
          study in more details the variations of the hydrogen column
          density on long (orbital) and short (several kilosecond) time
          scales.

          Comments: submitted to the Astrophysical Journal
          We present X-ray observations of the as of yet unidentified
          very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray source HESSJ1640-465 with the
          aim of establishing a counterpart of this source in the keV
          energy range, and identifying the mechanism responsible for the
          VHE emission. The 21.8 ksec XMM-Newton observation of
          HESSJ1640-465 in September 2005 represents a significant
          improvement in sensitivity and angular resolution over previous
          ASCA studies in this region. These new data show a
          hard-spectrum X-ray emitting object at the centroid of the
          H.E.S.S. source, within the shell of the radio Supernova
          Remnant (SNR) G338.3-0.0. This object is consistent with the
          position and flux previously measured by both ASCA and
          Swift-XRT but is now shown to be significantly extended. We
          argue that this object is very likely the counterpart to
          HESSJ1640-465 and that both objects may represent the Pulsar
          Wind Nebula of an as of yet undiscovered pulsar associated with
          G338.3-0.0.

          The Arecibo Pulsar-ALFA (PALFA) survey of the Galactic plane
          began in 2004 when the new ALFA (Arecibo L-band Feed Array)
          receiver was commissioned. It is slated to continue for the
          next 3-5 years and is expected to discover hundreds of new
          pulsars. We present the goals, progress, and recent discoveries
          of the PALFA survey. So far preliminary data processing has
          found 24 new pulsars, one of which is a young 144ms pulsar in a
          highly relativistic binary with an orbital period of 3.98
          hours. Another object exhibits sporadic bursts characteristic
          of a newly defined class of radio-loud neutron stars: RRATs
          (Rotating RAdio Transients). The PALFA survey is going to
          accumulate a total of 1 Petabyte (PB) of raw data which will be
          made available to the community via a sophisticated tape
          archive and database hosted at the Cornell Theory Center
          supercomputing facility. Web tools and services are being
          developed which will allow users of the archive to perform data
          analysis remotely.
          We also discuss parameters, expected discoveries and the
          scientific impact of a projected pulsar survey with the Square
          Kilometer Array (SKA). The SKA is to become operational in 2014
          and will have the capability of detecting thousands of pulsars
          not detectable with current instruments, allowing us to perform
          a comprehensive census of the Galactic pulsar population.

          and the recently found Rotating RAdio Transcients (RRATs) in
          the Cygnus OB complex. The survey uses the Westerbrok Synthesis
          Radio Telescope (WSRT) in a unique way called the 8gr8 mode,
          which gives it the best efficiency of any low-frequency
          wide-area survey. So far we have found a few new pulsars and
          the routines for the detection of RRATs are already implemented
          in the standard reduction. We expect to find a few tens of new
          pulsars and a similar number of RRATs. This will help us to
          improve our knowledge about the population and properties of
          the latter poorly known objects as well as provide an improved
          knowledge of the number of young pulsars associated with the OB

          We investigate the X-ray and optical properties of a sample of
          X-ray bright sources from the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) Wing
          Survey. We have detected two new pulsars with pulse periods of
          65.8 s (CXOU J010712.6-723533) and 700 s (CXOU
          J010206.6-714115), and present observations of two previously
          known pulsars RX J0057.3-7325 (SXP101) and SAX J0103.2-7209
          (SXP348). Our analysis has led to three new optical
          identifications for the detected pulsars. We find long-term
          optical periods for two of the pulsars, CXOU J010206.6-714115
          and SXP101, of 267 and 21.9 d, respectively. Spectral analysis
          of a sub-set of the sample shows that the pulsars have harder
          spectra than the other sources detected. By employing a
          quantile-based colour-colour analysis we are able to separate
          the detected pulsars from the rest of the sample. Using
          archival catalogues we have been able to identify counterparts
          for the majority of the sources in our sample. Combining this
          with our results from the temporal analysis of the Chandra data
          and archival optical data, the X-ray spectral analysis, and by
          determining the X-ray to optical flux ratios we present
          preliminary classifications for the sources. In addition to the
          four detected pulsars, our sample includes two candidate
          foreground stars, 12 probable active galactic nuclei, and five
          unclassified sources.

          We present a detailed study of the single radio pulses of PSR
          B0656+14. The emission can be characterized by two separate
          populations of pulses: bright pulses have a narrow ``spiky''
          appearance in contrast to the underlying weaker broad pulses.
          The shape of the pulse profile requires an unusually long
          timescale to achieve stability (over 25,000 pulses at 327 MHz)
          caused by spiky emission. The extreme peak-fluxes of the
          brightest of these pulses indicates that PSR B0656+14, were it
          not so near, could only have been discovered as an RRAT source.
          The strongest bursts represent pulses from the bright end of an
          extended smooth pulse-energy distribution, which is unlike
          giant pulses, giant micropulses or the pulses of normal
          pulsars. Longer observations of the RRATs may reveal that they,
          like PSR B0656+14, emit weaker emission in addition to the
          bursts.

          bright, 10^5, 10^6 Jy and more, they have extra ordinal spectra
          and polarization. EM energy concentrated in such strong pulse
          is high enough to accelerate particles up to Lorenz factor

          Aims: Detect tertiary components of close binaries from
          spectroscopy and light curve modelling; investigate
          light-travel time effect and the possibility of magnetic
          activity cycles; measure mass-ratios for unstudied systems and
          derive absolute parameters. Methods: We carried out new
          photometric and spectroscopic observations of five bright
          (V<10.5 mag) close eclipsing binaries, predominantly in the
          southern skies. We obtained full Johnson BV light curves, which
          were modelled with the Wilson-Devinney code. Radial velocities
          were measured with the cross-correlation method using IAU
          radial velocity standards as spectral templates. Period changes
          were studied with the O-C method, utilising published epochs of
          minimum light (XY Leo) and ASAS photometry (VZ Lib). Results:
          For three objects (DX Tuc, QY Hya, V870 Ara), absolute
          parameters have been determined for the first time. We detect
          spectroscopically the tertiary components in XY Leo, VZ Lib and
          discover one in QY Hya. For XY Leo we update the light-time
          effect parameters and detect a secondary periodicity of about
          5100 d in the O$-$C diagram that may hint about the existence
          of short-period magnetic cycles. A combination of recent
          photometric data shows that the orbital period of the tertiary
          star in VZ Lib is likely to be over 1500 d. QY Hya is a
          semi-detached X-ray active binary in a triple system with K and
          M-type components, while V870 Ara is a contact binary with the
          third smallest spectroscopic mass-ratio for a W UMa star to
          date (q=0.082+/-0.030). This small mass-ratio, being close to
          the theoretical minimum for contact binaries, suggests that
          V870 Ara has the potential of constraining evolutionary
          scenarios of binary mergers. The inferred distances to these
          systems are compatible with the Hipparcos parallaxes.

          Title: Collapse and Fragmentation of Molecular Cloud Cores. IX.
          Magnetic Braking of Initially Filamentary Clouds

          issue
          The collapse and fragmentation of initially filamentary,
          magnetic molecular clouds is calculated in three dimensions
          with a gravitational, radiative hydrodynamics code. The code
          includes magnetic field effects in an approximate manner:
          magnetic pressure, tension, braking, and ambipolar diffusion
          are all modelled. Three types of outcomes are observed: direct
          collapse and fragmentation into a multiple protostar system,
          periodic contraction and expansion without collapse, or
          periodic contraction and expansion leading eventually to
          collapse. While the models begin their evolution at rest except
          for the assumed solid-body rotation, they develop weakly
          supersonic velocity fields as a result of the rebounding prior
          to collapse. The models show that magnetically-supported clouds
          subject to magnetic braking can undergo dynamic collapse
          leading to protostellar fragmentation on scales of 10 AU to 100
          AU, consistent with typical binary star separations.

          CU Virginis is one of the brightest radio emitting members of
          the magnetic chemically peculiar (MCP) stars and also one of
          the fastest rotating. We have now discovered that CU Vir is
          unique among stellar radio sources in generating a persistent,
          highly collimated, beam of coherent, 100% polarised, radiation
          from one of its magnetic poles that sweeps across the Earth
          every time the star rotates. This makes the star strikingly
          similar to a pulsar. This similarity is further strengthened by
          the observation that the rotating period of the star is
          lengthening at a phenomenal rate (significantly faster than any
          other astrophysical source - including pulsars) due to a
          braking mechanism related to its very strong magnetic field.

          We have analyzed 5.5 years of timing observations of 7
          ``slowly'' rotating radio pulsars, made with the Westerbork
          Synthesis Radio Telescope. We present improved timing solutions
          and 30, mostly small new glitches. The most interesting results
          are: 1) The detection of glitches one to two orders of
          magnitude smaller than ever seen before in slow radio pulsars.
          2) Resolving timing-noise looking structures in the residuals
          of PSR B1951+32 by using a set of small glitches. 3) The
          detections of three new glitches in PSR J1814-1744, a
          high-magnetic field pulsar. In these proceedings we present the
          most interesting results of our study. For a full coverage, we

          We present the first direct evidence for turn-over in pulsar
          radio spectra at high frequencies. Two pulsars are now shown to
          have a turn-over frequency > 1GHz. We also find some evidence
          that the peak frequency of turn-over in pulsar spectra appears
          to depend on dispersion measure and pulsar age.

          W.Becker, H.H.Huang, MPE Report 291, pp.92-95
          We present the statistical results of a systematic, unbiased
          search for subpulse modulation of 187 pulsars performed with
          the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) in the
          Netherlands at an observing wavelength of 21 cm (Weltevrede et
          al. 2006a). We have increased the list of pulsars that show the
          drifting subpulse phenomenon by 42, indicating that more than
          55% of the pulsars that show this phenomenon. The large number
          of new drifters we have found allows us, for the first time, to
          do meaningful statistics on the drifting phenomenon. We find
          that the drifting phenomenon is correlated with the pulsar age
          such that drifting is more likely to occur in older pulsars.
          Pulsars that drift more coherently seem to be older and have a
          lower modulation index. Contrary claims from older studies,
          both P_3 (the repetition period of the drifting subpulse
          pattern) and the drift direction are found to be uncorrelated
          with other pulsar parameters.

          The LOw Frequency ARray, LOFAR, will have the sensitivity,
          bandwidth, frequency range and processing power to
          revolutionise low-frequency pulsar studies. We present results
          of simulations that indicate that a LOFAR survey will find
          approximately 1500 new pulsars. These new pulsars will give us
          a much better understanding of the low end of the luminosity
          function and thus allow for a much more precise estimate of the
          true total local pulsar population. The survey will also be
          very sensitive to the ultra-steep spectrum pulsars, RRATs, and
          the pulsed radio emission from objects like Geminga and AXPs.
          We will also show that by enabling us to observe single pulses
          from hundreds of pulsars, including many millisecond pulsars,
          LOFAR opens up new possibilities for the study of emission
          physics.

          to Strange Stars
          Authors: A.G. Aksenov, M. Milgrom, V.V. Usov
          Comments: 3 pages, 2 figures, Invited talk at 11th Marcel
          Grossmann Meeting, Berlin, July 2006
          We present the results of numerical simulations of stationary,
          spherically outflowing, electron-positron pair winds, with
          total luminosities in the range 10^{34}--10^{42} ergs/s. In the
          concrete example described here, the wind injection source is a
          hot, bare, strange star, predicted to be a powerful source of
          pairs created by the Coulomb barrier at the quark surface. We
          find that photons dominate in the emerging emission, and the
          emerging photon spectrum is rather hard and differs
          substantially from the thermal spectrum expected from a neutron
          star with the same luminosity. This might help distinguish the
          putative bare strange stars from neutron stars.

          Title: Transition to Quark Matter and long Gamma Ray Bursts
          Authors: Alessandro Drago, Giuseppe Pagliara, Irene Parenti
          (Univ. Ferrara and INFN Sez. Ferrara, Italy)
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, Proceedings of "Swift and GRBs:
          Unveiling the Relativisitc Universe", Venice, 5-9 June 2006
          The energy released by the inner engine of GRBs can originate
          from structural readjustments inside a compact star. In
          particular, the formation of deconfined quark matter can
          liberate enough energy to power the burst. We show that the
          burning of a neutron star into a quark star likely proceeds as
          a deflagration and not as a detonation. In that way no strong
          baryon contamination is produced near the surface of the star.
          It is tempting to associate the temporal structures observed in
          the light curves with specific processes taking place inside
          the compact star. The so-called quiescent times, during which
          no signal is emitted in the highest energy band, correspond to
          pauses during the processes of readjustment. If the quark (or
          hybrid) star formed after these transformations is strongly
          magnetized and rotates rapidly, a prolonged gamma emission can
          be produced, as proposed by Usov years ago. This can explain
          the quasi-plateau observed by Swift in several GRBs.

          Comments: The Astrophysical Journal, in press
          We present an analysis of the mass and age of the young
          low-mass binary Oph 1622-2405. Using resolved optical
          spectroscopy of the binary, we measure spectral types of
          M7.25+/-0.25 and M8.75+/-0.25 for the A and B components,
          respectively. We show that our spectra are inconsistent with
          the spectral types of M9 and M9.5-L0 from Jayawardhana & Ivanov
          and M9+/-0.5 and M9.5+/-0.5 from Close and coworkers. Based on
          our spectral types and the theoretical evolutionary models of
          Chabrier and Baraffe, we estimate masses of 0.055 and 0.019
          Msun for Oph 1622-2405A and B, which are significantly higher
          than the values of 0.013 and 0.007 Msun derived by Jayawardhana
          & Ivanov and above the range of masses observed for extrasolar
          planets (M<=0.015 Msun). Planet-like mass estimates are further
          contradicted by our demonstration that Oph 1622-2405A is only
          slightly later (by 0.5 subclass) than the composite of the
          young eclipsing binary brown dwarf 2M 0535-0546, whose
          components have dynamical masses of 0.034 and 0.054 Msun. To
          constrain the age of Oph 1622-2405, we compare the strengths of
          gravity-sensitive absorption lines in optical and near-infrared
          spectra of the primary to lines in field dwarfs (>1 Gyr) and
          members of Taurus (~1 Myr) and Upper Scorpius (~5 Myr). The
          line strengths for Oph 1622-2405A are inconsistent with
          membership in Ophiuchus (<1 Myr) and instead indicate an age
          similar to that of Upper Sco, which is agreement with a similar
          analysis performed by Close and coworkers. We conclude that Oph
          1622-2405 is part of an older population in Sco-Cen, perhaps
          Upper Sco itself.

          A self-consistent electrodynamics of a particle accelerator in
          a rotating neutron-star magnetosphere is investigated on the
          two-dimensional poloidal plane. Solving the Poisson equation
          for the electrostatic potential together with the Boltzmann
          equations for electrons, positrons and gamma-rays, it is
          demonstrated that the created current density increases to be
          super-Goldreich-Julian if the trans-field thickness of the gap
          becomes thick enough. This new solution exists from the
          neutron-star surface to the outer magnetosphere with a
          small-amplitude positive acceleration field in the inner part,
          which works to extract ions from the stellar surface as a
          space-charge-limited flow. The acceleration field is highly
          unscreened in the outer magnetosphere, in the same manner as in
          traditional outer-gap models.

          The Galactic bulge region is a rich host of variable
          high-energy point sources. Since 2005, February 17 we are
          monitoring the source activity in this region about every three
          days with INTEGRAL. Thanks to the large field of view, the
          imaging capabilities and the sensitivity at hard X-rays, we are
          able to present for the first time a detailed homogeneous
          (hard) X-ray view of a sample of 76 sources in the Galactic
          bulge region. We describe the successful monitoring program and
          show the first results for a period of about one and a half
          year. We focus on the short (hour), medium (month) and
          long-term (year) variability in the 20-60 keV and 60-150 keV
          bands. When available, we discuss the simultaneous observations
          in the 3-10 keV and 10-25 keV bands. Per visibility season we
          detect 32/33 sources in the 20-60 keV band and 8/9 sources in
          the 60-150 keV band. On average, we find per visibility season
          one active bright (>~100 mCrab, 20-60 keV) black-hole candidate
          X-ray transient and three active weaker (<~25 mCrab, 20-60 keV)
          neutron star X-ray transients. Most of the time a clear
          anti-correlation can be seen between the soft and hard X-ray
          emission in some of the X-ray bursters. Hard X-ray flares or
          outbursts in X-ray bursters, which have a duration of the order
          of weeks, are accompanied by soft X-ray drops. On the other
          hand, hard X-ray drops can be accompanied by soft X-ray
          flares/outbursts. We found a number of new sources, IGR
          J17354-3255, IGR 17453-2853, IGR J17454-2703, IGR J17456-2901b,
          IGR J17536-2339, and IGR J17541-2252. We report here on some of
          the high-energy properties of these sources. The high-energy
          light curves of all the sources in the field of view, and the
          high-energy images of the region, are made available through

          In this work, we study the polarisation properties of the
          synchrotron emission emanating from the striped wind model. We
          use an explicit asymptotic solution for the large-scale field
          structure related to the oblique split monopole and valid for
          the case of an ultra-relativistic plasma. This is combined with
          a crude model for the emissivity of the striped wind and of the
          magnetic field within the dissipating stripes themselves. We
          calculate the polarisation properties of the high-energy pulsed
          emission and compare our results with optical observations of
          the Crab pulsar. The resulting radiation is linearly polarised.
          In the off-pulse region, the electric vector lies in the
          direction of the projection on the sky of the rotation axis of
          the pulsar, in good agreement with the data. Other properties
          such as a reduced degree of polarisation and a characteristic
          sweep of the polarisation angle within the pulses are also
          reproduced.

          Our high time resolution observations of individual giant
          pulses in the Crab pulsar show that both the time and frequency
          signatures of the interpulse are distinctly different from
          those of the main pulse. Giant main pulses can occasionally be
          resolved into short-lived, relatively narrow-band nanoshots. We
          believe these nanoshots are produced by soliton collapse in
          strong plasma turbulence. Giant interpulses are very different.
          Their dynamic spectrum contains narrow, microsecond-long
          emission bands. We have detected these proportionately spaced
          bands from 4.5 to 10.5 GHz. The bands cannot easily be
          explained by any current theory of pulsar radio emission; we
          speculate on possible new models.

          emission from the Crabpulsar

          We present a multicomponent model to explain the features of
          the pulsed emission and spectrum of the Crab Pulsar, on the
          basis of X and gamma-ray observations performed with BeppoSAX,
          INTEGRAL and CGRO. This model explains the evolution of the
          pulse shape and of the phase-resolved spectra, ranging from the
          optical/UV to the GeV energy band, on the assumption that the
          observed emission is due to several components. The first
          component, C_O, is assumed to have the pulsed double-peaked
          profile observed at the optical frequencies, while the second
          component, C_X, isdominant in the interpeak and second peak
          phase regions. The spectra of these components are modelled
          with log-parabolic laws. Moreover, to explain the properties of
          the pulsed emission in the MeV-GeV band, we introduce two more
          components, C_O_gamma and C_X_gamma, with phase distributions
          similar to those of C_O and C_X and log-parabolic spectra with
          the same curvature but different peak energies. This
          multicomponent model is able to reproduce both the broadband
          phase-resolved spectral behaviour and the changes of the pulse
          shape with energy. We also propose some possible physical
          interpretations in which C_O and C_X are emitted by secondary
          pairs via a synchrotron mechanism while C_O_gamma and C_X_gamma
          can originate either from Compton scattered or primary
          curvature photons.

          We investigate polarization of high-energy emissions from the
          Crab pulsar in the frame work of the outer gap accelerator. The
          recent version of the outer gap, which extends from inside the
          null charge surface to the light cylinder, is used for
          examining the light curve, the spectrum and the polarization
          characteristics, simultaneously. The polarization position
          angle curve and the polarization degree are calculated to
          compare with the Crab optical data. We show that the outer gap
          model explains the general features of the observed light
          curve, the spectrum and the polarization by taking into account
          the emissions from inside of the null charge surface and from
          tertiary pairs, which were produced by the high-energy photons
          from the secondary pairs. For the Crab pulsar, the polarization
          position angle curve indicates that the viewing angle of the
          observer measured from the rotational axis is greater than 90
          degrees.

          We evaluate the Lienard-Wiechert field of a rotating
          superluminal point source numerically and show that this
          radiation field has the following intrinsic characteristics.
          (i) It is sharply focused along a narrow, rigidly rotating
          spiral-shaped beam that embodies the cusp of the envelope of
          the emitted wave fronts. (ii) It consists of either one or
          three concurrent polarization modes (depending on the relative
          positions of the observer and the cusp) that constitute
          contributions to the field from differing retarded times. (iii)
          Two of the modes are comparable in strength at both edges of
          the signal and dominate over the third everywhere except in the
          middle of the pulse. (iv) The position angle of the total field
          swings across the beam by as much as 180$^\circ$. (v) The
          position angles of its two dominant modes remain approximately
          orthogonal throughout their excursion across the beam. Given
          the fundamental nature of the Lienard-Wiechert field, the
          coincidence of these characteristics with those of the radio
          emission that is received from pulsars is striking.

          June 5-9, 2006. To appear in "Il Nuovo Cimento"
          If strange quark matter (SQM) is the true ground state of
          hadronic matter, then conversion of neutron stars (NS) into
          quark stars (QS) could release some 10^{53} erg. We describe a
          scenario of burning of a NS into a hot, differentially rotating
          QS. Emission of released non-baryonic energy through the QS
          surface is discussed. The role of magnetobuoyancy of SQM is
          mentioned. The outflow of gamma e+ e- lasting for up to ~1000 s
          could be at the origin of long GRBs. Advantages of hot,
          differentially rotating QS as an inner engine of long GRBs are
          reviewed.

          Authors: V. S. Beskin, E. E. Nokhrina
          Comments: Proceedings of the 363. WE-Heraeus Seminar on:

          W.Becker, H.H.Huang, MPE Report 291, pp.128-131
          The aim of this article is to draw attention to the importance
          of the electric current loss in the energy output of radio
          pulsars. We remind that even the losses attributed to the
          magneto-dipole radiation of a pulsar in vacuum can be written
          as a result of Ampere force action of the electric currents
          flowing over the neutron star surface (Michel 1991, Beskin,
          Gurevich & Istomin 1993). It is this force that is responsible
          for the transfer of angular momentum of a neutron star to an
          outgoing magneto-dipole wave. If a pulsar is surrounded by
          plasma, and there is no longitudinal current in its
          magnetosphere, there is no energy loss (Beskin, Gurevich &
          Istomin 1993, Mestel, Panagi & Shibata 1999). It is the
          longitudinal current closing within the pulsar polar cap that
          exerts the retardation torque acting on the neutron star. This
          torque can be determined if the structure of longitudinal
          current is known. Here we remind of the solution by Beskin,
          Gurevich & Istomin (1993) and discuss the validity of such an
          assumption. Finally, it is shown that the behaviour of the
          recently observed "part-time job" pulsar B1931+24 can be
          naturally explained within the model of current loss while the
          magneto-dipole model faces difficulties.

          The main idea and procedure are presented for a new synthetical
          method on constraining 3-D structure of emission regions of
          pulsars. With this method the emission regions can be
          synthetically constrained by fitting multi-wavelength
          observations features, e.g. pulse widths, phase offsets between
          radio pulse profiles and high energy light curves, and radio
          polarization properties. The main technique is based on
          numerically calculating the emission directions along any open
          field line via including aberration and retardation effects
          under a certain magnetic field configuration, e.g. vacuum
          dipole field. It can be easily extended by involving some
          further effects or magnetic field line configuration. The role
          of observed linear polarization properties in the method is
          discussed. The future application to known X/gamma-ray and
          radio pulsars will be helpful to test and improve current
          theoretical models on pulsar emission.

          Whenever a large group of people are engaged in an activity,
          communities will form. The nature of these communities depends
          on the relationship considered. In the group of people who
          regularly use scholarly literature, a relationship like
          ``person i and person j have cited the same paper'' might
          reveal communities of people working in a particular field. On
          this poster, we will investigate the relationship ``person i
          and person j have read the same paper''. Using the data logs of
          the NASA/Smithsonian Astrophysics Data System (ADS), we first
          determine the population that will participate by requiring
          that a user queries the ADS at a certain rate. Next, we apply
          the relationship to this population. The result of this will be
          an abstract ``relationship space'', which we will describe in
          terms of various ``representations''. Examples of such
          ``representations'' are the projection of co-read vectors onto
          Principal Components and the spectral density of the co-read
          network. We will show that the co-read relationship results in
          structure, we will describe this structure and we will provide
          a first attempt in the classification of this structure in
          terms of astronomical communities.

          ApJ
          We calculate herein the late stages of terrestrial planet
          accumulation around a solar type star that has a binary
          companion with semimajor axis larger than the terrestrial
          planet region. We perform more than one hundred simulations to
          survey binary parameter space and to account for sensitive
          dependence on initial conditions in these dynamical systems. As
          expected, sufficiently wide binaries leave the planet formation
          process largely unaffected. As a rough approximation, binary
          stars with periastron $q_B > 10$ AU have minimal effect on
          terrestrial planet formation within $\sim 2$ AU of the primary,
          whereas binary stars with $q_B \la$ 5 AU restrict terrestrial
          planet formation to within $\sim$ 1 AU of the primary star.
          Given the observed distribution of binary orbital elements for
          solar type primaries, we estimate that about 40 -- 50 percent
          of the binary population is wide enough to allow terrestrial
          planet formation to take place unimpeded. The large number of
          simulations allows for us to determine the distribution of
          results -- the distribution of plausible terrestrial planet
          systems -- for effectively equivalent starting conditions. We
          present (rough) distributions for the number of planets, their
          masses, and their orbital elements.

          Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars
          Authors: Lynn D. Matthews, Mark J. Reid (Harvard-Smithsonian
          Center for Astrophysics)
          Comments: Accepted to AJ; version with full resolution figures
          available at this http URL
          (Abridged) We have used the VLA to search for neutral atomic
          hydrogen in the circumstellar envelopes of five AGB stars. We
          have detected HI 21-cm emission coincident in both position and
          velocity with the semi-regular variable RS Cnc. The emission
          comprises a compact, slightly elongated feature centered on the
          star with a mean diameter ~82'' (1.5e17 cm), plus an additional
          filament extending ~6' to the NW. This filament suggests that a
          portion of the mass loss is highly asymmetric. We estimate
          MHI=1.5e-3 Msun and M_dot~1.7e-7 Msun/yr. Toward R Cas, we
          detect weak emission that peaks at the stellar systemic
          velocity and overlaps with the location of its circumstellar
          dust shell and thus is probably related to the star. In the
          case of IRC+10216, we were unable to confirm the detection of
          HI in absorption against the cosmic background previously
          reported by Le Bertre & Gerard. However, we detect arcs of
          emission at projected distances of r~14'-18' (~2e18 cm) to the
          NW. A large separation of the emission from the star is
          plausible given its advanced evolutionary status, although it
          is unclear if the asymmetric distribution and complex velocity
          structure are consistent with a circumstellar origin. For EP
          Aqr, we detected HI emission comprising multiple clumps redward
          of the systemic velocity, but we are unable to determine
          unambiguously whether the emission arises from the
          circumstellar envelope or from interstellar clouds along the
          line-of-sight. Regardless of the adopted distance for the
          clumps, their inferred HI masses are at least an order of
          magnitude smaller than their individual binding masses. We
          detected our fifth target, R Aqr (a symbiotic binary), in the
          1.4 GHz continuum, but did not detect any HI emission from the
          system.

          Title: Cohesive property of magnetized neutron star surfaces:
          Computations and implications

          Scientific Assembly, Beijing, 16-23 July 2006
          The cohesive energy of condensed matter in strong magnetic
          fields is a fundamental quantity characterizing magnetized
          neutron star surfaces. The cohesive energy refers to the energy
          required to pull an atom out of the bulk condensed matter at
          zero pressure. Theoretical models of pulsar and magnetar
          magnetospheres depend on the cohesive properties of the surface
          matter in strong magnetic fields. For example, depending on the
          cohesive energy of the surface matter, an acceleration zone
          ("polar gap") above the polar cap of a pulsar may or may not
          form. Also, condensation of the neutron star surface, if it
          occurs, can significantly affect thermal emission from isolated
          neutron stars. We describe our calculations of the cohesive
          property of matter in strong magnetic fields, and discuss the
          implications of our results to the recent observations of
          neutron star surface emission as well as to the
          detection/non-detection of radio emission from magnetars.

          We posit that accreting compact objects, including stellar mass
          black holes and neutron stars as well as supermassive black
          holes, may undergo extended periods of accretion during which
          the angular momentum of the disk at large scales is misaligned
          with that of the compact object. In such a scenario,
          Lense-Thirring precession caused by the rotating compact object
          can dramatically affect the disk. In this presentation we
          describe results from a three-dimensional relativistic
          magnetohydrodynamic simulation of an MRI turbulent disk
          accreting onto a tilted rapidly rotating black hole. For this
          case, the disk does not achieve the commonly described
          Bardeen-Petterson configuration; rather, it remains nearly
          planar, undergoing a slow global precession. Accretion from the
          disk onto the hole occurs predominantly through two opposing
          plunging streams that start from high latitudes with respect to
          both the black-hole and disk midplanes. This is a consequence
          of the non-sphericity of the gravitational spacetime of the
          black hole.

          We calculate the transition rates between proton Landau levels
          due to non-radiative and radiative Coulomb collisions in an
          electron-proton plasma with strong magnetic field B. Both
          electron-proton collisions and proton-proton collisions are
          considered. The roles of the first-order cyclotron absorption
          and second-order free-free absorption and scattering in
          determining the line strength and shape as well as the
          continuum are analysed in detail. We solve the statistical
          balance equation for the populations of proton Landau levels.
          For temperatures \sim 10^6-10^7 K, the deviations of the proton
          populations from LTE are appreciable at density \rho < 0.1
          B_{14}^{3.5} g cm^{-3}, where B_{14}=B/(10^{14} G). We present
          general formulae for the plasma emissivity and absorption
          coefficents under a wide range of physical conditions. Our
          results are useful for studying the possibility and the
          conditions of proton/ion cyclotron line formation in the near
          vicinity of highly magnetized neutron stars.

          We evaluate the result of the recent pioneering numerical
          simulations in Spitkovsky~2006 on the spindown of an oblique
          relativistic magnetic dipole rotator. Our discussion is based
          on our experience from two idealized cases, that of an aligned
          dipole rotator, and that of an oblique split-monopole rotator.
          We conclude that the issue of electromagnetic pulsar spindown
          may not have been resolved yet.

          The second fastest millisecond pulsar, B1937+21, is one of
          several pulsars known to emit giant pulses (GPs). GPs are
          characterized by their huge energy, power-law cumulative energy
          distribution, and particular longitudes of occurrence. All
          these characteristics are different from those of regular
          pulses. Here, we present a study of GPs from our observations
          of the pulsar B1937+21 with the GBT at 2.1 GHz in both left and
          right circular polarization with a time resolution of 8 ns. The
          Mark5 data acquisition system was used for the first time in
          single-dish observations with the GBT. This allowed us to
          obtain continuous and uniform recording for 7.5 hours with a
          data rate of 512 Mbps. As a result, more than 6000 GPs were
          found above a detection threshold of 200 Jy. We report on
          instantaneous spectra of GPs, as well as on a comparison with
          scintillation spectra of regular emission, on the distribution
          of GP energies, and on polarization properties of GPs.

          PSR B0540-69 is often called an extragalactic 'twin' of the
          Crab pulsar in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The pulsar is
          embedded in a synchrotron nebula in the center of SNR
          0540-69.3. It was discovered with the Einstein satellite with
          P~50 ms, spin-down age of ~1500 years and a spin-down
          luminosity of ~10^38 erg/s. It has since been detected with all
          major X-ray telescopes. At X-ray energies up to ~40 keV the
          latest observations were reported from RXTE and from INTEGRAL
          (only spectrum) in the context of a survey of the LMC. Optical
          pulsed emission and faint radio emission have also been found
          from PSR B0540-69. The INTEGRAL analysis presented here is
          based on observations of the LMC obtained in Jan. 2003 and Jan.
          2004 with a total exposure of ~1.5 Ms. In the mosaic maps from
          the total exposure (JEM-X and IBIS/ISGRI) a source at the
          location of PSR B0540-69 is clearly visible up to energies of
          ~200 keV. After barycentric correction and determination of the
          pulsar phases, based on theephemeris available from
          contemporaneous RXTE data, the lightcurves show the
          characteristic shape of a broad pulse up into the 40-100 keV
          band. At higher energies no significant pulsation is
          detectable. We derive the spectrum of the total source from the
          ISGRI data. The photon spectrum can be fitted with a power law
          of index 2.22, which is compatible with the result found by
          Goetz et al., 2006.

          We present Spitzer Space Telescope photometry of six
          short-period polars, EF Eri, V347 Pav, VV Pup, V834 Cen, GG
          Leo, and MR Ser. We have combined the Spitzer Infrared Array
          Camera (3.6 -8.0 microns) data with the 2MASS J, H, K_s
          photometry to construct the spectral energy distributions of
          these systems from the near- to mid-IR (1.235 - 8 microns). We
          find that five out of the six polars have flux densities in the
          mid-IR that are substantially in excess of the values expected
          from the stellar components alone. We have modeled the observed
          SEDs with a combination of contributions from the white dwarf,
          secondary star, and either cyclotron emission or a cool,
          circumbinary dust disk to fill in the long-wavelength excess.
          We find that a circumbinary dust disk is the most likely cause
          of the 8 micron excess in all cases, but we have been unable to
          rule out the specific (but unlikely) case of completely
          optically thin cyclotron emission as the source of the observed
          8 micron flux density. While both model components can generate
          enough flux at 8 microns, neither dust nor cyclotron emission
          alone can match the excess above the stellar components at all
          wavelengths. A model combining both cyclotron and dust
          contributions, possibly with some accretion-generated flux in
          the near-IR, is probably required, but our observed SEDs are
          not sufficiently well-sampled to constrain such a complicated
          model. If the 8 micron flux density is caused by the presence
          of a circumbinary dust disk, then our estimates of the masses
          of these disks are many orders of magnitude below the mass
          required to affect CV evolution.

          Title: A Novel Mechanism for Type-I Superconductivity in
          Neutron Stars
          Authors: James Charbonneau, Ariel Zhitnitsky
          Comments: 9 pages
          We suggest a mechanism that may resolve a conflict raised by
          Link between neutron star precession and the standard picture
          of the neutron star in which the core is composed of a mixture
          of a neutron superfluid and a proton type-II superconductor. We
          will show that if there is a persistent, non-dissipating
          current running along the magnetic flux tubes, the force
          between magnetic flux tubes may be attractive, resulting in a
          type-I, rather than a type-II, superconductor. If this is the
          case, the conflict between the observed precession and the
          canonical estimation of the Landau-Ginzburg parameter $\kappa >
          1/\sqrt{2}$ (which suggests type II behaviour) will be
          automatically resolved. Such a current arises in some condensed
          matter systems and may also appear in QCD dense matter as a
          consequence of quantum anomalies. We calculate the interaction
          between two vortices carrying a current $j$ and demonstrate
          that when $j > {\hbar c\over 2 q \lambda}$, where $q$ is the
          charge of the Cooper pair and $\lambda$ is the Meissner
          penetration depth, a superconductor is always type-I, even when
          the cannonical Landau-Ginzburg parameter $\kappa$ indicates
          type-II behaviour. If this condition is met, the magnetic field
          is expelled from the superconducting regions of the neutron
          star leading to the formation of the intermediate state where
          alternating domains of superconducting matter and normal matter
          coexist. We also discuss some instances where anomalous induced
          current may play a crucial role, such as the neutron star
          kicks, pulsar glitches and the toroidal magnetic field.

          Globular star clusters contain thousands to millions of old
          stars packed within a region only tens of light years across.
          Their high stellar densities make it very probable that their
          member stars will interact or collide. There has been
          considerable debate about whether black holes should exist in
          these star clusters. Some theoretical work suggests that
          dynamical processes in the densest inner regions of globular
          clusters may lead to the formation of black holes of ~1,000
          solar masses. Other numerical simulations instead predict that
          stellar interactions will eject most or all black holes that
          form in globular clusters. Here we report the X-ray signature
          of an accreting black hole in a spectroscopically-confirmed
          globular cluster in the Virgo Cluster giant elliptical galaxy
          NGC 4472. This object has an X-ray luminosity of about 4*10^39
          ergs/sec, making it brighter than any non-black hole object can
          be in an old stellar population. The X-ray luminosity varies by
          a factor of 7 in a few hours, ruling out the possibility that
          the object is several neutron stars superposed.

          figures, figure 3 in color
          Analysis of archival RXTE data on neutron stars binaries has
          shown that for several sources the quality factor (Q) of the
          lower kilohertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPO) drops sharply
          beyond a certain frequency. This is one possible signature of
          the approach to the general relativistic innermost stable
          circular orbit (ISCO), but the implications of such an
          interpretation for strong gravity and dense matter are
          important enough that it is essential to explore alternate
          explanations. In this spirit, Mendez has recently proposed that
          Q depends fundamentally on mass accretion rate (as measured by
          spectral hardness) rather than the frequency of the QPO. We
          test this hypothesis for 4U1636-536 by measuring precisely
          spectral colors simultaneously with the lower QPO frequency and
          Q after correction for the frequency drift, over a data set
          spanning eight years of RXTE observations. We find that in this
          source there is no correlation between Q and spectral hardness.
          In particular, no apparent changes in hardness are observed
          when Q reaches its maximum before dropping off. We perform a
          similar analysis on 4U1608-522; another source showing a sharp
          drop in the quality factor of its lower kHz QPO. We find that
          for this source, positive and negative correlations are
          observed between spectral hardness, frequency and Q.
          Consequently, if we are to search for a common explanation for
          the sharp drop in the quality factor seen in both sources, the
          spectral hardness is not a good candidate for the independent
          variable whereas the frequency remains. Therefore, we conclude
          that the ISCO explanation is viable for 4U1636-536, and thus
          possibly for others.

          The Equation of States (EoS) plays the crucial role in all
          studies of neutron star properties. Still, a microscopical
          understanding of EoS remains largely an unresolved problem. We
          use 2-color QCD as a model to study the dependence of vacuum
          energy (gluon condensate in QCD) as function of chemical
          potential \mu\ll \Lambda_{QCD} where we find very strong and
          unexpected dependence on $\mu$. We present the arguments
          suggesting that similar behavior may occur in 3-color QCD in
          the color superconducting phases. Such a study may be of
          importance for analysis of EoS when phenomenologically relevant
          parameters (within such models as MIT Bag model or NJL model)
          are fixed at zero density while the region of study lies at
          much higher densities not available for terrestrial tests.

          Authors: M. Reyniers, H. Van Winckel (K.U.Leuven, Belgium)
          Comments: 4 pages, 5 figures, accepted by A&A Letters
          Recent photospheric abundance studies of galactic field RV
          Tauri stars show that depletion of refractory elements is
          rather common in these evolved objects. The process that
          creates this chemical anomaly is not understood well, but it
          probably requires the presence of gravitationally bound dust in
          a binary system. We test for the presence of depletion in
          extra-galactic objects. A detailed photospheric abundance study
          on the basis of high-quality UVES spectra was performed on the
          RV Tauri star in the LMC: MACHO82.8405.15. Abundances were
          derived using a critically compiled line list with accurate
          log(gf) values and the latest Kurucz model atmospheres. With
          [Fe/H]=-2.6 in combination with [Zn/Fe]=+2.3 and [S/Ti]=+2.5,
          MACHO82.8405.15 displays a strong depletion abundance pattern.
          The effect of the depletion is comparable to the strongest
          depletions seen in field Galactic RV Tauri stars. The chemical
          analysis of MACHO82.8405.15 proves that the depletion process
          also occurs in the extragalactic members of the RV Tauri
          pulsation class. Our program star is a member of a larger
          sample of LMC RV Tauri objects. This sample is unique, since
          the distances of the members are well-constrained. Further
          studies of this sample are therefore expected to gain deeper
          insight into the poorly understood depletion phenomenon and of
          the evolutionary status of RV Tauri stars in general.

          Two Chandra observations of the R Aqr symbiotic binary system
          taken 3.3 years apart show dramatic changes in the X-ray
          morphology and spectral characteristics in the inner 500 AU of
          this system. The morphology of the soft X-ray emission has
          evolved from a nearly circular region centered on the binary
          system to an hourglass shape that indicates the formation of a
          new southwest jet. Synchrotron radiation from the new jet in
          contemporaneous VLA radio spectra implies the physical
          conditions in the early stages of jet development are different
          from those in the more extended outer thermal jets known to
          exist for decades in this system. The central binary source has
          two X-ray spectral components in each of the two epochs, a soft
          component and a highly absorbed hard component characterized by
          T ~ 10^8 K if fit with a thermal plasma model. The spectrum
          hardened considerably between 2000.7 and 2004.0, primarily due
          to increased flux above 5 keV, suggesting a change in the
          accretion activity of the white dwarf on a timescale of a few
          years or less. Point-source Fe K emission is detected at the
          position of the central binary system in both observations.
          While the earlier observation shows evidence of only a single
          emission peak near Fe K alpha at 6.4 keV, the later observation
          shows a more complex emission structure between 6 and 7 keV.
          Finally, we have discovered a modulation in the hard X-ray flux
          with a period of 1734 s at a 95% confidence level in the 2004
          observation only. The modulation potentially arises from
          standing shocks in an accretion column and we have explored the
          possibility that the white dwarf in R Aqr is analogous to the
          magnetic white dwarfs in Intermediate Polar.

          Title: Protoplanet Magnetosphere Interactions
          Authors: John C.B. Papaloizou
          Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A
          In this paper, we study a simple model of an orbiting
          protoplanet in a central magnetospheric cavity, the entry into
          such a cavity having been proposed as a mechanism for halting
          inward orbital migration. We have calculated the gravitational
          interaction of the protoplanet with the magnetosphere using a
          local model and determined the rate of evolution of the orbit.
          The interaction is found to be determined by the outward flux
          of MHD waves and thus the possibility of the existence of such

          of the merger of a neutron star with another compact object may
          be to yield a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB). Emphasis is made on
          some robust results that general relativistic
          (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations have established regarding
          the aforementioned subject.

          mechanism

          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Aims. We derive simple estimates of the maximum efficiency with
          which matter can be ejected by the propeller mechanism in
          disk-fed, rotating magnetic neutron stars. Some binary
          evolution scenarios envisage that this mechanism is responsible
          for expelling to infinity the mass inflowing at a low rate from
          the companion star, therefore limiting the total amount of mass
          that can be accreted by the neutron star. Methods. We
          demonstrate that, for typical neutron star parameters, a
          maximum of \eta_{pro} < 5.7 (P_{-3})^{1/3} times more matter
          than accreted can be expelled through the propeller mechanism
          at the expenses of the neutron star rotational energy (P_{-3}
          is the NS spin period in unit of 10E-3 s). Approaching this
          value, however, would require a great deal of fine tuning in
          the system parameters and the properties of the interaction of
          matter and magnetic field at the magnetospheric boundary.
          Results. We conclude that some other mechanism must be invoked
          in order to prevent that too much mass accretes onto the
          neutron stars of some low mass X-ray binaries.

          Authors: Xi-Wei Liu, Xiang-Dong Li (NJU)
          Comments: 17 pages, 5 figures and 1 table. Submitted to Chinese
          Journal of Astronomy and Astrophysics. This is ONLY a first
          draft of the paper and some issues needs to be addressed
          according to the referee's report in a forthcoming revision
          Assuming a naive star formation history, we construct the
          synthetic X-ray source populations for comparison with the
          X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of the interacting galaxies NGC
          4038/4039 using a population synthesis code. We have considered
          high- and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries, young
          rotation-powered pulsars and fallback disc-fed black holes in
          modelling the bright X-ray sources detected. To examine the
          effects of the input parameters on the calculated results we
          produce a series of hybrid models. We find that for typical
          binary evolution parameters, it is difficult to match the
          observed XLF shape, and the predicted XLFs seem to be steeper
          than those of starburst and late type spiral galaxies. We note
          that the shape of the XLFs depends critically on the existence
          of XLF break for young populations, which seems to be a popular
          feature in theoretical population synthesis works. We discuss
          possible reasons and implications on the discrepancy of the
          calculated and observational XLFs.

          Gauge effects on the fluctuation properties of the
          normal-to-superconducting phase transition in bulk and thin
          film superconductors are reviewed. Similar problems in the
          description of other natural systems (liquid crystals, quantum
          field theory, early universe) are also discussed. The
          relatively strong gauge effects on the fluctuations of the
          ordering field at low spatial dimensionality $D$ and, in
          particular, in thin (quasi-2D) films are considered in details.
          A special attention is paid to the fluctuations of the gauge
          field. It is shown that the mechanism, in which these gauge
          fluctuations affect the phase transition order and other phase
          transition properties varies with the variation of spatial
          dimensionality $D$. The problem for the experimental
          confirmation of theoretical predictions about the order of
          phase transitions in gauge systems is discussed. Related
          topics: gauge effects on the critical behavior of
          unconventional superconductors, disorder, quantum fluctuations
          in a close vicinity of ultra-low phase transition temperatures,
          are also briefly discussed.

          We present models of temperature distribution in the crust of a
          neutron star in the presence of a strong toroidal component
          superposed to the poloidal component of the magnetic field. The
          presence of such a toroidal field hinders heat flow toward the
          surface in a large part of the crust. As a result, the neutron
          star surface presents two warm regions surrounded by extended
          cold regions and has a thermal luminosity much lower than in
          the case the magnetic field is purely poloidal. We apply these
          models to calculate the thermal evolution of such neutron stars
          and show that the lowered photon luminosity naturally extends
          their life-time as detectable thermal X-ray sources.

          Title: The birth properties of Galactic millisecond radio
          pulsars
          Authors: Lilia Ferrario, Dayal Wickramasinghe
          Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in the
          MNRAS
          We model the population characteristics of the sample of
          millisecond pulsars within a distance of 1.5kpc.We find that
          for a braking index n=3, the birth magnetic field distribution
          of the neutron stars as they switch on as radio MSPs can be
          represented by a Gaussian with mean $\log B(G)= 8.1$ and
          $\sigma_{\log B}=0.4$ and their birth spin period by a Gaussian
          with mean $P_0=4$ ms and $\sigma_{P_0}=1.3$ ms. Our study,
          which takes into consideration acceleration effects on the
          observed spin-down rate, shows that most MSPs are born with
          periods that are close to the currently observed values and
          with average characteristic ages typically larger by a factor
          1.5 compared to the true age. The Galactic birth rate of the
          MSPs is deduced to be $\gsimeq 3.2 \times 10^{-6}$ yr$^{-1}$
          near the upper end of previous estimates and larger than the
          semi-empirical birth rate $\sim 10^{-7}$ yr$^{-1}$ of the
          LMXBs. The mean birth spin period deduced by us for the radio
          MSPs is a factor 2 higher than the mean spin period observed
          for the accretion and nuclear powered X-ray pulsars, although
          this discrepancy can be resolved if we use a braking index
          $n=5$, the value appropriate to spin down caused by angular
          momentum losses by gravitational radiation or magnetic
          multipolar radiation. We discuss the arguments for and against
          the hypothesis that accretion induced collapse may constitute
          the main route to the formation of the MSPs, pointing out that
          on the AIC scenario the low magnetic fields of the MSPs may
          simply reflect the field distribution in isolated magnetic
          white dwarfs which has recently been shown to be bi-modal with
          a dominant component that is likely to peak at fields below
          $10^3$ G which would scale to neutron star fields below $10^9$
          G.

          pages, 4 figures
          In this review paper, we summarise the goals of asteroseismic
          studies of close binary stars. We first briefly recall the
          basic principles of asteroseismology, and highlight how the
          binarity of a star can be an asset, but also a complication,
          for the interpretation of the stellar oscillations. We discuss
          a few sample studies of pulsations in close binaries and
          summarise some case studies. This leads us to conclude that
          asteroseismology of close binaries is a challenging field of
          research, but with large potential for the improvement of
          current stellar structure theory. Finally, we highlight the
          best observing strategy to make efficient progress in the near
          future.

          Title: Long Secondary Periods and Binarity in Red Giant Stars
          Authors: I. Soszynski
          Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ
          Observational arguments supporting the binary explanation of
          the long secondary periods (LSP) phenomenon in red giants are
          presented. Photometry of about 1200 semiregular variables with
          the LSP in the Large Magellanic Cloud are analyzed using the
          MACHO and OGLE photometry. For about 5% of these objects
          additional ellipsoidal-like or eclipsing-like modulation with
          the same periods as the LSP is detectable. These double-humped
          variations are usually shifted in phase comparing to the LSP
          light curves. I discuss the model of binary system with a red
          giant as the primary component and a low-mass object as the
          secondary one. The mass lost by the red giant through the wind
          follows the spiral pattern in the orbit around the primary star
          and obscures it causing the LSP variations.

          Title: Accretion onto the Companion of Eta Carinae During the
          Spectroscopic Event. IV. the Disappearance of Highly Ionized
          Lines
          Authors: Noam Soker (Technion, Israel)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          We show that the rapid and large decrease in the intensity of
          high-ionization emission lines from the Eta Carinae massive
          binary system can be explained by the accretion model. These
          emission lines are emitted by material in the nebula around the
          binary system that is being ionized by radiation from the hot
          secondary star. The emission lines suffer three months long
          deep fading every 5.54 year, assumed to be the orbital period
          of the binary system. In the accretion model, for ~70 day the
          less massive secondary star is accreting mass from the primary
          wind instead of blowing its fast wind. The accretion event has
          two effects that substantially reduce the high-energy ionizing
          radiation flux from the secondary star. (1) The accreted mass
          absorbs a larger fraction of the ionizing flux. (2) The
          accreted mass forms a temporarily blanked around the secondary
          star that increases its effective radius, hence lowering its
          effective temperature and the flux of high energy photons. This
          explanation is compatible with the fading of the emission lines
          at the same time the X-ray is declining to its minimum, and
          with the fading being less pronounced in the polar directions.

          Title: The superorbital variability and triple nature of the
          X-ray source 4U 1820-303
          Authors: A. A. Zdziarski, L. Wen, M. Gierlinski
          Comments: submitted to MNRAS
          We perform a comprehensive analysis of the superorbital
          modulation in the ultracompact X-ray source 4U 1820-303,
          consisting of a white dwarf accreting onto a neutron star.
          Based on XTE data, we measure the fractional amplitude of the
          source superorbital variability (with a 70-d quasi-period) in
          the folded and averaged light curves, and find it to be by a
          factor of 2. As proposed before, the superorbital variability
          can be explained by oscillations of the binary eccentricity. We
          now present detailed calculations of the eccentricity-dependent
          flow through the inner Lagrangian point, and find a maximum of
          the eccentricity of 0.004 is sufficient to explain the observed
          fractional amplitude. We then study hierarchical triple models
          yielding the required quasi-periodic eccentricity oscillations
          through the Kozai process. We find the resulting theoretical
          light curves to match well the observed ones. We constrain the
          ratio of the semimajor axes of the outer and inner systems, the
          component masses, and the inclination angle between the inner
          and outer orbits. Last but not least, we discover a remarkable
          and puzzling synchronization between the observed period of the
          superorbital variability (equal to the period of the
          eccentricity oscillations in our model) and the period of the
          general-relativistic periastron precession of the binary.

          Title: Dependence of the orbital modulation of X-rays from 4U
          1820-303 on the accretion rate
          Authors: A. A. Zdziarski, M. Gierlinski, L. Wen
          Comments: submitted to MNRAS
          We report the discovery, using XTE data, of a dependence of the
          X-ray orbital modulation depth on the X-ray spectral state in
          the ultracompact atoll binary 4U 1820-303. This state (measured
          by us by the position on the X-ray colour-colour diagram) is
          tightly coupled to the accretion rate, which, in turn, is
          coupled to the phase of the 170-d superorbital cycle of this
          source. The modulation depth is much stronger in the
          high-luminosity, so-called banana, state than in the
          low-luminosity, island, state. We find the X-ray modulation is
          independent of energy, which rules out bound-free X-ray
          absorption in an optically thin medium as the cause of the
          modulation. We also find a significant dependence of the offset
          phase of the orbital modulation on the spectral state, which
          favours the model in which the modulation is caused by
          scattering in hot gas around a bulge at the disc edge, which
          both size and the position vary with the accretion rate.
          Estimates of the source inclination appear to rule out a model
          in which the bulge itself occults a part of the accretion disc
          corona. We calculate the average flux of this source over the
          course of its superorbital variability (which has the period of
          170 d), and find it to be fully compatible with the model of
          accretion as due to the angular momentum loss via emission of
          gravitational radiation. Also, we compare the dates of all
          X-ray bursts observed from this source by BeppoSAX and XTE with
          the XTE light curve, and find all of them to coincide with deep
          minima of the flux, confirming previous results based on
          smaller samples.

          Title: Interpretation of the Helix Planetary Nebula using
          Hydro-Gravitational-Dynamics: Planets and Dark Energy
          Authors: Carl H. Gibson (UCSD), Rudolph E. Schild (Harvard)
          Comments: 44 pages 10 figures, see this http URL for further
          information and higher resolution figures
          Hubble Space Telescope (HST/ACS) images of the Helix Planetary
          Nebula (NGC 7293) are interpreted using the
          hydro-gravitational-dynamics theory (HGD) of Gibson 1996-2006.
          HGD predicts that baryonic-dark-matter (BDM) dominates the mass
          of galaxies (Schild 1996) as Jovian (promordial-fog-particle,
          PFP) Planets (JPPs) in proto-globular-star-cluster (PGC) clumps
          within galaxy halo diameters surrounding its stars. From HGD,
          supernova Ia (SNe Ia) events normally occur in planetary
          nebulae (PNe) within PGCs where binary clustering cascades of
          merging planets produce central binary star systems. As central
          stars of PNe, binaries exchange mass and accrete JPPs to grow
          white-dwarfs to $1.44 M_{\sun}$ instability within ionized
          (Oort cloud) cavities bounded by evaporating JPPs. SNe Ia
          events are thus intermittently obscured by radiation-inflated
          JPP atmospheres producing systematic SNe Ia distance errors, so
          the otherwise mysterious ``dark energy'' concept is
          unnecessary. HST/ACS and WFPC2 Helix images show $>7000$
          cometary globules, here interpreted as gas-dust cocoons of JPPs
          evaporated by beamed radiation from its white-dwarf plus
          companion central binary star system. Mass for growing the
          stars, the PNe, and possibly a SNe Ia event, is accreted
          gravitationally from ambient BDM JPPs. Measured JPP masses
          $\approx 3 \times 10^{25}$ kg with spacing $\approx 10^{14}$ m

          Medium" conference, eds. M. Haverkorn and W.M. Goss
          Observations of Halpha emission measures and pulsar dispersion
          measures at high Galactic latitude (|b| > 10 deg) provide
          information about the density and distribution of the diffuse
          warm ionized medium (WIM). The diffuse WIM has a lognormal
          distribution of EM sin |b|, which is consistent with a density
          structure established by isothermal turbulence. The H+
          responsible for most of the emission along high-EM sin |b|
          sightlines is clumped in high density (> 0.1 cm^{-3}) regions
          that occupy only a few parsecs along the line of sight, while
          the H+ along low-EM sightlines occupies hundreds of parsecs
          with considerably lower densities.

          Title: High Energy Gamma-rays from Globular Clusters
          Authors: W. Bednarek, J. Sitarek
          Comments: 12 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          It is expected that specific globular clusters can contain up
          to a hundred of millisecond pulsars. These pulsars can
          accelerate leptons at the shock waves originated in collisions
          of the pulsar winds and/or inside the pulsar magnetospheres.
          Energetic leptons diffuse gradually through the globular
          cluster comptonizing stellar and microwave background
          radiation. We calculate the GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray spectra for
          different models of injection of leptons and parameters of the
          globular clusters assuming reasonable, of the order of 1%,
          efficiency of energy conversion from the pulsar winds into the
          relativistic leptons. It is concluded that leptons accelerated
          in the globular cluster cores should produce well localized
          $\gamma$-ray sources which are concentric with these globular
          clusters. The results are shown for four specific globular
          clusters (47 Tuc, Ter 5, M13, and M15), in which significant
          population of millisecond pulsars have been already discovered.
          We argue that the best candidates, which might be potentially
          detected by the present Cherenkov telescopes and the planned
          satellite telescopes (AGILE, GLAST), are 47 Tuc on the southern
          hemisphere, and M13 on the northern hemisphere. We conclude
          that detection (or non-detection) of GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray
          emission from GCs by these instruments put important
          constraints on the models of acceleration of leptons by
          millisecond pulsars.

          Title: Numerical solution of the linear dispersion relation in
          a relativistic pair plasma
          Authors: J Petri, J G Kirk
          Comments: Accepted by Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion
          We describe an algorithm that computes the linear dispersion
          relation of waves and instabilities in relativistic plasmas
          within a Vlasov-Maxwell description. The method used is fully
          relativistic and involves explicit integration of particle
          orbits along the unperturbed equilibrium trajectories. We check
          the algorithm against the dispersion curves for a single
          component magnetised plasma and for an unmagnetised plasma with
          counter-streaming components in the non-relativistic case. New
          results on the growth rate of the Weibel or two-stream
          instability in a hot unmagnetised pair plasma consisting of two
          counter-streaming relativistic Maxwellians are presented. These
          are relevant to the physics of the relativistic plasmas found
          in gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jets and pulsar winds.

          Title: The Low-Mass Limit for Total Mass of W UMa-type Binaries
          Authors: K. Stepien
          Comments: 18 pages, 3 figures
          Journal-ref: Acta Astron., 56, 347, 2006
          The observations of W UMa type stars show a well-defined
          short-period limit of 0.22 d, which is equivalent to a lower
          mass limit of approximately 1 solar mass for the total binary
          mass. It is currently believed that cool contact binaries are
          formed from detached binaries losing angular momentum (AM) via
          a magnetized wind. Orbital evolution of detached binaries with
          various component masses was followed until the primary
          component reached the critical Roche surface and the Roche lobe
          overflow (RLOF) began. It was assumed that the minimum initial,
          i.e. ZAMS, orbital period of such binaries is equal to 2 d and
          that the components lose AM just as single stars. According to
          the mass-dependent formula for AM loss rate of single stars,
          derived in this paper, the AM loss time scale increases
          substantially with decreasing stellar mass. The formula was
          applied to binaries with the initial primary component masses
          between 1.0 and 0.6 solar mass and two values of mass ratio q=1
          and 0.5.
          Detailed calculations show that the time needed to reach RLOF
          by a 1 solar mass primary is of the order of 7.5 Gyr, but it
          increases to more than 13 Gyr for a binary with an initial
          primary mass of 0.7 solar mass. Binaries with less massive
          primaries have not yet had time to reach RLOF even within the
          age of the Universe. This sets a lower mass limit for the
          presently existing contact binaries

          Title: Les Houches Lectures on Effective Field Theories and

          Comments: Proceedings of Les Houches 2006. LaTeX, 44 pages, 10
          figures
          These lectures give an overview of the uses of effective field
          theories in describing gravitational radiation sources for LIGO
          or LISA. The first lecture reviews some of the standard ideas
          of effective field theory (decoupling, matching, power
          counting) mostly in the context of a simple toy model. The
          second lecture sets up the problem of calculating gravitational
          wave emission from non-relativistic binary stars by
          constructing a tower of effective theories that separately
          describe each scale in the problem: the internal size of each
          binary constituent, the orbital separation, and the wavelength
          of radiated gravitons.

          Comments: 6 pages (emulateapj style), 4 figures. Accepted for
          publication in AJ
          We present the results of a five year monitoring campaign of
          the close binary TWA 5Aab in the TW Hydrae association, using
          speckle and adaptive optics on the W.M. Keck 10 m telescopes.
          These measurements were taken as part of our ongoing monitoring
          of pre-main sequence (PMS) binaries in an effort to increase
          the number of dynamically determined PMS masses and thereby
          calibrate the theoretical PMS evolutionary tracks. Our
          observations have allowed us to obtain the first determination
          of this system's astrometric orbit. We find an orbital period
          of 5.94 +- 0.09 years and a semi-major axis of 0.066" +-
          0.005". Combining these results with a kinematic distance, we
          calculate a total mass of 0.71 +- 0.14 M_sun (D/44 pc)^3. for
          this system. This mass measurement, as well as the estimated
          age of this system, are consistent to within 2$\sigma$ of all
          theoretical models considered. In this analysis, we properly
          account for correlated uncertainties, and show that while these
          correlations are generally ignored, they increase the formal
          uncertainties by up to a factor of five and therefore are
          important to incorporate. With only a few more years of
          observation, this type of measurement will allow the
          theoretical models to be distinguished.

          Comments: 13 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          The hot Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) in clusters of galaxies is a
          very large repository of metals produced by supernovae. We aim
          to accurately measure the abundances in the ICM of many
          clusters and compare these data with metal yields produced by
          supernovae. Using the data archive of the XMM-Newton X-ray
          observatory, we compile a sample of 22 clusters. We fit spectra
          extracted from the core regions and determine the abundances of
          silicon, sulfur, argon, alcium, iron, and nickel. The
          abundances from the spectral fits are subsequently fitted to
          supernova yields determined from several supernova type Ia and
          core-collapse supernova models. We find that the argon and
          calcium abundances cannot be fitted with currently favoured
          supernova type Ia models. We obtain a major improvement of the
          fit, when we use an empirically modified delayed-detonation
          model that is calibrated on the Tycho supernova remnant. The
          two modified parameters are the density where the sound wave in
          the supernova turns into a shock and the ratio of the specific
          internal energies of ions and electrons at the shock. Our fits
          also suggest that the core-collapse supernovae that contributed
          to the enrichment of the ICM had progenitors which were already
          enriched. The Ar/Ca ratio in clusters is a good touchstone for
          determining the quality of type Ia models. The core-collapse
          contribution, which is about 50% and not strongly dependent on
          the IMF or progenitor metallicity, does not have a significant
          impact on the Ar/Ca ratio. The number ratio between supernova
          type Ia and core-collapse supernovae suggests that binary
          systems in the appropriate mass range are very efficient (~
          5-16%) in eventually forming supernova type Ia explosions.

          Title: The imprint of massive black hole formation models on
          the LISA data stream
          Authors: Alberto Sesana, Marta Volonteri, Francesco Haardt
          Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          The formation, merging, and accretion history of massive black
          holes along the hierarchical build--up of cosmic structures
          leaves a unique imprint on the background of gravitational
          waves at mHz frequencies. We study here, by means of dedicated
          simulations of black hole build--up, the possibility of
          constraining different models of black hole cosmic evolution
          using future gravitational wave space--borne missions, such as
          LISA. We consider two main scenarios for black hole formation,
          namely, one where seeds are light (~10^2 \msun, remnant of
          Population III stars), and one where seeds are heavy (>~10^4
          \msun, direct collapse). In all the models we have
          investigated, massive black hole binary coalescences do not
          produce a stochastic GW background, but rather, a set of
          individual resolved events. Detection of several hundreds
          merging events in 3 year LISA mission will be the sign of a
          heavy seed scenario with efficient formation of black hole
          seeds in a large fraction of high redshift halos. On the other
          extreme, a low event rate, about few tens in 3 years, is
          peculiar of scenarios where either the seeds are light, and
          many coalescences do not fall into the LISA band, or seeds are
          massive, but rare. In this case a decisive diagnostic is
          provided by the shape of the mass distribution of detected
          events. Light binaries (m<10^4\msun) are predicted in a fairly
          large number in Population III remnants models, but are totally
          absent in direct collapse models. Finally, a further, helpful
          diagnostic of black hole formation models lies in the
          distribution of the mass ratios in binary coalescences. While
          heavy seed models predict that most of the detected events
          involve equal mass binaries, in the case of light seeds, mass
          ratios are equally distributed in the range 0.1-1.

          Close white dwarf - red dwarf binaries must have gone through a
          common-envelope phase during their evolution. DE CVn is a
          detached white dwarf - red dwarf binary with a relatively short
          (~8.7 hours) orbital period. Its brightness and the presence of
          eclipses makes this system ideal for a more detailed study.
          From a study of photometric and spectroscopic observations of
          DE CVn we derive the system parameters which we discuss in the
          frame work of common-envelope evolution. Photometric
          observations of the eclipses are used to determine an accurate
          ephemeris. From a model fit to an average low-resolution
          spectrum of DE CVn we constrain the temperature of the white
          dwarf and the spectral type of the red dwarf. The eclipse light
          curve is analysed and combined with the radial velocity curve
          of the red dwarf determined from time-resolved spectroscopy to
          derive constraints on the inclination and the masses of the
          components in the system. The derived ephemeris is HJD_min =
          2452784.5533(1) + 0.3641394(2) x E. The red dwarf in DE CVn has
          a spectral type of M3V and the white dwarf has an effective
          temperature of 8000 K. The inclination of the system is 86 (+3,
          -2) deg and the mass and radius of the red dwarf are 0.41 +/-
          0.06 M_sun and 0.37 (+0.06, -0.007) R_sun, respectively, and
          the mass and radius of the white dwarf are 0.51 (+0.06, -0.02)
          M_sun and 0.0136 (+0.0008, -0.0002) R_sun, respectively. We
          found that the white dwarf has a hydrogen-rich atmosphere
          (DA-type). Given that DE CVn has experienced a common-envelope
          phase, we can reconstruct its evolution and we find that the
          progenitor of the white dwarf was a relatively low-mass star (M
          <= 1.6M_sun). The current age of this system is 3.3-7.3 x 10^9
          years, while it will take longer than the Hubble time for DE
          CVn to evolve into a semi-detached system.

          binary CPD-41degr7733
          Authors: H. Sana, G. Rauw, E. Gosset
          Comments: Accepted by ApJ, 15 pages, 9 figures
          Using a set of high-resolution spectra, we studied the physical
          and orbital properties of the O-type binary CPD-41 7733,
          located in the core of \ngc. We report the unambiguous
          detection of the secondary spectral signature and we derive the
          first SB2 orbital solution of the system. The period is 5.6815
          +/- 0.0015 d and the orbit has no significant eccentricity.
          CPD-41 7733 probably consists of stars of spectral types O8.5
          and B3. As for other objects in the cluster, we observe
          discrepant luminosity classifications while using spectroscopic
          or brightness criteria. Still, the present analysis suggests
          that both components display physical parameters close to those
          of typical O8.5 and B3 dwarfs. We also analyze the X-ray light
          curves and spectra obtained during six 30 ks XMM-Newton
          pointings spread over the 5.7 d period. We find no significant
          variability between the different pointings, nor within the
          individual observations. The CPD-41 7733 X-ray spectrum is well
          reproduced by a three-temperature thermal mekal model with
          temperatures of 0.3, 0.8 and 2.4 keV. No X-ray overluminosity,
          resulting e.g. from a possible wind interaction, is observed.
          The emission of CPD-41 7733 is thus very representative of
          typical O-type star X-ray emission.

          [Abridged] Type-I X-ray bursts are thermonuclear flashes that
          take place on the surface of accreting neutron stars. The wait
          time between consecutive bursts is set by the time required to
          accumulate the fuel needed to trigger a new burst; this is at
          least one hour. Sometimes secondary bursts are observed,
          approximately 10 min after the main burst. These short
          wait-time bursts are not yet understood. We observed the
          low-mass X-ray binary and X-ray burster EXO 0748-676 with
          XMM-Newton for 158 h, during 7 uninterrupted observations
          lasting up to 30 h each. We detect 76 X-ray bursts. Most
          remarkably, 15 of these bursts occur in burst triplets, with
          wait times of 12 min between the three components of the
          triplet. We also detect 14 doublets with similar wait times
          between the two components of the doublet. The characteristics
          of the bursts indicate that possibly all bursts in this system
          are hydrogen-ignited, in contrast with most other frequent
          X-ray bursters in which bursts are helium-ignited, but
          consistent with the low mass accretion rate in EXO 0748-676.
          Possibly the hydrogen ignition is the determining factor for
          the occurrence of short wait-time bursts.

          We review here recent numerical results concerning the
          acceleration and collimation of relativistic outflows from
          neutron stars, and we discuss their implications for models of
          magnetars in their hypothesized initial high rotation states.
          New results with different injection conditions and extending
          to much larger distance from the central star are also
          presented and discussed, showing that, only in the case of
          weakly magnetized winds, collimated outflows are indeed
          possible. We finally comment on the possibility that newly born
          magnetars might trigger GRBs, and we show that numerical
          results do not support such hypothesis.

          The Angstrom Project is using a distributed network of
          two-meter class telescopes to conduct a high cadence
          pixel-lensing survey of the bulge of the Andromeda Galaxy
          (M31). With the expansion of global telescope network, the
          detection efficiency of pixel-lensing surveys is rapidly
          improving. In this paper, we estimate the detection rate of
          binary lens events expected from high-cadence pixel-lensing
          surveys toward M31 such as the Angstrom Project based on
          detailed simulation of events and application of realistic
          observational conditions. Under the conservative detection
          criteria that only high signal-to-noise caustic-crossing events
          with long enough durations between caustic crossings can be
          firmly identified as binary lens events, we estimate that the
          rate would be $\Gamma_{\rm b}\sim (7-15)f_{\rm b}(N/50)$ per
          season, where $f_{\rm b}$ is the fraction of binaries with
          projected separations of $10^{-3} {\rm AU}<\tilde{d}<10^3 {\rm
          AU}$ out of all lenses and $N$ is the rate of stellar
          pixel-lensing events. We find that detected binaries would have
          mass ratios distributed over a wide range of $q\gtrsim 0.1$ but
          with separations populated within a narrow range of $1 {\rm
          AU}\lesssim \tilde{d}\lesssim 5 {\rm AU}$. Implementation of an
          alert system and subsequent follow-up observations would be
          important not only for the increase of the binary lens event
          rate but also for the characterization of lens matter.

          Authors: C.M. Zhang

          The stationary phase point (SPP) method in one-dimensional case
          is introduced to treat the diffractive scintillation. From weak
          scattering, where the SPP number N=1, to strong scattering
          (N$\gg$1), via transitional scattering regime (N$\sim$2,3), we
          find that the modulation index of intensity experiences the
          monotonically increasing from 0 to 1 with the scattering
          strength, characterized by the ratio of Fresnel scale $\rf$ to
          diffractive scale $\rdiff$.

          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Letters
          We report on XMM-Newton observations of the "Black Widow
          pulsar", PSR B1957+20. The pulsar's X-ray emission is
          non-thermal and best modeled with a single powerlaw spectrum of
          photon index 2.03(+0.51/-0.36). No coherent X-ray pulsations at
          the pulsar's spin-period could be detected, though a strong
          binary-phase dependence of the X-ray flux is observed for the
          first time. The data suggest that the majority of the pulsar's
          X-radiation is emitted from a small part of the binary orbit
          only. We identified this part as being near to where the radio
          eclipse takes place. This could mean that the X-rays from PSR
          B1957+20 are mostly due to intra-shock emission which is
          strongest when the pulsar wind interacts with the ablated
          material from the companion star.

          Title: Post-Newtonian N-body simulations
          Authors: Sverre J. Aarseth (Institute of Astronomy, University
          of Cambridge)
          Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We report on the first fully consistent conventional cluster
          simulation which includes terms up to post^{5/2} Newtonian in
          the potential of the massive body. Numerical problems for
          treating extremely energetic binaries orbiting a single massive
          object are circumvented by employing the special
          ``wheel-spoke'' regularization method of Zare (1974) which has
          not been used in large-N simulations before. Idealized models
          containing N = 10^5 particles of mass 1 M_sun with a central
          black hole of 300 M_sun have been studied on GRAPE-type
          computers. An initial half-mass radius of r_h = 0.1 pc is
          sufficiently small to yield examples of relativistic
          coalescence. This is achieved by significant binary shrinkage
          within a density cusp environment, followed by the generation
          of extremely high eccentricities which are induced by Kozai
          (1962) cycles and/or resonant relaxation. More realistic models
          with white dwarfs and ten times larger half-mass radii also
          show evidence of GR effects before disruption. Experimentation
          with the post-Newtonian terms suggests that reducing the
          time-scales for activating the different orders progressively
          may be justified for obtaining qualitatively correct solutions
          without aiming for precise predictions of the final
          gravitational radiation wave form. The results obtained suggest
          that the standard loss-cone arguments underestimate the
          swallowing rate in globular clusters containing a central black
          hole.

          Title: Mining information from binary black hole mergers: a
          comparison of estimation methods for complex exponentials in
          noise
          Authors: Emanuele Berti, Vitor Cardoso, Jose A. Gonzalez,
          Ulrich Sperhake
          Comments: 20 pages, 7 figures
          The ringdown phase following a binary black hole merger is
          usually assumed to be well described by a linear superposition
          of complex exponentials (quasinormal modes). In the
          strong-field conditions typical of a binary black hole merger,
          non-linear effects may produce mode coupling. Mode coupling can
          also be induced by the black hole's rotation, or by expanding
          the radiation field in terms of spin-weighted spherical
          harmonics (rather than spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics).
          Observing deviations from the predictions of linear black hole
          perturbation theory requires optimal fitting techniques to
          extract ringdown parameters from numerical waveforms, which are
          inevitably affected by numerical error. So far, non-linear
          least-squares fitting methods have been used as the standard
          workhorse to extract frequencies from ringdown waveforms. These
          methods are known not to be optimal for estimating parameters
          of complex exponentials. Furthermore, different fitting methods
          have different performance in the presence of noise. The main
          purpose of this paper is to introduce the gravitational wave
          community to modern variations of a linear parameter estimation
          technique first introduced in 1795 by Prony: the
          Kumaresan-Tufts and matrix pencil methods. Using ``test''
          damped sinusoidal signals in Gaussian white noise we illustrate
          the advantages of these methods, showing that they have
          variance and bias at least comparable to standard non-linear
          least-squares techniques. Then we compare the performance of
          different methods on unequal-mass binary black hole merger
          waveforms. The methods we discuss should be useful both
          theoretically (to monitor errors and search for non-linearities
          in numerical relativity simulations) and experimentally (for
          parameter estimation from ringdown signals after a
          gravitational wave detection).

          Title: How changing physical constants and violation of local
          position invariance may occur?
          Authors: V.V. Flambaum, E.V. Shuryak
          Comments: reference added
          Subj-class: Atomic Physics
          Light scalar fields very naturally appear in modern
          cosmological models, affecting such parameters of Standard
          Model as electromagnetic fine structure constant $\alpha$,
          dimensionless ratios of electron or quark mass to the QCD
          scale, $m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{QCD}$. Cosmological variations of
          these scalar fields should occur because of drastic changes of
          matter composition in Universe: the latest such event is rather
          recent (redshift $z\sim 0.5$), from matter to dark energy
          domination. In a two-brane model (we use as a pedagogical
          example) these modifications are due to changing distance to
          "the second brane", a massive companion of "our brane". Back
          from extra dimensions, massive bodies (stars or galaxies) can
          also affect physical constants. They have large scalar charge
          $Q_d$ proportional to number of particles which produces a
          Coulomb-like scalar field $\phi=Q_d/r$. This leads to a
          variation of the fundamental constants proportional to the
          gravitational potential, e.g. $\delta \alpha/ \alpha = k_\alpha
          \delta (GM/ r c^2)$. We compare different manifestations of
          this effect. The strongest limits $k_\alpha +0.17 k_e= (-3.5\pm
          6) * 10^{-7}$ are obtained from the measurements of dependence
          of atomic frequencies on the distance from Sun (the distance
          varies due to the ellipticity of the Earth's orbit).

          The continuous improvement in localization errors (sky position
          and distance) in real time as LISA observes the gradual
          inspiral of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary can be of
          great help in identifying any prompt electromagnetic
          counterpart associated with the merger. We develop a new
          method, based on a Fourier decomposition of the time-dependent,
          LISA-modulated gravitational-wave signal, to study this
          intricate problem. The method is faster than standard Monte
          Carlo simulations by orders of magnitude. By surveying the
          parameter space of potential LISA sources, we find that
          counterparts to SMBH binary mergers with total mass M~10^5-10^7
          M_Sun and redshifts z<~3 can be localized to within the field
          of view of astronomical instruments (~deg^2) typically hours to
          weeks prior to coalescence. This will allow targeted searches
          for variable electromagnetic counterparts as the merger
          proceeds, as well as monitoring of the most energetic
          coalescence phase. A rich set of astrophysical and cosmological
          applications would emerge from the identification of
          electromagnetic counterparts to these gravitational-wave
          standard sirens.

          We present the first imaging X-ray observation of the highly
          inclined (i = 78 deg) Sab Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 6810 using
          XMM-Newton, which reveals soft X-ray emission that extends out
          to a projected height of ~7 kpc away from the plane of the
          galaxy. The soft X-ray emission beyond the optical disk of the
          galaxy is most plausibly extra-planar, although it could
          instead come from large galactic radius. This extended X-ray
          emission is spatially associated with diffuse H-alpha emission,
          in particular with a prominent 5-kpc-long H-alpha filament on
          the north-west of the disk. A fraction <~35% of the total soft
          X-ray emission of the galaxy arises from projected heights |z|
          > 2 kpc. Within the optical disk of the galaxy the soft X-ray
          emission is associated with the star-forming regions visible in
          ground-based H-alpha and XMM-Newton Optical Monitor near-UV
          imaging. The temperature, super-Solar alpha-element-to-iron
          abundance ratio, soft X-ray/H-alpha correlation, and X-ray to
          far-IR flux ratio of NGC 6810 are all consistent with local
          starbursts with winds, although the large base radius of the
          outflow would make NGC 6810 one of the few ``disk-wide''
          superwinds currently known. Hard X-ray emission from NGC 6810
          is weak, and the total E=2-10 keV luminosity and spectral shape
          are consistent with the expected level of X-ray binary emission
          from the old and young stellar populations. The X-ray
          observations provide no evidence of any AGN activity. We find
          that the optical, IR and radio properties of NGC 6810 are all
          consistent with a starburst galaxy, and that the old
          classification of this galaxy as a Seyfert 2 galaxy is probably
          incorrect.

          We have analyzed high spatial, moderate spectral resolution
          observations of Eta Carinae obtained with the STIS from 1998.0
          to 2004.3. The spectra show prominent P-Cygni lines in H I, Fe
          II and He I which are complicated by blends and contamination
          by nebular emission and absorption along the line-of-sight
          toward the observer. All lines show phase and species dependent
          variations in emission and absorption. For most of the cycle
          the He I emission is blueshifted relative to the H I and Fe II
          P-Cygni emission lines, which are approximately centered at
          system velocity. The blueshifted He I absorption varies in
          intensity and velocity throughout the 2024 day period. We
          construct radial velocity curves for the absorption component
          of the He I and H I lines. The He I absorption shows
          significant radial velocity variations throughout the cycle,
          with a rapid change of over 200 km/s near the 2003.5 event. The
          H I velocity curve is similar to that of the He I absorption,
          though offset in phase and reduced in amplitude. We interpret
          the complex line profile variations in He I, H I and Fe II to
          be a consequence of the dynamic interaction of the dense wind
          of Eta Car A with the less dense, faster wind plus the
          radiation field of a hot companion star, Eta Car B. During most
          of the orbit, Eta Car B and the He+ recombination zone are on
          the near side of Eta Car A, producing blueshifted He I
          emission. He I absorption is formed in the part of the He+ zone
          that intersects the line-of-sight toward Eta Car. We use the
          variations seen in He I and the other P-Cygni lines to
          constrain the geometry of the orbit and the character of Eta
          Car B.

          cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSF) at ~27 keV and
          ~54 keV, implying a neutron-star magnetic field of ~3 10^12
          Gauss, and the presence of an iron emission line at ~6.5 keV.
          During two strong flares those parameters remained unchanged.
          Furthermore we measure the neutron-star spin period of 283.6 s,
          indicating a still constant trend.

          Standing Accretion Shock Instability
          Authors: Shijun Yoshida, Naofumi Ohnishi, Shoichi Yamada
          Comments: 24 pages, 6 figures
          The so-called "acoustic revival mechanism" of core-collapse
          supernova proposed recently by the Arizona group is an
          interesting new possibility. Aiming to understand the
          elementary processes involved in the mechanism, we have
          calculated the eigen frequencies and eigen functions for the
          g-mode oscillations of a non-rotating proto neutron star. The
          possible excitation of these modes by the standing accretion
          shock instability, or SASI, is discussed based on these eigen
          functions. We have formulated the forced oscillations of
          $g$-modes by the external pressure perturbations exerted on the
          proto neutron star surface. The driving pressure fluctuations
          have been adopted from our previous computations of the
          axisymmetric SASI in the non-linear regime. We have paid
          particular attention to low l modes, since these are the modes
          that are dominant in SASI and that the Arizona group claimed
          played an important role in their acoustic revival scenario.
          Here l is the index of the spherical harmonic functions,
          $Y_l^m$. Although the frequency spectrum of the non-linear SASI
          is broadened substantially by non-linear couplings, the typical
          frequency is still much smaller than those of g-modes, the fact
          leading to a severe impedance mismatch. As a result, the
          excitations of various $g$-modes are rather inefficient and the
          energy of the saturated g-modes is $\sim 10^{50}$erg or
          smaller, with the g_2-mode being the largest in our model. Here
          the g_2-mode has two radial nodes and is confined to the
          interior of the convection region. The energy transfer rate
          from the g-modes to out-going sound waves is estimated from the

          Title: The jet-powered optical nebula of Cygnus X-1

          We present H-alpha and [O III] (5007 Angstroms) images of the
          nebula powered by the jet of the black hole candidate and
          microquasar Cygnus X-1, observed with the 2.5m Isaac Newton
          Telescope (INT). The ring-like structure is luminous in [O III]
          and there exists a thin outer shell with a high [O III] /
          H-alpha flux ratio. This outer shell probably originates in the
          collisionally excited atoms close to the front of the bow
          shock. Its presence indicates that the gas is shock excited as
          opposed to photoionised, supporting the jet-powered scenario.
          The shock velocity was previously constrained at 20 < v < 360
          km/s; here we show that v >= 100 km/s (1 sigma confidence)
          based on a comparison of the observed [O III] / H-alpha ratio
          in the bow shock with a number of radiative shock models. From
          this we further constrain the time-averaged power of the jet:
          P_Jet = (4 - 14)*10^36 erg/s. The H-alpha flux behind the shock
          front is typically 4*10^-15 erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2, and we
          estimate an upper limit of ~8*10^-15 erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2 (3
          sigma) to the optical (R-band) continuum flux of the nebula.
          The inferred age of the structure is similar to the time Cyg
          X-1 has been close to a bright H II region (due to the proper
          motion of the binary), indicating a dense local medium is
          required to form the shock wave. In addition, we search a > 1
          square degree field of view to the south of Cyg X-1 in H-alpha
          (provided by the INT Photometric H-alpha Survey of the Northern
          Galactic Plane; IPHAS) for evidence of the counter jet
          interacting with the surrounding medium. Two candidate regions
          are identified, whose possible association with the jet could
          be confirmed with follow-up observations in [S II] and deeper
          observations in [O III] and radio.

          Title: Cataclysmic Variables
          Authors: Robert Connon Smith
          Comments: 41 pages, 11 figures, invited review for Contemporary
          Physics, in press
          Cataclysmic variables are binary stars in which a relatively
          normal star is transferring mass to its compact companion. This
          interaction gives rise to a rich range of behaviour, of which
          the most noticeable are the outbursts that give the class its
          name. Novae belong to the class, as do the less well known
          dwarf novae and magnetic systems. Novae draw their energy from
          nuclear reactions, while dwarf novae rely on gravity to power
          their smaller eruptions. All the different classes of
          cataclysmic variable can be accommodated within a single
          framework and this article will describe the framework, review
          the properties of the main types of system and discuss models
          of the outbursts and of the long-term evolution.

          We discovered kHz QPOs in 80 archived RXTE observations from
          the peculiar low mass X-ray binary Circinus X-1. In 11 cases,
          those appear in pairs and have frequencies of the order of
          several hundred Hz that vary in frequency over a factor 2. This
          and the fact that they follow the relation followed by
          observations from other neutron stars as well as that they
          appear simultaneously confirm that the central object is a
          neutron star. These relations are extended to lower frequencies
          as also is the one of the frequency difference against the
          frequency of the upper kHz QPO. The monotonic increase of the
          latter challenges theoretical models of kHz QPOs.

          Title: Quasiequilibrium black hole-neutron star binaries in
          general relativity
          Authors: Keisuke Taniguchi, Thomas W. Baumgarte, Joshua A.
          Faber, Stuart L. Shapiro
          Comments: 16 pages, 15 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. D
          We construct quasiequilibrium sequences of black hole-neutron
          star binaries in general relativity. We solve Einstein's
          constraint equations in the conformal thin-sandwich formalism,
          subject to black hole boundary conditions imposed on the
          surface of an excised sphere, together with the relativistic
          equations of hydrostatic equilibrium. In contrast to our
          previous calculations we adopt a flat spatial background
          geometry and do not assume extreme mass ratios. We adopt a
          Gamma=2 polytropic equation of state and focus on irrotational
          neutron star configurations as well as approximately
          nonspinning black holes. We present numerical results for
          ratios of the black hole's irreducible mass to the neutron
          star's ADM mass in isolation of M_{irr}^{BH}/M_{ADM,0}^{NS} =
          1, 2, 3, 5, and 10. We consider neutron stars of baryon rest
          mass M_B^{NS}/M_B^{max} = 83% and 56%, where M_B^{max} is the
          maximum allowed rest mass of a spherical star in isolation for
          our equation of state. For these sequences, we locate the onset
          of tidal disruption and, in cases with sufficiently large mass
          ratios and neutron star compactions, the innermost stable
          circular orbit. We compare with previous results for black
          hole-neutron star binaries and find excellent agreement with
          third-order post-Newtonian results, especially for large binary
          separations. We also use our results to estimate the energy
          spectrum of the outgoing gravitational radiation emitted during
          the inspiral phase for these binaries.

          Title: High-energy Emission from Pulsar Outer Magnetospheres:
          Two-dimensional Electrodynamics and Phase-averaged Spectra

astro-ph/0307236 (a book chapter)
          We investigate particle accelerators in rotating neutron-star
          magnetospheres, by simultaneously solving the Poisson equation
          for the electrostatic potential together with the Boltzmann
          equations for electrons, positrons and photons on the poloidal
          plane. Applying the scheme to the three pulsars, Crab, Vela and
          PSR B1951+32, we demonstrate that the observed phase-averaged
          spectra are basically reproduced from infrared to very high
          energies. It is found that the Vela's spectrum in 10-50 GeV is
          sensitive to the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration
          near the light cylinder; thus, a careful argument is required
          to discriminate the inner-gap and outer-gap emissions using a
          gamma-ray telescope like GLAST. It is also found that PSR
          B1951+32 has a large inverse-Compton flux in TeV energies,
          which is to be detected by ground-based air Cerenkov telescopes
          as a pulsed emission.

          Title: Very high energy gamma-ray emission from X-ray
          transients during major outbursts
          Authors: M. Orellana, G.E. Romero, L.J. Pellizza, S. Vidrih
          Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in
          Astronomy and Astrophysical journal
          Context: Some high mass X-ray binaries (HMXB) have been
          recently confirmed as gamma-ray sources by ground based
          Cherenkov telescopes. In this work, we discuss the gamma-ray
          emission from X-ray transient sources formed by a Be star and a
          highly magnetized neutron star. This kind of systems can
          produce variable hadronic gamma-ray emission through the
          mechanism proposed by Cheng and Ruderman, where a proton beam
          accelerated in the pulsar magnetosphere impacts the transient
          accretion disk. We choose as case of study the best known
          system of this class: A0535+26. Aims: We aim at making
          quantitative predictions about the very high-energy radiation
          generated in Be-X ray binary systems with strongly magnetized
          neutron stars. Methods: We study the gamma-ray emission
          generated during a major X-ray outburst of a HMXB adopting for
          the model the parameters of A0535+26. The emerging photon
          signal from the disk is determined by the grammage of the disk
          that modulates the optical depth. The electromagnetic cascades
          initiated by photons absorbed in the disk are explored, making
          use of the so-called "Approximation A" to solve the cascade
          equations. Very high energy photons induce Inverse Compton
          cascades in the photon field of the massive star. We
          implemented Monte Carlo simulations of these cascades, in order
          to estimate the characteristics of the resulting spectrum.
          Results: TeV emission should be detectable by Cherenkov
          telescopes during a major X-ray outburst of a binary formed by
          a Be star and a highly magnetized neutron star. The gamma-ray
          light curve is found to evolve in anti-correlation with the
          X-ray signal.

          Title: The Latitude of Type I X-Ray Burst Ignition on Rapidly
          Rotating Neutron Stars
          Authors: Randall L. Cooper, Ramesh Narayan
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, accepted by ApJL
          We investigate the latitude at which type I X-ray bursts are
          ignited on rapidly rotating accreting neutron stars. We find
          that, for a wide range of accretion rates, ignition occurs
          preferentially at the equator, in accord with the work of
          Spitkovsky et al. However, for a range of accretion rates below
          the critical rate above which bursts cease, ignition occurs
          preferentially at higher latitudes. The range of accretion
          rates over which nonequatorial ignition occurs is an increasing
          function of the neutron star spin frequency. These findings
          have significant implications for thermonuclear flame
          propagation, and they may explain why oscillations during the
          burst rise are detected predominantly when the accretion rate
          is high. They also support the suggestion of Bhattacharyya &
          Strohmayer that non-photospheric radius expansion double-peaked
          bursts and the unusual harmonic content of oscillations during
          the rise of some bursts result from ignition at or near a
          rotational pole.

          Title: Quark Stars: Features and Findings
          Authors: Prashanth Jaikumar (Ohio University)
          Comments: Contribution to proceedings of Hot Quarks 2006,
          Villasimius, Italy; 5 pages (TeX), 2 .eps figures
          Under extreme conditions of temperature and/or density, quarks
          and gluons are expected to undergo a deconfinement phase
          transition. While this is an ephemeral phenomenon at the
          ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collider (BNL-RHIC), quark matter
          may exist naturally in the dense interior of neutron stars.
          Herein, we present an appraisal of the possible phase structure
          of dense quark matter inside neutron stars, and the likelihood
          of its existence given the current status of neutron star
          observations. We conclude that quark matter inside neutron
          stars cannot be dismissed as a possibility, although recent
          observational evidence rules out most soft equations of state.

          Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in
          Astronomy & Astrophysics
          Our goal was to improve the fundamental parameters of the
          massive close double-lined eclipsing B2.5V+B2.5V binary CV
          Velorum.We gathered new high-resolution echelle spectroscopy on
          13 almost consecutive nights covering essentially two orbits.
          We computed a simultaneous solution to all the available
          high-quality radial-velocity and light data with the latest
          version of the Wilson-Deviney code. We obtained the following
          values for the physical parameters: $M_1 = 6.066(74) M_\odot$,
          $M_2 = 5.972(70) M_\odot$, $R_1 = 4.126(24) R_\odot$, $R_2 =
          3.908(27) R_\odot$, $\log L_1 = 3.20(5) L_\odot$, and $\log L_2
          = 3.14(5) L_\odot$. The quoted errors contain a realistic
          estimate of systematic uncertainties mainly stemming from the
          effective temperature estimation. We derived abundances for
          both components and found them to be compatible with those of B
          stars in the solar neighbourhood. We discovered low-amplitude
          periodic line-profile variations with the orbital frequency for
          both components. Their interpretation requires new data with a
          longer time span. The primary rotates subsynchronously while
          the secondary's $v\sin i$ and radius are compatible with
          synchronous rotation. Finally, we provide an update of the
          empirical mass-luminosity relation for main-sequence B stars
          which can be used for statistical predictions of masses or
          luminosities.

          Title: Variational Calculation for the Equation of State of
          Nuclear Matter at Finite Temperatures
          Authors: H. Kanzawa, K. Oyamatsu, K. Sumiyoshi, M. Takano
          Comments: Accepted for publication in Nucl. Phys. A
          An equation of state (EOS) for uniform nuclear matter is
          constructed at zero and finite temperatures with the
          variational method starting from the realistic nuclear
          Hamiltonian composed of the Argonne V18 and UIX potentials. The
          energy is evaluated in the two-body cluster approximation with
          the three-body-force contribution treated phenomenologically so
          as to reproduce the empirical saturation conditions. The
          obtained energies for symmetric nuclear matter and neutron
          matter at zero temperature are in good agreement with those by
          Akmal, Pandharipande and Ravenhall at low densities. At high
          densities, the EOS is stiffer, and the maximum mass of the
          neutron star is 2.3 M . At finite temperatures, a variational
          method by Schmidt and Pandharipande is employed to evaluate the
          free energy, which is used to derive various thermodynamic
          quantities of nuclear matter necessary for supernova
          simulations. The result of this variational method at finite
          temperatures is found to be self-consistent.

          Title: Short-Hard Gamma-Ray Bursts
          Authors: Ehud Nakar
          Comments: A review, 125 pages, 12 figures. Physics Reports -
          Bethe Centennial Volume, in press
          Two types of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are observed: short
          duration hard spectrum GRBs and long duration soft spectrum
          GRBs. For many years long GRBs were the focus of intense
          research while the lack of observational data limited the study
          of short-hard GRBs (SHBs). In 2005 a breakthrough occurred
          following the first detections of SHB afterglows, longer
          wavelength emission that follows the burst of gamma-rays.
          Similarly to long GRBs, afterglow detections led to the
          identification of SHB host galaxies and measurement of their
          redshifts. These observations established that SHBs are
          cosmological relativistic sources that, unlike long GRBs, do
          not originate from the collapse of massive stars, and therefore
          constitute a distinct physical phenomenon. One viable model for
          SHB origin is the coalescence of compact binary systems (double
          neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole), in which
          case SHBs are the electromagnetic counterparts of strong
          gravitational-wave sources. The theoretical and observational
          study of SHBs following the recent pivotal discoveries is
          reviewed, along with new theoretical results that are presented
          here for the first time.

          Astrophysics
          Observations indicate that present-day star formation in the
          Milky Way disk takes place in stellar ensembles or clusters
          rather than in isolation. Bound, long lived stellar groups are
          known as open clusters. They gradually lose stars and in their
          final evolutionary stages they are severely disrupted leaving
          an open cluster remnant made of a few stars. In this paper, we
          study in detail the stellar content and kinematics of the
          poorly populated star cluster NGC1901. This object appears
          projected against the Large Magellanic Cloud. The aim of the
          present work is to derive the current evolutionary status,
          binary fraction, age and mass of this stellar group. These are
          fundamental quantities to compare with those from N-body models
          in order to study the most general topic of star cluster
          evolution and dissolution.The analysis is performed using
          wide-field photometry in the UBVI pass-band, proper motions
          from the UCAC.2 catalog, and 3 epochs of high resolution
          spectroscopy, as well as results from extensive N-body
          calculations.The star group NGC1901 is found to be an ensemble
          of solar metallicity stars, 400+/-100 Myr old, with a core
          radius of 0.23 pc, a tidal radius of 1.0 pc, and located at
          400+/-50 pc from the Sun. Out of 13 confirmed members, only 5
          single stars have been found. Its estimated present-day binary
          fraction is at least 62%. The calculated heliocentric space
          motion of the cluster is not compatible with possible
          membership in the Hyades stream.Our results show that NGC1901
          is a clear prototype of open cluster remnant characterized by a
          large value of the binary fraction and a significant depletion
          of low-mass stars. In the light of numerical simulations, this
          is compatible with NGC1901 being what remains of a larger
          system initially made of 500-750 stars.

          Title: Irradiation models for ULXs and fits to optical data
          Authors: C. M. Copperwheat, M. Cropper, R. Soria, K. Wu
          Comments: MNRAS accepted. 20 pages containing twelve figures
          and five tables
          We have constructed a model which describes the optical
          emission from ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), and have used
          it to constrain the parameters of seven ULX systems. Our model
          assumes a binary nature for ULXs, and accounts for optical
          emission from an X-ray irradiated companion star and accretion
          disk. We apply our model to six different ULX optical
          counterparts observed with HST, and one observed with the ESO
          VLT, and determine the mass, radius and age of the donor stars
          in these systems. In addition, we obtained constraints for the
          black hole (BH) mass in some cases. We use the mass accretion
          rate implied by the X-ray luminosity of these sources as an
          additional constraint on the donor star, by assuming the mass
          transfer is driven by the stellar nuclear evolution. We find
          that in general the donors are older and less massive than
          previously thought, and are consistent with being of spectral
          type B. We discuss how these results affect our understanding
          of the evolution and history of ULXs. Where we can constrain
          the BH masses, we find them to be consistent with stellar mass
          BHs or intermediate mass BHs of order 100 solar masses. We make
          predictions for future observations of optical/infrared ULX
          counterparts, calculating binary periods for different BH
          masses in each of the seven sources.

          Title: The observational legacy of preon stars - probing new
          physics beyond the LHC
          Authors: F. Sandin, J. Hansson
          Comments: 17 pages, 4 figures
          We discuss possible ways to observationally detect the
          superdense cosmic objects composed of hypothetical
          sub-constituent fermions beneath the quark/lepton level,
          recently proposed by us. The characteristic mass and size of
          such objects depend on the compositeness scale, and their huge
          density cannot arise within a context of quarks and leptons
          alone. Their eventual observation would therefore be a direct
          vindication of physics beyond the standard model of particle
          physics, possibly far beyond the reach of the Large Hadron
          Collider (LHC), in a relatively simple and inexpensive manner.
          If relic objects of this type exist, they can possibly be
          detected by present and future x-ray observatories,
          high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, and seismological
          detectors. To have a realistic detection rate, i.e., to be
          observable, they must necessarily constitute a significant
          fraction of cold dark matter.

          Title: Pulsar Studies of Tiny-Scale Structure in the Neutral
          ISM
          Authors: J. M. Weisberg, S. Stanimirovic
          Comments: Review to be published in the proceedings of the
          meeting on "Small Ionized and Neutral Structures in the Diffuse
          Interstellar Medium" (ASP Conference Series)
          We describe the use of pulsars to study small-scale neutral
          structure in the interstellar medium (ISM). Because pulsars are
          high velocity objects, the pulsar-Earth line of sight sweeps
          rapidly across the ISM. Multiepoch measurements of pulsar
          interstellar spectral line spectra therefore probe ISM
          structures on AU scales. We review pulsar measurements of small
          scale structure in HI and OH and compare these results with
          those obtained through other techniques.

          diagram of quark matter
          Authors: F. Sandin, D. Blaschke
          Comments: 18 pages, 25 figures
          We study the effect of neutrino trapping in new-born quark
          stars within a three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with
          self-consistently calculated quark masses. The phase diagrams
          and equations of state for charge neutral quark matter in
          beta-equilibrium are presented, with and without trapped
          neutrinos. The compact star sequences for different neutrino
          untrapping scenarios are investigated and the energy release
          due to neutrino untrapping is found to be of the order of 10^53
          erg. We find that hot quark stars characterized, e.g., by an
          entropy per baryon of 1-2 and a lepton fraction of 0.4, as
          models for the cores of newborn protoneutron stars are in the
          two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) state. High temperatures
          and/or neutrino chemical potentials disfavor configurations
          with a color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase. Stable quark star
          solutions with CFL cores exist only at low temperatures and
          neutrino chemical potentials.

          Aims: We investigate the X-ray spectral and timing properties
          of the high mass X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 observed during its
          June-September 2006 giant (type II) outburst. Methods: The data
          analyzed in this work are from partly simultaneous observations
          with INTEGRAL Swift. The pulse period P and its temporal
          derivative P_dot are measured. X-ray pulse profiles in
          different energy ranges and time intervals are constructed.
          Pulse averaged X-ray spectra for different time intervals are
          studied. Results: We report a strong spin-up of the source
          during the outburst, comparable to that observed in 1985 during
          the previous giant outburst when the source was discovered. The
          value of P_dot is found to be linearly related to the X-ray
          luminosity of the source during the outburst. For the first
          time the hard X-ray (>25 keV) characteristics of the source
          during a type II outburst are studied. The X-ray pulse profiles
          apparently change with luminosity. The X-ray spectral continuum
          in the 3--120 keV energy range is modeled with an absorbed
          power law with an exponential cutoff around E ~26 keV. An iron
          emission line at ~6-7 keV is observed. The spectrum reveals
          some features between 10 and 20 keV which can be modeled either
          by a broad emission line at ~13-15 keV (a ``bump'') or by two
          absorption lines at ~10 and ~20 keV.

          Title: Six new candidate ultracompact X-ray binaries

          Jonker (SRON, Utrecht University & Harvard CfA), C.B. Markwardt

          Comments: Accepted for publication in Astronomy and
          Astrophysics
          Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) appear able to sustain
          accretion onto the compact accretor at rates lower than in
          wider X-ray binaries. This may be understood by the smaller
          accretion disks in UCXBs: a lower X-ray luminosity suffices to
          keep a disk completely ionized through irradiation and, thus,
          keep the viscosity at a sufficiently high level to allow
          effective transport of matter to the compact object. We employ
          this distinguishing factor on data from RXTE and BeppoSAX to
          identify six new candidate UCXBs, thus increasing the
          population by one quarter. The candidates are drawn from the
          population of persistently accreting and type-I X-ray bursting
          low-mass X-ray binaries. The X-ray bursts establish the
          low-mass X-ray binary nature and provide a handle on the
          accretion rate. We find that the low accretion rates are
          supported by the long burst recurrence times and the hard X-ray
          spectra of the persistent emission as derived from the 2nd
          INTEGRAL catalog of soft gamma-ray sources. We discuss the
          peculiar light curves of some new UCXB candidates.

          Title: Using Swift observations of prompt and afterglow
          emission to classify GRBs
          Authors: P.T. O'Brien, R. Willingale
          Comments: 10 pages. 8 figures. Proceedings of the Royal Society
          Discussion meeting on Gamma-ray Bursts, September 18-20, 2006.
          To appear in Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. A
          We present an analysis of early BAT and XRT data for 107
          gamma--ray bursts (GRBs) observed by the Swift satellite. We
          use these data to examine the behaviour of the X-ray light
          curve and propose a classification scheme for GRBs based on
          this behaviour. As found for previous smaller samples, the
          earliest X-ray light curve can be well described by an
          exponential which relaxes into a power law, often with flares
          superimposed. The later emission is well fit using a similar
          functional form and we find that these two functions provide a
          good description of the entire X-ray light curve. For the
          prompt emission, the transition time between the exponential
          and the power law gives a well-defined timescale, T_p, for the
          burst duration. We use T_p, the spectral index of the prompt
          emission, beta_p, and the prompt power law decay index, alpha_p
          to define four classes of burst: short, slow, fast and soft.
          Bursts with slowly declining emission have spectral and
          temporal properties similar to the short bursts despite having
          longer durations. Some of these GRBs may therefore arise from
          similar progenitors including several types of binary system.
          Short bursts tend to decline more gradually than longer
          duration bursts and hence emit a significant fraction of their
          total energy at times greater than T_p. This may be due to
          differences in the environment or the progenitor for long, fast
          bursts.

          constraints on the flare's location and size
          Authors: J. Sanz-Forcada, F. Favata, G. Micela
          Comments: 8 pages (17 in online version), 9 figures (18 in

          also at this http URL . Accepted for publication in A&A
          The observation of eclipses during X-rays flares taking place
          in active cool stars binaries allows us to calculate the
          position and size of the flares. This information cannot be
          derived by analyzing the decay of the flares, a frequently used
          approach in the literature that requires the assumption of a
          physical model. We make use of the eclipsing light curve to
          constrain the set of possible solutions, from the geometrical
          point of view, in two flares of Algol, and one flare in VW Cep.
          We make use of a technique developed with the system SV Cam
          (i~90 deg) and generalize it to binary systems with arbitrary
          inclination. The method simulates all possible geometrical
          situations that can produce the times of the four contacts of
          the eclipse. As an approximation we assume that the emitting
          region has a spherical shape that remains unchanged during the
          eclipse. We however show that this is a good approximation for
          the problem. The solutions observed indicate that in two of the
          three cases the flare cannot be polar (lat<55 deg) and in a
          third one the flare can be placed either near the pole or at
          other latitudes. The emitting regions must have a small size
          (0.002-0.5 R_*), but if interpreted as the apex of coronal
          loops, their length could actually be up to 3.1 R_* for one of
          the Algol flares. These measurements imply a lower limit to the
          electron density in the emitting region between log n_e(cm^-3)
          10.4 and 14.0, and a magnetic field between 70 and 3500 G.
          Similar results are found if the emitting region is assumed to
          be loop-shaped.

          mergers
          Authors: Frank Herrmann, Ian Hinder, Deirdre Shoemaker, Pablo
          Laguna, Richard A. Matzner
          Comments: 8 pages, 8 figures
          The inspiral and merger of binary black holes will likely
          involve black holes with both unequal masses and arbitrary
          spins. The gravitational radiation emitted by these binaries
          will carry angular as well as linear momentum. A net flux of
          emitted linear momentum implies that the black hole produced by
          the merger will experience a recoil or kick. Previous studies
          have focused on the recoil velocity from unequal mass,
          non-spinning binaries. We present results from simulations of
          equal mass but spinning black hole binaries and show how a
          significant gravitational recoil can also be obtained in these
          situations. We consider the case of black holes with opposite
          spins of magnitude $a$ aligned/anti-aligned with the orbital
          angular momentum, with $a$ the dimensionless spin parameters of
          the individual holes. For the initial setups under
          consideration, we find a recoil velocity of $V = 475 \KMS a$.
          Supermassive black hole mergers producing kicks of this
          magnitude could result in the ejection from the cores of dwarf
          galaxies of the final hole produced by the collision.

          Comments: 7 pages, with figures
          The inner crust of neutron stars formed of nuclear clusters
          immersed in a neutron sea has been widely studied in the
          framework of the Wigner-Seitz approximation since the seminal
          work of Negele and Vautherin. In this article, the validity of
          this approximation is discussed in the framework of the band
          theory of solids. For a typical cell of $^{200}$Zr, present in
          the external layers of the inner crust, it is shown that the
          ground state properties of the neutron gas are rather well
          reproduced by the Wigner-Seitz approximation, while its
          dynamical properties depend on the energy scale of the process
          of interest or on the temperature. It is concluded that the
          Wigner-Seitz approximation is well suited for describing the
          inner crust of young neutron stars and the collapsing core of
          massive stars during supernovae explosions. However the band
          theory is required for low temperature fluid dynamics.

          Comments: 25 pages, 11 figures
          We construct realistic maps of the expected neutrino and
          gamma-ray emissions above the TeV originated from the hadronic
          scattering of cosmic rays (CR) with the interstellar medium
          (ISM). Differently from previous works, where a uniform CR
          density was assumed, we estimate the spatial distribution of
          primary nuclei by means of numerical simulations considering
          several models of the galactic magnetic field. Assuming that CR
          sources are supernova remnants (SNR), we use a distribution of
          those objects as estimated from observations of pulsars and
          progenitor stars.
          For the ISM distribution, we adopt most recent data both for
          the atomic and molecular hydrogen. With respect to previous
          results, we find the neutrino and gamma-ray emissions to be
          more peaked along the galactic equator and in the galactic
          centre which improves significantly the perspectives of a
          positive detection.
          We compare our predictions with present experimental upper
          limits both for the gamma-rays and the neutrinos and show that
          air shower array experiments may soon be able to detect the
          gamma-ray emission from the galactic plane. Finally, we discuss
          the perspectives that a neutrino telescope of kilometric scale
          based in the North hemisphere has to measure the diffuse
          emission from the inner Galaxy.

          Comments: 24 pages including 9 figures, accepted for
          publication in the Astrophysical Journal
          We present X-ray dust scattering halo results based on our 76
          ks {\it Chandra} ACIS-S/HETGS observation of the LMXB dipping
          source 4U 1624-490. Through analysis of the halo light curves
          with 2-6 keV spectra over the persistent and dipping periods,
          we estimate a geometric distance of $\sim$15 kpc to 4U
          1624-490. We also fit halo radial profiles with different ISM
          dust grain models to assess the location, uniformity, and
          density of the halo. Our analysis shows that the dust spatial
          distribution is not uniform along the line-of-sight; rather, it
          is consistent with the spiral arm structure mapped in {\sc
          Hii}. The large difference between the absorption Hydrogen
          column ($N_{\rm H}^{abs} \sim 8 \times10^{22} \rm cm^{-2}$;
          probes all gas along the line-of-sight) derived from broadband
          spectral fitting, and the scattering Hydrogen column ($N_{\rm
          H}^{sca} \sim 4 \times10^{22} \rm cm^{-2}$; probes only
          Galactic gas) derived from our studies of the 4U 1624-490 X-ray
          halo suggests that a large fraction of the column is local to
          the X-ray binary. We also present (and apply) a new method for
          assessing the {\it Chandra} point spread function at large ($>
          50''$) angles, through use of the time delays from the observed
          dips.

          2006
          In this paper, we review the observational properties of two
          accreting X-ray pulsars, the persistent source 4U1907+09 and
          the transient V0332+53. Accreting X-ray pulsars are among the
          brightest sources in the X-ray sky and are frequently observed
          by Integral and other X-ray missions. Nevertheless they are
          still very enigmatic sources as fundamental questions on the
          X-ray production mechanism still remain largely unanswered.
          These questions are addressed by performing detailed temporal
          and spectral studies on several objects over a long time range.
          Of vital importance is the study of cyclotron lines as they
          provide the only direct link to the magnetic field of the
          pulsar. While some objects show cyclotron lines which are
          extremely stable with time and with pulse phase, in other
          objects the lines strongly depend on the pulse phase, the
          luminosity of the source, or both.
          Of special interest in any case are transient sources where it
          is possible to study the evolution of the cyclotron line and
          the source in general from the onset until the end of the
          outburst through a wide range of different luminosity states.
          We present an observational review of a transient and a
          persistent accreting X-ray pulsar observed with Integral.

          Comments: 76 pages, 26 figures, review article to appear in the
          GRB Focus Issue of New Journal of Physics
          Recent months have witnessed dramatic progress in our
          understanding of SGRBs. There is now general agreement that
          SGRBs can produce directed outflows of relativistic matter with
          a kinetic luminosity exceeding by many millions that of AGN.
          The requirements of energy and compactness indicate that SGRB
          activity can be ascribed to a modest fraction of a solar mass
          of gas accreting onto a stellar mass BH or to a precursor stage
          leading inevitably to such an object. Scenarios involving the
          birth of a rapidly rotating NS, or an accreting BH in a merging
          binary driven by gravitational waves are reviewed, along with
          possible alternatives (collisions or collapse of compact
          objects). If a BH lies at the center of this activity, the
          fundamental pathways through which mass, angular momentum and
          energy can flow around and away from it play a key role in
          understanding how these prime movers can form collimated
          relativistic outflows. Hypercritical flows near BHs, where
          photons cannot supply the cooling, but neutrinos do so
          efficiently, are discussed in detail, and we believe that they
          offer the best hope of understanding the central engine. On the
          other hand, statistical investigations of SGRB niches provide
          valuable information on their nature and evolutionary behavior.
          In addition, compelling evidence now points to the continuous
          fueling of SGRB sources. We suggest that the observed late
          flaring activity could be due to a secondary accretion episode
          induced by the fall back of material stripped from a compact
          object during a merger or collision. Important open questions
          are identified, along with the types of observation that would
          discriminate among various models. SGRB jets may be one of the
          few observable consequences of how flows near nuclear density
          behave under the influence of strong gravitational fields.

          Title: Merger Recoils and Spin Flips From Generic Black-Hole
          Binaries
          Authors: Manuela Campanelli, Carlos O. Lousto, Yosef Zlochower,
          David Merritt
          Comments: 5 pages, revtex 4
          We report the first results from evolutions of a generic
          black-hole binary, i.e. a binary containing unequal mass black
          holes with misaligned spins. Our configuration, which has a
          mass ratio of 2:1, consists of an initially non-spinning hole
          orbiting a larger, rapidly spinning hole (specific spin a/m =
          0.885), with the spin direction oriented -45-degrees with
          respect to the orbital plane. We track the inspiral and merger
          for ~2 orbits and find that the remnant receives a substantial
          kick of 454 km/s, more than twice as large as the maximum kick
          from non-spinning binaries. Such a large recoil velocity
          reopens the possibility that a merged binary can be ejected
          even from the nucleus of a massive host galaxy. The remnant
          spin direction is flipped by 103-degrees with respect to the
          initial spin direction of the larger hole.

          Binary black holes can form efficiently in dense young stellar
          clusters, such as the progenitors of globular clusters, via a
          combination of gravitational segregation and cluster
          evaporation. We use simple analytic arguments supported by
          detailed $N$-body simulations to determine how frequently black
          holes born in a single stellar cluster should form binaries, be
          ejected from the cluster, and merge through the emission of
          gravitational radiation. We then convolve this ``transfer
          function'' relating cluster formation to black hole mergers
          with (i) the distribution of observed cluster masses and (ii)
          the star formation history of the universe, assuming that a
          significant fraction $\gcl$ of star formation occurs in
          clusters and that a significant fraction $\gcand$ of clusters
          undergo this segregation and evaporation process. We predict
          future ground--based gravitational wave (GW) detectors could
          observe $\sim 10^4 \gcl \gcand$ double black hole mergers per
          year. Under the most optimistic assumptions $(\gcl=\gcand=1)$,
          the presently operating LIGO interferometer could detect a
          merger during its first full year of science data; upper limits
          therefore weakly constrain star and cluster formation in the
          early universe.

          The supernova-GRB (Gamma-ray burst) association is tested by
          showing the consistence of the distributions of pulsar's kick
          velocities and GRB energies, under the assumption that cosmic
          GRBs are related to supernova explosions that form pulsars.
          These two distributions are derived from observations, and are
          checked by K-S test. The deduced distribution of kick velocity
          from the total energy of GRBs and the observed distribution of
          radio pulsars are found to come from a same parent population.
          This result may indicate that GRBs could be really related to
          supernovae, and that the asymmetry of GRB fireballs would cause
          the kick of pulsars.

          PSR B0031-07 is well known to exhibit three different modes of
          drifting sub-pulses (mode A, B and C). It has recently been
          shown that in a multifrequency observation, consisting of 2700
          pulses, all driftmodes were visible at low frequencies, while
          at 4.85 GHz only mode-A drift or non-drifting emission was
          detected. This suggests that modes A and B are emitted in
          sub-beams, rotating at a fixed distance from the magnetic axis,
          with the mode-B sub-beams being closer to the magnetic axis
          than the mode-A sub-beams. Diffuse emission between the
          sub-beams can account for the non-drifting emission. Using the
          results of an analysis of simultaneous multifrequency
          observations of PSR B0031-07, we set out to construct a
          geometrical model that includes emission from both sub-beams
          and diffuse emission and describes the regions of the radio
          emission of PSR B0031-07 at each emission frequency for
          driftmodes A and B. Based on the vertical spacing between
          driftbands, we have determined the driftmode of each sequence
          of drift. To restrict the model, we calculated average
          polarisation and intensity characteristics for each driftmode
          and at each frequency. The model reproduces the observed
          polarisation and intensity characteristics, suggesting that
          diffuse emission plays an important role in the emission
          properties of PSR B0031-07. The model further suggests that the
          emission heights of this pulsar range from a few kilometers to
          a little over 10 kilometers above the pulsar surface. We also
          find that the relationships between height and frequency of
          emission that follow from curvature radiation and from
          plasma-frequency emission could not be used to reproduce the
          observed frequency dependence of the width of the average
          intensity profiles.

          We report the discovery of a periodic modulation in the optical
          lightcurve of the candidate ultra-compact X-ray binary
          4U1822-000. Using time-resolved optical photometry taken with
          the William Herschel Telescope we find evidence for a
          sinusoidal modulation with a semi-amplitude of 8 percent and a
          period of 191 min, which is most likely close to the true
          orbital period of the binary. Using the van Paradijs &
          McClintock relation for the absolute magnitude and the distance
          modulus allowing for interstellar reddening, we estimate the
          distance to 4U1822-000 to be 6.3 kpc. The long orbital period

          The merger of two neutron stars usually produces a remnant with
          a mass significantly above the single (nonrotating) neutron
          star maximum mass. In some cases, the remnant will be
          stabilized against collapse by rapid, differential rotation.
          MHD-driven angular momentum transport eventually leads to the
          collapse of the remnant's core, resulting in a black hole
          surrounded by a massive accretion torus. Here we present
          simulations of this process. The plausibility of generating
          short duration gamma ray bursts through this scenario is
          discussed.

          We calculate the bulk viscosity of color-superconducting quark
          matter in the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase. We assume that
          the lightest bosons are the superfluid mode H and the kaons K0
          and K+, and that there is no kaon condensate. We calculate the
          rate of strangeness-equilibrating processes that convert kaons
          into superfluid modes, and the resultant bulk viscosity. We
          find that for oscillations with a timescale of milliseconds, at
          temperatures T << 1 MeV, the CFL bulk viscosity is much less
          than that of unpaired quark matter, but at higher temperatures
          the bulk viscosity of CFL matter can become larger.

          10 figures and 3 tables
          We present new photometry and spectroscopy of the eclipsing
          white dwarf - M-dwarf binary star RR Cae. We use timings of the
          primary eclipse from white-light photo-electric photometry to
          derive a new ephemeris for the eclipses. We find no evidence
          for any period change greater than Pdot/P ~ 5E-12 over a
          timescale of 10 years. We have measured the effective
          temperature of the white dwarf, T_WD, from an analysis of two
          high resolution spectra of RR Cae and find T_WD = (7540 +-
          175)K. We estimate a spectral type of M4 for the companion from
          the same spectra. We have combined new spectroscopic orbits for
          the white dwarf and M-dwarf with an analysis of the primary
          eclipse and cooling models for helium white dwarfs to measure
          the mass and radius of the M-dwarf. The mass of the M-dwarf is
          (0.182 - 0.183) +- 0.013 Msun and the radius is (0.203 - 0.215)
          +- 0.013 Rsun, where the ranges quoted for these values reflect
          the range of white dwarf models used. In contrast to previous
          studies, which lacked a spectroscopic orbit for the white
          dwarf, we find that the mass and radius of the M-dwarf are
          normal for an M4 dwarf. The mass of the white dwarf is (0.440
          +-0.022) Msun. With these revised masses and radii we find that
          RR Cae will become a cataclysmic variable star when the orbital
          period is reduced from its current value of 7.3 hours to 121
          minutes by magnetic braking in 9-20 Gyr. We note that there is
          night-to-night variability of a few seconds in the timing of
          primary eclipse caused by changes to the shape of the primary
          eclipse. We speculate as to the possible causes of this
          phenomenon. (Abridged)

          A possible birefringence effect that arises in quantum gravity
          leads to a frequency-dependent rotation of the polarization
          angle of linearly polarized emission from distant sources. Here
          we use the UV/optical polarization data of the afterglows of
          GRB 020813 and GRB 021004 to constrain this effect. We find an
          upper limit on the Gambini & Pulin birefringence parameter $|
          \eta | <2\times 10^{-7}$. This limit is of 3 orders better than
          the previous limits from observations of AGNs and of the Crab
          pulsar. Much stronger limits may be obtained by the future
          observation of polarization of the prompt $\gamma$-rays.

          We present the discovery of 2MASS J21321145+1341584AB as a
          closely separated (0.066") very low-mass field dwarf binary
          resolved in the near-infrared by the Keck II Telescope using
          laser guide star adaptive optics. Physical association is
          deduced from the angular proximity of the components and
          constraints on their common proper motion. We have obtained a
          near-infrared spectrum of the binary and find that it is best
          described by an L5+/-0.5 primary and an L7.5+/-0.5 secondary.
          Model-dependent masses predict that the two components straddle
          the hydrogen burning limit threshold with the primary likely
          stellar and the secondary likely substellar. The properties of
          this sytem - close projected separation (1.8+/-0.3 AU) and near
          unity mass ratio - are consistent with previous results for
          very low-mass field binaries. The relatively short estimated
          orbital period of this system (~7-12 yr) makes it a good target
          for dynamical mass measurements. Interestingly, the system's
          angular separation is the tightest yet for any very low-mass
          binary published from a ground-based telescope and is the
          tightest binary discovered with laser guide star adaptive
          optics to date.

          Model
          Authors: Randall L. Cooper, Ramesh Narayan
          Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ApJ
          We use the two-zone model of Cooper & Narayan to study the
          onset and time evolution of hydrogen-triggered type I X-ray
          bursts on accreting neutron stars. At the lowest accretion
          rates, thermally unstable hydrogen burning ignites helium as
          well and produces a mixed hydrogen and helium burst. For
          somewhat higher accretion rates, thermally unstable hydrogen
          burning does not ignite helium and thus triggers only a weak
          hydrogen flash. The peak luminosities of weak hydrogen flashes
          are typically much lower than the accretion luminosity. These
          results are in accord with previous theoretical work. We find
          that a series of weak hydrogen flashes generates a massive
          layer of helium that eventually ignites in an energetic pure
          helium flash. Although previously conjectured, this is the
          first time such bursting behavior has been actually
          demonstrated in a theoretical model. For yet higher accretion
          rates, hydrogen burning is thermally stable and thus steadily
          generates a layer of helium that ultimately ignites in a pure
          helium flash. We find that, for a narrow range of accretion
          rates between the mixed hydrogen and helium burst and weak
          hydrogen flash regimes, unstable hydrogen burning ignites
          helium only after a short series of weak hydrogen flashes has
          generated a sufficiently deep layer of helium. These bursts
          have fluences that are intermediate between those of normal
          mixed hydrogen and helium bursts and energetic pure helium
          flashes.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical
          Journal, 7 pages, 4 figures
          One of the challenges to increasing the mass of a white dwarf
          through accretion is the tendency for the accumulating hydrogen
          to ignite unstably and potentially trigger mass loss. It has
          been known for many years that there is a narrow range of
          accretion rates for which the hydrogen can burn stably,
          allowing for the white dwarf mass to increase as a pure helium
          layer accumulates. We first review the physics of stable
          burning, providing a clear explanation for why radiation
          pressure stabilization leads to a narrow range of accretion
          rates for stable burning near the Eddington limit, confirming
          the recent work of Nomoto and collaborators. We also explore
          the possibility of stabilization due to a high luminosity from
          beneath the burning layer. We then examine the impact of the
          beta-decay-limited ``hot'' CNO cycle on the stability of
          burning. Though this plays a significant role for accreting
          neutron stars, we find that for accreting white dwarfs, it can
          only increase the range of stably-burning accretion rates for
          metallicities below 0.01 solar metallicity.

          Title: On the abundances of GRO J1655-40

          Context: The detection of overabundances of $\alpha$-elements
          and lithium in the secondary star of a black-hole binary
          provides important insights about the formation of a
          stellar-mass black-hole. $\alpha$-enhancement might
          theoretically also be the result of pollution by the
          nucleosynthesis occurring during an outburst, or through
          spallation by the jet. Aims: We study the abundances, and their
          possible variations with time, in the secondary star of the
          runaway black-hole binary GRO J1655--40, in order to understand
          their origin. Methods: We present a detailed comparison between
          a Keck spectrum obtained in 1998 found in the literature,
          archival VLT-UVES data taken in 2004 and new VLT-UVES spectra
          obtained early 2006. We carefully determine the equivalent
          widths of different $\alpha$-elements (Mg, O, Ti, S and Si)
          with their associated uncertainty. We use the well-studied
          comparison star HD 156098 as well as synthetic spectra to match
          the spectrum of GRO J1655--40 in order to determine the
          abundances of these elements. Results: We see no significant
          variations of equivalent widths with time. Our fit using HD
          156098 reveals that there is significant overabundance of
          oxygen in all our spectra, but no overabundances of any of the
          other $\alpha$-elements. Finally, we do not detect the lithium
          line at 6707 \AA. Conclusions: We show that there is no
          detected pollution in GRO J1655--40 after the burst in 2005.
          Moreover, we argue that uncertainties in the equivalent widths
          were previously underestimated by a factor of $\sim$3.
          Consequently, our results challenge the existence of general
          overabundances of $\alpha$-elements observed in this galactic
          black-hole binary, and thus the accepted interpretation that
          they are of supernova origin. The physical cause of the
          overabundance of oxygen remains unclear.

          Title: Newborn Magnetars as sources of Gravitational Radiation:
          constraints from High Energy observations of Magnetar
          Candidates
          Authors: Simone Dall'Osso (1), Luigi Stella (1) (INAF - OAR)

          stars: from the interior to the surface", Eds. D. Page, R.
          Turolla, S. Zane
          Soft Gamma Repeaters and the Anomalous X-ray Pulsars are
          believed to contain slowly spinning "magnetars". The enormous
          energy liberated in the 2004 Dece 27 giant flare from SGR
          1806-20, together with the likely recurrence time of such
          events, points to an internal magnetic field strength ~ 10^{16}
          G. Such strong fields are expected to be generated by a
          coherent alpha-Omega dynamo in the early seconds after the
          Neutron Star formation, if its spin period is of a few
          milliseconds at most. A substantial deformation of the NS is
          caused by such fields and a newborn millisecond-spinning
          magnetar would thus radiate for a few days a strong
          gravitational wave signal. Such a signal may be detected with
          Advanced LIGO-class detectors up to the distance of the Virgo
          cluster, where ~ 1 magnetar per year are expected to form.
          Recent X-ray observations reveal that SNRs around magnetar
          candidates do not show evidence for a larger energy content
          than standard SNRs (Vink & Kuiper 2006). This is at variance
          with what would be expected if the spin energy of the young,
          millisecond NS were radiated away as electromagnetic radiation
          andd/or relativistic particle winds and, thus, transferred
          quickly to the expanding gas shell. We show here that these
          recent findings can be reconciled with the idea of magnetars
          being formed with fast spins, if most of their initial spin
          energy is radiated thorugh GWs. In particular, we find that
          this occurs for essentially the same parameter range that would
          make such objects detectable by Advanced LIGO-class detectors
          up to the Virgo Cluster.

          Authors: J. Albert, et al

          We report on VHE gamma-observations with the MAGIC telescope of
          the pulsar PSR B1951+32 and its associated nebula CTB 80. Our
          data constrain the cutoff energy of the pulsar to be <32GeV,
          assuming the pulsed gamma-ray emission to be exponentially
          cutoff. The upper limit on the flux of pulsed gamma-ray
          emission >75GeV is 4.3*10^-11 photons cm^-2 sec^-1 and the
          upper limit on the flux of steady emission >140GeV is
          1.5*10^-11 photons cm^-2 sec^-1. We discuss our results in the
          framework of recent model predictions and other studies.

          Specific-heat measurements are reported near the Curie
          temperature ($T_C$~= 320 K) on tri-glycine sulfate.
          Measurements were made on crystals whose surfaces were either
          non-grounded or short-circuited, and were carried out in
          magnetic fields up to 9 T and electric fields up to 220 V/cm.
          In non-grounded crystals we find that the shape of the
          specific-heat anomaly near $T_C$ is thermally broadened.
          However, the anomaly changes to the characteristic sharp
          $\lambda$-shape expected for a continuous transition with the
          application of either a magnetic field or an electric field. In
          crystals whose surfaces were short-circuited with gold, the
          characteristic $\lambda$-shape appeared in the absence of an
          external field. This effect enabled a determination of the
          critical exponents above and below $T_C$, and may be understood
          on the basis that the surface charge originating from the
          pyroelectric coefficient, $dP/dT$, behaves as if shorted by
          external magnetic or electric fields.

          Title: The rigidity of crystalline color superconducting quark
          matter

          Comments: 36 pages, 5 figures
          Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Phenomenology;
          Superconductivity
          We calculate the shear modulus of crystalline color
          superconducting quark matter, showing that this phase of dense,
          but not asymptotically dense, three-flavor quark matter
          responds to shear stress like a very rigid solid. To evaluate
          the shear modulus, we derive the low energy effective
          Lagrangian that describes the phonons that originate from the
          spontaneous breaking of translation invariance by the spatial
          modulation of the gap parameter $\Delta$. These massless bosons
          describe space- and time-dependent fluctuations of the crystal
          structure and are analogous to the phonons in ordinary
          crystals. The coefficients of the spatial derivative terms of
          the phonon effective Lagrangian are related to the elastic
          moduli of the crystal; the coefficients that encode the linear
          response of the crystal to a shearing stress define the shear
          modulus. We analyze the two particular crystal structures which
          are energetically favored over a wide range of densities, in
          each case evaluating the phonon effective action and the shear
          modulus up to order $\Delta^2$ in a Ginzburg-Landau expansion,
          finding shear moduli which are 20 to 1000 times larger than
          those of neutron star crusts. The crystalline color
          superconducting phase has long been known to be a superfluid --
          by picking a phase its order parameter breaks the quark-number
          $U(1)_B$ symmetry spontaneously. Our results demonstrate that
          this superfluid phase of matter is at the same time a rigid
          solid. We close with a rough estimate of the pinning force on
          the rotational vortices which would be formed embedded within
          this rigid superfluid upon rotation. Our results raise the
          possibility that (some) pulsar glitches could originate within
          a quark matter core deep within a neutron star.

          Comments: 3 pages, 1 figure, submitted to the MG11 proceedings
          Hypermassive neutron stars (HMNSs) are equilibrium
          configurations supported against collapse by rapid differential
          rotation and likely form as transient remnants of binary
          neutron star mergers. Though HMNSs are dynamically stable,
          secular effects such as viscosity or magnetic fields tend to
          bring HMNSs into uniform rotation and thus lead to collapse. We
          simulate the evolution of magnetized HMNSs in axisymmetry using
          codes which solve the Einstein-Maxwell-MHD system of equations.
          We find that magnetic braking and the magnetorotational
          instability (MRI) both contribute to the eventual collapse of
          HMNSs to rotating black holes surrounded by massive, hot
          accretion tori and collimated magnetic fields. Such hot tori
          radiate strongly in neutrinos, and the resulting
          neutrino-antineutrino annihilation could power short-hard GRBs.

          Comments: 22 pages, 7 figures, Proceedings of the 2006 COSPAR
          Meeting in Beijing, accepted for publication in AdSR
          In the last few years, new observations by CHANDRA and XMM have
          shown that Pulsar Wind Nebulae present a complex but similar
          inner feature, with the presence of axisymmetric rings and
          jets, which is generally referred as {\it jet-torus structure}.
          Due to the rapid growth in accuracy and robustness of numerical
          schemes for relativistic fluid-dynamics, it is now possible to
          model the flow and magnetic structure of the relativistic
          plasma responsible for the emission. Recent results have
          clarified how the jet and rings are formed, suggesting that the
          morphology is strongly related to the wind properties, so that,
          in principle, it is possible to infer the conditions in the
          unshocked wind from the nebular emission. I will review here
          the current status in the modeling of Pulsar Wind Nebulae, and,
          in particular, how numerical simulations have increased our
          understanding of the flow structure, observed emission,
          polarization and spectral properties. I will also point to
          possible future developments of the present models.

          We present results of our pulsar population synthesis of
          ordinary isolated and millisecond pulsars in the Galactic
          plane. Over the past several years, a program has been
          developed to simulate pulsar birth, evolution and emission
          using Monte Carlo techniques. We have added to the program the
          capability to simulate millisecond pulsars, which are old,
          recycled pulsars with extremely short periods. We model the
          spatial distribution of the simulated pulsars by assuming that
          they start with a random kick velocity and then evolve through
          the Galactic potential. We use a polar cap/slot gap model for
          $\gamma$-ray emission from both millisecond and ordinary
          pulsars. From our studies of radio pulsars that have clearly
          identifiable core and cone components, in which we fit the
          polarization sweep as well as the pulse profiles in order to
          constrain the viewing geometry, we develop a model describing
          the ratio of radio core-to-cone peak fluxes. In this model,
          short period pulsars are more cone-dominated than in our
          previous studies. We present the preliminary results of our
          recent study and the implications for observing these pulsars
          with GLAST and AGILE.

          General constraints on fluid velocity divergences for particles
          in quark matter are derived from baryon number conservation and
          enforced electric charge neutrality. A new oscillation pattern
          in three-flavor normal quark matter satisfying these conditions
          is found and its bulk viscosity is calculated. The result may

          Title: Diffusive Synchrotron Radiation from Pulsar Wind Nebulae
          Authors: G. D. Fleishman, M. F. Bietenholz
          Comments: 15 pages, 5 figures, accepted to MNRAS
          Diffusive Synchrotron Radiation (DSR) is produced by charged
          particles as they random walk in a stochastic magnetic field.
          The spectrum of the radiation produced by particles in such
          fields differs substantially from those of standard synchrotron
          emission because the corresponding particle trajectories
          deviate significantly from gyration in a regular field. The
          Larmor radius, therefore, is no longer a good measure of the
          particle trajectory. In this paper we analyze a special DSR
          regime which arises as highly relativistic electrons move
          through magnetic fields which have only random structure on a
          wide range of spatial scales. Such stochastic fields arise in
          turbulent processes, and are likely present in pulsar wind
          nebulae (PWNe). We show that DSR generated by a single
          population of electrons can reproduce the observed broad-band
          spectra of PWNe from the radio to the X-ray, in particular
          producing relatively flat spectrum radio emission as is usually
          observed in PWNe. DSR can explain the existence of several
          break frequencies in the broad-band emission spectrum without
          recourse to breaks in the energy spectrum of the relativistic
          particles. The shape of the radiation spectrum depends on the
          spatial spectrum of the stochastic magnetic field. The
          implications of the presented DSR regime for PWN physics are
          discussed.

          The phase structure and equation of state for two-flavor quark
          matter under compact star constraints is studied within a
          nonlocal chiral quark model. Chiral symmetry breaking leads to
          rather large, density dependent quark masses at the phase
          transition to quark matter. The influence of diquark pairing
          gaps and quark masses on density dependent emissivities for the
          direct URCA is discussed. Since m_u>m_d, the direct URCA
          process due to quark masses cannot occur. We present cooling
          curves for model quark stars and discuss their relation to
          observational data.

          Comments: 10 Pages, 2 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          In the absence of an active dynamo, purely poloidal magnetic
          field configurations are unstable to large-scale dynamical
          perturbations and ultimately reconnect away on Alfvenic
          timescales. Nevertheless, there are a number of classes of
          stars, including Ap stars, white dwarfs, and neutron stars
          which are thought to not contain active dynamos and yet do
          exhibit significant, large scale, surface magnetic fields.
          Braithwaite & Spruit (2004) have shown via simulations that the
          external poloidal magnetic field may be stabilized in such
          systems by a toroidal component in the stellar interior. We
          present a variational principle for computing the structure of
          a magnetic field within a conducting sphere surrounded by an
          insulating vacuum. We find a simple class of axisymmetric
          solutions parametrized by angular and radial quantum numbers.
          We discuss the implications that these may have for soft-gamma
          repeaters and pulsar magnetic field decay.

          One possible scenario for the formation of carbon-enhanced
          metal-poor stars is the accretion of carbon-rich material from
          a binary companion which may no longer visible. It is generally
          assumed that the accreted material remains on the surface of
          the star and does not mix with the interior until first
          dredge-up. However, thermohaline mixing should mix the accreted
          material with the original stellar material as it has a higher
          mean molecular weight. We investigate the effect that this has
          on the surface abundances by modelling a binary system of
          metallicity Z=0.0001 with a 2 solar mass primary star and a
          0.74 solar mass secondary star in an initial orbit of 4000
          days. The accretion of material from the wind of the primary
          leads to the formation of a carbon-rich secondary. We find that
          the accreted material mixes fairly rapidly throughout 90% of
          the star, with important consequences for the surface
          composition. Models with thermohaline mixing predict very
          different surface abundances after first dredge-up compared to
          canonical models of stellar evolution.

          Title: Orbital Evolution and orbital phase resolved
          spectroscopy of the HMXB pulsar 4U 1538-52 with RXTE-PCA and
          BeppoSAX

          We report here results from detailed timing and spectral
          studies of the high mass X-ray binary pulsar 4U~1538--52 over
          several binary periods using observations made with the Rossi
          X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and BeppoSAX satellites. Pulse
          timing analysis with the 2003 RXTE data over two binary orbits
          confirms an eccentric orbit of the system. Combining the
          orbitial parameters determined from this observation with the
          earlier measurements we did not find any evidence of orbital
          decay in this X-ray binary. We have carried out orbital phase
          resolved spectroscopy to measure changes in the spectral
          parameters with orbital phase, particularly the absorption
          column density and the iron line flux. The RXTE-PCA spectra in
          the 3--20 keV energy range were fitted with a power law and a
          high energy cut-off alongwith a Gaussian line at $\sim$ 6.4
          keV, whereas the BeppoSAX spectra needed only a power law and
          Gaussian emission line at $\sim$ 6.4 keV in the restricted
          energy range of 0.3--10.0 keV. An absorption along the line of
          sight was included for both the RXTE and BeppoSAX data. The
          variation of the free spectral parameters over the binary orbit
          was investigated and we found that the variation of the column
          density of absorbing material in the line of sight with orbital
          phase is in reasonable agreement with a simple model of a
          spherically symmetric stellar wind from the companion star.

          We re-examine the correlation between the frequencies of upper
          and lower kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) in bright
          neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries. By including the kHz QPO
          frequencies of the X-ray binary Cir X-1 and two accreting
          millisecond pulsars in our sample, we show that the full sample
          does not support the class of theoretical models based on a
          single resonance, while models based on relativistic precession
          or Alfven waves describe the data better. Moreover, we show
          that the fact that all sources follow roughly the same
          correlation over a finite frequency range creates a correlation
          between the linear parameters of the fits to any sub-sample.

          Dark matter has been recognized as an essential part of matter
          for over 70 years now, and many suggestions have been made,
          what it could be. Most of these ideas have centered on Cold
          Dark Matter, particles that are expected in extensions of
          standard particle physics, such as supersymmetry. Here we
          explore the concept that dark matter is sterile neutrinos, a
          concept that is commonly referred to as Warm Dark Matter. Such
          particles have keV masses, and decay over a very long time,
          much longer than the Hubble time. In their decay they produce
          X-ray photons which modify the ionization balance in the early
          universe, increasing the fraction of molecular Hydrogen, and
          thus help early star formation. Sterile neutrinos may also help
          to understand the baryon-asymmetry, the pulsar kicks, the early
          growth of black holes, the minimum mass of dwarf spheroidal
          galaxies, as well as the shape of dark matter halos. As soon as
          all these tests have been quantitative in its various
          parameters, we may focus on the creation mechanism of these
          particles, and could predict the strength of the sharp X-ray
          emission line, expected from any large dark matter assembly. A
          measurement of this X-ray emission line would be definitive
          proof for the existence of may be called weakly interacting
          neutrinos, or WINs.

          Title: On the Feasibility of a Stop NLSP in Gravitino Dark
          Matter Scenarios

          Comments: 31 pages, 14 figures
          We analyze the possibility that the lighter stop {\tilde t_1}
          could be the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) in
          models where the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric
          particle (LSP). We do not find any possibility for a stop NLSP
          in the constrained MSSM with universal input soft
          supersymmetry-breaking masses at the GUT scale (CMSSM), but do
          find small allowed regions in models with non-universal Higgs
          masses (NUHM). We discuss the cosmological evolution of stop
          hadrons. Most {\tilde t_1}qq `sbaryons' and the corresponding
          `antisbaryons' annihilate with conventional antibaryons and
          baryons into {\tilde t_1}{\bar q} `mesinos' and the
          corresponding `antimesinos', respectively, shortly after the
          quark-hadron transition in the early Universe, and most mesinos
          and antimesinos subsequently annihilate. As a result,
          insufficient metastable charged stop hadrons survive to alter
          Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

          R. K. Honeycutt
          The secondary photometric standard star #79 for the FS Aur
          field (Henden & Honeycutt 1997) designated as [HH97] FS Aur-79
          (GSC 1874 399) is a short period (0.2508 days) eclipsing binary
          whose light curve is a combination of the $\beta$ Lyr and BY
          Dra type variables. High signal-to-noise multi-color photometry
          were obtained using the USNO 1-m telescope. These light curves
          show asymmetry at quadrature phases (O'Connell effect), which
          can be modeled with the presence of star spots. A low
          resolution spectrum obtained with the 3.5-m WIYN telescope at
          orbital phase 0.76 is consistent with a spectral type of dK7e
          and dM3e. A radial velocity curve for the primary star was
          constructed using twenty-four high resolution spectra from the
          9.2 m HET. Spectra show H-alpha and H-beta in emission
          confirming chromospheric activity and possibly the presence of
          circumstellar material. Binary star models that simultaneously
          fit the U, B, V, R and RV curves are those with a primary star
          of mass 0.59+-0.02 Msun, temperature 4100+-25 K, mean radius of
          0.67 Rsun, just filling its Roche lobe and a secondary star of
          mass 0.31+-0.09 Msun, temperature 3425+-25 K, mean radius of
          0.48 Rsun, just within its Roche lobe. An inclination angle of
          83+-2 degrees with a center of mass separation of 1.62 Rsun is
          also derived. Star spots, expected for a rotation period of
          less than a day, had to be included in the modeling to fit the
          O'Connell effect.

          Hans Bethe contributed in many ways to our understanding of the
          supernovae that happen in massive stars, but, to this day, a
          first principles model of how the explosion is energized is
          lacking. Nevertheless, a quantitative theory of nucleosynthesis
          is possible. We present a survey of the nucleosynthesis that
          occurs in 32 stars of solar metallicity in the mass range 12 to
          120 solar masses. The most recent set of solar abundances,
          opacities, mass loss rates, and current estimates of nuclear
          reaction rates are employed. Restrictions on the mass cut and
          explosion energy of the supernovae based upon nucleosynthesis,
          measured neutron star masses, and light curves are discussed
          and applied. The nucleosynthetic results, when integrated over
          a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), agree quite well with
          what is seen in the sun. We discuss in some detail the
          production of the long lived radioactivities, 26Al and 60Fe,
          and why recent model-based estimates of the ratio 60Fe/26Al are
          overly large compared with what satellites have observed. A
          major source of the discrepancy is the uncertain nuclear cross
          sections for the creation and destruction of these unstable
          isotopes.

          Title: Coherence and Intermittency of Electron Density in
          Small-Scale Interstellar Turbulence
          Authors: P.W. Terry, K.W. Smith
          Comments: 30 pages, 3 figures
          Spatial intermittency in decaying kinetic Alfven wave
          turbulence is investigated to determine if it produces non
          Gaussian density fluctuations in the interstellar medium. Non
          Gaussian density fluctuations have been inferred from pulsar
          scintillation scaling. Kinetic Alfven wave turbulence
          characterizes density evolution in magnetic turbulence at
          scales near the ion gyroradius. It is shown that intense
          localized current filaments in the tail of an initial Gaussian
          probability distribution function possess a sheared magnetic
          field that strongly refracts the random kinetic Alfven waves
          responsible for turbulent decorrelation. The refraction
          localizes turbulence to the filament periphery, hence it avoids
          mixing by the turbulence. As the turbulence decays these
          long-lived filaments create a non Gaussian tail. A condition
          related to the shear of the filament field determines which
          fluctuations become coherent and which decay as random
          fluctuations. The refraction also creates coherent structures
          in electron density. These structures are not localized. The
          density distribution is non Gaussian, but its fourth order
          moment may not differ strongly from the Gaussian value until
          late times when mergers reduce the number of structures.

          Title: Birth Kick Distributions and the Spin-Kick Correlation
          of Young Pulsars
          Authors: C.-Y. Ng, Roger W. Romani
          Comments: 37 pages, 13 figures, ApJ accepted
          Evidence from pulsar wind nebula symmetry axes and radio
          polarization observations suggests that pulsar motions
          correlate with the spin directions. We assemble this evidence
          for young isolated pulsars and show how it can be used to
          quantitatively constrain birth kick scenarios. We illustrate by
          computing several plausible, but idealized, models where the
          momentum thrust is proportional to the neutrino cooling
          luminosity of the proto-neutron star. Our kick simulations
          include the effects of pulsar acceleration and spin-up and our
          maximum likelihood comparison with the data constrains the
          model parameters. The fit to the pulsar spin and velocity
          measurements suggests that: i) the anisotropic momentum
          required amounts to ~10% of the neutrino flux, ii) while a
          pre-kick spin of the star is required, the preferred magnitude
          is small 10-20rad/s, so that for the best-fit models iii) the
          bulk of the spin is kick-induced with $\bar \Omega$ ~120rad/s
          and iv) the models suggest that the anisotropy emerges on a
          timescale $\tau$ ~1-3s.

          Thanks to INTEGRAL's long exposures of the Galactic Plane, the
          two brightest Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters, SGR 1806-20 and SGR
          1900+14, have been monitored and studied in detail for the
          first time at hard-X/soft-gamma rays. SGR 1806-20, lying close
          to the Galactic Centre, and being very active in the past two
          years, has provided a wealth of new INTEGRAL results, which we
          will summarise here: more than 300 short bursts have been
          observed from this source and their characteristics have been
          studied with unprecedented sensitivity in the 15-200 keV range.
          A hardness-intensity anticorrelation within the bursts has been
          discovered and the overall Number-Intensity distribution of the
          bursts has been determined. The increase of its bursting
          activity eventually led to the December 2004 Giant Flare for
          which a possible soft gamma-ray (>80 keV) early afterglow has
          been detected with INTEGRAL. The deep observations allowed us
          to discover the persistent emission in hard X-rays (20-150 keV)
          from 1806-20 and 1900+14, the latter being in quiescent state,
          and to directly compare the spectral characteristics of all
          Magnetars (two SGRs and three Anomalous X-ray Pulsars) detected

          Comments: 10 pages, 1 figure, submitted to ApJ Letters
          We demonstrate that nonlinear decay of obliquely propagating
          Langmuir waves into another Langmuir and Alfven waves is
          possible in a one-dimensional, highly relativistic, streaming,
          pair plasma. Based on this we present a new mechanism of pulsar
          radio emission that involves development and quasilinear
          relaxation of two stream instability, induced scattering of
          generated Langmuir waves by plasma particles and nonlinear
          conversion of Langmuir waves into Alfven waves. It is shown
          that characteristic frequency of generated Alfven waves is much
          less than the plasma frequency and consistent with the
          observational data on pulsar radio emission.

          Pulsar braking indices offer insight into the physics that
          underlies pulsar spin-down. Only five braking indices have been
          measured via phase-coherent timing; all measured values are

          braking indices, obtained with phase-coherent timing for PSRs
          J1846-0258 (n=2.65+/-0.01), B1509-58 (n=2.839+/-0.001) and

          12 Bootis is a spectroscopic binary whose visual orbit has been
          resolved by interferometry. Though the physical parameters of
          the system have been determined with an excellent precision,
          the theoretical modelling of the components is still uncertain.
          We study the capability of solar-like oscillations to
          distinguish between calibrated models of the system obtained by
          including in the stellar modelling different mixing processes.
          We consider different scenarios for the chemical transport
          processes: classical overshooting, microscopic diffusion and
          turbulent mixing. For each of them we calibrate the stellar
          models of 12 Boo A and B by fitting the available observational
          constraints by means of a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization
          algorithm, and finally, we analyze the asteroseismic properties
          of different calibrated models. Several solutions with 12 Boo A
          in (or close to) post-main sequence and 12 Boo B on main
          sequence are found by assuming a thickness of the overshooting
          layer between 0.06 and 0.23 the pressure scale height.
          Solutions with both components on the main sequence can be
          found only by assuming an overshoot larger in the primary than
          in the secondary, or a more efficient central mixing for 12 Boo
          A than for 12 Boo B. We show that the detection of solar-like
          oscillations expected in these stars would allow to distinguish
          between different scenarios and provide therefore an estimation
          of the overshooting parameters and of the properties of
          extra-mixing processes.

          Title: Modeling of Interstellar Scintillation Arcs from Pulsar
          B1133+16
          Authors: Frank S. Trang, Barney J. Rickett
          Comments: 14 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Astrophysical
          Journal
          The parabolic arc phenomenon visible in the Fourier analysis of
          the scintillation spectra of pulsars provides a new method of
          investigating the small scale structure in the ionized
          interstellar medium (ISM). We report archival observations of
          the pulsar B1133+16 showing both forward and reverse parabolic
          arcs sampled over 14 months. These features can be understood
          as the mutual interference between an assembly of discrete
          features in the scattered brightness distribution. By
          model-fitting to the observed arcs at one epoch we obtain a
          ``snap-shot'' estimate of the scattered brightness, which we
          show to be highly anisotropic (axial ratio >10:1), to be
          centered significantly off axis and to have a small number of
          discrete maxima, which are coarser the speckle expected from a
          Kolmogorov spectrum of interstellar plasma density. The results
          suggest the effects of highly localized discrete scattering
          regions which subtend 0.1-1 mas, but can scatter (or refract)
          the radiation by angles that are five or more times larger.

          Title: Evolving to type Ia supernovae with long delay time
          Authors: Wen-Cong Chen, Xiang-Dong Li
          Comments: accepted for publication in ApJ Letters
          Recent investigations on the delay time of type Ia supernovae
          have set useful constraints on the progenitors of type Ia
          supernovae. Here we have calculated the evolution of close
          binaries consisting of a white dwarf and a main-sequence or
          subgiant companion. We assume that, once Roche lobe overflow
          occurs a small fraction of the lost mass from the system forms
          a circumbinary disk, which extracts the orbital angular
          momentum from the system through tidal torques. Our
          calculations indicate that the existence of circumbinary disk
          can enhance the mass transfer rate and cause secular orbital
          shrinkage. The white dwarf can grow in mass efficiently to
          trigger type Ia supernovae even with relatively low-mass ($\la
          2 M_{\odot}$) donor stars. Thus this scenario suggest a new
          possible evolutionary channel to those type Ia supernovae with
          long delay time $\sim 1-3$ Gyr.

          Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We present a detailed analysis of Swift multi-wavelength
          observations of GRB 070110 and its remarkable afterglow. The
          early X-ray light curve, interpreted as the tail of the prompt
          emission, displays a spectral evolution already seen in other
          gamma-ray bursts. The optical afterglow shows a shallow decay
          up to ~2 d after the burst, which is not consistent with
          standard afterglow models. The most intriguing feature is a
          very steep decay in the X-ray flux at ~20 ks after the burst,
          ending an apparent plateau. The abrupt drop of the X-ray light
          curve rules out an external shock as the origin of the plateau
          in this burst and implies long-lasting activity of the central
          engine. The temporal and spectral properties of the plateau
          phase point towards a continuous central engine emission rather
          than the episodic emission of X-ray flares. We suggest that the
          observed X-ray plateau is powered by a spinning down central
          engine, possibly a millisecond pulsar, which dissipates energy
          at an internal radius before depositing energy into the
          external shock.

          Because of the tremendous densities that exist in the cores of
          neutron stars, a significant fraction of the matter in the
          cores of such stars is likely to exist in the form of hyperons.
          Depending on spin frequency, the hyperon content changes
          dramatically in rotating neutron stars, as discussed in this
          paper.

          Authors: R. Oechslin, H.-T. Janka (MPI for Astrophysics,
          Garching, Germany)
          Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to PRL
          We analyze the gravitational wave (GW) emission from our
          recently published set of relativistic neutron star (NS) merger
          simulations and determine characteristic signal features that
          allow one to link GW measurements to the properties of the
          merging binary stars. We find that the distinct peak in the GW
          energy spectrum that is associated with the formation of a
          hypermassive merger remnant has a frequency that depends
          strongly on the properties of the nuclear equation of state
          (EoS) and on the total mass of the binary system, whereas the
          mass ratio and the NS spins have a weak influence. If the total
          mass can be determined from the inspiral chirp signal, the peak
          frequency of the postmerger signal is a sensitive indicator of
          the EoS.

          September 1, 2006
          We study the structure and evolution of neutron stars (NS) the
          interiors of which are modeled using microscopic approaches and
          constrained by the condition that the equation of state (EoS)
          of matter extrapolated to high densities should not contradict
          known observational data from compact stars and experimental
          data from heavy-ion collisions (HIC). We use modern cooling
          simulations to extract distributions of NS masses required to
          reproduce those of the yet sparse data in the Temperature-Age
          (TA) plane. By comparing the results with a mass distribution
          for young, nearby NSs used in population synthesis we can
          sharpen the NS cooling constraints.

          Title: Upper limits on gravitational wave emission from 78
          radio pulsars
          Authors: The LIGO Scientific Collaboration: B. Abbott, et al,
          M. Kramer, A. G. Lyne
          Comments: 21 pages
          We present upper limits on the gravitational wave emission from
          78 radio pulsars based on data from the third and fourth
          science runs of the LIGO and GEO600 gravitational wave
          detectors. The data from both runs have been combined
          coherently to maximise sensitivity. For the first time pulsars
          within binary (or multiple) systems have been included in the
          search by taking into account the signal modulation due to
          their orbits. Our upper limits are therefore the first measured
          for 56 of these pulsars. For the remaining 22, our results
          improve on previous upper limits by up to a factor of 10. For
          example, our tightest upper limit on the gravitational strain
          is 3.2e-25 for PSRJ1603-7202, and the equatorial ellipticity of
          PSRJ2124-3358 is less than 10e-6. Furthermore, our strain upper
          limit for the Crab pulsar is only three times greater than the
          fiducial spin-down limit.

          Comments: 30 pages, 11 figures
          We investigate the correlated predictions of singlet extended
          MSSM models for direct detection of the lightest neutralino
          with its cosmological relic density. To illustrate the general
          effects of the singlet, we take heavy sleptons and squarks. We
          apply LEP, $(g-2)_\mu$ and perturbativity constraints. We find
          that the WMAP upper bound on the cold dark matter density
          limits much of the parameter space to regions where the
          lightest neutralino can be discovered in recoil experiments.
          The results for the NMSSM and UMSSM are typically similar to
          the MSSM since their light neutralinos have similar
          compositions and masses. In the n/sMSSM the neutralino is often
          very light and its recoil detection is within the reach of the
          CDMS II experiment. In general, most points in the parameter
          spaces of the singlet models we consider are accessible to the
          WARP experiment.

          Comments: 38 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to ApJ
          We combine Spitzer and ground-based observations to measure the
          microlens parallax of OGLE-2005-SMC-001, the first space-based
          such determination since Refsdal proposed the idea in 1966. The
          parallax measurement yields a projected velocity \tilde v ~ 230
          km/s, the typical value expected for halo lenses, but an order
          of magnitude smaller than would be expected for lenses lying in
          the Small Magellanic Cloud itself. The lens is a weak (i.e.,
          non-caustic-crossing) binary, which complicates the analysis
          considerably but ultimately contributes additional constraints.
          Using a test proposed by Assef et al. (2006), which makes use
          only of kinematic information about different populations but
          does not make any assumptions about their respective mass
          functions, we find that the likelihood ratio is L_halo/L_SMC =
          20. Hence, halo lenses are strongly favored but SMC lenses are
          not definitively ruled out. Similar Spitzer observations of
          additional lenses toward the Magellanic Clouds would clarify
          the nature of the lens population. The Space Interferometry
          Mission could make even more constraining measurements.

          Comments: 6 pages
          Pulsar emission should primarily come from the magnetic
          separatrix... Combining theory and observations, we show that
          force-free electrodynamics (FFE) gives an accurate description
          of the large-scale electromagnetic field in the magnetospheres
          of Crab-like pulsars. A robust prediction of FFE is the
          existence and stability of a singular current layer on the
          magnetic separatrix. We argue that most of the observed pulsar
          emission comes from this singular current layer.

          The specific characteristic of the SED of serendipitously
          discovered post-AGB binaries, allowed us to launch a very
          extensive multi-wavelength study of evolved objects, selected
          on the basis of very specific selection criteria. Those
          criteria were tuned to discover more stars with circumstellar
          dusty discs. The observational study includes radial velocity
          monitoring, high spectral resolution optical studies, infrared
          spectral dust studies, sub-mm bolometric observations and high
          spatial resolution interferometric experiments with the VLTI.
          In this contribution, we will review the preliminary results of
          this program showing that the binary rate is indeed very high.
          We argue that the formation of a stable circumbinary disc must
          play a lead role in the evolution of the systems.

          Comments and suggestions are welcome
          Many similar phenomena occur in astrophysical systems with
          spatial and mass scales different by many orders of magnitudes.
          For examples, collimated outflows are produced from the Sun,
          proto-stellar systems, gamma-ray bursts, neutron star and black
          hole X-ray binaries, and supermassive black holes; various
          kinds of flares occur from the Sun, stellar coronae, X-ray
          binaries and active galactic nuclei; shocks and particle
          acceleration exist in supernova remnants, gamma-ray bursts,
          clusters of galaxies, etc. In this report I summarize briefly
          these phenomena and possible physical mechanisms responsible
          for them. I emphasize the importance of using the Sun as an
          astrophysical laboratory in studying these physical processes,
          especially the roles magnetic fields play in them; it is quite
          likely that magnetic activities dominate the fundamental
          physical processes in all these systems.
          As a case study, I show that X-ray light curves from solar
          flares, black hole binaries and gamma-ray bursts exhibit a
          common scaling law of non-linear dynamical properties, over a
          dynamical range of several orders of magnitudes in intensities,
          implying that many basic X-ray emission nodes or elements are
          interconnected over multi-scales. A future high timing and
          imaging resolution solar X-ray instrument, aimed at isolating
          and resolving the fundamental elements of solar X-ray
          lightcurves, may shed new lights onto the fundamental physical
          mechanisms, which are common in astrophysical systems with
          vastly different mass and spatial scales. Using the Sun as an
          astrophysical laboratory, "Applied Solar Astrophysics" will
          deepen our understanding of many important astrophysical
          problems.

          This is a call for amateur astronomers who have the equipment
          and experience for producing high quality photometry to
          contribute to a program of finding periods in the optical light
          curves of high mass X-ray binaries (HMXB). HMXBs are binary
          stars in which the lighter star is a neutron star or a black
          hole and the more massive star is an O type supergiant or a Be
          type main sequence star. Matter is transferred from the
          ordinary star to the compact object and X-rays are produced as
          the the gravitational energy of the accreting gas is converted
          into light. HMXBs are very bright, many are brighter than 10th
          magnitude, and so make perfect targets for experienced amateur
          astronomers with photometry capable CCD equipment coupled with
          almost any size telescope.

          Title: Bulk viscosity in kaon condensed matter
          Authors: Debarati Chatterjee, Debades Bandyopadhyay
          Comments: LaTeX, 26 pages, 8 figures
          We investigate the effect of $K^-$ condensed matter on bulk
          viscosity and r-mode instability in neutron stars. The bulk
          viscosity coefficient due to the non-leptonic process $n
          \rightleftharpoons p + K^-$ is studied here. In this connection
          the equation of state is constructed within the framework of
          relativistic field theoretical models where nucleon-nucleon and
          kaon-nucleon interactions are mediated by the exchange of
          scalar and vector mesons. We find that the bulk viscosity
          coefficient due to the non-leptonic weak process in the
          condensate is suppressed by several orders of magnitude.
          Consequently, kaon bulk viscosity may not damp the r-mode
          instability in neutron stars.

          Title: Pre-main sequence spectroscopic binaries suitable for
          VLTI observations

          A severe problem of the research in star-formation is that the
          masses of young stars are almost always estimated only from
          evolutionary tracks. Since the tracks published by different
          groups differ, it is often only possible to give a rough
          estimate of the masses of young stars. It is thus crucial to
          test and calibrate the tracks. Up to now, only a few tests of
          the tracks could be carried out. However, with the VLTI it is
          now possible to set constrains on the tracks by determining the
          masses of many young binary stars precisely. In order to use
          the VLTI efficiently, a first step is to find suitable targets,
          which is the purpose of this work. Given the distance of nearby
          star-forming regions, suitable VLTI targets are binaries with
          orbital periods between at least 50 days, and few years.
          Although a number of surveys for detecting spectroscopic
          binaries have been carried out, most of the binaries found so
          far have periods which are too short. We thus surveyed the
          Chamaeleon, Corona Australis, Lupus, Sco-Cen, rho Ophiuci
          star-forming regions in order to search for spectroscopic
          binaries with periods longer than 50 days, which are suitable
          for the VLTI observations. As a result of the 8 years campaign
          we discovered 8 binaries with orbital periods longer than 50
          days. Amongst the newly discovered long period binaries is CS
          Cha, which is one of the few classical T Tauri stars with a
          circumbinary disk. The survey is limited to objects with masses
          higher than 0.1 to 0.2 Modot for periods between 1 and 8 years.
          We find that the frequency of binaries with orbital periods <
          3000 days is of 20+/-5 percent. The frequency of long and short
          period pre-main sequence spectroscopic binaries is about the
          same as for stars in the solar neighbourhood. In total 14 young
          binaries are now known which are suitable for mass
          determination with the VLTI.

          Title: "Meissner effect" and Blandford-Znajek mechanism in
          conductive black hole magnetospheres
          Authors: S.S.Komissarov, J.C. McKinney
          Comments: Accepted by MNRAS Letters
          The expulsion of axisymmetric magnetic field from the event
          horizons of rapidly rotating black holes has been seen as an
          astrophysically important effect that may significantly reduce
          or even nullify the efficiency of the Blandford-Znajek
          mechanism of powering the relativistic jets in Active Galactic
          Nuclei and Gamma Ray Bursts. However, this Meissner-like effect
          is seen in vacuum solutions of black hole electrodynamics
          whereas the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is concerned with
          plasma-filled magnetospheres. In this paper we argue that
          conductivity dramatically changes the properties of
          axisymmetric electromagnetic solutions -- even for a maximally
          rotating Kerr black hole the magnetic field is pulled inside
          the event horizon. Moreover, the conditions resulting in
          outgoing Poynting flux in the Blandford-Znajek mechanism exist
          not on the event horizon but everywhere within the black hole
          ergosphere. Thus, the Meissner effect is unlikely to be of
          interest in astrophysics of black holes, at least not in the
          way this has been suggested so far. These conclusions are
          supported by the results of time-dependent numerical
          simulations with three different computer codes. The test
          problems involve black holes with the rotation parameter
          ranging from $a=0.999$ to $a=1$. The pure electrodynamic
          simulations deal with the structure of conductive
          magnetospheres of black holes placed in a uniform-at-infinity
          magnetic field (Wald's problem) and the magnetohydrodynamic
          simulations are used to study the magnetospheres arising in the
          problem of disk accretion.

          Title: Entropy & viscosity bound of strange stars
          Authors: Sibasish Laha, Taparati Gangopadhyay, Manjari Bagchi,
          Mira Dey, Jishnu Dey, Monika Sinha, Subharthi Ray
          Comments: 7 pages, 2 figures
          At finite temperature (T) there is a link with general
          relativity and hydrodynamics that leads to a lower bound for
          the ratio of shear viscosity and entropy density (\eta/s). We
          find that the bound is saturated in the simple model for quark
          matter that we use for strange stars at T = 80 MeV, at the
          surface of a strange star. At this T we have the possibility of
          cosmic separation of phases. We find that, although strongly
          correlated, the quark matter at the surface of strange stars
          constitute the most perfect interacting fluid permitted by
          nature. At the centre of the star, however, the density is
          higher and conditions are more like the results found for
          perturbative QCD.

          We present results from an H-alpha monitoring campaign of the
          Be X-ray binary systems HDE 245770 = A 0535+26 and X Per. We
          use the H-alpha equivalent widths together with adopted values
          of the Be star effective temperature, disk inclination, and
          disk outer boundary to determine the half-maximum emission
          radius of the disk as a function of time. The observations of
          HDE 245770 document the rapid spectral variability that
          apparently accompanied the regeneration of a new circumstellar
          disk. This disk grew rapidly during the years 1998 - 2000, but
          then slowed in growth in subsequent years. The outer disk
          radius is probably truncated by resonances between the disk gas
          and neutron star orbital periods. Two recent X-ray outbursts
          appear to coincide with the largest disk half-maximum emission
          radius attained over the last decade. Our observations of X Per
          indicate that its circumstellar disk has recently grown to near
          record proportions, and concurrently the system has
          dramatically increased in X-ray flux, presumably the result of
          enhanced mass accretion from the disk. We find that the H-alpha
          half-maximum emission radius of the disk surrounding X Per
          reached a size about six times larger than the stellar radius,
          a value, however, that is well below the minimum separation
          between the Be star and neutron star. We suggest that spiral
          arms excited by tidal interaction at periastron may help lift
          disk gas out to radii where accretion by the neutron star
          companion becomes more effective.

          Authors: J.E. Horvath (IAG-USP, Sao Paulo U.)
          Comments: 6 pp. 1 .eps figure, to apear in Astrophys. Space Sci
          We address in this work the general features of a possible
          compact stars composed by elementary fermions beyond the quark
          level. The {\it locus} of these hypothetic objects in the
          mass-radius plane is constructed for the maximum mass (minimum
          radius) of the sequence of models in terms of a compositeness
          scale only, and in fact this approach applies for any composite
          model postulating fermions at or beyond the preon level. We
          point out a constraint on the preon mass arising from the
          applicability of the General Relativity structure equations,
          leading to the questioning of the hypothesis of light preons if
          the preon scale is high, provided classical compact objects are
          enforced. Some remarks on the existence of superdense stars of
          astrophysical and primordial origin are made and discussed.

          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          We perform general relativistic simulations of stellar core
          collapse to a proto-neutron star, using a microphysical
          equation of state as well as an approximate description of
          deleptonization. We show that for a wide variety of rotation
          rates and profiles the gravitational wave burst signals from
          the core bounce are of a generic type, known as Type I in the
          literature. In our systematic study, using both general
          relativity and Newtonian gravity, we identify and individually
          quantify the micro- and macrophysical mechanisms leading to
          this result, i.e. the effects of rotation, the equation of
          state, and deleptonization. Such a generic type of signal
          templates will likely facilitate a more efficient search in
          current and future gravitational wave detectors of both
          interferometric and resonant type.

          Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures
          In this work we present a revised measurement of the
          phase-averaged optical polarisation of the Vela pulsar (PSR
          B0833-45), for which only one value has been published so far
          (Wagner & Seifert 2000). Our measurement has been obtained
          through an accurate reanalysis of archival polarisation
          observations obtained with the FORS instrument at the VLT. We
          have measured a phase-averaged linear polarisation degree
          P=9.4% +/- 4% and a position angle 146 +/- 11 deg, very close
          to the ones of the axis of symmetry of the X-ray arcs and jets
          detected by Chandra and of the pulsar proper motion.We have
          compared the measured phase-averaged optical polarisation with
          the expectations of different pulsars' magnetosphere models. We
          have found that all models consistently predict too large
          values of the phase-averaged linear polarization with respect
          to the observed one. This is probably a consequence of present
          models' limitations which neglect the contributions of various
          depolarisation effects. Interestingly, for the outer gap model
          we have found that, assuming synchrotron radiation for the
          optical emission, the observed polarisation position angle also
          implies an alignment between the pulsar rotational axis and the
          axis of symmetry of the X-ray arcs and jets.

          emission lines of the nova-like Cataclysmic Variable V3885 Sgr
          are presented and analyzed. The binary orbital period was
          determined as P = 0.20716071(22) days. Doppler Tomography was
          performed with both H-alpha and He I lines. Disc radial
          emissivity profiles were also computed. The tomography mapping
          of flickering sources was performed using the H-alpha line,
          from which we concluded that the flickering is not uniformly
          distributed on the disc. The observed tomogram of the
          flickering was compared with simulations, suggesting that the
          most intense flickering source in the H-alpha is not located in
          the accretion disc. It is proposed that the main line
          flickering source may be associated with the illuminated
          secondary star.

          Spectra of the stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds from
          cosmic strings are calculated and compared with present and
          future experimental limits. Background spectra are calculated
          numerically for dimensionless string tensions G mu/c^2 between
          10^{-7} and 10^{-18}, and initial loop sizes as a fraction of
          the Hubble radius, alpha, from 0.1 to 10^{-6}. The spectra of
          the cosmic string backgrounds are compared with current
          millisecond pulsar limits and LISA sensitivity curves. For
          models with large stable loops (alpha=0.1), current
          pulsar-timing limits exclude G mu/c^2>10^{-9} and within the
          range of current models based on brane inflation. LISA may
          detect a background from strings as light as G mu/c^2 10^{-16},
          corresponding to field-theory strings formed at roughly 10^{11}

          Comments: 13 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          We present the results of a search for pulsed very-high-energy
          (VHE) gamma-ray emission from young pulsars using data taken
          with the H.E.S.S. imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope
          system. Data on eleven pulsars, selected according to their
          spin-down luminosity relative to distance, are searched for
          gamma-ray signals with periodicity at the respective pulsar
          spin period. Special analysis efforts were made to improve the
          sensitivity in the 100 GeV gamma-ray energy domain in an
          attempt to reduce the gap between satellite and ground-based
          gamma-ray instruments. No significant evidence for pulsed
          emission is found in any data set. Differential upper limits on
          pulsed energy flux are determined for all selected pulsars in
          the approximate gamma-ray energy range between 100 GeV and 50
          TeV, using different limit determination methods, testing a
          wide range of possible pulsar light curves and energy spectra.
          The limits derived here imply that the magnetospheric VHE
          gamma-ray production efficiency in young pulsars is less than
          10^-4 of the pulsar spin-down luminosity, requiring spectral
          turnovers for the high-energy emission of four established
          gamma-ray pulsars, and constrain the inverse Compton radiation
          component predicted by several outer gap models.

          Although there is strong support for the collapsar engine as
          the power source of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), we
          still do not definitively know the progenitor of these
          explosions. Here we review the current set of progenitor
          scenarios for long-duration GRBs and the observational
          constraints on these scenarios. Examining these, we find that
          single-star models cannot be the only progenitor for
          long-duration GRBs. Several binary progenitors can match the
          solid observational constraints and also have the potential to
          match the trends we are currently seeing in the observations.
          Type Ib/c supernovae are also likely to be produced primarily
          in binaries; we discuss the relationship between the
          progenitors of these explosions and those of the long-duration
          GRBs.

          Title: Planets in binary systems: is the present configuration
          indicative of the formation process?
          Authors: F. Marzari, M. Barbieri
          Comments: 5 pages, 5 figures Accepted for publication on A&A
          The present dynamical configuration of planets in binary star
          systems may not reflect their formation process since the
          binary orbit may have changed in the past after the planet
          formation process was completed. An observed binary system may
          have been part of a former hierarchical triple that became
          unstable after the planets completed their growth around the
          primary star. Alternatively, in a dense stellar environment
          even a single stellar encounter between the star pair and a
          singleton may singificantly alter the binary orbit. In both
          cases the planets we observe at present would have formed when
          the dynamical environment was different from the presently
          observed one.
          We have numerically integrated the trajectories of the stars
          (binary plus singleton) and of test planets to investigate the
          abovementioned mechanisms.
          Our simulations show that the circumstellar environment during
          planetary formation around the primary was gravitationally less
          perturbed when the binary was part of a hierarchical triple
          because the binary was necessarely wider and, possibly, less
          eccentric. This circumstance has consequences for the planetary
          system in terms of orbital spacing, eccentricity, and mass of
          the individual planets. Even in the case of a single stellar
          encounter the present appearance of a planetary system in a
          binary may significantly differ from what it had while planet
          formation was ongoing. However, while in the case of
          instability of a triple the trend is always towards a tighter
          and more eccentric binary system, when a single stellar
          encounter affects the system the orbit of the binary can become
          wider and be circularized.

          The recent discovery of a very bright type Ia supernova,
          SNLS-03D3bb ($\equiv$ SN 2003fg), in the Supernova Legacy
          Survey (SNLS) has raised the question of whether
          super-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf stars are needed to
          explain such explosions. In principle, such a progenitor could
          form by the mergers of two rather massive white dwarfs. Binary
          systems of two white dwarfs in close orbit where their total
          mass significantly exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass, have not yet
          been found. Therefore SNLS-03D3bb could establish the first
          clear case of a double-degenerate progenitor of a (peculiar)
          type Ia supernovae. Moreover, if this interpretation is
          correct, it casts some doubt on the universality of the
          calibration relations used to make SNe Ia distance indicators
          for cosmology. Here we present a critical discussion of the
          expected observational finger prints of
          super-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions; in important respects,
          these are not consistent with the observations of SNLS-03D3bb.
          We demonstrate that the lop-sided explosion of a
          Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf could provide a better
          explanation.

          PSR J1744-3922 is a binary pulsar exhibiting highly variable
          pulsed radio emission. We report on a statistical
          multi-frequency study of the pulsed radio flux variability
          which suggests that this phenomenon is extrinsic to the pulsar
          and possibly tied to the companion, although not strongly
          correlated with orbital phase. The pulsar has an unusual
          combination of characteristics compared to typical recycled
          pulsars: a long spin period (172 ms); a relatively high
          magnetic field strength (1.7x10^10 G); a very circular, compact
          orbit of 4.6 hours; and a low-mass companion (0.08 Msun). These
          spin and orbital properties are likely inconsistent with
          standard evolutionary models. We find similarities between the
          properties of the PSR J1744-3922 system and those of several
          other known binary pulsar systems, motivating the
          identification of a new class of binary pulsars. We suggest
          that this new class could result from either: a standard
          accretion scenario of a magnetar or a high-magnetic field
          pulsar; common envelope evolution with a low-mass star and a
          neutron star, similar to what is expected for ultra-compact
          X-ray binaries; or, accretion induced collapse of a white
          dwarf. We also report the detection of a possible K'=19.30(15)
          infrared counterpart at the position of the pulsar, which is
          relatively bright if the companion is a helium white dwarf at
          the nominal distance, and discuss its implications for the
          pulsar's companion and evolutionary history.

          Title: Where the Blue Stragglers Roam: Searching for a Link
          Between Formation and Environment
          Authors: Nathan Leigh, Alison Sills, Christian Knigge
          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures
          The formation of blue stragglers is still not completely
          understood, particularly the relationship between formation
          environment and mechanism. We use a large, homogeneous sample
          of blue stragglers in the cores of 57 globular clusters to
          investigate the relationships between blue straggler
          populations and their environments. We use a consistent
          definition of ``blue straggler'' based on position in the
          color-magnitude diagram, and normalize the population relative
          to the number of red giant branch stars in the core. We find
          that the previously determined anti-correlation between blue
          straggler frequency and total cluster mass is present in the
          purely core population. We find some weak correlations with
          central velocity dispersion and with half-mass relaxation time.
          The blue straggler frequency does not show any trend with any
          other cluster parameter. Even though collisions may be expected
          to be a dominant blue straggler formation process in globular
          cluster cores, we find no correlation between the frequency of
          blue stragglers and the collision rate in the core. We also
          investigated the blue straggler luminosity function shape, and
          found no relationship between any cluster parameter and the
          distribution of blue stragglers in the color-magnitude diagram.
          Our results are inconsistent with some recent models of blue
          straggler formation that include collisional formation
          mechanisms, and may suggest that almost all observed blue
          stragglers are formed in binary systems.

          We present a review on the explanation of the RHIC HBT puzzle
          by a granular pion-emitting source of quark-gluon plasma
          droplets. The evolution of the droplet is described by
          relativistic hydrodynamics with an equation of state suggested
          by lattice gauge results. The granular source evolution is
          obtained by superposing all of the evolutions of individual
          droplets. Pions are assumed to be emitted thermally from the
          droplets at the freeze-out configuration characterized by a
          freeze-out temperature $T_f$. We find that the average particle
          emission time scales with the initial radius of the droplet.
          Pions will be emitted earlier if the droplet radius is smaller.
          An earlier emission time will lead to a smaller extracted HBT
          radius $R_{\rm out}$, while the extracted HBT radius $R_{\rm
          side}$ is determined by the scale of the distribution of the
          droplet centers. However, a collective expansion of the
          droplets can further decrease $R_{\rm out}$. As a result, the
          value of $R_{\rm out}/R_{\rm side}$ can be close to, or even
          less than 1 for the

          Title: Complexity of chaotic fields and standard model
          parameters
          Authors: Christian Beck
          Comments: 27 pages, 7 figures. Invited lectures given at the
          Erice summer school `The Logic of Nature, Complexity and New
          Physics: From Quark-Gluon Plasma to Superstrings, Quantum
          Gravity and Beyond' (Erice, 29 Aug.-7. Sept. 2006)
          In order to understand the parameters of the standard model of
          electroweak and strong interactions (coupling constants,
          masses, mixing angles) one needs to embed the standard model
          into some larger theory that accounts for the observed values.
          This means some additional sector is needed that fixes and
          stabilizes the values of the fundamental constants of nature.
          In these lecture notes we describe in nontechnical terms how
          such a sector can be constructed. Our additional sector is
          based on rapidly fluctuating scalar fields that, although
          completely deterministic, evolve in the strongest possible
          chaotic way and exhibit complex behaviour. These chaotic fields
          generate potentials for moduli fields, which ultimately fix the
          fundamental parameters. The chaotic dynamics can be physically
          interpreted in terms of vacuum fluctuations. These vacuum
          fluctuations are different from those of QED or QCD but coupled
          with the same moduli fields as QED and QCD are. The vacuum
          energy generated by the chaotic fields underlies the currently
          observed dark energy of the universe. Our theory correctly
          predicts the numerical values of the electroweak and strong
          coupling constants using a simple principle, the minimization
          of vacuum energy. Implementing some additional discrete
          symmetry assumptions one also obtains predictions for fermion
          masses, as well as a Higgs mass prediction of 154 GeV.

          We present for the first time the nonlinear dynamics of quantum
          electrodynamic (QED) photon splitting in a strongly magnetized
          electron-positron (pair) plasma. By using a QED corrected
          Maxwell equation, we derive a set of equations that exhibit
          nonlinear couplings between electromagnetic (EM) waves due to
          nonlinear plasma currents and QED polarization and
          magnetization effects. Numerical analyses of our coupled
          nonlinear EM wave equations reveal the possibility of a more
          efficient decay channel, as well as new features of energy
          exchange among the three EM modes that are nonlinearly
          interacting in magnetized pair plasmas. Possible applications
          of our investigation to astrophysical settings, such as
          magnetars, are pointed out.

          We present polarization observations of the radio emitting
          magnetar AXP J1810-197. Using simultaneous multi-frequency
          observations performed at 1.4, 4.9 and 8.4 GHz, we obtained
          polarization information for single pulses and the average
          pulse profile at several epochs. We find that in several
          respects this magnetar source shows similarities to the
          emission properties of normal radio pulsars while
          simultaneously showing striking differences. The emission is
          nearly 80-95% polarized, often with a low but significant
          degree of circular polarization at all frequencies which can be
          much greater in selected single pulses. The position angle
          swing has a low average slope of only 1 deg/deg, deviating
          significantly from an S-like swing as often seen in radio
          pulsars which is usually interpreted in terms of a rotating
          vector model and a dipolar magnetic field. The observed
          position angle is consistent at all frequencies while showing
          significant secular variations. On average the interpulse is
          less linearly polarized but shows a higher degree of circular
          polarization. Some epochs reveal the existence of
          non-orthogonal emission modes in the main pulse and systematic
          wiggles in the PA swing, while the interpulse shows a large
          variety of position angle values. We interprete many of the
          emission properties as propagation effects in a non-dipolar
          magnetic field configuration where emission from different
          multipole components is observed.

          We present an analysis of the variations seen in the dispersion
          measures (DMs) of 20 millisecond pulsars observed as part of
          the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project. We carry out a
          statistically rigorous structure function analysis for each
          pulsar and show that the variations seen for most pulsars are
          consistent with those expected for an interstellar medium
          characterised by a Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum. The
          structure functions for PSRs J1045-4509 and J1909-3744 provide
          the first clear evidence for a large inner scale, possibly due
          to ion-neutral damping. We also show the effect of the solar
          wind on the DMs and show that the simple models presently
          implemented into pulsar timing packages cannot reliably correct
          for this effect. For the first time we clearly show how DM
          variations affect pulsar timing residuals and how they can be
          corrected in order to obtain the highest possible timing
          precision. Even with our presently limited data span, the
          residuals (and all parameters derived from the timing) for six
          of our pulsars have been significantly improved by correcting
          for the DM variations.

          Comments: 6 figures, AASTEX style, accepted for publication in
          ApJ
          We present the results of high resolution spectroscopy of the
          prototype polar AM Herculis observed with Chandra High Energy
          Transmission Grating. The X-ray spectrum contains hydrogen-like
          and helium-like lines of Fe, S, Si, Mg, Ne and O with several
          Fe L-shell emission lines. The forbidden lines in the spectrum
          are generally weak whereas the hydrogen-like lines are stronger
          suggesting that emission from a multi-temperature,
          collisionally ionized plasma dominates. The helium-like line
          flux ratios yield a plasma temperature of 2 MK and a plasma
          density 1 - 9 x10^12 cm^-3, whereas the line flux ratio of Fe
          XXVI to Fe XXV gives an ionization temperature of 12.4 +1.1
          -1.4 keV. We present the differential emission measure
          distribution of AM Her whose shape is consistent with the
          volume emission measure obtained by multi-temperature APEC
          model. The multi-temperature plasma model fit to the average
          X-ray spectrum indicates the mass of the white dwarf to be
          ~1.15 M_sun. From phase resolved spectroscopy, we find the line
          centers of Mg XII, S XVI, resonance line of Fe XXV, and Fe XXVI
          emission modulated by a few hundred to 1000 km/s from the
          theoretically expected values indicating bulk motion of ionized
          matter in the accretion column of AM Her. The observed
          velocities of Fe XXVI ions are close to the expected shock
          velocity for a 0.6 M_sun white dwarf. The observed velocity
          modulation is consistent with that expected from a single pole
          accreting binary system.

          Parameter Determination with SUSI
          Authors: J.R. North, P.G. Tuthill, W.J. Tango, J. Davis
          Comments: 3 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          The first complete orbital solution for the double-lined
          spectroscopic binary system \gamma^2 Velorum, obtained from
          measurements with the Sydney University Stellar Interferometer
          (SUSI), is presented. This system contains the closest example
          of a Wolf-Rayet star and the promise of full characterisation
          of the basic properties of this exotic high-mass system has
          subjected it to intense study as an archetype for its class. In
          combination with the latest radial-velocity results, our
          orbital solution produces a distance of 336^{+8}_{-7} pc,
          significantly more distant than the Hipparcos estimation
          (Schaerer et al. 1997; van der Hucht 1997). The ability to
          fully specify the orbital parameters has enabled us to
          significantly reduce uncertainties and our result is consistent
          with the VLTI observational point (Millour et al. 2006), but
          not with their derived distance. Our new distance, which is an
          order of magnitude more precise than prior work, demands
          critical reassessment of all distance-dependent fundamental
          parameters of this important system. In particular, membership
          of the Vela OB2 association has been reestablished, and the age
          and distance are also in good accord with the population of
          young stars reported by Pozzo et al. (2000). We determine the
          O-star primary component parameters to be M_V(O) = -5.63 \pm
          0.10 mag, R(O) = 17 \pm 2 R_{\sun} and {\cal M}(O) = 28.5 \pm
          1.1 M_{\sun}. These values are consistent with calibrations
          found in the literature if a luminosity class of II--III is
          adopted. The parameters of the Wolf-Rayet component are M_v(WR)
          = -4.33 \pm 0.17 mag and {\cal M}(WR) = 9.0 \pm 0.6 M_{\sun}.

          animations and full resolution figures. Submitted to the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We present numerical simulations of dynamically unstable mass
          transfer in a double white dwarf binary with initial mass
          ratio, q = 0.4. The binary components are approximated as
          polytropes of index n = 3/2 and the initially synchronously
          rotating, semi-detached equilibrium binary is evolved
          hydrodynamically with the gravitational potential being
          computed through the solution of Poisson's equation. Upon
          initiating deep contact, in our baseline simulation the mass
          transfer rate grows by more than an order of magnitude over
          approximately ten orbits, as would be expected for dynamically
          unstable mass transfer. However, the mass transfer rate then
          reaches a peak value, the binary expands and the mass transfer
          event subsides. The binary must therefore have crossed the
          critical mass ratio for stability against dynamical mass
          transfer. Despite the initial loss of orbital angular momentum
          into the spin of the accreting star, we find that the
          accretor's spin saturates and angular momentum is returned to
          the orbit more efficiently than has been previously suspected
          for binaries in the direct impact accretion mode. To explore
          this surprising result, we directly measure the critical mass
          ratio for stability by imposing artificial angular momentum
          loss at various rates to drive the binary to an equilibrium
          mass transfer rate. For one of these driven evolutions, we
          attain equilibrium mass transfer and deduce that effectively
          q_crit has evolved to approximately 2/3. This is consistent
          with the result for mass transferring binaries that effectively
          return angular momentum to the orbit through an accretion disk,
          although no such disk appears in our simulations.

          Title: Modelling the Radio Light Curve of Eta Carinae
          Authors: Amit Kashi, Noam Soker (Technion, Israel)
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS
          We study the propagation of the ionizing radiation emitted by
          the secondary star in Eta Carinae. We find that a large
          fraction of this radiation is absorbed by the primary stellar
          wind, mainly after it encounters the secondary wind and passes
          through a shock wave. The amount of absorption depends on the
          compression factor of the primary wind in the shock wave. We
          build a model where the compression factor is limited by the
          magnetic pressure in the primary wind. We find that the
          variation of the absorption by the post-shock primary wind with
          orbital phase changes the ionization structure of the
          circumbinary gas and can account for the radio light curve of
          Eta Car. Fast variations near periastron passage are attributed
          to the onset of the accretion phase.

          We report the discovery of a remarkable subpulse drift pattern
          in the relatively less studied wide profile pulsar, B0818-41,
          using high sensitivity GMRT observations. We find simultaneous
          occurrence of three drift regions with two different drift
          rates: an inner region with steeper apparent drift rate flanked
          on each side by a region of slower apparent drift rate.
          Furthermore, these closely spaced drift bands always maintain a
          constant phase relationship. Though these drift regions have
          significantly different values for the measured P2, the
          measured P3 value is the same and equal to 18.3 P1. We
          interpret the unique drift pattern of this pulsar as being
          created by the intersection of our line of sight (LOS) with two
          conal rings on the polar cap of a fairly aligned rotator
          (inclination angle alpha ~ 11 deg), with an ``inner'' LOS
          geometry (impact angle beta ~ -5.4 deg). We argue that both the
          rings have the same values for the carousel rotation
          periodicity P4 and the number of sparks Nsp. We find that Nsp
          is 19-21 and show that it is very likely that, P4 is the same
          as the measured P3, making it a truly unique pulsar. We present
          results from simulations of the radiation pattern using the
          inferred parameters, that support our interpretations and
          reproduce the average profile as well as the observed features
          in the drift pattern quite well.

          Title: First detection of phase-dependent colliding wind X-ray
          emission outside the Milky Way

          After having reported the detection of X-rays emitted by the
          peculiar system HD5980, we assess here the origin of this
          high-energy emission from additional X-ray observations
          obtained with XMM-Newton. This research provides the first
          detection of apparently periodic X-ray emission from hot gas
          produced by the collision of winds in an evolved massive binary
          outside the Milky Way. It also provides the first X-ray
          monitoring of a Luminous Blue Variable only years after its
          eruption and shows that the dominant source of the X-rays is
          not associated with the ejecta.

          Title: Importance of Compton scattering for radiation spectra
          of isolated neutron stars with weak magnetic fields

          Emergent model spectra of neutron star atmospheres are widely
          used to fit the observed soft X-ray spectra of different types
          of isolated neutron stars. We investigate the effect of Compton
          scattering on the emergent spectra of hot (T_eff > 10^6 K)
          isolated neutron stars with weak magnetic fields. In order to
          compute model atmospheres in hydrostatic and radiative
          equilibrium we solve the radiation transfer equation with the
          Kompaneets operator. We calculate a set of models with
          effective temperatures in the range 1 - 5 * 10^6 K, with two
          values of surface gravity (log g = 13.9 and 14.3) and different
          chemical compositions. Radiation spectra computed with Compton
          scattering are softer than those computed without Compton
          scattering at high energies (E > 5 keV) for light elements (H
          or He) model atmospheres. The Compton effect is more
          significant in H model atmospheres and models with low surface
          gravity. The emergent spectra of the hottest (T_eff > 3 * 10^6
          K) model atmospheres can be described by diluted blackbody
          spectra with hardness factors ~ 1.6 - 1.9. Compton scattering
          is less important in models with solar abundance of heavy
          elements.

          We have performed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the
          collapse and fragmentation of molecular cloud cores using a new
          algorithm for MHD within the smoothed particle hydrodynamics
          (SPH) method, that enforces the zero magnetic divergence
          constraint. We find that the support provided by magnetic
          fields over thermal pressure alone has several important
          effects on fragmentation and the formation of binary and
          multiple systems, and on the properties of massive
          circumstellar discs. The extra support suppresses the tendency
          of molecular cloud cores to fragment due to either initial
          density perturbations or disc fragmentation. Furthermore,
          unlike most previous studies, we find that magnetic pressure
          plays the dominant role in inhibiting fragmentation rather than
          magnetic tension or magnetic braking. In particular, we find
          that if the magnetic field is aligned with the rotation axis of
          the molecular cloud core, the effects of the magnetic field on
          fragmentation and disc structure are almost entirely due to
          magnetic pressure, while if the rotation axis is initially
          perpendicular to the magnetic field, magnetic tension plays a
          greater role and can actually aid fragmentation. Despite these
          effects, and contrary to several past studies, we find that
          strongly-perturbed molecular cloud cores are able to fragment
          to form wide binary systems even in the presence of quite
          strong magnetic fields. For massive circumstellar discs, we
          find that slowing of the collapse caused by the magnetic
          support decreases the mass infall rate on to the disc and,
          thus, weakens gravitational instabilities in young massive
          circumstellar discs. This not only reduces the likelihood that
          they will fragment, but also decreases the importance of spiral
          density waves in providing angular momentum transport and in
          promoting planet formation.

          Title: Experimental measurements of the O15(alpha,gamma)Ne19
          reaction rate vs. observations of type I X-ray bursts

          Neutron stars in close binary star systems often accrete matter
          from their companion stars. Thermonuclear ignition of the
          accreted material in the atmosphere of the neutron star leads
          to a thermonuclear explosion which is observed as an X-ray
          burst occurring periodically between hours and days depending
          on the accretion rate. The ignition conditions are
          characterized by a sensitive interplay between the continuously
          accreting fuel supply and depletion by nuclear burning via the
          hot CNO cycles. Therefore the ignition depends critically on
          the hot CNO breakout reaction O15(alpha,gamma)Ne19 that
          regulates the flow between the beta-limited hot CNO cycle and
          the rapid proton capture process. Until recently, the
          O15(alpha,gamma)Ne19 reaction rate was not known experimentally
          and the theoretical estimates carried significant
          uncertainties. In this paper we report on the astrophysical
          consequences of the first measurement of this reaction rate on
          the thermonuclear instability that leads to type I X-ray bursts
          on accreting neutron stars.

          Title: A choreographic solution to the general relativistic
          three-body problem
          Authors: Tatsunori Imai, Takamasa Chiba, Hideki Asada
          Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures
          We revisit the three-body problem in the framework of general
          relativity. The Newtonian N-body problem admits choreographic
          solutions, where a solution is called choreographic if every
          massive particles move periodically in a single closed orbit.
          One is a stable figure-eight orbit of a three-body system,
          which was found first by Moore (1993) and re-discovered with
          its existence proof by Chenciner and Montgomery (2000), In
          general relativity, however, the periastron shift prohibits a
          binary system from orbiting in a closed curve. Therefore, it is
          unclear whether general relativistic effects admit a
          choreographic solution such as the figure-eight. We carefully
          examine general relativistic corrections to initial conditions
          so that an orbit to a three-body system can be closed in a
          figure-eight. This solution is still choreographic without
          causing periastron shift. This illustration suggests that the
          general relativistic N-body problem also may admit a certain
          class of choreographic solutions.

          Title: Effect of the Coriolis Force on the Hydrodynamics of
          Colliding Wind Binaries
          Authors: M. Nicole Lemaster, James M. Stone, Thomas A. Gardiner
          Comments: 12 pages, 17 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          Using fully three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we
          investigate the effect of the Coriolis force on the
          hydrodynamic and observable properties of colliding wind binary
          systems. To make the calculations tractable, we assume
          adiabatic, constant velocity winds. The neglect of radiative
          driving, gravitational deceleration, and cooling limit the
          application of our models to real systems. However, these
          assumptions allow us to isolate the effect of the Coriolis
          force, and by simplifying the calculations, allow us to use a
          higher resolution (up to 640^3) and to conduct a larger survey
          of parameter space. We study the dynamics of collidng winds
          with equal mass loss rates and velocities emanating from equal
          mass stars on circular orbits, with a range of values for the
          ratio of the wind to orbital velocity. We also study the
          dynamics of winds from stars on elliptical orbits and with
          unequal strength winds. Orbital motion of the stars sweeps the
          shocked wind gas into an Archimedean spiral, with asymmetric
          shock strengths and therefore unequal postshock temperatures
          and densities in the leading and trailing edges of the spiral.
          We observe the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the contact
          surface between the shocked winds in systems with orbital
          motion even when the winds are identical. The change in shock
          strengths caused by orbital motion increases the volume of
          X-ray emitting post-shock gas with T > 0.59 keV by 63% for a
          typical system as the ratio of wind velocity to orbital
          velocity decreases to V_w/V_o = 2.5. This causes increased
          free-free emission from systems with shorter orbital periods
          and an altered time-dependence of the wind attenuation. We
          comment on the importance of the effects of orbital motion on
          the observable properties of colliding wind binaries.

          Title: Thermal emission from isolated neutron stars:
          theoretical and observational aspects
          Authors: Vyacheslav E. Zavlin
          Comments: Review lecture given at the 363-rd Heraeus Seminar on
          Neutron Stars and Pulsars held on May 14-19, 2006 in Bad Honnef

          The possibility for direct investigation of thermal emission
          from isolated neutron stars was opened about 25 years ago with
          the launch of the first X-ray observatory, Einstein. A
          significant contribution to this study was provided by ROSAT in
          1990's. The outstanding capabilities of the currently operating
          observatories, Chandra and XMM-Newton, have greatly increased
          the potential to observe and analyze thermal radiation from the
          neutron star surfaces. Confronting observational data with
          theoretical models of thermal emission, presumably formed in
          neutron star atmospheres, allows one to infer the surface
          temperatures, magnetic fields, chemical composition, and
          neutron star masses and radii. This information, supplemented
          with model equations of state and neutron star cooling models,
          provides an opportunity to understand the fundamental
          properties of the superdense matter in the neutron star
          interiors. I review the current status and most important
          results obtained from modeling neutron star thermal emission
          and present selected Chandra and XMM-Newton results on thermal
          radiation from various types of these objects: ordinary radio
          pulsars with ages ranging from about 2 kyr to 20 Myr
          (J1119-6127, Vela, B1706-44, J0538+2817, B2334+61, B0656+14,
          B1055-52, Geminga, B0950+08, J2043+2740), millisecond pulsars
          (J0030+0451, J2124-3358, J1024-0719, J0437-4715), putative
          pulsars (CXOU J061705.3+222127, RX J0007.0+7302), central
          compact objects in supernova remnats (in particular, 1E

          The components of the wide binary HIP64030=HD 113984 show a
          large (about 0.25 dex) iron content difference (Desidera et
          al.~2006 A&A 454, 581). The positions of the components on the
          color magnitude diagram suggest that the primary is a blue
          straggler. We studied the abundance difference of several
          elements besides iron, and we searched for stellar and
          substellar companions around the components to unveil the
          origin of the observed iron difference. A line-by-line
          differential abundance analysis for several elements was
          performed, while suitable spectral synthesis was performed for
          C, N, and Li. High precision radial velocities obtained with
          the iodine cell were combined with available literature data.
          The analysis of additional elements shows that the abundance
          difference for the elements studied increases with increasing
          condensation temperature, suggesting that accretion of
          chemically fractionated material might have occurred in the
          system. Alteration of C and N likely due to CNO processing is
          also observed. We also show that the primary is a spectroscopic
          binary with a period of 445 days and moderate eccentricity. The
          minimum mass of the companion is 0.17 Msun. Two scenarios were
          explored to explain the observed abundance pattern. In the
          first, all abundance anomalies arise on the blue straggler. If
          this is the case, the dust-gas separation may have been
          occurred in a circumbinary disk around the blue straggler and
          its expected white dwarf companion, as observed in several RV
          Tauri and post AGB binaries. In the second scenario, accretion
          of dust-rich material occurred on the secondary. This would
          also explain the anomalous carbon isotopic ratio of the
          secondary. Such a scenario requires that a substantial amount
          of mass lost by the central binary has been accreted by the
          wide component.

          Dispersion Measure

          Comments: 14 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables, to be published in
          MNRAS
          In an earlier paper (Ahuja, et al, 2005), based on simultaneous
          multi-frequency observations with the Giant Metrewave Radio
          Telescope (GMRT), we reported the variation of pulsar
          dispersion measures (DMs) with frequency. A few different
          explanations are possible for such frequency dependence, and a
          possible candidate is the effect of pulse shape evolution on
          the DM estimation technique. In this paper we describe
          extensive simulations we have done to investigate the effect of
          pulse profile evolution on pulsar DM estimates. We find that it
          is only for asymmetric pulse shapes that the DM estimate is
          significantly affected due to profile evolution with frequency.
          Using multi-frequency data sets from our earlier observations,
          we have carried out systematic analyses of PSR B0329+54 and PSR
          B1642-03. Both these pulsars have central core dominated
          emission which does not show significant asymmetric profile
          evolution with frequency. Even so, we find that the estimated
          DM shows significant variation with frequency for these
          pulsars. We also report results from new, simultaneous
          multi-frequency observations of PSR B1133+16 carried out using
          the GMRT in phased array mode. This pulsar has an asymmetric
          pulse profile with significant evolution with frequency. We
          show that in such a case, amplitude of the observed DM
          variations can be attributed to profile evolution with
          frequency. We suggest that genuine DM variations with frequency
          could arise due to propagation effects through the interstellar
          medium and/or the pulsar magnetosphere.

          Title: GRB Precursors in the Fallback Collapsar Scenario
          Authors: Xiang-Yu Wang, Peter Meszaros
          Comments: 6 pages, submitted to ApJ
          Precursor emission has been observed in a non-negligible
          fraction of gamma-ray bursts, the time gap between the
          precursor and the main burst extending up to hundreds of
          seconds in some cases, such as in GRB041219A, GRB050820A and
          GRB060124. We have investigated the maximum possible time gaps
          arising from the jet propagation inside the progenitor star, in
          models which assume that the precursor is produced by the jet
          bow shock or the cocoon breaking out of the progenitor. Due to
          the pressure drop ahead of the jet head after it reaches the
          stellar surface, a rarefaction wave propagates back into the
          jet at the sound speed, which re-accelerates the jet to a
          relativistic velocity and therefore limits the gap period to
          within about ten seconds. This scenario therefore cannot
          explain gaps which are hundreds of seconds long. Instead, we
          ascribe such long time gaps to the behavior of the central
          engine, and suggest a fallback collapsar scenario for these
          bursts. In this scenario, the precursor is produced by a weak
          jet formed during the initial core collapse, possibly related
          to MHD process associated with a short-lived proto-neutron
          star, while the main burst is produced by a stronger jet fed by
          the fallback disk accreting onto the black hole resulting from
          the collapse of the neutron star. We have examined the
          propagation times of the weak precursor jet through the stellar
          progenitor. We find that the initial weak jet can break out of
          the progenitor in a time less than ten seconds provided that it
          has a moderately high relativistic Lorentz factor (Gamma>10).
          The longer time gap following this is dictated by the fall-back
          timescale, which is long enough for the exit channel to close
          after the precursor activity ceases, allowing for the
          collimation of the main jet by the cocoon pressure as it
          propagates outward.

          Title: Energy dependent ~100 \mu s time lags as observational
          evidence of Comptonization effects in the neutron star plasma
          environment
          Authors: Maurizio Falanga, Lev Titarchuk
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, ApJ accepted
          We present a Comptonization model for the observed properties
          of the energy-dependent soft/hard time lags and pulsed fraction
          (amplitude) associated with the pulsed emission of a neutron
          star (NS). We account for the soft lags by downscattering of
          hard X-ray photons in the relatively cold plasma of the disk or
          NS surface. A fraction of the soft X-ray photons coming from
          the disk or NS surface upscatter off hot electrons in the
          accretion column. This effect leads to hard lags as a result of
          thermal Comptonization of the soft photons. This model
          reproduces the observed soft and hard lags due to the down- and
          upscattered radiation as a function of the electron number
          densities of the reflector, n_{e}^{ref}, and the accretion
          column, n_{e}^{hot}. In the case of the accretion-powered
          millisecond pulsars IGR J00291+5934, XTE J1751-305, and SAX
          J1808.4-3658, the observed time lags agree well with the model.
          Soft lags are observed only if n_e^{ref} << n_e^{hot}.
          Scattering of the pulsed emission in the NS environment may
          account for the observed time lags as a non-monotonic function
          of energy. The time lag measurements can be used as a probe of
          the innermost parts of the NS and accretion disk. We determine
          the upper and lower limits of the density variation in this
          region using the observed time lags. The observed
          energy-dependent pulsed amplitude allows us to infer a
          variation of the Thomson optical depth of the Compton cloud in
          which the accretion column is embedded.

          Title: Accreting X-ray millisecond pulsars observed with
          INTEGRAL
          Authors: Maurizio Falanga
          Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication
          in ESA SP-622. Proceeding of the 6th INTEGRAL Workshop, July
          3-7, 2006 Moscow, Russia
          I review the properties of three X-ray accreting millisecond
          pulsars observed with INTEGRAL. Out of seven recently
          discovered accretion-powered pulsars (one discovered by
          INTEGRAL), three were observed with the INTEGRAL satellite up
          to 300 keV. Detailed timing and spectral results will be
          presented, including data obtained during the most recent
          outburst of the pulsar HETE J1900.1-2455. Accreting X-ray
          millisecond pulsars are key systems to understand the spin and
          accretion history of neutron stars. They are also a good
          laboratory in which to study the source spectra, pulse profile,
          and phase shift between X-ray pulses in different energy ranges
          which give additional information of the X-ray production
          processes and emission environment.

          Title: Visual/infrared interferometry of Orion Trapezium stars:
          Preliminary dynamical orbit and aperture synthesis imaging of
          the Theta 1 Orionis C system

          Astronomy & Astrophysics
          Located in the Orion Trapezium cluster, Theta 1 Orionis C is
          one of the youngest and nearest high-mass stars (O5-O7) and
          also known to be a close binary system. Using new multi-epoch
          visual and near-infrared bispectrum speckle interferometric
          observations obtained at the BTA 6 m telescope, and IOTA
          near-infrared long-baseline interferometry, we trace the
          orbital motion of the Theta 1 Ori C components over the
          interval 1997.8 to 2005.9, covering a significant arc of the
          orbit. Besides fitting the relative position and the flux
          ratio, we apply aperture synthesis techniques to our IOTA data
          to reconstruct a model-independent image of the Theta 1 Ori C
          binary system.
          The orbital solutions suggest a high eccentricity (e approx.
          0.91) and short-period (P approx. 10.9 yrs) orbit. As the
          current astrometric data only allows rather weak constraints on
          the total dynamical mass, we present the two best-fit orbits.
          From these orbital solutions one can be favoured, implying a
          system mass of 48 M_sun and a distance to the Trapezium cluster
          of 434 pc. When also taking the measured flux ratio and the
          derived location in the HR-diagram into account, we find good
          agreement for all observables, assuming a spectral type of O5.5
          for Theta 1 Ori C1 (M=34.0 M_sun) and O9.5 for C2 (M=15.5
          M_sun).
          We find indications that the companion C2 is massive itself,
          which makes it likely that its contribution to the intense UV
          radiation field of the Trapezium cluster is non-negligible.
          Furthermore, the high eccentricity of the preliminary orbit
          solution predicts a very small physical separation during
          periastron passage (approx. 1.5 AU, next passage around
          2007.5), suggesting strong wind-wind interaction between the
          two O stars.

          Title: Application of the Probability Event Horizon filter to
          constrain the local rate density of binary black hole inspirals
          with Advanced LIGO
          Authors: E. Howell, D. Coward, R. Burman, D. Blair
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          The temporal evolution of the gravitational wave background
          signal resulting from stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH)
          inspirals has a unique statistical signature. We describe the
          application of a new filter, based on the `probability event
          horizon' (PEH) concept, that utilizes both the temporal and
          spatial source distribution to constrain the local rate
          density, $r_{0}$, of BBH inspiral events in the nearby
          Universe. Assuming Advanced LIGO sensitivities and an upper
          rate of Galactic BBH inspirals of $
          30\hspace{1mm}\mathrm{Myr}^{-1}$, we simulate GW data and apply
          a fitting procedure to the PEH filtered data. To determine the
          accuracy of the PEH filter in constraining $r_{0}$, a
          comparison is made with a fit to the brightness distribution of
          events. We apply both methods to a data stream containing a
          background of Gaussian distributed false alarms. We find that
          the brightness distribution yields lower standard errors, but
          is biased by the false alarms. In comparison the PEH method is
          less prone to errors resulting from false alarms but has a
          lower resolution as fewer events contribute to the data. Used
          in combination, the PEH and brightness distribution methods
          provide an improved estimate of the rate density.

          "Il Nuovo Cimento"
          The connection between the long Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) and
          Type Ic Supernovae (SNe) has revealed interesting diversity. We
          review the following types of the GRB-SN connection. (1)
          GRB-SNe: The three SNe all explode with energies much larger
          than those of typical SNe, thus being called Hypernovae (HNe).
          They are massive enough for forming black holes. (2) Non-GRB
          HNe/SNe: Some HNe are not associated with GRBs. (3) XRF-SN: SN
          2006aj associated with X-Ray Flash 060218 is dimmer than
          GRB-SNe and has very weak oxygen lines. Its progenitor mass is
          estimated to be small enough to form a neutron star rather than
          a black hole. (4) Non-SN GRB: Two nearby long GRBs were not
          associated SNe. Such ``dark HNe'' have been predicted in this
          talk (i.e., just before the discoveries) in order to explain
          the origin of C-rich (hyper) metal-poor stars. This would be an
          important confirmation of the Hypernova-First Star connection.
          We will show our attempt to explain the diversity in a unified
          manner with the jet-induced explosion model.

          Title: Effects of QCD phase transition on gravitational
          radiation from two-dimensional collapse and bounce of massive
          stars
          Authors: Nobutoshi Yasutake, Kei Kotake, Masa-aki Hashimoto,
          Shoichi Yamada
          Comments: 12 pages, 12 figures. Resubmitted to Phys.Rev.D
          We perform two-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamical core-collapse
          simulations of massive stars accompanying the QCD phase
          transition. We study how the phase transition affects the
          gravitational waveforms near the epoch of core-bounce. As for
          initial models, we change the strength of rotation and magnetic
          fields. Particularly, the degree of differential rotation in
          the iron core (Fe-core) is changed parametrically. As for the
          microphysics, we adopt a phenomenological equation of state
          above the nuclear density, including two parameters to change
          the hardness before the transition. We assume the first order
          phase transition, where the conversion of bulk nuclear matter
          to a chirally symmetric quark-gluon phase is described by the
          MIT bag model. Based on these computations, we find that the
          phase transition can make the maximum amplitudes larger up to
          $\sim$ 10 percents than the ones without the phase transition.
          On the other hand, the maximum amplitudes become smaller up to
          $\sim$ 10 percents owing to the phase transition, when the
          degree of the differential rotation becomes larger. We find
          that even extremely strong magnetic fields $\sim 10^{17}$ G in
          the protoneutron star do not affect these results.

          IGR J18483-0311 is a poorly known transient hard X-ray source
          discovered by INTEGRAL during observations of the Galactic
          Center region performed between 23--28 April 2003. Aims: To
          detect new outbursts from IGR J18483-0311 using INTEGRAL and
          archival Swift XRT observations and finally to characterize the
          nature of this source using the optical/near-infrared (NIR)
          information available through catalogue searches. Results: We
          report on 5 newly discovered outbursts from IGR J18483-0311
          detected by INTEGRAL.For two of them it was possible to
          constrain a duration of the order of a few days. The strongest
          outburst reached a peak flux of 120 mCrab (20--100 keV): its
          broad band JEM--X/ISGRI spectrum (3--50 keV) is best fitted by
          an absorbed cutoff power law with photon index=1.4+/-0.3,
          cutoff energy of ~22 keV and Nh ~9x10^22 cm^-2. Timing analysis
          of INTEGRAL data allowed us to identify periodicities of 18.52
          days and 21.0526 seconds which are likely the orbital period of
          the system and the spin period of the X-ray pulsar
          respectively. Swift XRT observations of IGR J18483$-$0311
          provided a very accurate source position which strongly
          indicates a highly reddened star in the USNO--B1.0 and 2MASS
          catalogues as its possible optical/NIR counterpart.
          Conclusions: The X-ray spectral shape, the periods of 18.52
          days and 21.0526 seconds, the high intrinsic absorption, the
          location in the direction of the Scutum spiral arm and the
          highly reddened optical object as possible counterpart, all
          favour the hypothesis that IGR J18483-0311 is a HMXB with a
          neutron star as compact companion. The system is most likely a
          Be X-ray binary, but a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient nature
          can not be entirely excluded.

          energy in Her X-1

          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, accepted by A&A Letters
          We present the results of ten years of repeated measurements of
          the Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature (CRSF) in the
          spectrum of the binary X-ray pulsar Her X-1 and report the
          discovery of a positive correlation of the centroid energy of
          this absorption feature in pulse phase averaged spectra with
          source luminosity.Our results are based on a uniform analysis
          of observations bythe RXTE satellite from 1996 to 2005, using
          sufficiently long observations of 12 individual 35-day Main-On
          states of the source. The mean centroid energy E_c of the CRSF
          in pulse phase averaged spectra of Her X-1 during this time is
          around 40 keV, with significant variations from one Main-On
          state to the next. We find that the centroid energy of the CRSF
          in Her X-1 changes by ~5% in energy for a factor of 2 in
          luminosity. The correlation is positive, contrary to what is
          observed in some high luminosity transient pulsars. Our finding
          is the first significant measurement of a positive correlation
          between E_c and luminosity in any X-ray pulsar. We suggest that
          this behaviour is expected in the case of sub-Eddington
          accretion and present a calculation of a quantitative estimate,
          which is very consistent with the effect observed in Her X-1.We
          urge that Her X-1 is regularly monitored further and that other
          X-ray pulsars are investigated for a similar behaviour.

          Title: Tidal dissipation in rotating solar-type stars
          Authors: G. I. Ogilvie, D. N. C. Lin
          Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures, to be published in Astrophys. J
          We calculate the excitation and dissipation of low-frequency
          tidal oscillations in uniformly rotating solar-type stars. For
          tidal frequencies smaller than twice the spin frequency,
          inertial waves are excited in the convective envelope and are
          dissipated by turbulent viscosity. Enhanced dissipation occurs
          over the entire frequency range rather than in a series of very
          narrow resonant peaks, and is relatively insensitive to the
          effective viscosity. Hough waves are excited at the base of the
          convective zone and propagate into the radiative interior. We
          calculate the associated dissipation rate under the assumption
          that they do not reflect coherently from the center of the
          star. Tidal dissipation in a model based on the present Sun is
          significantly enhanced through the inclusion of the Coriolis
          force but may still fall short of that required to explain the
          circularization of close binary stars. However, the dependence
          of the results on the spin frequency, tidal frequency, and
          stellar model indicate that a more detailed evolutionary study
          including inertial and Hough waves is required. We also discuss
          the case of higher tidal frequencies appropriate to stars with
          very close planetary companions. The survival of even the
          closest hot Jupiters can be plausibly explained provided that
          the Hough waves they generate are not damped at the center of
          the star. We argue that this is the case because the tide
          excited by a hot Jupiter in the present Sun would marginally
          fail to achieve nonlinearity. As conditions at the center of
          the star evolve, nonlinearity may set in at a critical age,
          resulting in a relatively rapid inspiral of the hot Jupiter.

          publication in ApJ
          We present near-infrared photometry of the globular cluster
          systems of the early-type galaxies NGC 4472, NGC 4594, NGC
          3585, and NGC 5813. We combine these near-infrared data,
          obtained with PANIC at the Magellan Baade 6.5m telescope, with
          archival optical HST and FORS/VLT data, and use the optical to
          near-infrared colors to constrain the ages and metallicities of
          the globular clusters around the target galaxies. For NGC 4472
          we have the most extensive near-infrared and optical
          photometric dataset. These colors show that the NGC 4472
          globular cluster system has a broad metallicity distribution
          and that the clusters are predominantly old (i.e. ages of about
          10 Gyr or more). This result agrees well with earlier
          spectroscopic work on NGC 4472, and is evidence that the
          combination of optical to near-infrared colors can identify
          predominantly old systems and distinguish these from systems
          with a substantial intermediate age component. Based on the
          smaller sample of combined optical and near-infrared data NGC
          4594 and NGC 3585 appear to have predominantly old globular
          cluster systems, while that of NGC 5813 may have a more
          significant age spread. We also match our sample of globular
          clusters with near-infrared and optical photometry to Chandra
          X-ray source detections in these galaxies, and discuss how the
          probability that a globular cluster hosts a low-mass X-ray
          binary depends on metallicity and age.

          Title: Polarization of the Crab Nebula with disordered magnetic
          components
          Authors: Yuji Nakamura, Shinpei Shibata
          Comments: 7 pages, 25 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          In this paper, we present an expanding disc model to derive
          polarization properties of the Crab nebula. The distribution
          function of the plasma and the energy density of the magnetic
          field are prescribed as function of the distance from the
          pulsar by using the model by Kennel and Coroniti (1984) with
          $\sigma = 0.003$, where $\sigma$ is the ratio of Poynting flux
          to the kinetic energy flux in the bulk motion just before the
          termination shock. Unlike previous models, we introduce
          disordered magnetic field, which is parameterized by the
          fractional energy density of the disordered component. Flow
          dynamics is not solved. The mean field is toroidal. Averaged
          polarization degree over the disc is obtained as a function of
          inclination angle and fractional energy density of the
          disordered magnetic field. It is found for the Crab that the
          disordered component has about 60 percent of the magnetic field
          energy. This value is also supported by the facts that the disc
          appears not `lip-shape' but as `rings' in the intensity map as
          was observed, and that the highest polarization degree of $\sim
          40$ percent is reproduced for rings, being consistent with the
          observation. We suggest that because the disordered field
          contributes rather pressure than tension, the pinch force may
          be over-estimated in previous relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
          simulations. Disruption of the toroidal magnetic field with
          alternating direction, which is proposed by Lyubarski (2003),
          may actually takes place. The relativistic flow speed, which is
          indicated by the front-back contrast, can be detected in
          asymmetry in distributions of the position angle and
          depolarization.

          Comments: proceedings of Coronae of Stars and Accretion Disks,
          Bonn, Dec. 2006, to be published in MmSAI
          We present updated results from the ongoing XMM-Newton
          monitoring program of moderately active, solar-like stars to
          investigate stellar X-ray activity cycles; here we report on
          the binary systems Alpha Cen A/B and 61 Cyg A/B. For 61 Cyg A
          we find a coronal X-ray cycle which clearly reflects the
          chromospheric activity cycle and is in phase with a ROSAT
          campaign performed in the 1990s. 61 Cyg A is the first example
          of a persistent coronal cycle observed on a star other than the
          Sun. The changes of its coronal properties during the cycle
          resemble the solar behaviour. The coronal activity of 61 Cyg B
          is more irregular, but also follows the chromospheric activity.
          Long-term variability is also present on Alpha Cen A and B. We
          find that Alpha Cen A, a G2 star very similar to our Sun,
          fainted in X-rays by at least an order of magnitude during the
          observation program. This behaviour has never been observed
          before on Alpha Cen A, but is rather similar to the X-ray
          behaviour of the Sun. The X-ray emission of the Alpha Cen
          system is dominated in our observations by Alpha Cen B, which
          might also have an activity cycle indicated by a significant
          fainting since 2005.

          Title: Close encounters in young stellar clusters: implications
          for planetary systems in the solar neighbourhood
          Authors: Daniel Malmberg, Francesca De Angeli, Melvyn B.

          Comments: 9 pages, 9 figures, 1 table. Submitted to MNRAS
          The stars that populate the solar neighbourhood were formed in
          stellar clusters. Through $N$-body simulations of these
          clusters, we measure the rate of close encounters between
          stars. By monitoring the interaction histories of each star, we
          investigate the singleton fraction in the solar neighbourhood.
          A {\it singleton} is a star which formed as a single star, has
          never experienced any close encounters with other stars or
          binaries, or undergone an exchange encounter with a binary. We
          find that, of the stars which formed as single stars, a
          significant fraction are not singletons once the clusters have
          dispersed. If some of these stars had planetary systems, with
          properties similar to those of the solar system, the planets'
          orbits may have been perturbed by the effects of close
          encounters with other stars or the effects of a companion star
          within a binary. Such perturbations can lead to strong
          planet-planet interactions which eject several planets, leaving
          the remaining planets on eccentric orbits. Some of the single
          stars exchange into binaries. Most of these binaries are broken
          up via subsequent interactions within the cluster, but some
          remain intact beyond the lifetime of the cluster. The
          properties of these binaries are similar to those of the
          observed binary systems containing extra-solar planets. Thus,
          dynamical processes in young stellar clusters will alter
          significantly any population of solar-system-like planetary
          systems. In addition, beginning entirely with a population of
          planetary systems resembling the solar system around single
          stars, dynamical encounters in young stellar clusters may
          produce at least some of the extra-solar planetary systems
          observed in the solar neighbourhood.

          Comments: 21 pages, 5 figures. Accepted to MNRAS
          We compute the probability that intermediate mass black holes
          (IMBHs) capture companions due to dynamical interactions and
          become accreting sources, and explore the possibility that the
          accreting IMBHs would appear as ultra-luminous X-ray sources
          (ULXs). We focus on IMBHs originating from low-metallicity
          Population III stars. Two channels of IMBH formation are
          considered: from primordial halos in the framework of
          hierarchical clustering, and from non-mixed, zero-metallicity
          primeval gas in galactic discs. IMBHs can form binary systems
          due to tidal captures of single stars and exchange interactions
          with existing binary systems in galactic discs. We find that
          neither formation mechanism of the accreting IMBH binary is
          able to provide enough sources to explain the observed
          population of ULXs. Even at sub-ULX luminosity, the total
          number of accreting IMBHs with $L> 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with
          dynamically captured companions is found to be $< 0.01$ per
          galaxy.

          (Abridged) With the SMA we have made high angular-resolution
          (~1" = 160 AU) observations of the protobinary system IRAS
          16293-2422 in the J = 4-3 lines of HCN and HC^15N, and in the
          continuum at 354.5 GHz. The HCN (4-3) line was also observed
          using the JCMT to supply missing short spacing information.
          Submillimeter continuum emission is detected from the
          individual binary components with a separation of ~5". The
          HC^15N (4-3) emission has revealed a compact (~500 AU)
          flattened structure (P.A. = -16 degree) associated with Source
          A, and shows a velocity gradient along the projected minor
          axis, which can be interpreted as an infalling gas motion. Our
          HCN image including the short-spacing information shows an
          extended (~3000 AU) circumbinary envelope as well as the
          compact structure associated with Source A. A toy model
          consisting of a flattened structure with radial infall towards
          a 1 Msun central star reproduces the HCN/HC^15N
          position-velocity diagram along the minor axis of the HC^15N
          emission. In the extended envelope there is also a North-East
          (Blue) to South-West (Red) velocity gradient across the binary
          alignment, which is likely to reflect gas motion in the
          swept-up dense gas associated with the molecular outflow from
          Source A. At Source B, there is only a weak compact structure
          with much narrower line widths (~2 km/s) seen in the
          optically-thin HC^15N emission than that at Source A (>10
          km/s), and there is no clearly defined bipolar molecular
          outflow associated with Source B. These results imply the
          different evolutionary stages between Source A and B in the
          common circumbinary envelope.

          pulse period

          Journal-ref: AIP Conf. Proc. 2006
          We have studied the long-term (1971-2005) behaviour of the 1.24
          sec pulse period and the 35 day precession period of Her X-1
          and show that both periods vary in a highly correlated way (see
          also Staubert et al. 1997 and 2000). When the spin-up rate
          decreases, the 35 day turn-on period shortens.This correlation
          is most evident on long time scales (~2000 days),e.g.around
          four extended spin-down episodes, but also on shorter time
          scales (a few 100 days) on which quasi-periodic variations are
          apparent. We argue that the likely common cause is variations
          of the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star.The data since
          1991 allow a continuous sampling and indicate a lag between the
          turn-on behaviour and the spin behaviour, in the sense that
          changes are first seen in the spin, about one cycle later in
          the turn-on. Both the coronal wind model (Schandl & Meyer 1994)
          as well as the stream-disk model (Shakura et al.999) predict
          this kind of behaviour.

          There is growing observational evidence for some kind of
          interaction between stars and close-in extrasolar giant
          planets. Shkolnik et al. reported variability in the
          chromospheric Ca H and K lines of HD 179949 and upsilon And
          that seemed to be phased with the planet's orbital period,
          instead of the stellar rotational period. However, the
          observations also indicate that the chromospheric light curves
          do not repeat exactly, which may be expected for a planet
          plowing through a variable stellar magnetic field. Using the
          complex solar magnetic field (modeled with the Potential Field
          Source Surface technique) as a guide, we simulate the shapes of
          light curves that would arise from planet-star interactions
          that are channeled along magnetic field lines. We also study
          the orbit-to-orbit variability of these light curves and how
          they vary from solar minimum (i.e., a more or less axisymmetric
          stretched dipole) to solar maximum (a superposition of many
          higher multipole moments) fields. Considering more complex
          magnetic fields introduces new difficulties in the
          interpretation of observations, but it may also lead to
          valuable new diagnostics of exoplanet magnetospheres.

          We study the hadron-quark phase transition in the interior of
          protoneutron stars. For the hadronic sector, we use a
          microscopic equation of state involving nucleons and hyperons
          derived within the finite-temperature Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone
          many-body theory, with realistic two-body and three-body
          forces. For the description of quark matter, we employ the MIT
          bag model both with a constant and a density-dependent bag
          parameter. We calculate the structure of protostars within a
          static approach. In particular we focus on a suitable
          temperature profile, suggested by dynamical calculations, which
          plays a fundamental role in determining the value of the
          minimum gravitational mass. The maximum mass instead depends
          only upon the equation of state employed.

          Title: Are disk galaxies the progenitors of giant ellipticals?
          Authors: Thorsten Naab, Jeremiah P. Ostriker
          Comments: submitted, comments welcome
          A popular formation scenario for giant elliptical galaxies
          proposes that they might have formed from binary mergers of
          disk galaxies. Difficulties with the scenario that emerged from
          earlier studies included providing the necessary stellar mass
          and metallicity, maintaining the tight color-magnitude relation
          and avoiding phase space limits. In this paper we revisit the
          issue and put constraints on the binary disc merger scenario
          based on the stellar populations of disc galaxies. We draw the
          following conclusions: Low redshift collisionless or gaseous
          mergers of present day Milky Way like disc galaxies do not form
          present day elliptical galaxies. Binary mergers of the
          progenitors of present day disc galaxies can have evolved into
          intermediate mass elliptical galaxies ($M < M_*$) if they have
          merged earlier than $\approx$ 4 Gyrs ago. But more massive
          giant ellipticals in general can not have formed from binary
          mergers of the progenitors of present day disc galaxies. They
          must be made from either multiple mergers or binary mergers of
          spirals at early times whose descendents no longer exist. A
          major reason for these conclusions is that the mass in metals
          of typical disk galaxy is approximately a factor of 4-8 smaller
          than the mass in metals of a typical early-type galaxy and this
          ratio grows to larger values with increasing redshift.

          observations of the spectral and timing behavior of the High
          Mass X-ray Binary A 0535+26 during its August/September 2005
          normal (type I) outburst with an average flux
          F(5-100keV)~400mCrab. The search for cyclotron resonance
          scattering features (fundamental and harmonic) is one major
          focus of the paper. Our analysis is based on data from INTEGRAL
          and RXTE Target of Opportunity Observations performed during
          the outburst. The pulse period is determined. X-ray pulse
          profiles in different energy ranges are analyzed. The broad
          band INTEGRAL and RXTE pulse phase averaged X-ray spectra are
          studied. The evolution of the fundamental cyclotron line at
          different luminosities is analyzed. The pulse period P is
          measured to be 103.39315(5)s at MJD 53614.5137. Two absorption
          features are detected in the phase averaged spectra at
          E_1~45keV and E_2~100keV. These can be interpreted as the
          fundamental cyclotron resonance scattering feature and its
          first harmonic and therefore the magnetic field can be
          estimated to be B~4x10^12G.

          Detecting heat from minor planets in the outer solar system is
          challenging, yet it is the most efficient means for
          constraining the albedos and sizes of Kuiper Belt Objects
          (KBOs) and their progeny, the Centaur objects. These physical
          parameters are critical, e.g., for interpreting spectroscopic
          data, deriving densities from the masses of binary systems, and
          predicting occultation tracks. Here we summarize Spitzer Space
          Telescope observations of 47 KBOs and Centaurs at wavelengths
          near 24 and 70 microns. We interpret the measurements using a
          variation of the Standard Thermal Model (STM) to derive the
          physical properties (albedo and diameter) of the targets. We
          also summarize the results of other efforts to measure the
          albedos and sizes of KBOs and Centaurs. The three or four
          largest KBOs appear to constitute a distinct class in terms of
          their albedos. From our Spitzer results, we find that the
          geometric albedo of KBOs and Centaurs is correlated with
          perihelion distance (darker objects having smaller perihelia),
          and that the albedos of KBOs (but not Centaurs) are correlated
          with size (larger KBOs having higher albedos). We also find
          hints that albedo may be correlated with with visible color
          (for Centaurs). Interestingly, if the color correlation is
          real, redder Centaurs appear to have higher albedos. Finally,
          we briefly discuss the prospects for future thermal
          observations of these primitive outer solar system objects.

          figures available at this http URL
          We present here the first 2D rotating, multi-group, radiation
          magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of supernova core
          collapse, bounce, and explosion. In the context of rapid
          rotation, we focus on the dynamical effects of magnetic
          stresses and the creation and propagation of MHD jets. We find
          that a quasi-steady state can be quickly established after
          bounce, during which a well-collimated MHD jet is maintained by
          continuous pumping of power from the differentially rotating
          core. If the initial spin period of the progenitor core is
          $\sles$ 2 seconds, the free energy reservoir in the secularly
          evolving protoneutron star is adequate to power a supernova
          explosion, and may be enough for a hypernova. The jets are well
          collimated by the infalling material and magnetic hoop
          stresses, and maintain a small opening angle. We see evidence
          of sausage instabilities in the emerging jet stream. Neutrino
          heating is sub-dominant in the rapidly rotating models we
          explore, but can contribute 10$-$25% to the final explosion
          energy. Our simulations suggest that even in the case of modest
          or slow rotation, a supernova explosion might be followed by a
          secondary, weak MHD jet explosion, which, because of its
          weakness may to date have gone unnoticed in supernova debris.
          Furthermore, we suggest that the generation of a
          non-relativistic MHD precursor jet during the early
          protoneutron star/supernova phase is implicit in both the
          collapsar and "millisecond magnetar" models of GRBs. The
          multi-D, multi-group, rapidly rotating RMHD simulations we
          describe here are a start along the path towards more realistic
          simulations of the possible role of magnetic fields in some of
          Nature's most dramatic events.

          Authors: M. Cantiello, S.-C. Yoon, N. Langer, M. Livio
          Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A Letters
          We present a binary channel for the progenitors of long
          gamma-ray bursts. We test the idea of producing rapidly
          rotating Wolf-Rayet stars in massive close binaries through
          mass accretion and consecutive quasi-chemically homogeneous
          evolution. The binary channel presented here may provide a
          means for massive stars to obtain the required high rotation
          rates. Moreover, it suggests that a possibly large fraction of
          long gamma-ray bursts occurs in runaway stars. This can have
          important observational consequences for both the positions of
          GRBs, and their afterglow properties.

          We present the results of a search for wide binary systems
          among 783 members of three nearby young associations:
          Taurus-Auriga, Chamaeleon I, and two subgroups of Upper
          Scorpius. Near-infrared (JHK) imagery from 2MASS was analyzed
          to search for wide (1-30"; ~150-4500 AU) companions to known
          association members, using color-magnitude cuts to reject
          likely background stars. We identify a total of 131 candidate
          binary companions with colors consistent with physical
          association, of which 39 have not been identified previously in
          the literature. Our results suggest that the wide binary
          frequency is a function of both mass and environment, with
          significantly higher frequencies among high-mass stars than
          lower-mass stars and in the T associations than in the OB
          association. We discuss the implications for wide binary
          formation and conclude that the environmental dependence is not
          a direct result of stellar density or total association mass,
          but instead might depend on another environmental parameter
          like the gas temperature. We also analyze the mass ratio
          distribution as a function of mass and find that it agrees with
          the distribution for field stars to within the statistical
          uncertainties. The binary populations in these associations
          generally follow the empirical mass-maximum separation relation
          observed for field binaries, but we have found one candidate
          low-mass system (USco-160611.9-193532; Mtot~0.4 Msun) which has
          a projected separation (10.8"; 1550 AU) much larger than the
          suggested limit for its mass. (Abridged)

          Title: Probing Dark Matter Substructure with Pulsar Timing
          Authors: E. R. Siegel, M. P. Hertzberg, J. N. Fry
          Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We demonstrate that pulsar timing measurements may be able to
          detect the presence of dark matter substructure within our own
          galaxy. As dark matter substructure transits near the
          line-of-sight between a pulsar and an observer, the change in
          the gravitational field will result in a delay of the
          light-travel-time of photons. We calculate the effect of this
          delay due to transiting dark matter substructure and find that
          the effect on pulsar timing ought to be observable for a wide
          range of substructure masses and density profiles. We find that
          transiting dark matter substructure with masses above 0.01
          solar masses ought to be detectable at present by these means.
          With small improvements, this method may be able to distinguish
          between baryonic, thermal non-baryonic, and non-thermal
          non-baryonic types of dark matter. Additionally, information
          about structure formation on small scales and the density
          profiles of galactic dark matter substructure can be extracted
          via this method.

          continuum study of the young high-mass protocluster

          The young massive star-forming region IRAS05358+3543 was
          observed at high-spatial resolution in the continuum emission
          at 3.1 and 1.2mm with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer, and
          at 875 and 438mum with the Submillimeter Array. We resolve at
          least four continuum sub-sources that are likely of
          protostellar nature. Two of them are potentially part of a
          proto-binary system with a projected separation of 1700AU.
          Additional (sub)mm continuum peaks are not necessarily
          harboring protostars but maybe caused by the multiple molecular
          outflows. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the
          sub-sources show several features. The main power house mm1,
          which is associated with CH3OH maser emission, a hypercompact
          HII region and a mid-infrared source, exhibits a typical SED
          with a free-free emission component at cm and long mm
          wavelengths and a cold dust component in the (sub)mm part of
          the spectrum (spectral index between 1.2mm and 438mum
          alpha~3.6). The free-free emission corresponds to a Lyman
          continuum flux of an embedded 13Msun B1 star. The coldest
          source of the region, mm3, has alpha~3.7 between 1.2mm and
          875mum, but has lower than expected fluxes in the shorter
          wavelength 438mum band. This turnover of the Planck-function
          sets an upper limit on the dust temperature of mm3 of
          approximately 20K. The uv-data analysis of the density
          structure of individual sub-cores reveals distributions with
          power-law indices between 1.5 and 2. This resembles the density
          distributions of the larger-scale cluster-forming clump as well
          as those from typical low-mass cores.

          The available data on isolated X-ray pulsars, their wind
          nebulae, and the supernova remnants which are connected to some
          of these sources are analyzed. It is shown that electric fields
          of neutron stars tear off charged particles from the surface of
          neutron star and trigger the acceleration of particles. The
          charged particles are accelerated mainly in the field of
          magneto-dipole radiation wave. Power and energy spectra of the
          charged particles depend on the strength of the magneto-dipole
          radiation. Therefore, the X-ray radiation is strongly dependent
          on the rate of rotational energy loss and weakly dependent on
          the electric field intensity. Coulomb interaction between the
          charged particles is the main factor for the energy loss and
          the X-ray spectra of the charged particles.

          Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures. Submitted to A&A
          Using Chandra observations, we study the X-ray emission of the
          stellar population in the compact dwarf elliptical galaxy M32.
          The proximity of M32 allows one to resolve all bright point
          sources with luminosities higher than 8e33 erg/s in the 0.5--7
          keV band. The remaining (unresolved) emission closely follows
          the galaxy's optical light and is characterized by an
          emissivity per unit stellar mass of ~4.3e27 erg/s/M_sun in the
          2--10 keV energy band. The spectrum of the unresolved emission
          above a few keV smoothly joins the X-ray spectrum of the Milky
          Way's ridge measured with RXTE and INTEGRAL. These results
          strongly suggest that weak discrete X-ray sources (accreting
          white dwarfs and active binary stars) provide the bulk of the
          ``diffuse'' emission of this gas-poor galaxy. Within the
          uncertainties, the average X-ray properties of the M32 stars
          are consistent with those of the old stellar population in the
          Milky Way. The inferred cumulative soft X-ray (0.5--2 keV)
          emissivity is however smaller than is measured in the immediate
          Solar vicinity in our Galaxy. This difference is probably
          linked to the contribution of young (age <1Gyr) stars, which
          are abundant in the Solar neighborhood but practically absent
          in M32. Combining Chandra, RXTE and INTEGRAL data, we obtain a
          broad-band (0.5--60 keV) X-ray spectrum of the old stellar
          population in galaxies.

          Title: Searching for primordial black hole dark matter with
          pulsar timing arrays
          Authors: Naoki Seto, Asantha Cooray
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJL
          We discuss the possibility of detecting the presence of
          primordial black holes (PBHs), such as those that might account
          for galactic dark matter, using modification of pulsar timing
          residuals when PBHs pass within ~1000 AU and impart impulse
          accelerations to the Earth. With this technique, PBHs with
          masses around 10^{25} g (~0.1 lunar mass) can be detected.
          Currently, the constraints on the abundance of such dark matter
          candidates are weak. A 30 year-long monitoring campaign with
          the proposed Square Kilometer Array (SKA) can rule out a PBH
          fraction more than ~1/10 in the solar neighborhood in the form
          of dark matter with mass ~10^{25} g.

          Title: Extreme adaptive optics imaging with a clear and

          Authors: E. Serabyn, K. Wallace, M. Troy, B. Mennesson, P.
          Haguenauer, R. Gappinger, R. Burruss
          Comments: accepted by ApJ
          Rather than using an adaptive optics (AO) system to correct a
          telescope s entire pupil, it can instead be used to more finely
          correct a smaller sub-aperture. Indeed, existing AO systems can
          be used to correct a sub-aperture 1/3 to 1/2 the size of a 5-10
          m telescope to extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) levels. We
          discuss the potential performance of a clear off-axis
          well-corrected sub-aperture (WCS), and describe our initial
          imaging results with a 1.5 m diameter WCS on the Palomar
          Observatory s Hale telescope. These include measured Strehl
          ratios of 0.92-0.94 in the infrared (2.17 microns), and 0.12 in
          the B band, the latter allowing a binary of separation 0.34 arc
          sec to be easily resolved in the blue. Such performance levels
          enable a variety of novel observational modes, such as infrared
          ExAO, visible-wavelength AO, and high-contrast coronagraphy.
          One specific application suggested by the high Strehl ratio
          stability obtained (1%) is the measurement of planetary
          transits and eclipses. Also described is a simple dark-hole
          experiment carried out on a binary star, in which a comatic
          phase term was applied directly to the deformable mirror, in
          order to shift the diffraction rings to one side of the point
          spread function.

          Title: SGR1806-20: evidence for a superstrong Magnetic Field
          from Quasi Periodic Oscillations
          Authors: M. Vietri, L. Stella, G. Israel
          Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical
          Journal, Part I
          Fast Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs, frequencies of $\sim 20
          - 1840$ Hz) have been recently discovered in the ringing tail
          of giant flares from Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs), when the
          luminosity was of order $10^{41}-10^{41.5}$ erg/s. These
          oscillations persisted for many tens of seconds, remained
          coherent for up to hundreds of cycles and were observed over a
          wide range of rotational phases of the neutron stars believed
          to host SGRs. Therefore these QPOs must have originated from a
          compact, virtually non-expanding region inside the star's
          magnetosphere, emitting with a very moderate degree of beaming
          (if at all). The fastest QPOs imply a luminosity variation of
          $\Delta L/\Delta t \simeq 6 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-2}$, the
          largest luminosity variation ever observed from a compact
          source. It exceeds by over an order of magnitude the usual
          Cavallo-Fabian-Rees (CFR) luminosity variability limit for a
          matter-to-radiation conversion efficiency of 100%. We show that
          such an extreme variability can be reconciled with the CFR
          limit if the emitting region is immersed in a magnetic field
          $\gtrsim 10^{15}$ G at the star surface, providing independent
          evidence for the superstrong magnetic fields of magnetars.

          Title: Stardust findings favor not only the planetary origin of
          comets but the underlying close-binary cosmogony of the Solar
          system as well
          Authors: Edward M. Drobyshevski
          Comments: 14 pages
          We analyze findings of the Stardust mission that brought to the
          Earth dust from the 81P/Wild 2 coma. Just as the data of the
          Deep Impact mission to 9P/Tempel 1, they are at odds with the
          widely accepted condensation/sublimation comet paradigm. They
          fit rather well to the approach assuming ejection of nuclei of
          short-period comets from moon-like bodies of the type of
          Galilean satellites in rare (six to seven events in 4.5 aeons)
          global explosions of their massive icy envelopes saturated by
          2H2+O2, products of the electrolysis of ice. This approach
          offers an explanation, in particular, for the jet activity of
          comets, which is sustained by combustion of the 2H2+O2+organics
          mixture ignited and complemented by the solar radiation.
          Combustion accounts also for other observations, in particular,
          the presence in the dust of products of high-temperature
          (800-900 K) metamorphism. The presence of minerals forming at
          still higher temperatures (~1400-2000 K), just as the
          undoubtedly planetary origin of some long-period comets
          arriving from the joint planeto-cometary cloud beyond Neptune,
          forces one, however, to invoke the close-binary cosmogony of
          the Solar system, which three decades ago predicted the
          existence of such a cloud (in the recent decade, this
          prediction has been substantiated by the discovery there of
          many dwarf planets). It considers the Jupiter-Sun system as the
          limiting case of a binary star and uses it as a basis for
          explanation of all the known observations and for prediction of
          the new ones to come. It provides an explanation, in
          particular, for both the origin and capture by the Earth of the
          Moon as a high-temperature condensate and the formation of the
          Galilean satellites, which also contain inclusions of
          refractory minerals in their ices.

          This paper presents the first optical variability study of the

          binary systems. A total of 129 new variable stars have been
          identified, including the discovery of 4 eclipsing binaries
          that are cluster members, 1 additional candidate, 8 field
          binaries, 19 field delta Scuti stars, 3 field W UMa eclipsing
          binaries, 13 other periodic variables and 81 long period or
          non-periodic variables. These include the known luminous blue
          variable, the B[e] star, 11 Wolf-Rayet stars, several
          supergiants, and other reddened stars that are likely members
          of Westerlund 1. The bright X-ray source corresponding to the
          Wolf-Rayet star WR77o (B) is found to be a 3.51 day eclipsing
          binary. The discovery of a reddened detached eclipsing binary
          system implies the first identification of main-sequence stars

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters. Six pages
          with 4 figures
          We have used the Parkes radio telescope to study the polarized
          emission from the anomalous X-ray pulsar XTE J1810-197 at
          frequencies of 1.4, 3.2, and 8.4 GHz. We find that the pulsed
          emission is nearly 100% linearly polarized. The position angle
          of linear polarization varies gently across the observed pulse
          profiles, varying little with observing frequency or time, even
          as the pulse profiles have changed dramatically over a period
          of 7 months. In the context of the standard pulsar "rotating
          vector model," there are two possible interpretations of the
          observed position angle swing coupled with the wide profile. In
          the first, the magnetic and rotation axes are substantially
          misaligned and the emission originates high in the
          magnetosphere, as seen for other young radio pulsars, and the
          beaming fraction is large. In the second interpretation, the
          magnetic and rotation axes are nearly aligned and the line of
          sight remains in the emission zone over almost the entire pulse
          phase. We deprecate this possibility because of the observed
          large modulation of thermal X-ray flux. We have also measured
          the Faraday rotation caused by the Galactic magnetic field, RM
          = +77 rad/m^2, implying an average magnetic field component
          along the line of sight of 0.5 microG.

          explanation of the GX 17+2 case
          Authors: R. Farinelli, L. Titarchuk, F. Frontera
          Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ
          We report results of a new spectral analysis of two BeppoSAX
          observations of the Z source GX 17+2. In one of the two
          observations the source exhibits a powerlaw-like hard (> 30
          keV) X-ray tail which was described in a previous work by a
          hybrid Comptonization model. Recent high-energy observations
          with INTEGRAL of a sample of Low Mass X-Ray Binaries including
          both Z and atoll classes have shown that bulk (dynamical)
          Comptonization of soft photons can be a possible alternative
          mechanism for producing hard X-ray tails in such systems. We
          start from the INTEGRAL results and we exploit the broad-band
          capability of BeppoSAX to better investigate the physical
          processes at work. We use GX 17+2 as a representative case.
          Moreover, we suggest that weakening (or disappearance) of the
          hard X-ray tail can be explained by increasing radiation
          pressure originated at the surface of the neutron star (NS). As
          a result the high radiation pressure stops the bulk inflow and
          consequently this radiation feedback of the NS surface leads to
          quenching the bulk Comptonization.

          We present optical lightcurves of 428 periodic variable stars
          coincident with ROSAT X-ray sources, detected using the first
          run of the SuperWASP photometric survey. Only 68 of these were
          previously recognised as periodic variables. A further 30 of
          these objects are previously known pre-main sequence stars, for
          which we detect a modulation period for the first time. Amongst
          the newly identified periodic variables, many appear to be
          close eclipsing binaries, their X-ray emission is presumably
          the result of RS CVn type behaviour. Others are probably BY Dra
          stars, pre-main sequence stars and other rapid rotators
          displaying enhanced coronal activity. A number of previously
          catalogued pulsating variables (RR Lyr stars and Cepheids)
          coincident with X-ray sources are also seen, but we show that
          these are likely to be misclassifications. We identify four
          objects which are probable low mass eclipsing binary stars,
          based on their very red colour and light curve morphology.

          Title: Discovery of the Widest Very Low Mass Binary

          Comments: accepted ApJL, 4 pages
          We report the discovery of a very low mass binary system
          (primary mass <0.1 Msol) with a projected separation of ~5100
          AU, more than twice that of the widest previously known system.
          A spectrum covering the 1-2.5 microns wavelength interval at R
          ~1700 is presented for each component. Analysis of the spectra
          indicates spectral types of M6.5V and M8V, and the photometric
          distance of the system is ~62 pc. Given that previous studies
          have established that no more than 1% of very low mass binary
          systems have orbits larger than 20 AU, the existence of such a
          wide system has a bearing on very low mass star formation and
          evolution models.

          Title: Observing cosmic string loops with gravitational lensing
          surveys
          Authors: Katherine J. Mack, Daniel H. Wesley, Lindsay J. King
          Comments: 18 pages, 3 figures
          We show that the existence of cosmic strings can be strongly
          constrained by the next generation of gravitational lensing
          surveys at radio frequencies. We focus on cosmic string loops,
          which we expect to be far more numerous than long
          (horizon-sized) strings, as suggested by simulations. Using
          simple models of the loop population and minimal assumptions
          about the lensing cross-section per loop, we estimate the
          optical depth to lensing and show that extant radio surveys
          such as CLASS have already ruled out a portion of the cosmic
          string model parameter space. Future radio interferometers,
          such as LOFAR and especially SKA, may constrain $G\mu/c^2 <
          10^{-9}$ in some regions of parameter space, outperforming
          current constraints from pulsar timing and the CMB by up to two
          orders of magnitude. A fundamental advantage of this approach
          is that it is based on direct detections of cosmic strings;
          whereas lensing requires only that the loop have a mass, other
          constraints must rely on estimates of theoretical uncertainties
          such as the gravitational wave emission of loops or the
          population dynamics of string networks. This difference is
          essential since the properties of cosmic strings are
          essentially unknown.

          Title: Subaru Weak Lensing Study of Seven Merging Clusters:
          Distributions of Mass and Baryons

          We present and compare projected distributions of mass,
          galaxies, and the intracluster medium (ICM) for a sample of
          merging clusters of galaxies based on the joint weak-lensing,
          optical, and X-ray analysis. Our sample comprises seven nearby
          Abell clusters ($0.0542 \le z \le 0.279$), for which we have
          conducted systematic, deep imaging observations with
          Suprime-Cam on Subaru telescope. Our seven target clusters,
          representing various merging stages and conditions, allow us to
          investigate in details the physical interplay between dark
          matter, ICM, and galaxies associated with cluster formation and
          evolution. A1750 and A1758 are binary systems consisting of two
          cluster-sized components, A520, A754, A1758, and A1914 are
          on-going cluster mergers, and A2034 and A2142 are cold-front
          clusters. In the binary clusters, which are presumably in an
          early phase of mergers, the projected mass, optical light, and
          X-ray distributions are overall similar and regular without
          significant substructures. On-going merging clusters, on the
          other hand, reveal highly irregular mass distributions. Overall
          the mass distribution appears to be similar to the galaxy
          luminosity distribution, whereas their distributions are quite
          different from the ICM distribution in a various ways. The cold
          front clusters also reveal irregular mass structures that
          differ from ICM structures. In particular, all of three cold
          fronts are found to be associated with a mass substructure
          located ahead of the moving cold front, as found in the bullet
          cluster 1E0657-56.

          Title: Constraints on the Massive Supernova Progenitors
          Authors: Bojan Arbutina
          Comments: 11 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in
          IJMPD
          Generally accepted scheme distinguishes two main classes of
          supernovae (SNe): Ia resulting from the old stellar population
          (deflagration of a white dwarf in close binary systems), and
          SNe of type II and Ib/c whose ancestors are young massive stars
          (died in a core-collapse explosion). Concerning the latter,
          there are suggestions that the SNe II are connected to early B
          stars, and SNe Ib/c to isolated O or Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars.
          However, little or no effort was made to further separate SNe
          Ib from Ic. We have used assumed SN rates for different SN
          types in spiral galaxies in an attempt to perform this task. If
          isolated progenitor hypothesis is correct, our analysis
          indicates that SNe Ib result from stars of main-sequence mass
          $23 \mathcal{M}_{\odot} \lesssim \mathcal{M} \lesssim 30
          \mathcal{M}_{\odot}$, while the progenitors of SNe Ic are more
          massive stars with $\mathcal{M} \gtrsim 30
          \mathcal{M}_{\odot}$.
          Alternatively, if the majority of SNe Ib/c appear in close
          binary systems (CBs) then they would result from the same
          progenitor population as most of the SNe II, i.e. early B stars
          with initial masses of order $\mathcal{M} \sim 10
          \mathcal{M}_{\odot}$. Future observations of SNe at
          high-redshift ($z$) and their rate will provide us with unique
          information on SN progenitors and star-formation history of
          galaxies. At higher-$z$ (deeper in the cosmic past) we expect
          to see the lack of type Ia events, i.e. the dominance of
          core-collapse SNe. Better understanding of the
          stripped-envelope SNe (Ib/c), and their potential use as
          distance indicators at high-$z$, would therefore be of great
          practical importance.

          Title: Eclipsing Binary System WN3(h)+O5V BAT99-129: Analysis
          of the MACHO Light Curve and the Parameters of the Components
          Authors: I. I. Antokhin, A. M. Cherepashchuk
          Comments: 11 pages, 11 figures, 1 table. To be published in
          "Astronomy Reports"
          BAT99-129 is a massive eclipsing binary system in the Large
          Magellanic Cloud (LMC) which consists of WN3(h) and O5V
          components. A broad-band MACHO light curve of the system is
          studied in the present paper. A dense and extended atmosphere
          of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) star does not allow one to analyze the
          light curve in terms of standard parametric models of
          Wilson-Devinney type. Distributions of brightness and
          absorption across the WR star disk are restored using direct
          solution of integral equations describing eclipses in the
          system.
          As a result, reliable estimates of the orbital inclination and
          component parameters have been obtained. The orbital
          inclination is 78 deg, the orbital separation is 28.5 solar
          radii, the radius of the O component is 7.1 solar radii. The
          size of the WR component core opaque in optical continuum is
          3.4 solar radii. The brightness temperature in the center of
          the WR disk is about 45000K. Probable errors of the parameters
          are discussed. Evolutionary status of the system is discussed.

          Title: The Source of the Helium Visible Lines in Eta Carinae
          Authors: Amit Kashi, Noam Soker (Technion, Israel)
          Comments: Submitted to New Astronomy
          We assume that the helium-I lines emitted by the massive binary
          system Eta Carinae are formed in the acceleration zone of the
          less-massive secondary star. We calculate the Doppler shift of
          the lines as a function of orbital phase and of several
          parameters of the binary system. We find that a good fit is
          obtained if the helium lines are formed in the region where the
          secondary wind speed is 430 km/sec. The acceptable binary
          eccentricity is in the range 0.9-0.95, and the inclination
          angle (the angle between a line perpendicular to the orbital
          plane and the line of sight) is in the range 40-55 degrees.
          Lower values of e require higher values of i, and vice versa.
          The binary system is oriented such that the secondary star is
          in our direction (closer to us) during periastron passage. The
          orbital motion can account in part to the Doppler shift of the
          peak in X-ray emission.

          Title: Population Synthesis Studies of Close Binary Systems
          Using a Variable Common Envelope Efficiency Parameter: I.
          Dependence upon Secondary Mass
          Authors: Michael Politano, Kevin P. Weiler
          Comments: 43 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables
          We perform population synthesis calculations of present-day
          post common envelope binaries (PCEBs) and zero-age cataclysmic
          variables (ZACVs) using a common envelope efficiency parameter,
          alphaCE, that is a function of secondary mass, Ms. We
          investigate three basic possibilities: (1) a standard constant
          alphaCE prescription, with alphaCE = 1.0, 0.6, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1
          and 0.05, to provide a baseline for comparison, (2) a power law
          dependence, alphaCE = (Ms)^n, with n = 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0, and
          (3) a dependence in which ?CE approaches 1 for large secondary
          masses and alphaCE = 0 below some assumed cutoff mass, alphaCE
          = 1?Mcut/Ms, where Mcut is the cutoff mass and is equal to
          0.0375, 0.075 and 0.15 solar mass. For each population, we
          compute orbital period, orbital separation, white dwarf mass
          and secondary mass distributions.
          We find that if alphaCE < 0.2 in our constant ?CE sequence, the
          predicted present-day ZACV population is significantly modified
          compared with our standard model (alphaCE = 1.0). In our
          variable alphaCE sequences for ZACVs, we find that for models
          in which alphaCE decreases very rapidly for small secondary
          masses, the orbital period distribution below the period gap
          differs significantly from our standard model. These
          differences are most evident in our power law sequence model
          with n = 2 and in our cutoff mass sequence model with Mcut =
          0.15 solar mass. In these two models, the fraction of CVs
          forming with orbital periods below the gap is reduced
          significantly, the fraction forming in the gap is increased
          significantly, and both the short-period peak and the minimum
          period in the ZACV orbital period distribution shift to
          considerably longer orbital periods compared with our standard
          model.

          Title: Do Black Holes End up as Quark Stars ?
          Authors: R.K.Thakur
          Comments: 6 pages
          The possibility of the existence of quark stars has been
          discussed by several authors since 1970. Recently, it has been
          pointed out that two putative neutron stars, RXJ 1856.5 - 3754
          in Corona Australis and 3C58 in Cassiopeia are too small and
          too dense to be neutron stars; they show evidence of being
          quark stars. Apart from these two objects, there are several
          other compact objects which fit neither in the category of
          neutron stars nor in that of black holes. It has been suggested
          that they may be quark stars.In this paper it is shown that a
          black hole cannot collapse to a singularity, instead it may end
          up as a quark star. In this context it is shown that a
          gravitationally collapsing black hole acts as an ultrahigh
          energy particle accelerator, hitherto inconceivable in any
          terrestrial laboratory, that continually accelerates particles
          comprising the matter in the black hole. When the energy
          \textit{E} of the particles in the black hole is $\geq
          10^{2}$GeV, or equivalently the temperature \textit{T} of the
          matter in the black holes is $\geq 10^{15}$K, the entire matter
          in the black hole will be converted into quark-gluon plasma
          permeated by leptons. Since quarks and leptons are spin 1/2
          particles,they are governed by Pauli's exclusion principle.
          Consequently, one of the two possibilities will occur; either
          Pauli's exclusion principle would be violated and the black
          hole would collapse to a singularity, or the collapse of the
          black hole to a singularity would be inhibited by Pauli's
          exclusion principle, and the black hole would eventually
          explode with a mini bang of a sort. After explosion, the
          remnant core would stabilize as a quark star.

          Double-Peaked Low-Ionization Emission Lines: A binary Black
          Hole System?
          Authors: Xue-Guang Zhang, Dultzin-Hacyan D., Ting-Gui Wang
          Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures. Accepted by MNRAS
          In this paper we study the object SDSS J1130+0058 which is the
          only AGN known to have both double-peaked low-ionization broad
          emission lines, and also X-shaped radio structures. Emission
          from an accretion disk can reproduce the double-peaked line
          profile of broad H$\alpha$, but not the radio structure. Under
          the accretion disk model, the period of the inner emission line
          region is about 230 years. Using a new method to subtract the
          stellar component from the data of the SDSS DR4, we obtain an
          internal reddening factor which is less than previously found.
          The implied smaller amount of dust disfavors the backflow model
          for the X-shaped radio structure. The presence of a Binary
          Black Hole (BBH) system is the most natural way to explain
          ${\it both}$ the optical and radio properties of this AGN.
          Under the assumption of the BBH model, we can estimate the BBH
          system has a separation of less than 0.04 pc with a period less
          than 59 years, this may pose some problem to the BLRs sizes,
          still we conclude that the BBH model is favored on the basis of
          the present limited information.

          The s-enhanced and very metal-poor star CS 30322-023 shows a
          puzzling abundance pattern of the neutron-capture elements,
          i.e. several neutron-capture elements such as Ba, Pb etc. show
          enhancement, but other neutron-capture elements such as Sr, Eu
          etc. exhibit deficient with respect to iron. The study to this
          sample star could make people gain a better understanding of s-
          and r-process nucleosynthesis at low metallicity. Using a
          parametric model, we find that the abundance pattern of the
          neutron-capture elements could be best explained by a star that
          was polluted by an AGB star and the CS 30322-023 binary system
          formed in a molecular cloud which had never been polluted by
          r-process material. The lack of r-process material also
          indicates that the AGB companion cannot have undergone a
          type-1.5 supernova, and thus must have had an initial mass
          below 4.0M$_\odot$, while the strong N overabundance and the
          absence of a strong C overabundance indicate that the
          companion's initial mass was larger than 2.0M$_\odot$. The
          smaller s-process component coefficient of this star
          illustrates that there is less accreted material of this star
          from the AGB companion, and the sample star should be formed in
          the binary system with larger initial orbital separation where
          the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) mechanism can not work.

          Title: Galactic Sources of High Energy Neutrinos
          Authors: Felix Aharonian
          Comments: Invited talk at the The International Conference on
          Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics (Neutrino 06), Santa Fe, New
          Mexico, June 13-19, 2006
          The undisputed galactic origin of cosmic rays at energies below
          the so-called knee implies an existence of a nonthemal
          population of galactic objects which effectively accelerate
          protons and nuclei to TeV-PeV energies. The distinct signatures
          of these cosmic accelerators are high energy neutrinos and
          gamma-rays produced through hadronic interactions. While
          gamma-rays can be produced also by directly accelerated
          electrons, high energy neutrinos provide the most
          straightforward and unambiguous information about the nucleonic
          component of accelerated particles. The planned km-cube class
          high energy neutrino detectors are expected to be sensitive
          enough to provide the first astrophysically meaningful probes
          of potential VHE neutrino sources. This optimistic prediction
          is based on the recent discovery of high energy gamma-ray
          sources with hard energy spectra extending to 10 TeV and
          beyond. Amongst the best-bet candidates are two young
          shell-type supernova remnants - RXJ1713.7-4946 and
          RXJ0852.0-4622, and perhaps also two prominent plerions - the
          Crab Nebula and Vela X. Because of strong absorption of TeV

          (somewhat fainter) compact TeV gamma-ray emitters like the
          binary systems LS5039 and LS I+61~303, and, hopefully, from
          hypothetical "hidden" or "orphan" neutrino sources.

          Title: Generation of Type I X-ray Burst Oscillations by
          Unstable Surface Modes
          Authors: Ramesh Narayan, Randall L. Cooper
          Comments: 9 pages, submitted to ApJ
          The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer has detected nearly coherent
          oscillations in the tails of type I X-ray bursts from 17
          low-mass X-ray binaries. The oscillations are thought to be
          generated by brightness fluctuations associated with a surface
          mode on the rotating neutron star. The mechanism that drives
          the modes is, however, not understood, since the burning layer
          is stable to thermal perturbations. We show here via a linear
          perturbation analysis that, even under conditions when pure
          thermal perturbations are stable, nonradial surface modes may
          still be unstable. Specifically, we find that, if
          helium-burning reactions supply a reasonable fraction of the
          outgoing flux during burst decay, nonradial surface modes will
          grow in time. On the other hand, these modes are stable in the
          presence of hydrogen burning via the rp-process. The result
          naturally explain why oscillations in the decay phase of type I
          X-ray bursts are detected only from short-duration bursts.

          Title: Curious properties of the recycled pulsars and the
          potential of high precision timing
          Authors: Matthew Bailes
          Comments: 15 pages, 8 figures, To appear in proceedings of "A

          Heuvel, Amsterdam, Aug 2005), New Ast. Rev. accepted Feb 2007
          Binary and Millisecond pulsars have a great deal to teach us
          about stellar evolution and are invaluable tools for tests of
          relativistic theories of gravity. Our understanding of these
          objects has been transformed by large-scale surveys that have
          uncovered a great deal of new objects, exquisitely timed by
          ever-improving instrumentation. Here we argue that there exists
          a fundamental relation between the spin period of a pulsar and
          its companion mass, and that this determines many of the
          observable properties of a binary pulsar. No recycled pulsars
          exist in which the minimum companion mass exceeds (P/10 ms)
          Solar Masses. Furthermore, the three fastest disk millisecond
          pulsars are either single, or possess extremely low-mass
          companions Mc~0.02 Mo, consistent with this relation. Finally,
          the four relativistic binaries for which we have actual
          measurements of neutron star masses, suggest that not only are
          their spin periods related to the companion neutron star mass,
          but that the kick imparted to the system depends upon it too,
          leading to a correlation between orbital eccentricity and spin
          period. The isolation of the relativistic binary pulsars in the
          magnetic field-period diagram is used to argue that this must
          be because the kicks imparted to proto-relativistic systems are
          usually small, leading to very few if any isolated runaway
          mildly-recycled pulsars. This calls into question the magnitude
          of supernova kicks in close binaries, which have been usually
          assumed to be similar to those imparted to the bulk of the
          pulsar population. Finally, we review some of the highlights of
          the Parkes precision timing efforts, which suggest 10
          nanosecond timing is obtainable on PSR J1909-3744 that will aid
          us in searching for cosmological sources of gravitational
          waves.

          Title: Habitable Planet Formation in Binary-Planetary Systems
          Authors: Nader Haghighipour, Sean N. Raymond
          Comments: 27 pages, 11 figures, submitted for publication
          Recent radial velocity observations have indicated that
          Jovian-type planets can exist in moderately close binary star
          systems. Numerical simulations of the dynamical stability of
          terrestrial-class planets in such environments have shown that,
          in addition to their giant planets, these systems can also
          harbor Earth-like objects. In this paper, we study the late
          stage of terrestrial planet formation in such binary-planetary
          systems, and present the results of the simulations of the
          formation of Earth-like bodies in their habitable zones. We
          consider a circumprimary disk of Moon- to Mars-sized objects
          and numerically integrate the orbits of these bodies at the
          presence of the Jovian-type planet of the system and for
          different values of the mass, semimajor axis, and orbital
          eccentricity of the secondary star. Results indicate that,
          Earth-like objects, with substantial amounts of water, can form
          in the habitable zone of the primary star. Simulations also
          indicate that, by transferring angular momentum from the
          secondary star to protoplanetary objects, the giant planet of
          the system plays a key role in the radial mixing of these
          bodies and the water contents of the final terrestrial planets.
          We will discuss the results of our simulation and show that the
          formation of habitable planets in binary-planetary systems is
          more probable in binaries with moderate to large perihelia.

          Title: Maximum gravitational recoil
          Authors: Manuela Campanelli, Carlos O. Lousto, Yosef Zlochower,
          David Merritt
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figs, revtex4
          Recent calculations of gravitational radiation recoil generated
          during black-hole binary mergers have reopened the possibility
          that a merged binary can be ejected even from the nucleus of a
          massive host galaxy. Here we report the first systematic study
          of gravitational recoil of equal-mass binaries with equal, but
          anti-aligned, spins parallel to the orbital plane. Such an
          orientation of the spins is expected to maximize the recoil. We
          find that recoil velocity (which is perpendicular to the
          orbital plane) varies sinusoidally with the angle that the
          initial spin directions make with the initial linear momenta of
          each hole and scales up to a maximum of ~4000 km/s for
          maximally-rotating holes. Our results show that the amplitude
          of the recoil velocity can depend sensitively on spin
          orientations of the black holes prior to merger.

          An accident of misidentification has brought to light the
          interesting system HD 191588, a new RS CVn-type spectroscopic
          binary. A radial-velocity study of the primary star, the only
          seen component, carried out at the Observatoire de
          Haute-Provence with the Coravel instrument and subsequently at
          the Cambridge Observatories with a similar one, reveals two
          orbital motions: a short-period orbit (60 days) and a
          long-period one (about 4.5 years), so this star is a triple
          system. The following orbital elements are obtained: (1) for
          the long-period orbit P = 1667+/-17 days, T = 50901 +/-67 MJD,
          Gamma = +2.09 +/-0.07 km/s, K = 2.51 +/-0.13 km/s, e = 0.18
          +/-0.04, omega = 228deg +/- 14 deg, a1 sin i = 56.7 +/- 3.0 Gm,
          f(m) = 0.0026 +/-0.0004 M_sun, and (2) for the short-period
          orbit P = 60.0269 +/-0.0016 days, T = 50482.6 +/-3.3 MJD, gamma
          is var., K = 24.03 +/- 0.09 km/s, e = 0.012 +/-0.004, omega =
          233 deg +/-19deg, a1 sin i = 19.83 +/-0.07 Gm, f(m) = 0.0865
          +/-0.0009 M_sun. From near-infrared observations we refine the
          classification of the primary component and we found a spectral
          type of K2.5 III, and a spectrum obtained in the blue--near-UV
          spectral region reveals strong H and K emission lines of Ca II.
          The unseen secondary should be a solar-type star (F or G V);
          the minimum mass of the third body is that of a dwarf M star.
          Probably, the primary component rotates in synchronism with the
          orbital motion in the inner orbit; a model, based upon that
          hypothesis, is proposed for the system, and finally the
          connection of the inner binary to the long-period RS CVn group
          (Hall 1976) is discussed.

          Title: Hyperfast pulsars as the remnants of massive stars
          ejected from young star clusters
          Authors: V.V.Gvaramadze, A.Gualandris, S.Portegies Zwart
          Comments: 11 pages, 6 figures, 1 table
          Recent proper motion and parallax measurements for the pulsar
          PSR B1508+55 gave the highest (transverse) velocity (~1100
          km/s) ever measured for a neutron star (Chatterjee et al.
          2005). The spin-down characteristics of PSR B1508+55 (typical
          of non-recycled pulsars) imply that the high velocity of this
          pulsar cannot be solely due to disruption of a tight massive
          binary system. A possible way to account for the high velocity
          of PSR B1508+55 is to assume that at least a part of this
          velocity is due to a natal kick or a post-natal acceleration
          (Chatterjee et al. 2005). We propose an alternative explanation
          for the origin of hyperfast pulsars based on the idea that they
          could be the remnants of a symmetric supernova explosion of a
          high-velocity massive star (or its helium core) which attained
          its peculiar velocity (similar to that of the pulsar) in the
          course of a strong three or four body dynamical encounter in
          the core of the parent young massive star cluster. Our proposal
          implies that the dense cores of young massive star clusters
          (located either in the Galactic disk or near the Galactic
          centre) could also produce the so-called hypervelocity stars
          (Brown et al. 2005) -- the ordinary stars moving with a speed
          of ~1000 km/s.

          Title: Discovery of a Transient X-ray Source in the Compact

          Authors: Mihoko Yukita, Douglas A. Swartz, Roberto Soria, Allyn
          F. Tennant
          Comments: 7 pages, submitted to ApJ
          We report the discovery of an X-ray source coincident with the
          nuclear star cluster at the dynamical center of the nearby
          late-type spiral galaxy NGC 2403. The X-ray luminosity of this
          source varies from below detection levels, ~1e35 erg/s in the
          0.5-8.0 keV band, to 7e38 erg/s on timescales between
          observations of less than 2 months. The X-ray spectrum is
          well-fit by an accretion disk model consisting of multiple
          blackbody components and corresponding physically to a compact
          object mass of greater than approximately 5 solar masses. No
          pulsations nor aperiodic behavior is evident in its X-ray light
          curve on the short timescales of the individual observations.
          The X-ray properties of the source are more similar to those of
          the nuclear source X-8 in M33, believed to be a low-mass X-ray
          binary, then to those of the low-luminosity active galactic
          nucleus in NGC 4395. The brightness of the nuclear star
          cluster, M_I ~ -11.8 mag, is typical of clusters in late-type
          spirals but its effective radius, r_e \~ 12 pc, is several
          times larger than average indicating a relatively relaxed
          cluster and a low probability of a central massive object. The
          cluster has a mass 3e6 solar masses and an age of 1.4 Gyr
          estimating from its observed colors and brightness.

          Title: Further Evidence for an Elliptical Instability in
          Rotating Fluid Bars and Ellipsoidal Stars
          Authors: Shangli Ou, Joel E. Tohline, Patrick M. Motl
          Comments: 28 pages, submitted to ApJ, quicktime movies are
          available at: this http URL
          Using a three-dimensional nonlinear hydrodynamic code, we
          examine the dynamical stability of more than twenty
          self-gravitating, compressible, ellipsoidal fluid
          configurations that initially have the same velocity structure
          as Riemann S-type ellipsoids. Our focus is on ``adjoint''
          configurations, in which internal fluid motions dominate over
          the collective spin of the ellipsoidal figure; Dedekind-like
          configurations are among this group. We find that, although
          some models are stable and some are moderately unstable, the
          majority are violently unstable toward the development of
          $m=1$, $m=3$, and higher-order azimuthal distortions that
          destroy the coherent, $m=2$ bar-like structure of the initial
          ellipsoidal configuration on a dynamical time scale.
          The parameter regime over which our models are found to be
          unstable generally corresponds with the regime over which
          incompressible Riemann S-type ellipsoids have been found to be
          susceptible to an elliptical strain instability \citep{LL96}.
          We therefore suspect that an elliptical instability is
          responsible for the destruction of our compressible analogs of
          Riemann ellipsoids. The existence of the elliptical instability
          raises concerns regarding the final fate of neutron stars that
          encounter the secular bar-mode instability and regarding the
          spectrum of gravitational waves that will be radiated from such
          systems.

          We report on time-resolved CCD photometry of four outbursts of
          a short-period SU UMa-type dwarf nova, V844 Herculis. We
          successfully determined the mean superhump periods to be
          0.05584(64) days, and 0.055883(3) for the 2002 May
          superoutburst, and the 2006 April-May superoutburst,
          respectively. During the 2002 October observations, we
          confirmed that the outburst is a normal outburst, which is the
          first recorded normal outburst in V844 Her. We also examined
          superhump period changes during 2002 May and 2006 April-May
          superoutbursts, both of which showed increasing superhump
          period over the course of the plateau stage. In order to
          examine the long-term behavior of V844 Her, we analyzed
          archival data over the past ten years since the discovery of
          this binary. Although photometry is not satisfactory in some
          superoutbursts, we found that V844 Her showed no precursors and
          rebrightenings. Based on the long-term light curve, we further
          confirmed V844 Her has shown almost no normal outbursts despite
          the fact that the supercycle of the system is estimated to be
          about 300 days. In order to explain the long-term light curves
          of V844 Her, evaporation in the accretion disk may play a role
          in the avoidance of several normal outbursts, which does not
          contradict with the relatively large X-ray luminosity of V844
          Her.

          We present the culmination of our near-infrared survey of the
          optically spectroscopically identified white dwarf stars from
          the McCook & Sion catalog, conducted using photometric data
          from the Two Micron All Sky Survey final All Sky Data Release.
          The color-selection technique, which identifies candidate
          binaries containing a white dwarf and a low mass stellar (or
          sub-stellar) companion via their distinctive locus in the
          near-infrared color-color diagram, is demonstrated to be simple
          to apply and to yield candidates with a high rate of subsequent
          confirmation. We recover 105 confirmed binaries, and identify
          28 firm candidates (20 of which are new to this work) and 21
          tentative candidates (17 of which are new to this work) from
          the 2MASS data. Only a small number of candidates from our
          survey have likely companion spectral types later than M5, none
          of which is an obvious L type (i.e., potential brown dwarf)
          companion. Only one previously known WD + brown dwarf binary is
          detected. This result is discussed in the context of the 2MASS
          detection limits, as well as other recent observational surveys
          that suggest a very low rate of formation (or survival) for
          binary stars with extreme mass ratios.

          deposited energy distributions in the atmosphere with help of
          the GEANT4 code and the CORSIKA code show that more than 20% of
          this energy may be deposited at distances above 100 m from the
          shower axis.

          Title: Bulk viscosity of strange quark matter: Urca versus
          non-leptonic processes
          Authors: Basil A. Sa'd, Igor A. Shovkovy, Dirk H. Rischke
          Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures
          A general formalism for calculating the bulk viscosity of
          strange quark matter is developed. Contrary to the common
          belief that the non-leptonic processes alone give the dominant
          contribution to the bulk viscosity, the inclusion of the Urca
          processes is shown to play an important role at intermediate
          densities when the characteristic r-mode oscillation
          frequencies are not too high. The interplay of non-leptonic and
          Urca processes is analyzed in detail

          Radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars like Geminga may account for a
          number of the unidentified EGRET sources in the Galaxy. The
          number of Geminga-like pulsars is very sensitive to the
          geometry of both the gamma-ray and radio beams. Recent studies
          of the shape and polarization of pulse profiles of young radio
          pulsars have provided evidence that their radio emission
          originates in wide cone beams at altitudes that are a
          significant fraction (1 -10%) of their light cylinder radius.
          Such wide radio emission beams will be visible at a much larger
          range of observer angles than the narrow core components
          thought to originate at lower altitude. Using 3D geometrical
          modeling that includes relativistic effects from pulsar
          rotation, we study the visibility of such radio cone beams as
          well as that of the gamma-ray beams predicted by slot gap and
          outer gap models. From the results of this study one can obtain
          revised predictions for the fraction of Geminga-like, radio
          quiet pulsars present in the gamma-ray pulsar population.

          Title: The quasi-persistent neutron star soft X-ray transient
          1M 1716-315 in quiescence
          Authors: P.G. Jonker, C.G. Bassa, S. Wachter
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, accepted to MNRAS
          We report on our analysis of a 20 ksec Chandra X-ray
          observation of the quasi-persistent neutron star soft X-ray
          transient (SXT) 1M1716-315 in quiescence. Only one source was
          detected in the HEAO-I error region. Its luminosity is
          1.6E32-1.3E33 erg s-1. In this the range is dominated by the
          uncertainty in the source distance. The source spectrum is well
          described by an absorbed soft spectrum, e.g. a neutron star
          atmosphere or black body model. No optical or near-infrared
          counterpart is present at the location of the X-ray source,
          down to a magnitude limit of I> 23.5 and K_s> 19.5. The
          positional evidence, the soft X-ray spectrum together with the
          optical and near-infrared non-detections provide strong
          evidence that this source is the quiescent neutron star SXT.
          The source is 10-100 times too bright in X-rays in order to be
          explained by stellar coronal X-ray emission. Together with the
          interstellar extinction measured in outburst and estimates for
          the source distance, the reported optical and near-infrared
          limit give an upper limit on the absolute magnitude of the
          counterpart of I>8.6 and K_s>5.1. This implies that the system
          is either an ultra-compact X-ray binary having P_orb<1 hr or
          the companion star is an M-dwarf. We reconstructed the long
          term X-ray lightcurve of the source. 1M1716-315 has been active
          for more than 12 years before returning to quiescence, the
          reported Chandra observation started 16.9+-4.1 years after the
          outburst ended.

          Title: Constraining a possible time variation of the
          gravitational constant G with terrestrial nuclear laboratory
          data
          Authors: P. G. Krastev, B. A. Li (Texas A&M
          University-Commerce)
          Comments: 7 pages, 7 figures, 1 table
          Testing the constancy of the gravitational constant G has been
          a longstanding fundamental question in natural science. As
          first suggested by Jofr\'{e}, Reisenegger and Fern\'{a}ndez
          [1], Dirac's hypothesis of a decreasing gravitational constant
          $G$ with time due to the expansion of the Universe would induce
          changes in the composition of neutron stars, causing
          dissipation and internal heating. Eventually, neutron stars
          reach their quasi-stationary states where cooling due to
          neutrino and photon emissions balances the internal heating.
          The correlation of surface temperatures and radii of some old
          neutron stars may thus carry useful information about the
          changing rate of G. Using the density dependence of the nuclear
          symmetry energy constrained by recent terrestrial laboratory
          data on isospin diffusion in heavy-ion reactions at
          intermediate energies and the size of neutron skin in
          $^{208}Pb$ within the gravitochemical heating formalism, we
          obtain an upper limit of the relative changing rate of
          $|\dot{G}/G|\le4\times 10^{-12}yr^{-1}$ consistent with the
          best available estimates in the literature.

          Parameters from the literature, such as positions,
          photoelectric absorption (nH), spin and orbital periods, and
          distances or redshifts, were collected for all ~500 sources
          detected by INTEGRAL-ISGRI so far. We investigate where new and
          previously-known sources detected by ISGRI fit in the parameter
          space of high-energy objects, and we use the parameters to test
          correlations expected from theoretical predictions. For
          example, the influence of the local absorbing matter on
          periodic modulations is studied for Galactic High-Mass X-ray
          Binaries (HMXBs) with OB supergiant and Be companions. We
          examine the spatial distribution of different types of sources
          in the Milky Way using various projections of the Galactic
          plane, in order to highlight signatures of stellar evolution
          and to speculate on the origin of the group of sources whose
          classifications are still uncertain. ISGRI has detected similar
          numbers of X-ray Binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The
          former group contains new members of the class of HMXBs with
          supergiant stellar companions. Thanks to these additional
          systems, we are able to show that HMXBs are generally
          segregated in plots of intrinsic nH versus the orbital period
          of the system and versus the spin period of the pulsar, based
          on whether the companion is a Be or an OB supergiant star. We
          also find a tentative but expected anti-correlation between nH
          and the orbital period, and a possible and unexpected
          correlation between the nH and the spin period. While only a
          handful of new Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) have been
          discovered, there are many sources that remain unclassified and
          they appear to follow a spatial distribution typical of
          Galactic sources (especially LMXBs) rather than extragalactic
          sources.

          and Astrophysical Transactions)
          VLBI observations of the Crab pulsar with the 64-m radio
          telescope at Kalyazin (Russia) and the 46-m radio telescope of
          the Algonquin Radio Observatory (Canada) at 2.2 GHz and
          single-dish observations of the millisecond pulsar B1937+21
          with the GBT (USA) at 2.1 GHz were conducted to probe the
          interstellar medium and study the properties of giant pulses.
          The VLBI data were processed with a dedicated software
          correlator, which allowed us to obtain the visibility of single
          giant pulses. Two frequency scales of 50 and 450 kHz were found
          in the diffraction spectra of giant pulses from the Crab
          pulsar. The location of the scattering region was estimated to
          be close to the outer edge of the nebula. No correlation was
          found between the power spectra of giant pulses at left- and
          right-hand circular polarization. We explain this lack of
          correlation through the influence of the strong magnetic field
          on circularly polarized emission in the region close to the
          Crab pulsar.
          Combining the measurement of the decorrelation bandwidth with
          that of the scattering time of giant pulses for B1937+21, we
          found three frequency scales of 1.7, 3.8, and 16.5 MHz. The
          scattering time of giant pulses of B1937+21 at 2.1 GHz was
          found to be 40+-4 ns. We obtained an upper limit of the
          intrinsic width of giant pulses from B1937+21 of less than 8
          ns. The frequency dependences of the scattering times for the
          Crab pulsar and PSR B1937+21 were found to be different. They
          are characterized by exponents of -3.5 and -4.2, respectively.
          We attribute the difference to the large influence of
          scattering in the Crab nebula.

          Title: Timing the Eccentric Binary Millisecond Pulsar in NGC
          1851
          Authors: Paulo C. Freire, Scott M. Ransom, Yashwant Gupta
          Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal
          We have used the Green Bank Telescope to observe the
          millisecond pulsar PSR J0514-4002A on 43 occasions spread over
          2 years. This 5-ms pulsar is located in the globular cluster
          NGC 1851; it belongs to a binary system and has a highly
          eccentric (e = 0.888) orbit. We have obtained a phase-coherent
          timing solution for this object, including very precise
          position, spin and orbital parameters. The pulsar is located
          4.6" (about 1.3 core radii) from the center of the cluster, and
          is likely to lie on its more distant half. The non-detection of
          eclipses at superior conjunction can be used, given the
          peculiar geometry of this system, to rule out the possibility
          of an extended companion. We have measured the rate of advance
          of periastron for this binary system to be $\dot{\omega}$ =
          0.01289(4) degrees per year, which if due completely to general
          relativity, implies a total system mass of 2.453(14) solar
          masses. Given the known mass function, the pulsar mass has to
          be < 1.5 solar masses, and the mass of the companion has to be
          > 0.96 solar masses, implying that it is a heavy white dwarf.
          The 350-MHz flux density of this pulsar varies between 0.2 and
          1.4 mJy; the origin of these variations is not known.

          Title: Elastic stars in general relativity: IV. Axial
          perturbations
          Authors: Max Karlovini, Lars Samuelsson
          Comments: 18 pages, no figures
          This is the fourth paper in a series that attempt to put
          forward a consistent framework for modelling solid regions in
          neutron stars. Here we turn our attention to axial
          perturbations of spherically symmetric spacetimes using a gauge
          invariant approach due to one of us. Using the formalism
          developed in the first paper in the series it turns out that
          the matter perturbations are neatly expressible in terms of a
          ``metric'' tensor field depending only on the speeds of shear
          wave propagation along the principal directions in the solid.
          The results are applicable to a wide class of elastic materials
          and does not assume material isotropy nor quasi-Hookean
          behaviour. The perturbation equations are then specialised to a
          static background and are given by two coupled wave equations.
          Our formalism is thus slightly simpler than the previously
          existing results of Shumaker & Thorne, where an additional
          initial value equation needs to be solved. The simplification
          is mainly due to the gauge invariance of our approach and shows
          up also in somewhat simpler boundary conditions. We also give a
          first order formulation suitable for numerical integration of
          the quasi-normal mode problem of a neutron star. The relations
          between the gauge independent variables and the, in general,
          gauge dependent perturbed metric and strain tensor are
          explicitly given.

          Aims. We present the first long-term pulse profile study of the
          X-ray pulsar SAX J2103.5+4545. Our main goal is to study the
          pulse shape correlation either with luminosity, time or energy.
          Methods. This Be/X-ray binary system was observed from 1999 to
          2004 by RXTE PCA, and by INTEGRAL from 2002 to 2005, during the
          Performance and Verification (PV) phase and the Galactic Plane
          Scan survey (GPS). X-ray pulse profiles were obtained in
          different energy ranges. The long-term spectral variability of
          this source is studied. The long-term flux, frequency and
          spin-up rate histories are computed. A new set of orbital
          parameters are also determined.
          Results. The pulse shape is complex and highly variable either
          with time or luminosity. However, an energy dependence pattern
          was found. Single, double, triple or even quadruple peaks pulse
          profile structure was obtained. It was confirmed that SAX
          J2103.5+4545 becomes harder when the flux is higher. The new
          orbital solution obtained is: P_orb= 12.66528+-0.00051 days, e
          = 0.401+-0.018, w = 241.36+-2.18 and a_xsin i = 80.81+-0.67

          We report the discovery of the partially eclipsing binary LP
          133-373. Nearly identical eclipses along with observed
          photometric colors and spectroscopy indicate that it is a pair
          of chromospherically active dM4 stars in a circular 1.6 d
          orbit. Light and velocity curve modeling to our differential
          photometry and velocity data show that each star has a mass and
          radius of 0.340+/-0.014 M_sun and 0.33+/-0.02 R_sun. The binary
          is itself part of a common proper motion pair with LP 133-374 a
          cool DC or possible DA white dwarf with a mass of 0.49-0.82
          M_sun, which would make the system at least 3 Gyr old.

          Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures
          Nucleosynthesis, on the surface of accreting neutron stars,
          produces a range of chemical elements. We perform molecular
          dynamics simulations of crystallization to see how this complex
          composition forms new neutron star crust. We find chemical
          separation, with the liquid ocean phase greatly enriched in low
          atomic number elements compared to the solid crust. This phase
          separation should change many crust properties such as the
          thermal conductivity and shear modulus. The concentration of
          carbon, if present, is enriched in the ocean. This may allow
          unstable thermonuclear burning of the carbon and help explain
          the ignition of the very energetic explosions known as
          superbursts.

          Authors: P. Reig (FORTH/University of Crete)
          Comments: accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We have investigated the long-term X-ray variability, defined
          as the root-mean-square (rms) of the ASM RXTE light curves, of
          a set of galactic Be/X-ray binaries and searched for
          correlations with system parameters, such as the spin period of
          the neutron star and the orbital period and eccentricity of the
          binary. We find that systems with larger rms are those
          harbouring fast rotating neutron stars, low eccentric and
          narrow orbits. These relationships can be explained as the
          result of the truncation of the circumstellar disc. We also
          present an updated version of the Halpha equivalent
          width-orbital period diagram, including sources in the SMC.
          This diagram provides strong observational evidence of the
          interaction of neutron star with the circumstellar envelope of
          its massive companion.

          K star transferring mass to a white dwarf by way of an
          accretion disk. We have obtained new spectroscopic observations
          of SS Cyg with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). Fits of
          synthetic spectra for Roche-lobe-filling stars to the
          absorption-line spectrum of the K star yield the amplitude of
          the K star's radial velocity curve and the mass ratio: K_{K} =
          162.5 +/- 1.0 km/s and q= M_{K} /M_{wd} = 0.685 +/- 0.015. The
          fits also show that the accretion disk and white dwarf
          contribute a fraction f = 0.535 +/- 0.075 of the total flux at
          5500 angstroms. Taking the weighted average of our results with
          previously published results obtained using similar techniques,
          we find <K_{K}> = 163.7 +/- 0.7 km/s and <q> = 0.683 +/- 0.012.
          The orbital light curve of SS Cyg shows an ellipsoidal
          variation diluted by light from the disk and white dwarf. From
          an analysis of the ellipsoidal variations we limit the orbital
          inclination to the range 45 deg. <= i <= 56 deg. The derived
          masses of the K star and white dwarf are M_{K} = 0.55 +/- 0.13
          M_sun and M_{wd} = 0.81 +/- 0.19 M_sun, where the uncertainties
          are dominated by systematic errors in the orbital inclination.
          The K star in SS Cyg is 10% to 50% larger than an unevolved
          star with the same mass and thus does not follow the
          mass-radius relation for Zero-Age Main-Sequence stars; nor does
          it follow the ZAMS mass/spectral-type relation. Its mass and
          spectral type are, however, consistent with models in which the
          core hydrogen has been significantly depleted.

          Title: Brown dwarf formation by binary disruption
          Authors: Simon P. Goodwin (Sheffield), Ant Whitworth (Cardiff)
          Comments: 6 pages, no figures. Accepted for A&A
          Context: The principal mechanism by which brown dwarfs form,
          and its relation to the formation of higher-mass (i.e.
          hydrogen-burning) stars, is poorly understood. Aims: We
          advocate a new model for the formation of brown dwarfs.
          Methods: In this model, brown dwarfs are initially binary
          companions, formed by gravitational fragmentation of the outer
          parts (R > 100 AU) of protostellar discs around low-mass
          hydrogen-burning stars. Most of these binaries are then gently
          disrupted by passing stars to create a largely single
          population of brown dwarfs and low-mass hydrogen-burning stars.
          Results: This idea is consistent with the excess of binaries
          found in low-density pre-main sequence populations, like that
          in Taurus, where they should survive longer than in denser
          clusters. Conclusions: If brown dwarfs form in this way, as
          companions to more massive stars, the difficulty of forming
          very low-mass prestellar cores is avoided. Since the disrupted
          binaries will tend to be those involving low-mass components
          and wide orbits, and since disruption will be due to the gentle
          tides of passing stars (rather than violent N-body interactions
          in small-N sub-clusters), the liberated brown dwarfs will have
          velocity dispersions and spatial distributions very similar to
          higher-mass stars, and they will be able to retain discs, and
          thereby to sustain accretion and outflows. Thus the problems
          associated with the ejection and turbulence mechanisms can be
          avoided. This model implies that most, possibly all, stars and
          brown dwarfs form in binary or multiple systems.

          Comments: 33 pages invited review, 363rd Heraeus Seminar
          "Neutron Stars and Pulsars", Bad Honnef, 2006
          We review current theoretical ideas on pulsar winds and their
          surrounding nebulae. Relativistic MHD models of the wind of the
          aligned rotator, and of the striped wind, together with models
          of magnetic dissipation are discussed. It is shown that the
          observational signature of this dissipation is likely to be
          point-like, rather than extended, and that pulsed emission may
          be produced. The possible pulse shapes and polarisation
          properties are described. Particle acceleration at the
          termination shock of the wind is discussed, and it is argued
          that two distinct mechanisms must be operating, with the
          first-order Fermi mechanism producing the high-energy electrons
          (above 1 TeV) and either magnetic annihilation or resonant
          absorption of ion cyclotron waves responsible for the 100 MeV
          to 1 TeV electrons. Finally, MHD models of the morphology of
          the nebula are discussed and compared with observation.

          Title: The Oblate Schwarzschild Approximation for Light Curves
          of Rapidly Rotating Neutron Stars
          Authors: Sharon M. Morsink, Denis A. Leahy, Coire Cadeau, John
          Braga
          Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures. Submitted to the Astrophysical
          Journal
          We present a simple method for including the oblateness of a
          rapidly rotating neutron star when fitting X-ray light curves.
          In previous work we showed that the oblateness induced by
          rotation at frequencies above 300 Hz produces a geometric
          effect which needs to be accounted for when modelling light
          curves to extract constraints on the neutron star's mass and
          radius. In our model X-rays are emitted from the surface of an
          oblate neutron star and propagate to the observer along
          geodesics of the Schwarzschild metric for a spherical neutron
          star. Doppler effects due to rotation are added in the same
          manner as in the case of a spherical neutron star. We show that
          this model captures the most important effects due to the
          neutron star's rotation. We also explain how the geometric
          oblateness effect can rival the Doppler effect for some
          emission geometries.

          Title: The Higgs field can be expressed through the lepton and

          Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Phenomenology; Mathematical
          Physics
          The Higgs field is a central point of the Standard Model
          supplying masses to other fields through the symmetry breaking
          mechanism. However, it is associated with an elementary
          particle which is not yet discovered experimentally. In this
          short note I suggest a way for expressing the Higgs field
          through other fields of the Standard Model. If this is the
          case, being not an independent field, the Higgs field does not
          require an elementary particle to be associated with it.

          Title: The initial mass function of simple and composite
          stellar populations
          Authors: Pavel Kroupa (AIfA, Bonn)
          Comments: 70 pages, 23 figures, 3 tables, in Proceedings of the
          Meeting "Resolved Stellar Populations", Cancun, Mexico, 18-22
          April 2005, eds. D. Valls-Gabaud and M. Chavez, ASP Conf. Ser.
          (in press). This version is slightly modified in having
          additional clarifications and a few newer references than the
          proceedings version
          (abridged) The case can be made for a rather universal stellar
          IMF form that can be approximated by a two-part power-law
          function in the stellar regime. However, there exists a
          possible hint for a systematic variation with metallicity. A
          picture is emerging according to which the binary properties of
          very-low-mass stars (VLMSs) and BDs may be fundamentally
          different from those of late-type stars implying the probable
          existence of a discontinuity in the IMF, but the surveys also
          appear to suggest the number of BDs per star to be independent
          of the physical conditions of current Galactic star formation.
          Star-burst clusters and thus globular cluster may, however,
          have a much larger abundance of BDs. Very recent advances have
          allowed the measurement of the physical upper stellar mass
          limit, which also appears to be disconcertingly robust to
          variations in metallicity. Furthermore, it now appears that
          star clusters may be formed such that the most-massive stars
          just forming terminate further star-formation within the
          particular cluster. Populations formed from many star clusters,
          composite populations, would then have steeper IMFs (fewer
          massive stars per low-mass star) than the simple populations in
          the constituent clusters. A near invariant star-cluster mass
          function implies the maximal cluster mass to correlate with the
          galaxy-wide star-formation rate. This then leads to the result
          that the composite-stellar IMFs vary in dependence of galaxy
          type, with potentially dramatic implications for theories of
          galaxy formation and evolution.

          Letter
          We present an empirical spectral modelling of the high energy
          emission of the anomalous X-ray pulsar 4U 0142+614, based on
          simultaneous Swift and INTEGRAL observations from X to
          gamma-ray energies. We adopted models contained in the XSPEC
          analysis package, as well as models based on recent theoretical
          studies, and restricted ourselves to those combinations of up
          to three components which produce a good fit while requiring
          the lowest number of free parameters. Only three models were
          found to fit satisfactorily the 0.5-250keV spectrum of 4U
          0142+614: i) a ~0.4keV blackbody and two power-laws, ii) a
          resonant cyclotron scattering model plus a power-law and iii)
          two log-parabolic functions. We found that only the latter two
          models do not over-predict the infrared/optical emission
          observed simultaneously from this AXP, and only the
          log-parabolic functions can naturally account for the upper
          limits set by COMPTEL in the gamma-ray range. A possible
          interpretation of the two log-parabolae in terms of inverse
          Compton scattering of soft X-ray photons by very energetic
          particles is discussed.

          Title: Black Hole Spin Evolution: Implications for Short-hard

          The evolution of the spin and tilt of black holes in compact
          black hole - neutron star and black hole - black hole binary
          systems is investigated via the population synthesis method.
          Based on recent results on accretion at super Eddington rates
          in slim disk models, estimates of natal kicks, and the results
          regarding fallback in supernova models, we obtain the black
          hole spin and misalignment. It is found that the spin
          parameter, a_spin, is less than 0.5 for initially non rotating
          black holes and the tilt, i_tilt, is less than 40 deg for 50%
          of the systems in black hole - neutron star binaries. Upon
          comparison with the results of black hole - neutron star merger
          calculations we estimate that only a small fraction (~0.02) of
          these systems can potentially produce a short-hard gamma ray
          burst. Only for high initial black hole spin parameters
          (a_spin>0.6) can this fraction be significant (~0.35). For the
          majority of black holes in black hole - neutron star systems
          the spin magnitude is increased to a_spin>0.1 and the degree of
          spin misalignment (i_tilt ~ 40 deg) is sufficiently high that
          the predicted gravitational radiation signal significantly
          differs from that for non rotating black holes. However, due to
          the (i) insensitivity of signal detection techniques to the
          black hole spin and the (ii) predicted overall low contribution
          of black hole binaries to the signal we find that the detection
          of gravitational waves are not greatly inhibited by current
          searches with non spinning templates. It is pointed out that
          the detection of a black hole - black hole binary inspiral
          system with LIGO or VIRGO may provide a direct measurement of
          the initial spin of a black hole.

          Comments: Accepted for inclusion in "The Kuiper Belt",
          University of Arizona Press, Space Science Series
          Binaries have played a crucial role many times in the history
          of modern astronomy and are doing so again in the rapidly
          evolving exploration of the Kuiper Belt. The large fraction of
          transneptunian objects that are binary or multiple, 48 such
          systems are now known, has been an unanticipated windfall.
          Separations and relative magnitudes measured in discovery
          images give important information on the statistical properties
          of the binary population that can be related to competing
          models of binary formation. Orbits, derived for 13 systems,
          provide a determination of the system mass. Masses can be used
          to derive densities and albedos when an independent size
          measurement is available. Angular momenta and relative sizes of
          the majority of binaries are consistent with formation by
          dynamical capture. The small satellites of the largest
          transneptunian objects, in contrast, are more likely formed
          from collisions. Correlations of the fraction of binaries with
          different dynamical populations or with other physical
          variables have the potential to constrain models of the origin
          and evolution of the transneptunian population as a whole.
          Other means of studying binaries have only begun to be
          exploited, including lightcurve, color, and spectral data.
          Because of the several channels for obtaining unique physical
          information, it is already clear that binaries will emerge as
          one of the most useful tools for unraveling the many
          complexities of transneptunian space.

          Cloud
          Authors: A. Derekas, L.L. Kiss, T.R. Bedding
          Comments: 11 figures, 9 pages, accepted for publication in ApJ
          Eclipsing binaries offer a unique opportunity to determine
          fundamental physical parameters of stars using the constraints
          on the geometry of the systems. Here we present a reanalysis of
          publicly available two-color observations of about 6800 stars
          in the Large Magellanic Cloud, obtained by the MACHO project
          between 1992 and 2000 and classified as eclipsing variable
          stars. Of these, less than half are genuine eclipsing binaries.
          We determined new periods and classified the stars, 3031 in
          total, using the Fourier parameters of the phased light curves.
          The period distribution is clearly bimodal, reflecting refer to
          the separate groups of more massive blue main sequence objects
          and low mass red giants. The latter resemble contact binaries
          and obey a period-luminosity relation. Using evolutionary
          models, we identified foreground stars. The presented database
          has been cleaned of artifacts and misclassified variables, thus
          allowing searches for apsidal motion, tertiary components,
          pulsating stars in binary systems and secular variations with
          time-scales of several years.

          Be/X-ray binaries comprise roughly two-thirds of the high-mass
          X-ray binaries (HMXBs), which is a class of X-ray binaries that
          results from the high mass of the companion or donor star (> 10
          solar masses). Currently the formation and evolution of X-ray
          producing Be binaries is a matter of great debate. Modelling of
          these systems requires knowledge of Be star evolution and also
          consideration of how the evolution changes when the star is in
          close proximity to a companion. Within this work we complete a
          full population synthesis study of Be binaries for the Galaxy.
          The results for the first time match aspects of the
          observational data, most notably the observed upper limit to
          the period distribution. We conclude that greater detailed
          studies on the evolution of Be stars within X-ray binaries
          needs to be completed, so that rapid binary evolution
          population synthesis packages may best evolve these systems.

          Title: The main- interpulse interaction of PSR B1702-19
          Authors: P. Weltevrede, G. A. E. Wright, B. W. Stappers
          Comments: 13 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          This paper reports on single-pulse radio observations of PSR
          B1702-19 and their implications for pulsar emission theories.
          These observations were made with the Westerbork Synthesis
          Radio Telescope at 1380 and 328 MHz. The PA-swing is used to
          constrain possible geometries of the pulsar and the
          single-pulse data is analysed for subpulse modulation
          correlations between the main pulse and interpulse. We confirm
          earlier conclusions that the dipole axis of this pulsar is
          almost perpendicular to its rotation axis, and report that both
          its main pulse and interpulse are modulated with a periodicity
          around 10.4 times the pulsar's rotation. Allowing for the
          half-period delay between main pulse and interpulse the
          modulation is found to be precisely in phase. Despite small
          secular variations in the periodicity, the phase-locking
          continues over all timescales ranging up to several years. The
          precision of the phase locking is difficult for current
          emission theories to explain if the main pulse and interpulse
          originate from opposing magnetic poles. We therefore also
          explore the possibility of a bidirectional model, in which all
          the modulated emission comes from one pole, but is seen from
          two sides and slightly displaced by aberration and time-delay.
          In this model the unmodulated emission is directed to us from
          the opposite pole, requiring the emission of the main pulse to
          originate from two different poles. This is difficult to
          reconcile with the observed smooth PA-swing. Whichever model
          turns out to be correct, the answer will have important
          implications for emission theories.

          spectroscopy of the HH 30 jet. We measured proper motions of
          about 100-300 km/s for the HH 30 jet and counterjet, and of
          about 120 km/s for the HL Tau jet. Inclination angles with
          respect to the plane of the sky are 0-40 deg for the HH 30 jet
          and 60 deg for the HL Tau jet. Comparison with previous
          observations suggests that most of the jet knots consist of
          persisting structures. Also, we corroborate that the HH 30-N
          knots correspond to the head of the HH 30 jet. The overall HH
          30 jet structure can be well described by a wiggling ballistic
          jet, arising either by the orbital motion of the jet source
          around a primary or by precession of the jet axis because of
          the tidal effects of a companion. In the first scenario, the
          orbital period would be 53 yr and the total mass 0.25-2 solar
          masses. In the precession scenario, the mass of the jet source
          would be 0.1-1 solar masses, the orbital period <1 yr, and the
          mass of the companion less than a few times 0.01 solar masses,
          thus being a substellar object or a giant exoplanet. In both
          scenarios a binary system with a separation <18 AU (<0.13
          arcsec) is required. Since the radius of the flared disk
          observed with the HST is about 250 AU, we conclude that this
          disk appears to be circumbinary rather than circumstellar,
          suggesting that the search for the collimating agent of the HH
          30 jet should be carried out at much smaller scales.

          natural to review both sessions in one joint contribution to
          the MG11 Proceedings. The summary places the delivered talks in

          Title: Coupling between the 45 Hz Horizontal-Branch Oscillation
          and the Normal Branch Oscillation in Scorpius X-1
          Authors: Wenfei Yu
          Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL
          The observations of the bright persistent neutron star low-mass
          X-ray binary (LMXB) Sco X-1 performed with the {\it Rossi X-ray
          Timing Explorer} (RXTE) show a $\sim$ 6 Hz normal-branch
          oscillation (NBO), a $\sim$ 45 Hz horizontal-branch oscillation
          (HBO), and twin kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) on its
          normal branch simultaneously. We have found that the fractional
          amplitude of the HBO corresponding to the NBO phase of high
          flux is 1.1%, while that of the NBO phase of low flux is
          undetectable, with a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.4%, implying
          that the HBO strength varies with the NBO phase in an opposite
          way to that of the lower kHz QPO previously found, and suggests
          that the condition for the generation of the HBO is met when
          the NBO flux is high. The 6 Hz NBO in Sco X-1 connects the 45
          Hz HBO and the twin kHz QPO together, showing a unique picture
          indicating a coupling between the QPOs, which has never been
          observed in other neutron star LMXBs. We discuss the
          implications for current models of the 45 Hz HBO, the 6 Hz NBO,
          and the twin kHz QPOs.

          Title: Gravitational recoil: signatures on the massive black
          hole population
          Authors: Marta Volonteri
          Comments: Submitted to ApJL
          In the last stages of a black hole merger, the binary can
          experience a recoil due to asymmetric emission of gravitational
          radiation. Recent numerical relativity simulations suggest that
          the recoil velocity can be as high as a few thousands
          kilometers per second for particular configurations. We
          consider here the effect of this worst case scenario on the
          hierarchical evolution of the massive black hole (MBH)
          population, where sensible values for binaries mass ratios and
          spins are assumed. The orbital configuration is chosen to be
          the one yielding the highest possible kick. We explore two
          routes for MBH formation which lead to different ejection
          histories: either that MBHs are the remnants of the first
          generation of stars, or that MBHs form by direct collapse. We
          show that the gravitational recoil does not pose a threat to
          the evolution of the MBH population that we observe locally in
          either case. The gravitational recoil is instead a real hazard
          for (i) MBHs in biased halos at high-redshift, where mergers
          are more common, and the potential wells still relatively
          shallow. Similarly, it is very challenging to retain (ii) MBHs
          merging in star clusters.

          Title: Pulsed X-ray Emission from Pulsar A in the Double Pulsar
          System J0737-3039

          Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures, emulateapj; submitted to ApJ
          The double pulsar system J0737-3039 is not only a test bed for
          General Relativity and theories of gravity, but also provides a
          unique laboratory for probing the relativistic winds of neutron
          stars. Recent X-ray observations have revealed a point source
          at the position of PSR J0737-3039, but have failed to detect
          pulsations or orbital modulation. Here we report on Chandra
          X-ray Observatory High Resolution Camera observations of the
          double pulsar. We detect deeply modulated, double-peaked X-ray
          pulses at the period of PSR J0737-3039A, similar in appearance
          to the observed radio pulses. The pulsed fraction is
          approximately 70%. Although purely non-thermal emission is
          consistent with the data, the X-ray pulse morphology of A, in
          combination with previously reported spectral properties of the
          X-ray emission, suggests the existence of both non-thermal
          magnetospheric emission and a broad sinusoidal thermal emission
          component from the neutron star surface. No pulsations are
          detected from pulsar B, and there is no evidence for orbital
          modulation. The absence of orbital modulation is consistent
          with theoretical expectations of a Poynting-dominated
          relativistic wind at the termination shock between the
          magnetosphere of B and the wind from A, and with the small
          fraction of the energy outflow from A intercepted by the
          termination shock.

          Astrophysics)

          2007 issue
          The Mercury-Manganese star Phi Her is a well known
          spectroscopic binary that has been the subject of a recent
          study by Zavala et al. (2006), in which they resolved the
          companion using long-baseline interferometry. The total mass of
          the binary is now fairly well established, but the combination
          of the spectroscopy with the astrometry has not resulted in
          individual masses consistent with the spectral types of the
          components. The motion of the center of light of Phi Her was
          clearly detected by the Hipparcos satellite. Here we make use
          of the Hipparcos intermediate data (`abscissa residuals') and
          show that by combining them in an optimal fashion with the
          interferometry the individual masses can be obtained reliably
          using only astrometry. We re-examine and then incorporate
          existing radial-velocity measurements into the orbital
          solution, obtaining improved masses of 3.05 +/- 0.24 M_Sun and
          1.614 +/- 0.066 M_Sun that are consistent with the theoretical
          mass-luminosity relation from recent stellar evolution models.
          These mass determinations provide important information for the
          understanding of the nature of this peculiar class of stars.

          Title: Burial of the polar magnetic field of an accreting
          neutron star. II. Hydromagnetic stability of axisymmetric
          equilibria
          Authors: D. J. B. Payne, A. Melatos
          Comments: 16 pages, 23 figures, accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          The theory of polar magnetic burial in accreting neutron stars
          predicts that a mountain of accreted material accumulates at
          the magnetic poles of the star, and that, as the mountain
          spreads equatorward, it is confined by, and compresses, the
          equatorial magnetic field. Here, we extend previous,
          axisymmetric, Grad-Shafranov calculations of the hydromagnetic
          structure of a magnetic mountain up to accreted masses as high
          as $\Ma = 6\times 10^{-4}\Msun$, by importing the output from
          previous calculations (which were limited by numerical problems
          and the formation of closed bubbles to $\Ma < 10^{-4}\Msun$)
          into the time-dependent, ideal-magnetohydrodynamic code ZEUS-3D
          and loading additional mass onto the star dynamically. The rise
          of buoyant magnetic bubbles through the accreted layer is
          observed in these experiments. We also investigate the
          stability of the resulting hydromagnetic equilibria by
          perturbing them in ZEUS-3D. Surprisingly, it is observed that
          the equilibria are marginally stable for all $\Ma\leq 6\times
          10^{-4}\Msun$; the mountain oscillates persistently when
          perturbed, in a combination of Alfv\'en and acoustic modes,
          without appreciable damping or growth, and is therefore not
          disrupted (apart from a transient Parker instability initially,
          which expels $< 1 %$ of the mass and magnetic flux).

          Authors: Ramanpreet Kaur, Biswajit Paul, Harsha Raichur, Ram
          Sagar
          Comments: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal
          We report here discovery of Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPOs)
          in the High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) Pulsar XTE J0111.20-7317
          during a transient outburst in this source in December 1998.
          Using observations made with the proportional counter array of
          the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer during the second peak and the
          declining phase of this outburst we have discovered a QPO
          feature at a frequency of 1.27 Hz. We have ruled out the
          possibility that the observed QPOs can instead be from the
          neighbouring bright X-ray pulsar SMC X-1. This is the highest
          frequency QPO feature ever detected in any HMXB pulsar. In the
          absence of a cyclotron absorption feature in the X-ray
          spectrum, the QPO feature, along with the pulse period and
          X-ray flux measurement measurement helps us to constrain the
          magnetic field strength of the neutron star.

          Authors: T.V. Zaqarashvili, G. Belvedere
          Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures, accepted in ApJ
          The weakly non-linear interaction of slow magnetoacoustic and
          torsional Alfven waves propagating along an unperturbed
          poloidal magnetic field in a stellar interior is studied in the
          high plasma beta limit. It is shown that slow magnetoacoustic
          waves parametrically drive torsional modes with the half
          frequency and wave number. Therefore global slow
          magnetoacoustic waves which have a radial velocity
          polarization, may amplify the torsional oscillations. Possible
          applications of this mechanism to the Sun and binary stars are
          briefly discussed.

          Authors: J.E. Horvath (IAG- Sao Paulo U.)
          Comments: 23 pp., 1 .eps figure
          We present a short review of strange quark matter in supernovae
          and related explosions, with particular attention to the issue
          of the propagation of the combustion in the dense stellar
          environment. We discuss the instabilities affecting the flame
          and present some new results of application to the turbulent
          regime. The transition to the distributed regime and further
          deflagration-to-detonation mechanism are addressed. Finally we
          show that magnetic fields may be important for this problem,
          because they modify the flame through the dispersion relations
          which characterize the instabilities. A tentative
          classification of explosive phenomena according to the value of
          the average local magnetic field affecting the burning and the
          type of stellar system in which this conversion is taking place
          is presented. As a general result, we conclude that ``short''
          conversion timescales are always favored, since the burning
          falls in either the turbulent Rayleigh-Taylor (or even the
          distributed) regime, or perhaps in the detonation one. In both
          cases the velocity is several orders of magnitude larger than
          $v_{lam}$, and therefore the latter is irrelevant in practice
          for this problem. Interesting perspectives for the study of
          this problem are still open and important issues need to be
          addressed.

          Title: Upper limit map of a background of gravitational waves
          Authors: The LIGO Scientific Collaboration: B. Abbott, et al
          Comments: 11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables
          We searched for an anisotropic background of gravitational
          waves using data from the LIGO S4 science run and a method that
          is optimized for point sources. This is appropriate if, for
          example, the gravitational wave background is dominated by a
          small number of distinct astrophysical sources. No signal was
          seen. Upper limit maps were produced assuming two different
          power laws for the source strain power spectrum. For an f^-3
          power law and using the 50 Hz to 1.8 kHz band the upper limits
          on the source strain power spectrum vary between 1.2e-48 Hz^-1
          (100 Hz/f)^3 and 1.2e-47 Hz^-1 (100 Hz /f)^3, depending on the
          position in the sky. Similarly, in the case of constant strain
          power spectrum, the upper limits vary between 8.5e-49 Hz^-1 and
          6.1e-48 Hz^-1.
          As a side product a limit on an isotropic background of
          gravitational waves was also obtained. All limits are at the
          90% confidence level. Finally, as an application, we focused on
          the direction of Sco-X1, the closest low-mass X-ray binary. We
          compare the upper limit on strain amplitude obtained by this
          method to expectations based on the X-ray luminosity of Sco-X1.

          Comments: 11 pages, 8 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          With its relatively long observation time per pointing, the
          Parkes multibeam survey was effective in detecting nulling
          pulsars. We have made 2-hour observations of 23 pulsars which
          showed evidence for pulse nulling or mode changing in the
          survey data. Because of the low flux density of these pulsars,
          in most cases averaging times of between 10 s and 60 s were
          necessary and so this analysis is insensitive to very short
          nulls. Seven of the pulsars had null fractions of more than 40%
          with the largest having a lower limit of 95%. Mode changes were
          observed in six pulsars with clear relationships between
          nulling and mode changing in some cases. Combined with earlier
          results, the data suggest that large null fractions are more
          related to large characteristic age than to long pulse period.
          The observations suggest that nulling and mode changing are
          different manifestations of the same phenomenon.

          Comments: Accepted for ApJ
          The Mira AB system is a nearby (~107 pc) example of a wind
          accreting binary star system. In this class of system, the wind
          from a mass-losing red giant star (Mira A) is accreted onto a
          companion (Mira B), as indicated by an accretion shock
          signature in spectra at ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths.
          Using novel imaging techniques, we report the detection of
          emission at mid-infrared wavelengths between 9.7 and 18.3
          $\mu$m from the vicinity of Mira B but with a peak at a radial
          position about 10 AU closer to the primary Mira A. We interpret
          the mid-infrared emission as the edge of an optically-thick
          accretion disk heated by Mira A. The discovery of this new
          class of accretion disk fed by M-giant mass loss implies a
          potential population of young planetary systems in white-dwarf
          binaries which has been little explored, despite being
          relatively common in the solar neighborhood.

          ~0.02 mJy, while the limits on the flux of single pulses are ~1
          Jy or better. The corresponding radio luminosity limits are
          significantly below the observed luminosities of the majority
          of the observed radio pulsars, and they are significantly below
          the radio luminosity of XTE J1810-197, the only AXP known thus
          far to emit radio pulsations, at the epoch when radio pulses
          were first detected from this source. Our null results support
          the hypothesis that pulsed radio emission from AXPs is only
          present in conjunction with X-ray outburst activity. However,
          we cannot rule out the possibility that pulsed radio emission
          is present, but that it is too weak to be detected in our
          observations, or that unfavorable viewing geometries prevent
          this emission from being seen by terrestrial observers. Given
          the possible association between the radio emission and
          transient X-ray behavior of XTE J1810-197, continued radio
          searches of these and other AXPs at different epochs are
          warranted, particularly after periods of X-ray burst activity.

          Title: Superfluid neutron star turbulence
          Authors: N. Andersson, T. Sidery, G.L. Comer
          Comments: 15 pages, 2 figures
          We analyse the implications of superfluid turbulence for
          neutron star physics. We begin by extending our previous
          results for the mutual friction force for a straight vortex
          array to account for the self-induced flow which arises when
          the vortices are curved. We then discuss Vinen's
          phenomenological model for isotropic turbulence, and derive the
          associated (Gorter-Mellink) form for the mutual friction. We
          compare this derivation to a more recent analysis of Schwarz,
          which sheds light on various involved issues. Having discussed
          isotropic turbulence, we argue that this case is unlikely to be
          relevant for neutron stars. Instead we expect a rotating
          neutron star to exhibit polarised turbulence, where relative
          flow drives the turbulence and rotation counteracts it. Based
          on recent results for superfluid Helium, we construct a
          phenomenological model that should have the key features of
          such a polarised turbulent system.

          Title: The circumbinary disc around the J-type C-star IRAS
          18006-3213
          Authors: P. Deroo, H. Van Winckel, T. Verhoelst, M. Min, M.

          Comments: 11 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          In the generally accepted, but poorly documented model,
          silicate J-type C-stars are binary objects for which the
          silicate emission originates from a circumbinary or a
          circumcompanion disc. We aim at testing this hypothesis by a
          thorough spectral and spatial observational study of one
          object: IRAS18006-3213.
          We obtained, analysed and modeled high spatial resolution
          interferometric VLTI/MIDI observations on multiple baselines
          ranging from 45 m to 100 m. All observations resolved the
          object and show the very compact nature of the N-band emission
          (~30 mas). In addition, the highest spatial resolution data
          show a significant differential phase jump around 8.3 micron.
          This demonstrates the asymmetric nature of the N-band emission.
          Moreover, the single telescope N-band spectrum shows the
          signature of highly processed silicate grains. These data are
          used to confirm the model on silicate J-type C-stars for
          IRAS18006-3213. We show that the most favourable model of the
          dust geometry is a stable circumbinary disc around the system,
          seen under an intermediate inclination.
          The data presented on the silicate J-type C-star IRAS18006-3213
          provide evidence that the oxygen rich dust is trapped in a
          circumbinary disc. The formation of this disc is probably
          linked to the binary nature of the central star.

          Space Res
          Formation of relativistic jets in the magnetosphere of
          collapsing stars is considered. These jets will be formed in
          the polar caps of magnetosphere of collapsing star, where the
          stellar magnetic field increases during the collapse and the
          charged particles are accelerated. The jets will generate
          non-thermal radiation. The analysis of dynamics and emission of
          particles in the stellar magnetosphere under collapse shows
          that collapsing stars can by powerful sources of relativistic
          jets.

          Title: Magnetic field dissipation in neutron star crusts: from
          magnetars to isolated neutron stars
          Authors: J.A. Pons, U. Geppert
          Comments: 14 pages, 10 figures
          We study the non--linear evolution of magnetic fields in
          neutron star crusts with special attention to the influence of
          the Hall drift. Our goal is to understand the conditions for
          fast dissipation due to the Hall term in the induction
          equation. We study the interplay of Ohmic dissipation and Hall
          drift in order to find a timescale for the overall crustal
          field decay. We solve numerically the Hall induction equation
          by means of a hybrid method (spectral in angles but finite
          differences in the radial coordinate). The microphysical input
          consists of the most modern available crustal equation of
          state, composition and electrical conductivities. We present
          the first long term simulations of the non--linear magnetic
          field evolution in realistic neutron star crusts with a
          stratified electron number density and temperature dependent
          conductivity. We show that Hall drift influenced Ohmic
          dissipation takes place in neutron star crusts on a timescale
          of 1 Myr. When the initial magnetic field has magnetar
          strength, the fast Hall drift results in an initial rapid
          dissipation stage that lasts 10-50 kyr. The interplay of the
          Hall drift with the temporal variation and spatial gradient of
          conductivity tends to favor the displacement of toroidal fields
          toward the inner crust, where stable configurations can last
          for 1 Myr. We show that the thermally emitting isolated neutron
          stars, as the Magnificent Seven, are very likely descendants of
          neutron stars born as magnetars.

          emulateapj format. To appear in The Astrophysical Journal, June
          2007 issue
          We develop a technique to measure radial velocities of stars
          from spectra that present four sets of lines. The algorithm is
          an extension of the two-dimensional cross-correlation method
          TODCOR to four dimensions. It computes the correlation of the
          observed spectrum against a combination of four templates with
          all possible shifts, and allows also for the derivation of the
          light ratios of the components. After testing the algorithm and
          demonstrating its ability to measure Doppler shifts accurately
          even under conditions of heavy line blending, we apply it to
          the case of the quadruple-lined system HD 110555. The primary
          and secondary components of this previously known visual binary
          (separation about 0.4 arcsec) are each shown to be double-lined
          spectroscopic binaries with periods of 57 days and 76 days,
          respectively, making the system a hierarchical quadruple. The
          secondary in the 76-day subsystem contributes only 2.5% to the
          total light, illustrating the ability of the method to measure
          velocities of very faint components.

          & Astrophysics. Figure 6 will appear with a better quality in
          the A&A paper
          Context. NGC 300 X-1 is the second extragalactic candidate,
          after IC 10 X-1, in the rare class of Wolf-Rayet/compact object
          X-ray binary systems exemplified in the Galaxy by Cyg X-3. From
          a theoretical point of view, accretion onto a black hole in a
          detached system is possible for large orbital periods only if
          the mass of the relativistic object is high or the velocity of
          the accreted wind is low. Aims. We analysed a 2 week SWIFT XRT
          light curve of NGC 300 X-1 and searched for periodicities.
          Methods. Period searches were made using Lomb-Scargle
          periodogram analysis. We evaluated the confidence level using
          Monte Carlo simulations. Results. A period of 32.8+-0.4h (3
          sigma error) was found for NGC 300 X-1 with a confidence level
          >99%. Furthermore, we confirm the high irregular variability
          during the high flux level, as already observed in the
          XMM-Newton observations of the source. A folded XMM-Newton
          light curve is shown, with a profile that is in agreement with
          SWIFT. The mean absorbed X-ray luminosity in the SWIFT
          observations was 1.5x10^38 erg/s, close to the value derived
          from the XMM-Newton data. Conclusions. While Cyg X-3 has a
          short period of 4.8 h, the period of NGC 300 X-1 is very close
          to that of IC 10 X-1 (34.8+-0.9 h). These are likely orbital
          periods. Possibility of formation of accretion disk for such
          high orbital periods strongly depends on the terminal velocity
          of the Wolf-Rayet star wind and black-hole mass. While low
          masses are possible for wind velocities < 1000 km/s, these
          increase to several tens of solar masses for velocities > 1600
          km/s and no accretion disk may form for terminal velocities
          larger than 1900 km/s.

          The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board Swift has accumulated
          extensive light curves for 265 sources (not including GRBs) in
          the energy range 14 to 200 keV. We present here a summary of
          searches for periodic modulation in the flux from X-ray
          binaries. Our results include: determination of the orbital
          periods of IGR J16418-4532 and IGR J16320-4751; the
          disappearance of a previously known 9.6 day period in 4U
          2206+54; the detection of a 5 hour period in the symbiotic
          X-ray binary 4U 1954+31, which might be the slowest neutron
          star rotation period yet discovered; and the detection of
          flares in the supergiant system 1E 1145.1-6141 which occur at
          both periastron and apastron passage with nearly equal
          amplitude. We compare techniques of weighting data points in
          power spectra and present a method related to the semi-weighted
          mean which, unlike conventional weighting, works well over a
          wide range of source brightness.

          Comments: 19 pages, 6 figures, to appear in The Astriphysical
          Journal, June 2007 issue
          In this paper we report detection of multiple component
          structures in a Chandra X-ray image obtained in March 2001 of
          the nearby symbiotic interacting binary system CH Cyg. These
          components include a compact central source, an arc-like
          structure or a loop extending to 1.5'' (400 AU) from the
          central source associated with the 1997 jet activity, and
          possibly a newly formed jet extending to about 150 AU from the
          central source. The structures are also visible in VLA and HST
          images obtained close in time to the Chandra observations. The
          emission from the loop is consistent with optically thin
          thermal X-ray emission originating from a shock resulting from
          interaction of the jet ejecta with the dense circumbinary
          material. The emission from the central source originates
          within less then 50 AU region, and is likely associated with
          the accretion disk around the white dwarf. CH Cyg is only the
          second symbiotic system with jet activity detected at X-ray
          wavelengths, and the Chandra high-angular resolution image,
          combined with the VLA and HST images, provides the closest view
          of the region of jet formation and interaction with the
          circumbinary material in a symbiotic binary.

          Authors: Carlos O. Lousto, Yosef Zlochower
          Comments: 4 pages, revtex4
          We present a simple formula for the radiated angular momentum
          based on a spin-weighted spherical harmonic decomposition of
          the Weyl scalar psi_4 representing outgoing radiation in the
          Kinnersley tetrad. We test our formula by measuring the
          radiated angular momentum from three simulations of
          non-spinning equal-mass black-hole binary with orbital angular
          momentum aligned along the x, y, and z axes respectively. We
          find that the radiated angular momentum agrees with the
          differences in the remnant horizon spins and the initial
          angular momentum for each system.

          exhibiting spectra resembling those of Super Soft X-ray binary

          the 3 $\sigma$ level, the radius must satisfy R<11.9 km which
          rules out very stiff equations of state. At the 2 $\sigma$

          White dwarf binaries are the most common compact binaries in
          the Universe and are especially important for low-frequency
          gravitational wave detectors such as LISA. There are a number
          of open questions about binary evolution and the Galactic
          population of white dwarf binaries that can be solved using
          gravitational wave data and at the same time, our ever
          improving knowledge about these binaries will help to predict
          the signals that can be expected for LISA. In addition a number
          of white dwarf binaries will serve as verification sources for
          the instrument. I will discuss these issues and report recent,
          surprising, developments in this field. Finally I report
          calculations about the feasibility of complementary
          electro-magnetic observations which unfortunately cannot
          reproduce the optimistic results of Cooray et al. (2004).

          microlensing light curves of extended sources
          Authors: M. Dominik
          Comments: 11 pages, 8 figures embedded; MNRAS accepted
          The availability of a robust and efficient routine for
          calculating light curves of a finite source magnified due to
          bending its light by the gravitational field of an intervening
          binary lens is essential for determining the characteristics of
          planets in such microlensing events, as well as for modelling
          stellar lens binaries and resolving the brightness profile of
          the source star. However, the presence of extended caustics and
          the fact that the images of the source star cannot be
          determined analytically while their number depends on the
          source position (relative to the lens system), makes such a
          task difficult in general. Combining the advantages of several
          earlier approaches, an adaptive contouring algorithm is
          presented, which only relies on a small number of simple rules
          and operations on the adaptive search grid. By using the
          parametric representation of critical curves and caustics found
          by Erdl & Schneider (1993), seed solutions to the adaptive grid
          are found, which ensures that no images or holes are missed.

          Explosive hydrogen burning in type I X-ray bursts (XRBs)
          comprise charged particle reactions creating isotopes with
          masses up to A~100. Since charged particle reactions in a

          accurate values of the burst temperatures and densities. This
          allows a detailed and accurate time-dependent identification of
          the reaction flow from the surface layers through the
          convective region and the ignition region to the neutron star
          ocean. Using this, we determine the relative importance of
          specific nuclear reactions in the X-ray burst.

          Supernova 1987A, the first naked-eye supernova observed since
          Kepler's supernova in 1604, defies a number of theoretical
          expectations. Its anomalies have long been attributed to a
          merger between two massive stars that occurred some 20,000
          years before the explosion, but so far there has been no
          conclusive proof that this merger took place. Here, we present
          three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the mass
          ejection associated with such a merger and the subsequent
          evolution of the ejecta, and we show that this accurately
          reproduces the properties of the triple-ring nebula surrounding
          the supernova.

          RX J0720.4-3125 is an isolated neutron star that, uniquely in
          its class, has shown changes in its thermal X-ray spectrum. We
          use new spectra taken with Chandra's Low Energy Transmission
          Grating Spectrometer, as well as archival observations, to try
          to understand the timescale and nature of these changes. We
          construct lightcurves, which show both small, slow variations
          on a timescale of years, and a larger event that occurred more
          quickly, within half a year.
          From timing, we find evidence for a `glitch' coincident with
          this larger event, with a fractional increase in spin frequency
          of 5x10^{-8}. We compare the `before' and `after' spectra with
          those from RX J1308.6+2127, an isolated neutron star with
          similar temperature and magnetic field strength, but with a
          much stronger absorption feature in its spectrum. We find that
          the `after' spectrum can be represented remarkably well by the
          superposition of the `before' spectrum, scaled by two thirds,
          and the spectrum of RX J1308.6+2127, thus suggesting that the
          event affected approximately one third of the surface. We
          speculate the event reflects a change in surface composition
          caused by, e.g., an accretion episode.

          Comments: Belated posting of contribution to the proceedings of
          NOW2006, Conca Specchiulla, Italy, September 9-16, 2006
          A nascent neutron star resulting from stellar collapse is a
          prodigious source of neutrinos of all flavors. While the most
          basic features of this neutrino emission can be estimated from
          simple considerations, the detailed simulation of the
          neutrinos' decoupling from the hot neutron star is not yet
          computationally tractable in its full glory, being a
          time-dependent six-dimensional transport problem. Nevertheless,
          supernova neutrino fluxes are of great interest in connection
          with the core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism and
          supernova nucleosynthesis, and as a potential probe of the
          supernova environment and of some of the neutrino mixing
          parameters that remain unknown; hence a variety of approximate
          transport schemes have been used to obtain results with reduced
          dimensionality. However, none of these approximate schemes have
          addressed a recent challenge to the conventional wisdom that
          neutrino flavor mixing cannot impact the explosion mechanism or
          r-process nucleosynthesis.

          Title: Sterile neutrinos
          Authors: Alexander Kusenko

          School on particles and fields" and the "6th Latin American
          Symposium on high energy physics" (VI-Silafae/XII-MSPF)
          Neutrino masses are usually described by adding to the Standard
          Model some SU(2)-singlet fermions that have the Yukawa
          couplings, as well as some Majorana mass terms. The number of
          such fields and the scales of their Majorana masses are not
          known. Several independent observations point to the
          possibility that some of these singlets may have masses well
          below the electroweak scale. A sterile neutrino with mass of a
          few keV can account for cosmological dark matter. The same
          particle would be emitted anisotropically from a cooling
          neutron star born in a supernova explosion. This anisotropy can
          be large enough to explain the observed velocities of pulsars.
          A lighter sterile neutrino, with mass of the order of eV, is
          implied by the LSND results; it can have profound implications
          for cosmology. We review the physics of sterile neutrinos and
          the roles they may play in astrophysics and cosmology.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical
          Journal. Six pages, 2 figures
          We have obtained observations of the magnetar XTE J1810-197
          with the Very Long Baseline Array at two epochs separated by
          106 days, at wavelengths of 6 cm and 3.6 cm. Comparison of the
          positions yields a proper motion value of 13.5+-1.0 mas/yr at
          an equatorial position angle of 209.4+-2.4 deg (east of north).
          This value is consistent with a lower-significance proper
          motion value derived from infrared observations of the source
          over the past three years, also reported here. Given its
          distance of 3.5+-0.5 kpc, the implied transverse velocity
          corrected to the local standard of rest is 212+-35 km/s (1
          sigma). The measured velocity is slightly below the average for
          normal young neutron stars, indicating that the mechanism(s) of
          magnetar birth need not lead to high neutron star velocities.
          We also use Australia Telescope Compact Array, Very Large
          Array, and these VLBA observations to set limits on any diffuse
          emission associated with the source on a variety of spatial
          scales, concluding that the radio emission from XTE J1810-197
          is >96% pulsed.

          J0720.4-3125
          Authors: D. L. Kaplan, M. H. van Kerkwijk, J. Anderson
          Comments: 17 pages, 8 figures. To be published in ApJ
          We have used a set of dedicated astrometric data from the
          Hubble Space Telescope to measure the parallax and proper
          motion of the nearby neutron star RX J0720.4-3125. At each of
          eight epochs over two years, we used the High Resolution Camera
          of the Advanced Camera for Surveys to measure the position of
          the B=26.6 target to a precision of ~2 mas (~0.07 pix) relative
          to 22 other stars. From these data we measure a parallax of
          pi=2.8+/-0.9 mas (for a distance of 360+170-90 pc) and a proper
          motion of mu=107.8+/-1.2 mas/yr. Exhaustive testing of every
          stage of our analysis suggests that it is robust, with a
          maximum systematic uncertainty on the parallax of 0.4 mas. The
          distance is compatible with earlier estimates made from scaling
          the optical emission of RX J0720.4-3125 relative to the even
          closer neutron star RX J1856.5-3754. The distance and proper
          motion imply a transverse velocity of 180+90-40 km/s,
          comparable to velocities observed for radio pulsars. The speed
          and direction suggest an origin for RX J0720.4-3125 in the
          Trumpler 10 OB association ~0.7 Myr ago, with a possible range
          of 0.5-1.0 Myr given by the uncertainty in the distance.

          Magnetars, neutron stars with ultra strong magnetic fields
          ($B\sim 10^{14} - 10^{15}$G), manifest their exotic nature in
          the form of soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous X-ray
          pulsars. This study estimates the birthrate of magnetars to be
          $\sim$ 0.22 per century with a galactic population comprising
          of $\sim$17 objects. A population synthesis was carried out
          based on the five anomalous X-ray pulsars detected in the ROSAT
          All-Sky Survey by comparing their number to that of massive OB
          stars in a well defined volume. Additionally, the group of
          seven X-ray dim isolated neutron stars detected in the same
          survey were found to have a birthrate of $\sim$ 2 per century
          with a galactic population of $\sim$ 22,000 objects.

          We use four Chandra gratings spectra of the neutron star
          low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 to better understand the
          nature of certain X-ray absorption lines in X-ray binaries,
          including the Ne II, Ne III, Ne IX, O VII, and O VIII lines.
          The equivalent widths of the lines are generally consistent
          between the observations, as expected if these lines originate
          in the hot interstellar medium. No evidence was found that the
          lines were blueshifted, again supporting the interstellar
          medium origin, though this may be due to poor statistics. There
          may be low-level variability in the O VIII Ly-alpha line though
          it is not clearly correlated with the source flux as might be
          expected if the origin of the line is local to the source. We
          conclude that a high fraction of the absorption is interstellar
          in origin, but more sensitive observations are needed to search
          for low-level variability.

          Authors: Wolfgang Tichy, Pedro Marronetti
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, to be submitted to PRD
          We present results from several simulations of equal mass black
          holes with spin. The spin magnitudes are $S/m^2=0.8$ in all
          cases, but we vary the spin orientations arbitrarily, in and
          outside the orbital plane. We find that in all but one case the
          final merged black hole acquires a kick of more than 1000 km/s,
          indicating that kicks of this magnitude are likely to be
          generic and should be expected for mergers with general spin
          orientations. The maximum kick velocity we find is 2500 km/s
          and occurs for initial spins which are anti-aligned in the
          initial orbital plane.

          Comments: 2 pages, 2 figures, proceedings of IAU Symp. 241,
          Stellar Populations as Building Blocks of Galaxies
          The discovery of an excess of light in the far-ultraviolet (UV)
          in 1969 in elliptical galaxies was a major surprise. While it
          is now clear that this UV excess (UV-upturn) is probably caused
          by an old population of helium-burning stars. Han et al (2002,
          2003) proposed a binary model for the formation of hot
          subdwarfs (helium burning stars) and the model can reproduce
          the observations in our Galaxy. By applying the binary model to
          the study of evolutionary population synthesis, we have
          obtained an {\it a priori} model for the UV-upturn of
          elliptical galaxies. The model shows that the UV-upturn is most
          likely resulted from binary interactions and it is universal
          (not very much metallicity-dependant) in ellipticals. This has
          major implications for understanding the evolution of the
          UV-upturn and elliptical galaxies in general; contrary to
          previous postulates, it implies that the UV-upturn is not a
          sign of age, but could be a potentially powerful indicator for
          a recent minor burst of star-forming activity.

          Comments: 4 pages
          The properties and composition of the outer crust of
          nonaccreting cold neutron stars are studied by applying the
          model of Baym, Pethick and Sutherland, which was extended by
          the higher order corrections for the atomic binding, screening,
          exchange and zero-point energies, and taking into account for
          the first time triaxial deformations of nuclei. Experimental
          data of the atomic mass table from Audi, Wapstra and Thibault
          of 2003 are used together with two different theoretical
          nuclear models: the SLy6 parametrization for a
          Skyrme-Hartree-Fock model with BCS pairing and the
          parametrization D1S for a Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov calculation
          with a finite-range Gogny interaction. The nuclear masses in
          both theoretical models were calculated under consideration of
          3D triaxial deformations. The two models are compared
          concerning their neutron drip line, magic neutron numbers and
          the sequence of nuclei up to the neutron drip in the outer
          crust of nonaccreting cold neutron stars, with special emphasis
          on the effect of triaxial deformations.

          Baron
          Comments: 34 pages, to appear in New Astronomy Reviews
          Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) are thought to come from carbon-oxygen
          white dwarfs that accrete mass from binary companions until
          they approach the Chandrasekhar limit, ignite carbon, and
          undergo complete thermonuclear disruption. A survey of the
          observed types of binaries that contain white dwarfs is
          presented. We propose that certain systems that seem most
          promising as SN Ia progenitors should be more intensively
          observed and modeled, to determine whether the white dwarfs in
          these systems will be able to reach the Chandrasekhar limit. In
          view of the number of promising single-degenerate systems and
          the dearth of promising double-degenerate systems, we suspect
          that single-degenerates produce most or perhaps all SNe Ia,
          while double-degenerates produce some or perhaps none.

          Authors: Efrain J. Ferrer, Vivian de la Incera
          Comments: 18 pages, 1 figure
          The best natural candidates for the realization of color
          superconductivity are quark stars -not yet confirmed by
          observation- and the extremely dense cores of compact stars,
          many of which have very large magnetic fields. To reliably
          predict astrophysical signatures of color superconductivity, a
          better understanding of the role of the star's magnetic field
          in the color superconducting phase that realizes in the core is
          required. This paper is an initial step in that direction. The
          field scales at which the different magnetic phases of a color
          superconductor with three quark flavors can be realized are
          investigated. Coming from weak to strong fields, the system
          undergoes first a symmetry transmutation from a
          Color-Flavor-Locked (CFL) phase to a Magnetic-CFL (MCFL) phase,
          and then a phase transition from the MCFL phase to the
          Paramagnetic-CFL (PCFL) phase. The low-energy effective theory
          for the excitations of the diquark condensate in the presence
          of a magnetic field is derived using a covariant representation
          that takes into account all the Lorentz structures contributing
          at low energy. The field-induced masses of the charged mesons
          and the threshold field at which the CFL $\to$ MCFL symmetry
          transmutation occurs are obtained in the framework of this
          low-energy effective theory. The relevance of the different
          magnetic phases for the physics of compact stars is discussed.

          We have searched for Gravitational Waves (GWs) associated with
          the SGR 1806-20 hyperflare of 27 December 2004. This event,
          originating from a Galactic neutron star, displayed exceptional
          energetics. Recent investigations of the X-ray light curve's
          pulsating tail revealed the presence of Quasi-Periodic
          Oscillations (QPOs) in the 30 - 2000 Hz frequency range, most
          of which coincides with the bandwidth of the LIGO detectors.
          These QPOs, with well-characterized frequencies, can plausibly
          be attributed to seismic modes of the neutron star which could
          emit GWs. Our search targeted potential quasi-monochromatic GWs
          lasting for tens of seconds and emitted at the QPO frequencies.
          We have observed no candidate signals above a pre-determined
          threshold and our lowest upper limit was set by the 92.5 Hz QPO
          observed in the interval from 150 s to 260 s after the start of
          the flare. This bound corresponds to a (90% confidence)
          root-sum-squared amplitude h_rssdet^90% = 4.5e-22 strain
          Hz^-1/2 on the GW waveform strength in the detectable
          polarization state reaching our Hanford (WA) 4 km detector. We
          illustrate the astrophysical significance of the result via an
          estimated characteristic energy in GW emission that we would
          expect to be able to detect. The above result corresponds to
          7.7e46 erg (= 4.3e-8 M_sun c^2), which is of the same order as
          the total (isotropic) energy emitted in the electromagnetic
          spectrum. This result provides a means to probe the energy
          reservoir of the source with the best upper limit on the GW
          waveform strength published and represents the first broadband
          asteroseismology measurement using a GW detector.

          Title: Detection of extended very-high-energy gamma-ray
          emission towards the young stellar cluster Westerlund 2
          Authors: HESS Collaboration: F. Aharonian, et al
          Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Results from gamma-ray observations by the H.E.S.S. telescope
          array in the direction of the young stellar cluster Westerlund
          2 are presented. Stereoscopic imaging of Cherenkov light
          emission of gamma-ray induced showers in the atmosphere is used
          to study the celestial region around the massive Wolf-Rayet
          (WR) binary WR 20a. Spectral and positional analysis is
          performed using standard event reconstruction techniques and
          parameter cuts. The detection of a new gamma-ray source is
          reported from H.E.S.S. observations in 2006. HESS J1023-575 is
          found to be coincident with the young stellar cluster
          Westerlund 2 in the well-known HII complex RCW 49. The source
          is detected with a statistical significance of more than 9
          sigma, and shows extension beyond a point-like object within
          the H.E.S.S. point-spread function. The differential gamma-ray
          spectrum of the emission region is measured over approximately
          two orders of magnitude in flux. The spatial coincidence
          between HESS J1023-575 and the young open cluster Westerlund 2,
          hosting e.g. the massive WR binary WR 20a, requires a look into
          a variety of potential models to account for the observed
          very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission. Considered emission
          scenarios include emission from the colliding wind zone of WR
          20a, collective stellar winds from the extraordinary ensemble
          of hot and massive stars in the stellar cluster Westerlund 2,
          diffusive shock acceleration in the wind-blown bubble itself,
          and supersonic winds breaking out into the interstellar medium
          (ISM). The observed source extension argues against a single
          star origin of the observed VHE emission.

          Title: Correlations between X-ray Spectral Characteristics and
          Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Sco X-1
          Authors: Charles F. Bradshaw (MITRE/GMU), Lev Titarchuk
          (GMU/NRL/GSFC), Sergey Kuznetsov (UCR/IKI, Russia)
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          (July 1, 2007, v663n1 issue)
          Correlations between 1-10 Hz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs)
          and spectral power law index have been reported for black hole
          (BH) candidate sources and one neutron star source, 4U 1728-34.
          An examination of QPO frequency and index relationships in Sco
          X-1 is reported herein. We discovered that Sco X-1,
          representing Z-source groups, can be adequately modeled by a
          simple two-component model of Compton up-scattering with a soft
          photon electron temperature of about 0.4 keV, plus an Iron
          K-line. The results show a strong correlation between spectral
          power law index and kHz QPOs. Because Sco X-1 radiates near the
          Eddington limit, one can infer that the geometrical
          configuration of the Compton cloud (CC) is quasi-spherical
          because of high radiation pressure in the CC. Thus, we conclude
          that the high Thomson optical depth of the Compton cloud, in
          the range of ~5-6 from the best-fit model parameters, is
          consistent with the neutron star's surface being obscured by
          material. Moreover, a spin frequency of Sco X-1 is likely
          suppressed due to photon scattering off CC electrons.
          Additionally, we demonstrate how the power spectrum evolves
          when Sco X-1 transitions from the horizontal branch to the
          normal branch.

          We present results of Swift optical, UV and X-ray observations
          of the afterglow of GRB 050801. The source is visible over the
          full optical, UV and X-ray energy range of the Swift UVOT and
          XRT instruments.Both optical and X-ray lightcurves exhibit a
          broad plateau (\Delta t/t ~ 1) during the first few hundred
          seconds after the gamma-ray event. We investigate the
          multiwavelength spectral and timing properties of the
          afterglow, and we suggest that the behaviour at early times is
          compatible with an energy injection by a newly born magnetar
          with a period of a few tenths of a millisecond, which keeps the
          forward shock refreshed over this short interval by
          irradiation. Reverse shock emission is not observed. Its
          suppression might be due to GRB ejecta being permeated by high
          magnetic fields, as expected for outflows powered by a
          magnetar.Finally, the multiwavelength study allows a
          determination of the burst redshift, z=1.56.

          Comments: 15 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          The magnetic cataclysmic variable AE Aquarii hosts a rapidly
          rotating white dwarf which is thought to expel most of the
          material streaming onto it. Observations of AE Aqr have been
          obtained in the wavelength range of 5 - 70 microns with the
          IRS, IRAC, and MIPS instruments on board the Spitzer Space
          Telescope. The spectral energy distribution reveals a
          significant excess above the K4V spectrum of the donor star
          with the flux increasing with wavelength above 12.5 microns.
          Superposed on the energy distribution are several hydrogen
          emission lines, identified as Pf alpha and Hu alpha, beta,
          gamma. The infrared spectrum above 12.5 microns can be
          interpreted as synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated
          to a power-law distribution dN=E^{-2.4}dE in expanding clouds
          with an initial evolution timescale in seconds. However, too
          many components must then be superposed to explain
          satisfactorily both the mid-infrared continuum and the observed
          radio variability. Thermal emission from cold circumbinary
          material can contribute, but it requires a disk temperature
          profile intermediate between that produced by local viscous
          dissipation in the disk and that characteristic of a passively
          irradiated disk. Future high-time resolution observations
          spanning the optical to radio regime could shed light on the
          acceleration process and the subsequent particle evolution.

          Title: Efficiency of mass transfer in massive close binaries,
          Tests from double-lined eclipsing binaries in the SMC
          Authors: S.E. de Mink, O.R. Pols, R. W. Hilditch
          Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A 15/03/2007, 16 pages
          One of the major uncertainties in close binary evolution is the
          efficiency of mass transfer beta: the fraction of transferred
          mass that is accreted by a secondary star. We attempt to
          constrain the mass-transfer efficiency for short-period massive
          binaries undergoing case A mass transfer.
          We present a grid of about 20,000 detailed binary evolution
          tracks with primary masses 3.5-35 Msun, orbital periods 1-5
          days at a metallicity Z=0.004, assuming both conservative and
          non-conservative mass transfer. We perform a systematic
          comparison, using least-squares fitting, of the computed models
          with a sample of 50 double-lined eclipsing binaries in the
          Small Magellanic Cloud, for which fundamental stellar
          parameters have been determined. About 60% of the systems are
          currently undergoing slow mass transfer.
          In general we find good agreement between our models and the
          observed detached systems. However, for many of the
          semi-detached systems the observed temperature ratio is more
          extreme than our models predict. For the 17 semi-detached
          systems that we are able to match, we find a large spread in
          the best fitting mass-transfer efficiency; no single value of
          beta can explain all systems. We find a hint that initially
          wider systems tend to fit better to less conservative models.
          We show the need for more accurate temperature determinations
          and we find that determinations of surface abundances of
          nitrogen and carbon can potentially constrain the mass-transfer
          efficiency further.

          New xmm observations have been performed around periastron and
          apastron passages in September 2005, during an epoch of
          presumably enhanced O star wind. Also, 2005 Chandra
          observations on LS 5039 are revisited. Moreover, a compilation
          of the Halpha EW and rxte/ASM X-ray count rate obtained since
          the 1990s is carried out, being both quantities compared with
          each other and also with historical radio data. xmm
          observations show higher and harder emission around apastron
          than around periastron. No signatures of thermal emission or a
          reflection iron line indicating the presence of an accretion
          disk are found in the spectrum, and the hydrogen column density
          (N_H) is compatible with a constant and with the interstellar
          value in both observations. The hardness ratio and the count
          rate seem uncorrelated at periastron and may be correlated at
          apastron. We find that LS 5039 was bright and hard in 2005
          chandra observations. The ASM count rate shows changes by a
          ~80% on year timescales, and the Halpha EW shows yearly
          variations of a ~10%. Both quantities may be anticorrelated
          rather than correlated, unlike it was previously thought. At
          radio frequencies, the emission varies by ~20%, presenting some
          similarities with the X-rays. ASM, Halpha EW and radio data may
          hint to variability at orbital timescales. The low value and
          constancy of the N_H could imply that the X-ray emitter is
          located at >~10^12 cm from the compact object. We suggest that
          the non-thermal emission in LS 5039 is related to the jet and
          the stellar wind in a complex way and produced outside the
          system. However, the present data do not rule out the pulsar
          scenario.

          Title: Uncovering the Nature of the X-ray Transient 4U 1730-22:
          Discovery of X-ray Emission from a Neutron Star in Quiescence
          with Chandra
          Authors: John A. Tomsick (SSL/UCB and CASS/UCSD), Dawn M.
          Gelino (MSS/Caltech), Philip Kaaret (Univ. of Iowa)
          Comments: Accepted by the Astrophysical Journal
          The X-ray transient, 4U 1730-22, has not been detected in
          outburst since 1972, when a single outburst was detected by the
          Uhuru satellite. This neutron star or black hole X-ray binary
          is presumably in quiescence now, and here, we report on X-ray
          and optical observations of the 4U 1730-22 field designed to
          identify the system's quiescent counterpart. Using Chandra, we
          have found a very likely counterpart. The candidate counterpart
          is close to the center of the Uhuru error region and has a
          thermal spectrum. The 0.3-8 keV spectrum is well-described by a
          neutron star atmosphere model with an effective temperature of
          131+/-21 eV. For a neutron star with a 10 km radius, the
          implied source distance is 10(+12)(-4) kpc, and the X-ray
          luminosity is 1.9E33 ergs/s assuming a distance of 10 kpc.
          Accretion from a companion star is likely required to maintain
          the temperature of this neutron star, which would imply that it
          is an X-ray binary and therefore, almost certainly the 4U
          1730-22 counterpart. We do not detect an optical source at the
          position of the Chandra source down to R > 22.1, and this is
          consistent with the system being a Low-Mass X-ray Binary at a
          distance greater than a few kpc. If our identification is
          correct, 4U 1730-22 is one of the 5 most luminous of the 20
          neutron star transients that have quiescent X-ray luminosity
          measurements.

          Pulsars spin-down due to magnetic torque reducing its radius
          and increasing the central energy density. Some pulsar which
          are born with central densities close to the critical value of
          quark deconfinement may undergo a phase transition and
          structural re-arrengement. This process may excite oscillation
          modes and emmit gravitational waves. We determine the rate of
          quark core formation in neutron stars using a realistic

          Symposium" (Febuary 5-8, 2007, Stanford Univ., USA), AIP, ed.
          S. Barnes
          We present a Chandra X-ray observation of G12.82-0.02, a
          shell-like radio supernova remnant coincident with the TeV
          gamma-ray source HESS J1813-178. We resolve the X-ray emission
          from the co-located ASCA source into a compact object
          surrounded by structured diffuse emission that fills the
          interior of the radio shell. The morphology of the diffuse
          emission strongly resembles that of a pulsar wind nebula. The
          spectrum of the compact source is well-characterized by a
          power-law with index approx. 1.3, typical of young and
          energetic rotation-powered pulsars. For a distance of 4.5 kpc,
          consistent with the X-ray absorption, the 2-10 keV X-ray
          luminosity of the putative pulsar and nebula is L(PSR) = 3.2E33
          erg/s and L(PWN) = 1.4E34 erg/s, respectively. Both the flux
          ratio of L(PWN)/L(PSR) = 4.3 and the total luminosity of this
          system imply a pulsar spin-down power greater then 1E37 erg/s,
          on a par with the top ten most energetic young pulsars in the
          Galaxy. We associate the putative pulsar with the radio remnant
          and the TeV source and discuss the origin of the gamma-ray
          emission.

          Title: Comparing P-stars with Observations
          Authors: Paolo Cea
          Comments: 11 pages, 3 figures
          P-stars are compact stars made of up and down quarks in
          $\beta$-equilibrium with electrons in a chromomagnetic
          condensate. P-stars are able to account for compact stars as
          well as stars with radius comparable with canonical neutron
          stars. We compare p-stars with different available
          observations. Our results indicate that p-stars are able to
          reproduce in a natural manner several observations from
          isolated and binary pulsars. On the other hand, we argue that
          the standard model based on neutron stars is getting in
          troubles leading to the need for a drastic revision of the
          standard paradigm.

          Title: Linear shear flow past a hemispherical droplet adhering
          to a solid surface

          Comments: 10 figures
          Subj-class: Soft Condensed Matter; Fluid Dynamics; Exactly
          Solvable and Integrable Systems
          In this paper we investigate the properties of a three
          dimensional Stokes problem when a hemispherical droplet is
          introduced into a linear shear flow past a flat plane. The
          exact solution is computed as a function of the viscosity ratio
          between the droplet and the fluid and generalizes the solution
          for the hemispherical no-slip bump given in an earlier paper by
          Price (1985), here recovered in the limiting case of highly
          viscous droplet. Several expressions including the torque and
          the force acting on the drop will be considered as well as the
          role of the deformations on the surface for finite Capillary
          numbers.

          Title: The identification of physical close galaxy pairs
          Authors: D.S.L. Soares
          Comments: 16 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in The
          Astronomical Journal
          A classification scheme for close pairs of galaxies is
          proposed. The scheme is motivated by the fact that the majority
          of apparent close pairs are in fact wide pairs in
          three-dimensional space. This is demonstrated by means of
          numerical simulations of random samples of binary galaxies and
          the scrutiny of the resulting projected and spatial separation
          distributions.
          Observational strategies for classifying close pairs according
          to the scheme are suggested. As a result, physical -- i.e.,
          bound and spatially -- close pairs are identified.

          Title: New Very Low Mass Binaries in the Taurus Star-Forming
          Region
          Authors: Q.M. Konopacky, A.M. Ghez, E.L. Rice, G. Duchene
          Comments: 6 Pages (emulateapj style), 3 Figures. Accepted for
          publication in ApJ
          We surveyed thirteen very low mass (VLM; M < 0.2 M_sun) objects
          in the Taurus star-forming region using near-infrared
          diffraction-limited imaging techniques on the W.M. Keck I 10 m
          telescope. Of these thirteen, five were found to be binary,
          with separations ranging from 0.04" to 0.6" and flux ratios
          from 1.4 to 3.7. In all cases, the companions are likely to be
          physically associated with the primaries (probability >
          4-sigma). Using the theoretical models of Baraffe et al.
          (1998), we find that all five new companions, as well as one of
          the primaries, are likely brown dwarfs. The discovery of these
          systems therefore increases the total number of known, young
          VLM binaries by ~50%. These new systems, along with other young
          VLM binaries from the literature, have properties that differ
          significantly from older field VLM binaries in that the young
          systems have wider separations and lower mass ratios,
          supporting the idea that VLM binaries undergo significant
          dynamical evolution ~5 - 10 Myr after their formation. The
          range of separations of these binaries, four of which are over
          30 AU, argues against the ejection scenario of brown dwarf
          formation. While several of the young, VLM binaries discovered
          in this study have lower binding energies than the previously
          suggested minimum for VLM binaries, the apparent minimum is
          still significantly higher than that found among higher mass
          binaries. We suggest that this discrepancy may be due to the
          small mass of a VLM binary relative to the average perturbing
          star, leading to more substantial changes in their binding
          energy over time.

          Authors: T.B. Young, M.G. Hidas, J.K. Webb, M.C.B. Ashley, J.L.
          Christiansen, A. Derekas, C. Nutto
          Comments: 6 pages, published in MNRAS (08/2006)
          Journal-ref: 2006MNRAS.370.1529Y
          We present an analysis of a new, detached, double-lined
          eclipsing binary system with K7 Ve components, discovered as
          part of the University of New South Wales Extrasolar Planet
          Search. The object is significant in that only 6 other binary
          systems are known with comparable or lower mass. Such systems
          offer important tests of mass-radius theoretical models.
          Follow-up photometry and spectroscopy were obtained with the
          40-inch and 2.3m telescopes at SSO respectively. An estimate of
          the radial velocity amplitude from spectral absorption
          features, combined with the orbital inclination (83.5 deg)
          estimated from lightcurve fitting, yielded a total mass of
          M=(1.041 +/- 0.06)M_sun and component masses of M_A=(0.529 +/-
          0.035)M_sun and M_B=(0.512 +/- 0.035)M_sun. The radial velocity
          amplitude estimated from absorption features (167 +/- 3)kmps
          was found to be less than the estimate from the H_alpha
          emission lines (175 +/- 1.5)kmps. The lightcurve fit produced
          radii of R_A=(0.641 +/- 0.05)R_sun and R_B=(0.608 +/-
          0.06)R_sun, and a temperature ratio of T_B/T_A=0.980 +/- 0.015.
          The apparent magnitude of the binary was estimated to be V=13.9
          +/- 0.2. Combined with the spectral type, this gave the
          distance to the binary as 169 +/- 14 pc. The timing of the
          secondary eclipse gave a lower limit on the eccentricity of the
          binary system of 0.0025 +/- 0.0005. This is the most
          statistically significant non-zero eccentricity found for such
          a system, possibly suggesting the presence of a third
          companion.

          Title: Hartree-Fock variational bounds for ground state energy
          of chargeless fermions with finite magnetic moment in presence
          of a hard core potential:A stable ferromagnetic state
          Authors: Sudhanshu S. Jha, S. D. Mahanti
          Comments: A shorter version of this paper will appear in
          Pramana - Journal of Physics
          Subj-class: Strongly Correlated Electrons; Other; Statistical
          Mechanics
          We use different types of determinantal Hartree-Fock (HF) wave
          functions to calculate variational bounds for the ground state
          energy of spin-half fermions in volume V_0, with mass m,
          electric charge zero, and magnetic moment mu, which are
          interacting through long range magnetic dipole-dipole
          interaction. We find that at high densities when the average
          inter particle distance r_0 becomes small compared to the
          magnetic length r_m, a ferromagnetic state with spheroidal
          occupation function, involving quadrupolar deformation, gives a
          lower energy compared to the variational energy for the uniform
          paramagnetic state. This HF variational bound to the ground
          state energy turns out to have a lower energy than our earlier
          calculation in which instead of a determinantal wavefunction we
          had used a positive semi-definite single particle density
          matrix operator whose eigenvalues, having quadrupolar
          deformation, were allowed to take any value from 0 to 1. This
          system is of course still unstable towards infinite density
          collapse, but we show here explicitly that a suitable short
          range repulsive (hard core) interaction of strength U_0 and
          range a can stop this collapse.The existence of a stable high
          density ferromagnetic state with spheroidal occupation function
          is possible as long as the ratio of hard-core and magnetic
          dipole coupling constants is not very small compared to 1.

          Title: General relativistic simulations of magneto-rotational
          core collapse with microphysics
          Authors: P. Cerdá-Durán, J. A. Font, H. Dimmelmeier
          Comments: 25 pages, 14 figures, submitted to Astronomy &
          Astrophysics on March 7, 2007
          This paper presents results from axisymmetric simulations of
          magneto-rotational stellar core collapse to neutron stars in
          general relativity. These simulations are performed using a new
          general relativistic numerical code specifically designed to
          study this astrophysical scenario. The code is based on the
          conformally-flat approximation of Einstein's field equations
          and conservative formulations of the magneto-hydrodynamics
          equations. The code has been recently upgraded to incorporate a
          tabulated, microphysical equation of state and an approximate
          deleptonization scheme. This allows us to perform the most
          realistic simulations of magneto-rotational core collapse to
          date, which are compared with simulations employing a
          simplified (hybrid) equation of state, widely used in the
          relativistic core collapse community. Furthermore,
          state-of-the-art (unmagnetized) initial models from stellar
          evolution are used. In general, stellar evolution models
          predict weak magnetic fields in the progenitors, which
          justifies our simplification of performing the computations
          under the approach that we call the passive field approximation
          for the magnetic field. Our results show that for the core
          collapse models with microphysics the saturation of the
          magnetic field cannot be reached within dynamical time scales
          by winding up the poloidal magnetic field into a toroidal one.
          We estimate the effect of other amplification mechanisms
          including the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and several
          types of dynamos.

          Comments: 48 pages, 17 figures
          We use a 3-D relativistic SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics)
          code to study mergers of black hole -- neutron star (BH--NS)
          binary systems with low mass ratios, adopting $M_{NS}/M_{BH}
          \simeq 0.1$ as a representative case. The outcome of such
          mergers depends sensitively on both the magnitude of the BH
          spin and its obliquity (i.e., the inclination of the binary
          orbit with respect to the equatorial plane of the BH). In
          particular, only systems with sufficiently high BH spin
          parameter $a$ and sufficiently low orbital inclinations allow
          any NS matter to escape or to form a long-lived disk outside
          the BH horizon after disruption. Mergers of binaries with
          orbital inclinations above $\sim60^o$ lead to complete prompt
          accretion of the entire NS by the BH, even for the case of an
          extreme Kerr BH. We find that the formation of a significant
          disk or torus of NS material around the BH always requires a
          near-maximal BH spin and a low initial inclination of the NS
          orbit just prior to merger.

          Journal-ref: A&A 464, 1133-1138 (2007)
          We investigate a new approach to the detection of companions to
          extrasolar planets beyond the transit method. We discuss the
          possibility of the existence of binary planets.
          We develop a method based on the imaging of a planet-companion
          as an unresolved system (but resolved from its parent star). It
          makes use of planet-companion mutual phenomena, namely mutual
          transits and mutual shadows.
          We show that companions can be detected and their radius
          measured down to lunar sizes.

          Simulations of the chemical enrichment histories of ten Local
          Group (LG) dwarf galaxies are presented, employing
          empirically-derived star formation histories (SFHs), a rich
          network of isotopic and elemental nucleosynthetic yields, and a
          range of prescriptions for supernova (SN)-driven outflows. Our
          main conclusions are that (i) neutron-capture element patterns
          (particularly that of Ba/Y) suggest a strong contribution from
          low- and intermediate-mass stars, (ii) neutron star mergers may
          play a relatively larger role in the nucleosynthesis of dwarfs,
          (iii) SN feedback alone can explain the observed gas fraction
          in dwarf irregulars (dIrrs), but dwarf spheroidals (dSphs)
          require almost all their gas to be removed via ram pressure
          and/or tidal stripping, (iv) the predicted heavy Mg isotope
          enhancements in the interstellar medium of dwarfs may provide
          an alternate solution to claims of a varying fine structure (v)
          the gas lost from dwarfs have O,Si/C abundances in broad
          agreement with intergalactic medium abundances at redshifts
          2<z<4, and (vi) the chemical properties of dSphs are
          well-matched by preventing galactic winds from re-accreting,
          whilst those of dIrrs are better-matched by incorporating
          metallicity-dependent cooling and re-accretion of hot winds.
          Finally, doubts are cast upon a claimed association between LG
          dSph UMaII and High-Velocity Cloud Complex A.

          Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in Acta
          Astronomica
          As a result of the search among about 11 000 stars from the
          public ASAS-3 database, we report detection of pulsating
          components in eleven eclipsing binaries. In particular, we have
          found three classical Algols, MX Pav, IZ Tel, and VY Mic, with
          $\delta$ Sct-type primary components. In six other eclipsing
          binaries, the short-period variability can also be interpreted
          in terms of $\delta$ Sct-type pulsations, but in these systems
          both components are probably main-sequence stars. In HD 99612,
          the pulsation mode shows significant amplitude decrease during
          the time interval covered by observations. In addition, we find
          variability in one of the components of the eclipsing and
          double-lined spectroscopic O-type binary ALS 1135 which we
          interpret as a $\beta$ Cep-type pulsation. Finally, we find Y
          Cir to be a good candidate for an SPB star in an eclipsing
          binary system.

          Title: A Clumping Independent Diagnostic of Stellar Mass-loss
          Rates: Rapid Clump Destruction in Adiabatic Colliding Winds
          Authors: J. M. Pittard (Leeds, UK)
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL
          Clumping in hot star winds can significantly affect estimates
          of mass-loss rates, the inferred evolution of the star and the
          environmental impact of the wind. A hydrodynamical simulation
          of a colliding winds binary (CWB) with clumpy winds reveals
          that the clumps are rapidly destroyed after passing through the
          confining shocks of the wind-wind collision region (WCR) for
          reasonable parameters of the clumps if the flow in the WCR is
          adiabatic. Despite large density and temperature fluctuations
          in the post-shock gas, the overall effect of the interaction is
          to smooth the existing structure in the winds. Averaged over
          the entire interaction region, the resulting X-ray emission is
          very similar to that from the collision of smooth winds. The
          insensitivity of the X-ray emission to clumping suggests it is
          an excellent diagnostic of the stellar mass-loss rates in wide
          CWBs, and may prove to be a useful addition to existing
          techniques for deriving mass-loss rates, many of which are
          extremely sensitive to clumping. Clumpy winds also have
          implications for a variety of phenomena at the WCR: particle
          acceleration may occur throughout the WCR due to supersonic MHD
          turbulence, re-acceleration at multiple shocks, and
          re-connection; a statistical description of the properties of
          the WCR may be required for studies of non-equilibrium
          ionization and the rate of electron heating; and the physical
          mixing of the two winds will be enhanced, as seems necessary to
          trigger dust formation.

          Authors: J. M. Pittard (Leeds, UK), S. M. Dougherty (NRC HIA,
          Canada)
          Comments: To appear in the proceedings of "Massive Stars:
          Fundamental Parameters and Circumstellar Interactions"
          Massive WR+O star systems produce high-temperature,
          shock-heated plasma where the wind of the WR star and that of
          its binary companion collide - the wind-collision region (WCR).
          The WCR is a source of thermal (e.g. hard X-rays) and
          non-thermal (e.g. synchrotron) emission, the latter arising
          from electrons and ions accelerated to relativistic energies.
          These colliding wind binaries provide an excellent laboratory
          for the study of particle acceleration at higher mass, photon
          and magnetic energy densities than exist in SNRs. Recent models
          of the non-thermal emission from WR 140 have provided insight
          into this process.

          beta Aurigae and non-linear limb darkening in light curves

          analysis code and WIRE light curve are available from this http
          URL
          We present the most precise light curve ever obtained of a
          detached eclipsing binary star and use it investigate the
          inclusion of non-linear limb darkening laws in eclipsing binary
          light curve models. This light curve, of the bright system beta
          Aurigae, was obtained using the star tracker aboard the WIRE
          satellite and contains 30000 datapoints with a scatter of 0.3
          mmag. We analyse it using a version of the EBOP code modified
          to include non-linear limb darkening and to directly
          incorporate observed times of minimum light and spectroscopic
          light ratios into the solution as individual observations. We
          also analyse the dataset with the WD code to ensure that the
          two models give consistent results. EBOP provides an excellent
          fit to the WIRE data. Whilst the fractional radii are only
          defined to a precision of 5%, including an accurate published
          spectroscopic light ratio improves this dramatically to 0.5%.
          Using non-linear limb darkening improves the quality of the fit
          significantly and causes the measured radii to increase by
          0.4%. It is possible to derive all of the limb darkening
          coefficients from the light curve, although they are strongly
          correlated with each other, and they agree with theoretical
          predictions. The radii and masses of the components of beta Aur
          are R_A = 2.762 +/- 0.017 Rsun, R_B = 2.568 +/- 0.017 Rsun, M_A
          = 2.376 +/- 0.027 Msun and M_B = 2.291 +/- 0.027 Msun.
          Theoretical stellar models can match these parameters for a
          solar metal abundance and an age of 450-500 Myr. The Hipparcos
          trigonometric parallax and an interferometrically-derived
          orbital parallax give distances to beta Aur which are in
          excellent agreement with each other and with distances derived
          using surface brightness relations and several sets of
          empirical and theoretical bolometric corrections (abridged).

          Title: Silicates in D-type symbiotic stars: an ISO overview

          We investigate the IR spectral features of a sample of D-type
          symbiotic stars. Analyzing unexploited ISO-SWS data, deriving
          the basic observational parameters of dust bands and comparing
          them with respect to those observed in other astronomical
          sources, we try to highlight the effect of environment on grain
          chemistry and physic. We find strong amorphous silicate
          emission bands at 10 micron and 18 micron in a large fraction
          of the sample. The analysis of the 10 micron band, along with a
          direct comparison with several astronomical sources, reveals
          that silicate dust in symbiotic stars shows features between
          the characteristic circumstellar environments and the
          interstellar medium. This indicates an increasing reprocessing
          of grains in relation to specific symbiotic behavior of the
          objects. A correlation between the central wavelength of the 10
          and 18 micron dust bands is found. By the modeling of IR
          spectral lines we investigate also dust grains conditions
          within the shocked nebulae. Both the unusual depletion values
          and the high sputtering efficiency might be explained by the
          formation of SiO moleculae, which are known to be a very
          reliable shock tracer. We conclude that the signature of dust
          chemical disturbance due to symbiotic activity should be looked
          for in the outer, circumbinary, expanding shells where the
          environmental conditions for grain processing might be
          achieved. Symbiotic stars are thus attractive targets for new
          mid-infrared and mm observations.

          Title: Envelope density pattern around wide binary AGB stars: a
          dynamical model
          Authors: J.H. He
          Comments: 5 pages, 5 figures, accepted to be published in A&A
          in 2007
          The goal is to build up a simple dynamical model for the
          out-flowing circumstellar envelope around AGB stars in a wide
          binary system to explore the parameter dependence of the
          geometrical characteristics of column density patterns. An AGB
          star in a wide binary system is considered as a 3-D piston
          model that can induce a 3-D quasi-spherical density structure
          in the circumstellar envelope by orbital motion of the AGB
          star. The column density pattern only depends on two
          parameters: eccentricity of the orbit e and the terminal
          outflow velocity to mean orbital velocity ratio gamma. When
          viewed perpendicular to the orbital plane, spiral, broken
          spiral, and incomplete concentric shell patterns can be seen,
          while when viewed along the orbital plane, alternative
          concentric half-shell, egg-shell, and half-shell half-gap
          patterns will develop. Non-zero eccentricity causes asymmetry,
          while larger gamma makes a weaker pattern and helps bring out
          asymmetry. A spiral pattern may becomes broken when e > 0.4.
          The spiral center is always less than 12% of spiral pitch away
          from the orbit center. One should have more chances (~ 80%)
          seeing spiral-like patterns than seeing concentric shells (~
          20%) in the circumstellar envelope of wide binary AGB stars.

          Title: Simulation of the interstellar scintillation and the
          extreme scattering events of pulsars
          Authors: Murad Hamidouche, Jean-Francois Lestrade
          Comments: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics
          The rare and conspicuous flux density variations of some radio
          sources (extragalactic and pulsars) for periods of weeks to
          months have been denoted Extreme Scattering Events (ESE's) by
          Fiedler et al. (1987). Presently, there is no astrophysical
          mechanism that satisfactorily produces this phenomenon. In this
          paper, we conjecture that inhomogeneities of the electronic
          density in the turbulent interstellar medium might be the
          origin of this phenomenon. We have tested this conjecture by a
          simulation of the scintillation of the pulsar B1937+21 at 1.4
          GHz and 1.7 GHz for a period of six months. To this end, we
          have constructed a large square Kolmogorov phase screen made of
          131k x 131k pixels with electron inhomogeneity scales ranging
          from 6 x $10^6$ m to $10^{12}$ m and used the Kirchhoff-Fresnel
          integral to simulate dynamic spectra of a pulsar within the
          framework of Physical Optics.
          The simulated light curves exhibit a 10 day long variation
          simultaneously at 1.41 and 1.7 GHz that is alike the ``ESE''
          observed with the Nancay radiotelescope toward the pulsar
          B1937+21 in October 1989. Consequently, we conclude that
          ``ESE'' toward pulsars can be caused naturally by the
          turbulence in the ionized interstellar medium instead of
          invoking the crossing of discrete over pressured ionized clouds
          on the line of sight as in the model of Fiedler et al. (1987).
          We suggest that longer events could occur in a simulation of
          scintillation, if larger electron inhomogeneities > $10^{12}$ m
          were included in the construction of the Kolmogorov phase
          screen. This next step requires a supercomputer.

          The death of massive stars produces a variety of supernovae,
          which are linked to the structure of the exploding stars. The
          detection of several precursor stars of Type II supernovae have
          been reported, however we do not yet have direct information on
          the progenitors of the hydrogen deficient Type Ib and Ic
          supernovae. Here we report that the peculiar Type Ib supernova
          SN2006jc is spatially coincident with a bright optical
          transient that occurred in 2004. Spectroscopic and photometric
          monitoring of the supernova leads us to suggest that the
          progenitor was a carbon-oxygen Wolf-Rayet star embedded within
          a helium-rich circumstellar medium. There are different
          possible explanations for this pre-explosion transient. It
          appears similar to the giant outbursts of Luminous Blue
          Variables (LBV) of 60-100 solar mass stars, however the
          progenitor of SN2006jc was helium and hydrogen deficient. An
          LBV-like outburst of a Wolf-Rayet star could be invoked, but
          this would be the first observational evidence of such a
          phenomenon. Alternatively a massive binary system composed of
          an LBV which erupted in 2004, and a Wolf-Rayet star exploding
          as SN2006jc, could explain the observations.

          pages, 8 figures
          On September 21, 2006, an intense (~10^39 erg/s) and short (20
          ms) burst was detected by Swift BAT at a position consistent
          with that of the candidate Anomalous X-ray Pulsar, CXOU
          J164710.2-455216, discovered by Chandra in 2005. Swift
          follow-up observations began about 13 hours after the event and
          found the source at a 1-10keV flux level of about 4.5 x 10^-11
          erg/s/cm^2, i.e. ~300 times brighter than measured 5 days
          earlier by XMM. We report the results obtained from Swift BAT
          observations of the burst and subsequent Swift XRT observations
          carried out during the first four months after the burst. These
          data are complemented with those from two XMM observations
          (carried out just before and after the BAT event) and four
          archival Chandra observations carried out between 2005 and
          2007. We find a phase coherent solution for the source
          pulsations after the burst. The evolution of the pulse phase
          comprises an exponential component decaying with timescale of
          1.4d which we interpret as the recovery stage following a large
          glitch (Delta nu / nu about 6 x 10^-5). We also detect a
          quadratic component corresponding to a spin-down rate of Pdot ~
          9 x 10^-13, implying a magnetic field strength of 10^14 Gauss.
          During the first Swift XRT observation taken 0.6 days after the
          burst, the spectrum showed a kT = 0.65keV blackbody (R_BB =
          1.5km) plus a Gamma=2.3 power-law accounting for about 60% of
          the 1-10 keV observed flux. Analysis of Chandra archival data,
          taken during 2005 when the source was in quiescence, reveal
          that the modulation in quiescence is 100% pulsed at energies
          above 4 keV and consistent with the (unusually small-sized)
          blackbody component being occulted by the neutron star as it
          rotates.

          Title: Carbon Rich Extremely Metal Poor Stars: Signatures of
          Population-III AGB stars in Binary Systems
          Authors: H.B. Lau, R.J. Stancliffe, C.A. Tout
          Comments: 16 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables, accepted by MNRAS
          We use the Cambridge stellar evolution code STARS to model the
          evolution and nucleosynthesis of zero-metallicity
          intermediate-mass stars. We investigate the effect of duplicity
          on the nucleosynthesis output of these systems and the
          potential abundances of the secondaries. The surfaces of
          zero-metallicity stars are enriched in CNO elements after
          second dredge up. During binary interaction, such as Roche lobe
          overflow or wind accretion, metals can be released from these
          stars and the secondaries enriched in CNO isotopes. We
          investigate the formation of the two most metal poor stars
          known, HE 0107-5240 and HE 1327-2326. The observed carbon and
          nitrogen abundances of HE 0107-5240 can be reproduced by
          accretion of material from the companion-enhanced wind of a
          seven solar star after second dredge-up, though oxygen and
          sodium are underproduced. We speculate that HE 1327-2326, which
          is richer in nitrogen and strontium, may similarly be formed by
          wind accretion in a later AGB phase after third dredge-up.

          Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, MNRAS submitted
          Using ISAAC on the VLT, we have detected 2 candidate
          counterparts to the bursting pulsar GRO J 1744-28, one bright
          and one faint, both within the X-ray error circles found using
          XMM-Newton and Chandra. Photometry and spectroscopy of the
          bright candidate indicate that it is most likely a G type
          giant. The spectrum does not show Brackett-gamma emission, a
          known indicator of accretion, and dynamical calculations and
          comparison with the X-ray mass-function indicate that this star
          is most likely not the true X-ray source counterpart.
          Photometry of the fainter candidate indicates it is a K5 V star
          at a distance of 4 kpc. This fits the LEdd distance and the
          measured infrared extinction. If this star is the IR
          counterpart, dynamical calculations would require the system to
          be at very low inclination; however this source cannot be
          excluded without follow-up spectroscopy to detect emission
          signatures. The mass-function remains the tightest constraint
          for this system. The true counterpart most likely has a mass M
          < 0.3Msol. Mass transfer in such a system will be by
          wind-accretion as the counterpart will not fill its Roche lobe
          given the observed Porb. In this case, the derived magnetic
          field strength of 2.4 x 10^11 G is sufficient to inhibit
          accretion of captured material by the propeller effect.

          Authors: Slavek M. Rucinski, Theodor Pribulla, Marten van
          Kerkwijk
          We present results of the CFHT adaptive optics (AO) search for
          companions of a homogeneous group of contact binary stars, as a
          contribution of our attempts to prove a hypothesis that these
          binaries require a third star to become so close as observed.
          The data were obtained on two nights in 1998 and two nights in
          2005. In addition to companions directly discovered at
          separations of 1"-10" separations, we introduced a new method
          of AO image analysis to analyze distortions of the AO
          diffraction ring pattern at separations of 0.07"-1". Very close
          companions, with separations in the latter range were
          discovered in systems HV Aqr, OO Aql, CK Boo, XY Leo, BE Scl,
          and RZ Tau. More distant companions were detected in V402 Aur,
          AO Cam, V2082 Cyg. Our results provide a contribution to the
          mounting evidence that the presence of close companions is a
          very common phenomenon for very close binaries with orbital
          periods <1 day.

          Title: Wind-wind collision in the eta Carinae binary system -
          III. The HeII 4686 line profile
          Authors: Z. Abraham (IAG) D. Falceta-Goncalves (IAG & Nucleo de
          Astrofisica Teorica-UNICSUL)
          Comments: to appear in the MNRAS
          We modeled the HeII 4686 line profiles observed in the eta
          Carinae binary system close to the 2003.5 spectroscopic event,
          assuming that they were formed in the shocked gas that flows at
          both sides of the contact surface formed by wind-wind
          collision. We used a constant flow velocity and added
          turbulence in the form of a gaussian velocity distribution. We
          allowed emission from both the primary and secondary shocks but
          introduced infinite opacity at the contact surface, implying
          that only the side of the contact cone visible to the observer
          contributed to the line profile. Using the orbital parameters
          of the binary system derived from the 7 mm light curve during
          the last spectroscopic event (Paper II) we were able to
          reproduce the line profiles obtained with the HST at different
          epochs, as well as the line mean velocities obtained with
          ground based telescopes. A very important feature of our model
          is that the line profile depends on the inclination of the
          orbital plane; we found that to explain the latitude dependent
          mean velocity of the line, scattered into the line of sight by
          the Homunculus, the orbit inclination should be close to 90
          degrees, meaning that it does not lie in the Homunculus
          equatorial plane, as usually assumed. This inclination,
          together with the relative position of the stars during the
          spectroscopic events, allowed us to explain most of the
          observational features, like the variation of the Purple Haze
          with the orbital phase, and to conciliate the X-ray absorption
          with the postulated shell effect used to explain the optical
          and UV light curves.

          NGC1313 X-2 was among the first ultraluminous X-ray sources
          discovered, and has been a frequent target of X-ray and optical
          observations. Using the HST/ACS multi-band observations, this
          source is identified with a unique counterpart within an error
          circle of $0\farcs2$. The counterpart is a blue star on the
          edge of a young cluster of $\le10^7$ years amid a dominant old
          stellar population. Its spectral energy distribution is
          consistent with that for a Z=0.004 star with 8.5 $M_\odot$
          about $5\times10^6$ years old, or for an O7 V star at solar
          metallicity. The counterpart exhibited significant variability
          of $\Delta m = 0.153\pm0.033$ mag between two F555W
          observations separated by three months, reminiscent of the
          ellipsoidal variability due to the orbital motion of this ULX
          binary.

          Title: ASAS Eclipsing Binaries with Observed High Period Change
          Rates
          Authors: B. Pilecki, D. Fabrycky, R. Poleski
          Comments: 12 pages, 13 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We present 31 bright eclipsing contact and semi-detached
          binaries that showed high period change rates in a 5 year
          interval in observations by the All-Sky Automated Survey
          (ASAS). The time-scales of these changes range from only 50 up
          to 400 kyr. The orbital periods of 10 binaries are increasing
          and of 21 are decreasing, and even a larger excess is seen in
          contact binaries, where the numbers are 5 and 17, respectively.
          Period change has previously been noticed for only two of these
          binaries; our observations confirmed a secular period drift for
          SV Cen and period oscillations for VY Cet. The spectroscopic
          quadruple system V1084 Sco shows both period change and
          brightness modulation. All investigated binaries were selected
          from a sample of 1711 (1135 contact and 576 semi-detached) that
          fulfilled all criteria of data quality. We also introduce a
          "branch" test to check if luminosity changes on part of the
          binary's photosphere has led to a spurious or poorly

          Title: Dynamics of Charged Particles in the Radio Emission
          Region of Pulsar Magnetosphere

          Astrophysics)

          Astronomy and Astrophysics (2007)
          We consider the classical picture of three dimensional motion
          of charged particles in pulsar magnetosphere. We adopt a
          perturbative method to solve the equation of motion, and find
          the trajectory of particles as they move along the rotating
          dipolar magnetic field lines. Our aim is to study the influence
          of rotation on the pulsar radio emission by considering the
          constrained motion of particles along the open dipolar magnetic
          field lines. We find that the rotation induces a significant
          curvature into the particle trajectories. Our model predicts
          the intensity on leading side dominates over that of trailing
          side. We expect that if there is any curvature induced radio
          emission from the region close to the magnetic axis then it
          must be due to the rotation induced curvature. Our model
          predicts the radius--to--frequency mapping (RFM) in the core
          emissions.

          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          We aim to study the structure of the nebula around the
          post-AGB, binary star 89 Her. The presence of a rotating disk
          around this star had been proposed but not been yet confirmed
          by observations. We present high-resolution PdBI maps of CO
          J=2-1 and 1-0. Properties of the nebula are directly derived
          from the data and model fitting. We also present N-band
          interferometric data on the extent of the hot dust emission,
          obtained with the VLTI. Two nebular components are found: (a)
          an extended hour-glass-like structure, with expansion
          velocities of about 7 km/s and a total mass ~ 3 10$^{-3}$ Mo,
          and (b) an unresolved very compact component, smaller than ~
          0.4" and with a low total velocity dispersion of ~ 5 km/s. We
          cannot determine the velocity field in the compact component,
          but we argue that it can hardly be in expansion, since his
          would require too recent and too sudden an ejection of mass. On
          the other hand, assuming that this component is a keplerian
          disk, we derive disk properties that are compatible with
          expectations for such a structure; in particular, the size of
          the rotating gas disk should be very similar to the extent of
          the hot dust component from our VLTI data. Assuming that the
          equator of the extended nebula coincides with the binary
          orbital plane, we provide new results on the companion star
          mass and orbit.

          Title: Observable Signatures of a Black Hole Ejected by
          Gravitational Radiation Recoil in a Galaxy Merger
          Authors: Abraham Loeb (Harvard)
          Comments: 4 pages, submitted to PRL
          According to recent general-relativistic simulations, the
          coalescence of two spinning black holes (BHs) could lead to
          recoil speeds of the BH remnant of up to thousands of km/s as a
          result of the emission of gravitational radiation. Such speeds
          would enable the merger product to escape its host galaxy. Here
          we examine the circumstances resulting from a gas-rich galaxy
          merger under which the ejected BH would carry an accretion disk
          with it and be observable. As the initial BH binary emits
          gravitational radiation and its orbit tightens, a hole is
          opened around it in the disk which delays the consumption of
          gas prior to the eventual BH ejection. The punctured disk
          remains bound to the ejected BH within the region where the gas
          orbital velocity is larger than the ejection speed. For a ~10^7
          solar mass BH the ejected disk has a characteristic size of
          tens of thousands of Schwarzschild radii and an accretion
          lifetime of ~10^7 years. During that time, the ejected BH could
          traverse a considerable distance and appear as an off-center
          quasar with a feedback trail along the path it left behind. A
          small fraction of all quasars could be associated with an
          escaping BH.

          The discovery of the short-period giant exoplanet population,
          the so-called hot Jupiter population, and their link to brown
          dwarfs and low-mass stars challenges the conventional view of
          planet formation and evolution. We took advantage of the
          multi-fiber facilities GIRAFFE and FLAMES-UVES (VLT) to perform
          the first large radial velocity survey using a multi-fiber
          spectrograph, aiming at detecting planetary and brown dwarfs
          candidates and binaries. We observed during 5 consecutive
          half-nights 816 stars selected within one of the exoplanet
          field of the space mission CoRoT. We computed the radial
          velocities of these stars and shown that a systematic error of
          30 m s$^{-1}$ has been reached over 5 consecutive nights. Over
          the whole sample the Doppler measurements allowed us to
          identify a sample of 50 binaries, 9 active or blended binary
          stars, 5 unsolved cases and 14 exoplanets and brown dwarf
          candidates. Further higher precision Doppler measurements are
          now necessary to confirm and better characterize these
          candidates. This study demonstrates the efficiency of such a
          multi-fiber approach for large radial velocity surveys in
          search for exoplanets as well as the follow-up of transiting
          exoplanet candidates of existing and future programs like the
          CoRoT space mission.

          Title: Accretion rate and the occurrence of multi-peaked X-ray
          bursts
          Authors: Anna L. Watts, Immanuel Maurer (MPA Garching)
          Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Letters
          Most Type I X-ray bursts from accreting neutron stars have a
          lightcurve with a single peak, but there is a rare population
          of faint bursts that are double or even triple peaked.
          Suggested mechanisms include polar ignition with equatorial
          stalling, or multi-step energy release; the latter being caused
          by hydrodynamic instabilities or waiting points in the nuclear
          reaction sequence. We present an analysis of the accretion rate
          dependence of the multi-peak bursts, and discuss the
          consequences for the various models. The observations pose
          particular challenges for the polar ignition mechanism given
          current models of ignition latitude dependence.

          Accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics (manuscript AA-2006-6026)
          We report spatially resolved, spectrally dispersed N-band
          observations of the B[e] star Hen 3-1191 with the MIDI
          instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. The
          object is resolved with a 40 m baseline and has an equivalent
          uniform disc diameter ranging from 24 mas at 8 microns to 36
          mas at 13 microns. The MIDI spectrum and visibilities show a
          curvature which can arise from a weak silicate feature in which
          the object appears ~ 15% larger than in the continuum, but this
          could result from a change in the object's geometry within the
          band.
          We then model Hen's 3-1191 spectral energy distribution (.4-60
          microns) and N-band visibilities. Because of the unknown nature
          for the object, we use a wide variety of models for objects
          with IR excesses. We find the observations to be consistent
          with a disc featuring an unusually high mass accretion and a
          large central gap almost void of matter, an excretion disc, and
          a binary made of two IR sources. We are unable to find a
          circumstellar shell model consistent with the data.
          At last, we review the different hypotheses concerning the
          physical nature of the star and conclude that it is neither a
          Be supergiant nor a symbiotic star. However, we could not
          discriminate between the scenario of a young stellar object
          featuring an unusually strong FU Orionis-like outburst of mass
          accretion (4 to 250 x 10^-4 solar mass per year) and that of a
          protoplanetary nebula with an equatorial mass excretion rate
          (>~ 4 x 10^-5 solar mass per year). In both cases, taking the
          additional presence of an envelope or wind into account would
          result in lower mass flows.

          Title: The frequency of planets in multiple systems
          Authors: M. Bonavita, S. Desidera
          The frequency of planets in binaries is an important issue in
          the field of extrasolar planet studies, because of its
          relevance in estimating of the global planet population of our
          Galaxy and the clues it can give to our understanding of planet
          formation and evolution. However, only preliminary estimates
          are available in the literature. We analyze and compare the
          frequency of planets in multiple systems to the frequency of
          planets orbiting single stars. We also try to highlight
          possible connections between the frequency of planets and the
          orbital parameters of the binaries (such as the periastron and
          mass ratio.) A literature search was performed for binaries and
          multiple systems among the stars of the sample with uniform
          planet detectability defined by Fischer & Valenti (2005), and
          202 of the 850 stars of the sample turned out to be binaries,
          allowing a statistical comparison of the frequency of planets
          in binaries and single stars and a study of the run of the
          planet frequency as a function of the binary separation. We
          found that the global frequency of planets in the binaries of
          the sample is not statistically different from that of planets
          in single stars. Even conservatively taking the probable
          incompleteness of binary detection in our sample into account,
          we estimate that the frequency of planets in binaries can be no
          more than a factor of three lower than that of planets in
          single stars. There is no significant dependence of planet
          frequency on the binary separation, except for a lower value of
          frequency for close binaries. However, this is probably not as
          low as required to explain the presence of planets in close
          binaries only as the result of modifications of the binary
          orbit after the planet formation.

          Title: The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Insterstellar
          Clouds. IX. The Serpens YSO Population As Observed With IRAC
          and MIPS
          Authors: Paul Harvey, Bruno Merin, Tracy L. Huard, Luisa M.
          Rebull, Nicholas Chapman, Neal J. Evans II, Philip C. Myers
          We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d
          Spitzer Legacy observations of the Serpens star-forming region.
          In particular we present a set of criteria for isolating bona
          fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the extensive
          background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then
          discuss the properties of the resulting high confidence set of
          YSO's. We find 235 such objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that
          was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An additional set of 51
          lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified from the
          MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets
          of results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source
          properties with those of theoretical models for
          star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling of the subset
          of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
          exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that
          can be fit with actively accreting disks to some with both
          passive disks and even possibly debris disks. We find that the
          luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends down to at
          least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260
          pc. The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish
          YSO's from extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of
          YSO's at very low luminosities. A spatial clustering analysis
          shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are more highly
          clustered than the later stages and that the background
          extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point
          correlation function as seen in other extra-galactic studies.
          We also present a table of matches between several previous
          infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO population and
          our Spitzer data set.

          Society
          Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate
          Polar (IP) EX Hya in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are
          presented. Spin-modulated radial velocities consistent with an
          outer disc origin were detected for the first time in an IP.
          The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
          km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material
          circulating at the outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting
          corotation of the accretion curtain with material near the
          Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler tomograms have
          revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
          from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have
          confirmed the theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn
          (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and Norton et al. (2004) for EX
          Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that extend to a
          distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system.
          Evidence for overflow stream of material falling onto the
          magnetosphere was observed, confirming the result of Belle et
          al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is present during
          quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
          hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of
          the funnel at the outer disc edge, while those of halpha were
          produced due to the flow of material along the field lines far
          from the white dwarf (narrow component) and close to the white
          dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the accretion
          curtain model.

          Title: ALMA as the ideal probe of the solar chromosphere
          Authors: M. A. Loukitcheva, S. K. Solanki, S. White
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, to appear in the proceedings of
          the conference Science with ALMA: a new era for Astrophysics,
          Spain, 2006
          The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and
          dynamics, remains far from being properly understood, in spite
          of intensive research. Here we point out the potential of
          chromospheric observations at millimeter wavelengths to resolve
          this long-standing problem. Computations carried out with a
          sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to
          Carlsson and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is
          extremely sensitive to dynamic processes in the chromosphere
          and the appropriate wavelengths to look for dynamic signatures
          are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests that high
          resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided
          by ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the
          hot and the cool gas, and thus will have the potential of
          distinguishing between rival models of the solar atmosphere.
          Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of the
          quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12
          arcsec) reveal significant oscillations with amplitudes of
          50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8 mHz with a tendency toward
          short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer periods in
          network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as

          This paper presents a theoretical framework for turbulence in
          weakly collisional astrophysical plasmas: e.g., the solar wind,
          ISM, galaxy clusters, and accretion disks. The paper focuses on
          turbulence in a strong mean magnetic field. Fluctuations are
          assumed to be anisotropic with respect to the mean field and
          their frequency to be low compared to the ion cyclotron
          frequency. The turbulent energy must be dissipated into heat,
          which cannot happen without collisions. A kinetic cascade
          develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in
          space and velocity. The nature of the cascade depends on the
          physics of fluctuations at various scales. There are four
          special scales: the electron and ion gyroscales, the mean free
          path and the electron diffusion scale. In each of the scale
          ranges separated by these scales, the fully kinetic problem is
          reduced to a more physically transparent and computationally
          tractable model. In the ``inertial range'' above the ion
          gyroscale, the kinetic cascade separates into a cascade of
          Alfvenic fluctuations and a passive cascade of density and
          magnetic-field-strength fluctuations. The former are governed
          by two fluid-like Reduced MHD equations at both the collisional
          and collisionless scales; the latter obey a linear kinetic
          equation along the field lines associated with the Alfvenic
          component. In the ``dissipation range'' between the ion and
          electron gyroscales, there are the kinetic-Alfven-wave (KAW)
          cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron Reduced MHD
          equations and a passive cascade of ion entropy fluctuations in
          the phase space, which brings to collisional scales the energy
          damped by collisionless wave-particle interaction and leads to
          ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly converted into the
          electron heat. Astrophysical applications are discussed in
          detail.

          Title: The Mass and Radius of the Unseen M-Dwarf Companion in

          We derive masses and radii for both components in the
          single-lined eclipsing binary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of
          a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf secondary. The system's period
          is short, $P=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, with an orbit
          indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We
          demonstrate generally that the surface gravity of the secondary
          star in a single-lined binary undergoing total eclipses can be
          derived from characteristics of the light curve and
          spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique
          line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For
          HAT-TR-205-013, we assume the orbit has been tidally
          circularized, and that the primary's rotation has been
          synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed
          line broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$
          \kms, gives a primary radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$
          \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to the radius of the
          secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the
          semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351
          \pm 0.0014$ AU. Our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the
          semimajor axis then yield the individual masses, $M_{\rm B} =
          0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $M_{\rm A} = 1.04 \pm 0.13$ \msun.
          Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical
          mass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results
          from double-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe
          offers the opportunity to study the very low end of the stellar
          mass-radius relation.

          Title: Shaping the Globular Cluster Mass Function by
          Stellar-Dynamical Evaporation
          Authors: Dean E. McLaughlin, S. Michael Fall
          Comments: 8 pages, submitted to ApJ.
          Dynamical-evolution models of old globular cluster mass
          functions (GCMFs), in which the depletion of an initial
          power-law distribution at low masses is caused predominantly by
          evaporation driven by internal two-body relaxation, can explain
          the turnover mass scale M_{TO} and the generic shape of the
          GCMF at M < M_{TO}. We point out that such models inherently
          predict that the GCMF should depend on the cluster half-mass
          density, rho_h, and we show that the Galactic GCMF exhibits
          precisely the expected variations: M_{TO} increases
          systematically with rho_h, while the width of the distribution
          decreases. The quantitative details are consistent with a
          cluster mass-loss rate, -dM/dt = mu_{ev} ~ rho_h^{1/2} with
          rho_h approximately constant in time, which we adopt as the
          simplest description of evaporation. The normalization of
          mu_{ev} is within a factor of two of standard theoretical
          expectations. We show that the known, weak dependence of the
          Milky Way GCMF on Galactocentric position r_{gc} results from
          its basic dependence on cluster density plus a very scattered
          rho_h(r_{gc}) distribution, which we take directly from
          observations. This effectively removes the weakness of radial
          GCMF variations as an argument against an
          evaporation-dominated, evolutionary origin for the peak and
          low-mass behavior of the distribution. Similarly, a previously
          noted difference between the mass functions of low- and
          high-concentration Galactic globulars follows directly from the
          dependence on rho_h, combined with differences in the rho_h
          distribution at low and high cluster concentrations; it does
          not require distinct mass-loss laws for GCs in these two
          regimes.

          Title: Timing and Lensing of the Colliding Bullet Clusters:
          barely enough time and gravity to accelerate the bullet
          Authors: HongSheng Zhao (SUPA, St Andrews)
          Comments: 5-pages, Physical Review D, rapid publication
          submitted
          We present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark
          matter in the merging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical
          Local Group timing arguments. We consider particle orbits in
          potential models which fit the lensing data. {\it Marginally
          consistent} CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with a
          total mass M_{CDM} = 1 x 10^{15}Msun of Cold DM: the bullet
          subhalo can move with V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the "bullet" X-ray
          gas can move with V_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it
          maximum speeds} that are accelerable by the gravity of two
          truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even without the ram
          pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of
          the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and
          the bullet gas would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for
          the Hubble time. Models with V_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would
          invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x 10^{15}Msun of CDM
          for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Our results
          are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of
          $4500\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian
          lensing model of Angus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model
          with little hot dark matter $M_{HDM} \le 0.6\times
          10^{15}\msun$ and CDM model with a small halo mass $\le 1\times
          10^{15}\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity
          data.

          Context. Swift data are revolutionising our understanding of
          Gamma Ray Bursts. Since bursts fade rapidly, it is desirable to
          create and disseminate accurate light curves rapidly.
          Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of
          X-ray light curves obtained with Swift. The light curves should
          be of the quality expected of published data, but automatically
          created and updated so as to be self-consistent and rapidly
          available. Methods. We have produced a suite of programs which
          automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects
          of the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and
          pile-up are appropriately handled, and the data are binned with
          variable bin durations, as necessary for a fading source.
          Results. The light curve repository website (this http URL)
          contains light curves, hardness ratios and deep images for
          every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs are
          detected, light curves are created and updated within minutes
          of the data arriving at the UK Swift Science Data Centre.

          We report the first detection of the 6.2micron and 7.7micron
          infrared `PAH' emission features in the spectrum of a high
          redshift QSO, from the Spitzer-IRS spectrum of the Cloverleaf
          lensed QSO (H1413+117, z~2.56). The ratio of PAH features and
          rest frame far-infrared emission is the same as in lower
          luminosity star forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in
          local PG QSOs, supporting a predominantly starburst nature of
          the Cloverleaf's huge far-infrared luminosity (5.4E12 Lsun,
          corrected for lensing). The Cloverleaf's period of dominant QSO
          activity (Lbol ~ 7E13 Lsun) is coincident with an intense (star
          formation rate ~1000 Msun/yr) and short (gas exhaustion time
          ~3E7yr) star forming event.

          By combining high-resolution HST and wide-field ground based
          observations, in ultraviolet and optical bands, we study the
          Blue Stragglers Star (BSS) population of the galactic globular
          cluster M5 (NGC 5904) from its very central regions up to its
          periphery. The BSS distribution is highly peaked in the cluster
          center, decreases at intermediate radii and rises again
          outward. Such a bimodal distribution is similar to those
          previously observed in other globular clusters (M3, 47Tucanae,
          NGC6752). As for these clusters, dynamical simulations suggest
          that, while the majority of BSS in M5 could be originated by
          stellar collisions, a significant fraction (20-40%) of BSS
          generated by mass transfer processes in primordial binaries is
          required to reproduce the observed radial distribution. A
          candidate BSS has been detected beyond the cluster tidal
          radius. If confirmed, this could represent an interesting case
          of an "evaporating" BSS.

          The large quantity and high quality of modern radio and
          infrared line observations require efficient modeling
          techniques to infer physical and chemical parameters such as
          temperature, density, and molecular abundances. We present a
          computer program to calculate the intensities of atomic and
          molecular lines produced in a uniform medium, based on
          statistical equilibrium calculations involving collisional and
          radiative processes and including radiation from background
          sources. Optical depth effects are treated with an escape
          probability method. The program is available on the World Wide
          Web at this http URL . The program makes use of molecular data
          files maintained in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database
          (LAMDA), which will continue to be improved and expanded. The
          performance of the program is compared with more approximate
          and with more sophisticated methods. An Appendix provides
          diagnostic plots to estimate physical parameters from line
          intensity ratios of commonly observed molecules. This program
          should form an important tool in analyzing observations from
          current and future radio and infrared telescopes.

          Title: Nonlinear force-free coronal magnetic field modeling
          scheme based on the direct boundary integral formulation
          Authors: Han He, Huaning Wang
          Comments: 8 pages, 12 figures, submitted to JGR - Space Physics
          The boundary integral equation (BIE) method was first proposed
          by Yan and Sakurai [2000], which is used to extrapolate the
          nonlinear force-free magnetic field in the solar atmosphere.
          Recently, Yan and Li [2006] improved the BIE method and
          proposed the direct boundary integral equation (DBIE)
          formulation, which represents the nonlinear force-free magnetic
          field by direct integration of the magnetic field on the bottom
          boundary surface. Based on this new method, we devised a
          practical calculation scheme for the nonlinear force-free field
          modeling above solar active regions. The code of the scheme was
          tested both by the analytical solutions given by Low and Lou
          [1990], and by the observed data of vector magnetograms in the
          photosphere. The calculated field lines above the active
          regions present the X-shaped structure as well as the S-shaped
          loops, which can be helpful for understanding the magnetic
          reconnection processes during solar flares.

          We argue that the discrepancies observed in HII regions between
          abundances derived from optical recombination lines (ORLs) and
          collisionally excited lines (CELs) might well be the signature
          of a scenario of the enrichment of the interstellar medium
          (ISM) proposed by Tenorio-Tagle (1996). In this scenario, the
          fresh oxygen released during massive supernova explosions is
          confined within the hot superbubbles as long as supernovae
          continue to explode. Only after the last massive supernova
          explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling down and falls on
          the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these
          metal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization
          by the next generations of massive stars. During this process,
          the metal-rich droplets give rise to strong recombination lines
          of the metals, leading to the observed ORL-CEL discrepancy.

          We investigate the acceleration and simultaneous radiative
          losses of electrons in the vicinity of relativistic shocks.
          Particles undergo pitch angle diffusion, gaining energy as they
          cross the shock by the Fermi mechanism and also emitting
          synchrotron radiation in the ambient magnetic field. A
          semi-analytic approach is developed which allows us to consider
          the behaviour of the shape of the spectral cut-off and the
          variation of that cut-off with the particle pitch angle. The
          implications for the synchrotron emission of relativistic jets,
          such as those in gamma ray burst sources and blazars, are
          discussed.

          The complex Monoceros Loop SNR/Rosette Nebula region contains
          several potential sources of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray
          emission and two as yet unidentified high-energy EGRET sources.
          Sensitive VHE observations are required to probe acceleration
          processes in this region. The H.E.S.S. telescope array has been
          used to search for very high-energy gamma-ray sources in this
          region. CO data from the NANTEN telescope were used to map the
          molecular clouds in the region, which could act as target
          material for gamma-ray production via hadronic interactions. We
          announce the discovery of a new gamma-ray source, HESS
          J0632+058, located close to the rim of the Monoceros SNR. This
          source is unresolved by H.E.S.S. and has no clear counterpart
          at other wavelengths but is possibly associated with the weak

          the lower energy gamma-ray source 3EG J0634+0521. No evidence

          Energy
          Authors: Luca Amendola, Christos Charmousis, Stephen C. Davis
          Comments: 12 pages
          Although the Gauss-Bonnet term is a topological invariant for
          general relativity, it couples naturally to a quintessence
          scalar field, modifying gravity at solar system scales. We
          determine the solar system constraints due to this term by
          evaluating the post-Newtonian metric for a distributional
          source. We find a mass dependent, 1/r^7 correction to the
          Newtonian potential, and also deviations from the Einstein
          gravity prediction for light-bending. We constrain the
          parameters of the theory using planetary orbits, the Cassini
          spacecraft data, and a laboratory test of Newton's law, always
          finding extremely tight bounds on the energy associated to the
          Gauss-Bonnet term. We discuss the relevance of these
          constraints to late-time cosmological acceleration.

          Symposium, February 5-8, 2007, Stanford University, USA, to
          appear in the proceedings
          I describe the different classes of Active Galactic Nuclei
          (AGN) and the basic tenets of unified schemes. I then review
          the properties of the extragalactic sources detected in the GeV
          and TeV bands, showing that the vast majority of them belong to
          the very rare blazar class. I further discuss the kind of AGN
          GLAST is likely to detect, making some predictions going from
          the obvious to the likely, all the way to the less probable.

          Title: The transverse proximity effect in spectral hardness on
          the line of sight towards HE 2347-4342
          Authors: G. Worseck (1), C. Fechner (2), L. Wisotzki (1), A.
          Dall'Aglio (1) ((1) Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam, (2)
          Hamburger Sternwarte)
          Comments: 16 pages, 12 figures, submitted to A&A
          We report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of HE
          2347-4342, one of the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII
          forest has been resolved with FUSE. By analysing the HI and the
          HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse proximity
          effect is detected near three foreground quasars at z>2 due to
          line contamination and overdensities probably created by
          large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
          corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating
          spectral shape of the extragalactic UV radiation field along
          this line of sight. We find that the UV spectral shape near HE
          2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three foreground
          quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV
          background models dominated by quasars. Moreover, two metal
          line systems near QSO J23495-4338 and QSO J23503-4328 are
          consistent with a hard radiation field including a contribution
          of the quasars. We conclude that the foreground quasars show a
          transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local
          hardening of the UV radiation field, although the evidence is
          strongest for QSO J23495-4338. Thus, the relative spectral
          hardness traces the proximity effect also in overdense regions
          prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.
          Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by
          radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to
          understand the observed spectral shape variations. From the
          transverse proximity effect of QSO J23495-4338 we obtain a
          lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25Myr.

          Comments: 50 pages; Full paper with all figures available at
          this http URL; Accepted by AJ
          We present B, R, and Halpha imaging data of 19 large disk
          galaxies whose properties are intermediate between classical
          low surface brightness galaxies and ordinary high surface
          brightness galaxies. We use data taken from the Lowell 1.8m
          Perkins telescope to determine the galaxies' overall
          morphology, color, and star formation properties.
          Morphologically, the galaxies range from Sb through Irr and
          include galaxies with and without nuclear bars. The colors of
          the galaxies vary from B-R = 0.3 - 1.9, and most show at least
          a slight bluing of the colors with increasing radius. The
          Halpha images of these galaxies show an average star formation
          rate lower than is found for similar samples with higher
          surface brightness disks. Additionally, the galaxies studied
          have both higher gas mass-to-luminosity and diffuse Halpha
          emission than is found in higher surface brightness samples.

          Title: A Spitzer census of the IC 348 nebula
          Authors: August A. Muench, Charles J. Lada, K. L. Luhman, James
          Muzerolle, Erick Young
          Comments: Accepted to AJ; 33 pages in emulateapj format.
          We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and
          embedded star cluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by
          ground based spectra has added 42 class II T-Tauri sources to
          the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I protostars.
          The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after
          accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our
          Spitzer census of IC 348 reveals a population of protostars
          that is anti-correlated spatially with the T-Tauri members,
          which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around a B star.
          The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster
          periphery about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a
          filamentary ridge. We find that the star formation rate in this
          protostellar ridge is consistent with that rate which built the
          exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold, starless,
          millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population
          indicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming
          stars. We show that the IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing
          times old, and, as evidenced by its smooth radial profile and
          confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While it seems
          apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result
          of dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been
          erased, our findings support a model where embedded clusters
          are built up from numerous smaller sub-clusters. Finally, the
          results of our Spitzer census indicate that the supposition
          that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud
          should not preclude these observations that show it can be
          relatively long lived.

          Title: Discovery of X-ray emission from the young radio pulsar
          PSR J1357-6429
          Authors: P. Esposito, A. Tiengo, A. De Luca, F. Mattana
          Comments: Submitted to A&A Letters on 2007 March 14 (revised
          version following referee's comments)
          We present the first X-ray detection of the very young pulsar
          PSR J1357-6429 (characteristic age of 7.3 kyr) using data from
          the XMM-Newton and Chandra satellites. We found that the
          spectrum is well described by a power-law plus blackbody model,
          with photon index Gamma=1.4 and blackbody temperature kT=160
          eV. For the estimated distance of 2.5 kpc, this corresponds to
          a 2-10 keV luminosity of about 1.2E+32 erg/s, thus the fraction
          of the spin-down energy channeled by PSR J1357-6429 into X-ray
          emission is one of the lowest observed. The Chandra data
          confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar and
          allow to set un upper limit of 3E+31 erg/s on the 2-10 keV
          luminosity of a compact pulsar wind nebula. We do not detect
          any pulsed emission from the source and determine an upper
          limit of 30% for the modulation amplitude of the X-ray emission
          at the radio frequency of the pulsar.

          Years after Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursters", held in Aspen
          CO. USA, Feb 19-23, 2007
          We have been monitoring Supernova (SN) 1987A with {\it Chandra
          X-Ray Observatory} since 1999. We present a review of previous
          results from our {\it Chandra} observations, and some
          preliminary results from new {\it Chandra} data obtained in
          2006 and 2007. High resolution imaging and spectroscopic
          studies of SN 1987A with {\it Chandra} reveal that X-ray
          emission of SN 1987A originates from the hot gas heated by
          interaction of the blast wave with the ring-like dense
          circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive
          progenitor's equatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion.
          The blast wave is now sweeping through dense CSM all around the
          inner ring, and thus SN 1987A is rapidly brightening in soft
          X-rays. At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January), X-ray
          luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\rm X}$ $\sim$ 2.4 $\times$
          10$^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. X-ray
          emission is described by two-component plane shock model with
          electron temperatures of $kT$ $\sim$ 0.3 and 2 keV. As the
          shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring,
          the X-ray remnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of $v$
          $\sim$ 1400 km s$^{-1}$ than it was until 2004 ($v$ $\sim$ 6000
          km s$^{-1}$).

          Nebula, its Neutron Star, and the Progenitor Supernova

          Astrophysical Journal
          We present new observational results obtained for the Galactic
          non-thermal radio source G328.4+0.2 to determine both if this
          source is a pulsar wind nebula or supernova remnant, and in
          either case, the physical properties of this source. Using
          X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-ray emission
          from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best
          fit by a power law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for
          a thermal component, the X-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes
          from a region significantly smaller than the radio emission,
          and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantly offset
          from each other. We also present the results of a new high
          resolution (7 arcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained
          using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, and a deep search
          for radio pulsations using the Parkes Radio Telescope. We find
          that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some areas
          along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio
          spectral index of ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity
          limit of the central pulsar of L_{1400} < 30 mJy kpc^2,
          assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of these observational
          results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or
          a large PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple
          hydrodynamic model for the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As
          a result of this analysis, we conclude that G328.4+0.2 is a
          young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula formed by a low
          magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly
          (<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an
          energetic (>10^51 ergs), low ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses)
          supernova explosion which occurred in a low density (n~0.03
          cm^{-3}) environment.

          Comments: submitted to 2007 Gravity Research Foundation Essay

          We demonstrate that as we extrapolate the current $\Lambda$CDM
          universe forward in time, all evidence of the Hubble expansion
          will disappear, so that observers in our "island universe" will
          be fundamentally incapable of determining the true nature of
          the universe, including the existence of the highly dominant
          vacuum energy, the existence of the CMB, and the primordial
          origin of light elements. With these pillars of the modern Big
          Bang gone, this epoch will mark the end of cosmology and the
          return of a static universe. In this sense, the coordinate
          system appropriate for future observers will perhaps fittingly
          resemble the static coordinate system in which the de Sitter
          universe was first presented.

          We present maps of 1.5 square degrees of the Serpens dark cloud
          at 24, 70, and 160\micron observed with the Spitzer Space
          Telescope MIPS Camera. More than 2400 compact sources have been
          extracted at 24um, nearly 100 at 70um, and 4 at 160um. We
          estimate completeness limits for our 24um survey from Monte
          Carlo tests with artificial sources inserted into the Spitzer
          maps. We compare source counts, colors, and magnitudes in the
          Serpens cloud to two reference data sets, a 0.50 deg^2 set on a
          low-extinction region near the dark cloud, and a 5.3 deg^2
          subset of the SWIRE ELAIS N1 data that was processed through
          our pipeline. These results show that there is an easily
          identifiable population of young stellar object candidates in
          the Serpens Cloud that is not present in either of the
          reference data sets. We also show a comparison of visual
          extinction and cool dust emission illustrating a close
          correlation between the two, and find that the most embedded
          YSO candidates are located in the areas of highest visual
          extinction.

          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We present new theoretical predictions for the galaxy
          three-point correlation function (3PCF) using high-resolution
          dissipationless cosmological simulations of a flat LCDM
          Universe which resolve galaxy-size halos and subhalos. We
          create realistic mock galaxy catalogs by assigning luminosities
          and colors to dark matter halos and subhalos, and we measure
          the reduced 3PCF as a function of luminosity and color in both
          real and redshift space. As galaxy luminosity and color are
          varied, we find small differences in the amplitude and shape
          dependence of the reduced 3PCF, at a level qualitatively
          consistent with recent measurements from the SDSS and 2dFGRS.
          We confirm that discrepancies between previous 3PCF
          measurements can be explained in part by differences in binning
          choices. We explore the degree to which a simple local bias
          model can fit the simulated 3PCF. The agreement between the
          model predictions and galaxy 3PCF measurements lends further
          credence to the straightforward association of galaxies with
          CDM halos and subhalos.

          Title: Multi-spectral Observations of Lunar Occultations: I.
          Resolving The Dust Shell Around AFGL 5440
          Authors: Paul M. Harvey, Andrew Oldag
          We present observations and modeling of a lunar occultation of
          the dust-enshrouded carbon star AFGL 5440. The observations
          were made over a continuous range of wavelengths from 1 - 4um
          with a high-speed spectrophotometer designed expressly for this
          purpose. We find that the occultation fringes cannot be fit by
          any single-size model. We use the DUSTY radiative transfer code
          to model a circumstellar shell and fit both the observed
          occultation light curves and the spectral energy distribution
          described in the literature. We find a strong constraint on the
          inner radius of the dust shell, Tmax = 950 K +/- 50K, and
          optical depth at 5um of 0.5 +/- 0.1. The observations are best
          fit by models with a density gradient of r^-2 or the gradient
          derived by Ivezic & Elitzur for a radiatively driven
          hydrodynamic outflow. Our models cannot fit the observed IRAS
          60um flux without assuming a substantial abundance of graphite
          or by assuming a substantially higher mass-loss rate in the
          past.

          Objects

          Comments: 23 pages, 9 figures, 1 table; to appear in
          `Transneptunian Objects', Barucci et al. eds., University of
          Arizona Press
          This chapter summarizes analytic theory and numerical
          calculations for the formation and collisional evolution of
          KBOs at 20--150 AU. We describe the main predictions of a
          baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical
          perturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant
          planet modify the evolution. Although robust comparisons
          between observations and theory require better KBO statistics
          and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly
          consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by
          substantial collisional grinding and dynamical ejection.
          However, there are important problems reconciling the results
          of coagulation and dynamical calculations. Contrasting our
          current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids
          suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the
          identification of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the
          2003 EL61 family), would provide additional information on the
          relative roles of collisional grinding and dynamical ejection
          in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate
          calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution,
          a `unified' calculation that should give us a better picture of
          KBO formation and evolution.

          (Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong
          lensing, weak lensing, and optical observations with numerical
          simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray
          observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster with a prominent
          bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of the
          total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the
          collisionless galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray
          brightness peaks). Previous studies, based on older
          observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the
          self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass,
          sigma/m, using simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we
          take advantage of new, higher-quality observational datasets by
          running N-body simulations of 1E0657-56 that include the
          effects of self-interacting dark matter, and comparing the
          results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow
          for a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on
          the non-observation of an offset between the bullet subcluster
          mass peak and galaxy centroid. This new method places an upper
          limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If we make the
          assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal
          mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most
          stringent constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from
          the consistency of the subcluster's observed mass-to-light
          ratio with the main cluster's, and with the universal cluster
          value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark
          matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our
          limit is a slight improvement over the previous result from
          analytic estimates, and rules out most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g
          range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the standard
          collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.

          Spectral variability is the main tool for constraining emission
          models of BL
          Lac objects. By means of systematic observations of the BL Lac
          prototype PKS 2155-304 in the infrared-optical band, we explore
          variability on the scales of months, days and hours. We made
          our observations with the robotic 60 cm telescope REM located
          at La Silla, Chile. VRIJHK filters were used. PKS 2155-304 was
          observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval
          explored, the total number of photometric points and the short
          integration time render our photometry substantially superior
          to previous ones for this source. On the basis of the intensity
          and colour we distinguish three different states of the source,
          each of duration of months, which include all those described
          in the literature. In particular, we report the highest state
          ever detected in the H band. The source varied by a factor of 4
          in this band, much more than in the V band (a factor ~2). The
          source softened with increasing intensity, contrary to the
          general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights
          of November we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours.
          A variability episode with a time scale of ~24 h is well
          documented, a much more rapid flare with t=1-2 h, is also
          apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.

          Title: Supernova Polarization and the Type IIn Classification
          Authors: Jennifer L. Hoffman
          Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures; to appear in the AIP conference
          proceedings of "Supernova 1987A: 20 Years After - Supernovae
          and Gamma-Ray Bursters", February 19-23, 2007, Aspen, Colorado
          While the members of the Type IIn category of supernovae are
          united by the presence of strong multicomponent Balmer emission
          lines in their spectra, they are quite heterogeneous with
          respect to other properties such as Balmer line profiles, light
          curves, strength of radio emission, and intrinsic brightness.
          We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their
          polarimetric characteristics as well, some but not all of which
          may be due to inclination angle effects. The increasing number
          of known "hybrid" SNe with IIn-like emission lines suggests
          that circumstellar material may be more common around all types
          of SNe than previously thought. Investigation of the
          correlations between spectropolarimetric signatures and other
          IIn attributes will help us address the question of
          classification of "interacting SNe" and the possibility of
          distinguishing different groups within the diverse IIn
          subclass.

          Title: Near-Infrared Spectra of the Black Hole X-Ray Binary,
          A0620-00
          Authors: C.S. Froning, E.L. Robinson, M.A. Bitner
          Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal
          We present broadband NIR spectra of A0620-00 obtained with SpeX
          on the IRTF. The spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum
          on which are superimposed broad emission lines of HI and HeII
          and a host of narrower absorption lines of neutral metals and
          molecules. Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the
          dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00
          spectrum in J and H for all stars of spectral type K7V or
          earlier, demonstrating that the donor star, unless later than
          K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In
          addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are
          too weak with respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor
          star contribution, restricting the spectral type of the donor
          star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison of the A0620-00
          spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO
          absorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than
          in field dwarf stars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche
          lobe-filling donor star to the spectrum of A0620-00 show that
          the best match to the CO absorption lines is obtained when the
          C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star
          contribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%.
          Combined with previous published results from Froning &
          Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al. (1994), this gives a precise
          mass for the black hole in A0620-00 of M_BH = 9.7+-0.6 M_solar.

          Title: Modeling the Spectral Energy Distribution and
          Variability of 3C 66A during the WEBT campaign of 2003 -- 2004
          Authors: M. Joshi, M. Boettcher
          Comments: 23 pages, 9 figures, submitted to and accepted for
          publication in ApJ
          The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive
          multiwavelength monitoring campaign from July 2003 till April
          2004. The spectral energy distribution (SED) was measured over
          the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with flux measurements
          from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very
          high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a
          time-dependent leptonic jet model to reproduce the SED and
          optical spectral variability observed during our
          multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could
          successfully reproduce the observed SED and optical light
          curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value for the VHE
          gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth
          due to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR)
          on the peak of the high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to
          be negligible. Also, the presence of a broad line region (BLR)
          in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role in the
          emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very
          close to the central engine, but further out, the production
          mechanism of hard X-ray and gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly
          dominated by synchrotron self-Compton emission. We further
          discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral
          variability pattern. The simulated results do not predict
          observable hysteresis patterns in the optical or soft X-ray
          regimes for major flares on multi-day time scales.

          Comments: submitted to A&A (January 09, 2007)
          Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key
          diagnostic of planetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This
          motivates planet searches around stars which are significantly
          more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in particular
          our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass
          stars. Methods: As part of that program, we obtained
          measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5 dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a
          dispersion much in excess of their internal errors. An
          intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess
          dispersion is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with
          periods of 4.69 and 35 days. Results: These data are well
          described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each planet has a
          ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)
          magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the
          35-day period coincides with the stellar rotation period. This
          signal therefore originates in a spot inhomogeneity modulated
          by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the other hand is
          caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its
          detection adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets
          around M-dwarfs, and reinforces the emerging conclusion that
          this mass domain is much more populated than the jovian mass
          range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf with
          and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they
          are drawn from the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find
          tentative evidence that the host star metallicity correlates
          with the total mass of their planetary system.

          Title: A Comparison between Anomalous 6-cm H$_2$CO Absorption

          We report observations of the dust cloud L1204 with the Onsala
          25-m telescope in the 6 cm (1$_{11}-1_{10}$) transition of
          \htco. The observed region includes the
          S140 H${\alpha}$ arc. This spectral line is seen here in
          absorption against the cosmic microwave background, indicating
          the presence of widespread warm molecular gas at intermediate
          densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$CO and CO (taken
          from the literature) are fairly similar, though significant
          differences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO
          peak is nearly coincident with the S140 H${\alpha}$ arc, the
          maximum H$_2$CO absorption is clearly separated from it by a
          full 10$'$ beam ($\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that these differences
          result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.
          The CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased
          towards warm gas than the H$_2$CO 6 cm line. On the other hand,
          formaldehyde is more easily photodissociated and is, therefore,
          a poorer tracer of the molecular gas located immediately behind
          Photon Dominated Regions.

          Title: A New Model For The Loop-I (The North Polar Spur) Region
          Authors: M. Wolleben
          Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures, to appear in ApJ
          The North Polar Spur (NPS) is the brightest filament of Loop I,
          a large circular feature in the radio continuum sky. In this
          paper, a model consisting of two synchrotron emitting shells is
          presented that reproduces large-scale structures revealed by
          recent polarization surveys. The polarized emission of the NPS
          is reproduced by one of these shells. The other shell, which
          passes close to the Sun, gives rise to polarized emission
          towards the Galactic poles. It is proposed that X-ray emission
          seen towards the NPS is produced by interaction of the two
          shells. Two OB-associations coincide with the centers of the
          shells. A formation scenario of the Loop I region is suggested.

          We present excellent resolution and high sensitivity Very Large

          face-on galaxy NGC 1058, providing the first reliable study of
          the HI profile shapes throughout the entire disk of an external
          galaxy. Our observations show an intriguing picture of the
          interstellar medium; throughout this galaxy velocity--
          dispersions range between 4 to 15 km/sec but are not correlated
          with star formation, stars or the gaseous spiral arms. The
          velocity dispersions decrease with radius, but this global
          trend has a large scatter as there are several isolated,
          resolved regions of high dispersion. The decline of star light
          with radius is much steeper than that of the velocity
          dispersions or that of the energy in the gas motions.

          Title: Common Envelope Evolution Redux

          Urbana-Champaign)

          Binary Stars", ed. E.F. Milone, D.A. Leahy, & D.W. Hobill
          (Springer)
          Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange,
          when the envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser
          companion, and the core of the donor plus the dense companion
          star spiral inward through this dissipative envelope. As
          conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be
          responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with
          degenerate components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of
          accounting for short-period binaries containing one white dwarf
          component. However, attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary
          histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more
          problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass
          loss, either during the close of the first, slow episode of
          mass transfer that produced the first white dwarf, or during
          the detached phase preceding the final, common envelope
          episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with
          massive white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS
          Oph, also presents interpretative difficulties for simple
          energetic treatments of common envelope evolution. Their
          existence implies that major terms are missing from usual
          formulations of the energy budget for common envelope
          evolution. The most plausible missing energy term is the energy
          released by recombination in the common envelope, and, indeed,
          a simple reformulation the energy budget explicitly including
          recombination resolves this issue.

          Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have been detected at GeV energies by

          detected since the beginning of 2000 by BATSE, BeppoSax,
          HETE-2, INTEGRAL, Swift or the IPN. No evidence for emission
          from any of the bursts has been found and we present upper
          limits from these bursts.

          realistic simulations

          Comments: 34 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We investigate the evolution of binary fractions in star
          clusters using N-body models of up to 100000 stars. Primordial
          binary frequencies in these models range from 5% to 50%.
          Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and include a
          full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary
          evolution and the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the
          overall binary fraction of a cluster almost always remains
          close to the primordial value, except at late times when a
          cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the
          central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary
          fraction with time -- a simulation starting with 100000 stars
          and 5% binaries reached a core binary frequency as high as 40%
          at the end of the core-collapse phase (occurring at 16 Gyr with
          ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in the core by
          a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the
          combination of mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in
          exchange interactions produces the observed increase in
          relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled into and
          out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to
          convection in stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that
          the evolution of the core-radius up to the end of the initial
          phase of core-collapse is not affected by the exact value of
          the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or
          less). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the
          likely primordial binary content of globular clusters.

          We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two
          carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a
          0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white dwarf merger is followed by a
          three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an elaborate
          prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially
          absent, unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of
          SPH particles than earlier calculations. Based on this
          simulation, we suggest that the central region of the merger
          remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium, be
          approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which
          consists of a slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating
          hot envelope surrounded by a centrifugally supported disc. We
          construct a model of the CO remnant that mimics the results of
          the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic stellar
          evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The
          stellar evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold
          core is controlled by neutrino cooling at the interface between
          the core and the hot envelope, and that carbon ignition in the
          envelope can be avoided despite high effective accretion rates.
          This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion of
          cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the
          evolution of double CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be
          appropriate. Our results imply that at least some products of
          double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good candidates
          for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the
          characteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger
          and the eventual explosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).

          Air fluorescence detectors measure the energy of ultra-high
          energy cosmic rays by collecting fluorescence light emitted
          from nitrogen molecules along the extensive air shower cascade.
          To ensure a reliable energy determination, the light signal
          needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not only
          attenuate the signal, but also produce a non-negligible
          background component due to scattered Cherenkov light and
          multiple-scattered light. The correction requires regular
          measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol
          phase function, defined as the probability of light scattered
          in a given direction. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in
          Malargue, Argentina, the phase function is measured on an
          hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF) light
          sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field
          of view of the fluorescence detectors; the phase function can
          be extracted from the image of the shots in the fluorescence
          detector cameras. This paper describes the design, current
          status, standard operation procedure, and performance of the
          APF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory.

          Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear
          central holes in their protoplanetary disks, but the extent to
          which material can flow from the circumbinary disk across the
          gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has been unclear.
          In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the
          outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap,
          resulting in accretion that varies with the binary period. This
          accretion may manifest itself observationally as periodic
          changes in luminosity. Here we present a search for such
          periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic
          binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three
          years; we find that the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly
          periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16 +/- 0.04 days. This
          is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13
          days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial
          velocity data. The brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant
          random variability, but the overall periodic pattern is a broad
          peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than half the binary
          orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as
          clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some
          periodic component is not ruled out. The photometric variations
          are in good agreement with predictions from simulations of
          binaries with orbital parameters similar to those of UZ Tau E,
          suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from circumbinary
          disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the
          timescale over which they might form planets.

          Title: VLBI observations of nineteen GHz-Peaked-Spectrum radio
          sources at 1.6 GHz

          Aims and Methods: We present the results of VLBI observations
          of nineteen GHz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) radio sources at 1.6 GHz.
          Of them, 15 sources are selected from the Parkes Half Jansky
          (PHJ) sample (Snellen 2002), 4 others are from our previous
          observation list. We aimed at imaging the structure of GPS
          sources, searching for Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) and
          studying the absorption for the convex radio spectra of GPS
          sources.
          Results: We obtained total intensity 1.6 GHz VLBI images of 17
          sources for the first time. Of them, 80% show mini-double-lobe
          radio structure, indicating that they are CSOs or candidates,
          and their host AGNs could be edge-on to us. This result
          suggests that there is a high incidence of mini double-lobe
          sources (or CSOs) in the PHJ sample. The sources J0323+0534,
          J1135-0021, J1352+0232, J2058+0540, J2123-0112 and J2325-0344
          with measured redshift, showing double-lobe structure with
          sizes of <1 kpc, are classified as CSOs. Three sources
          J1057+0012, J1600-0037 and J1753+2750 are considered as
          core-jet sources according to their morphologies and flux
          variability.

          Title: Power Spectra to 1% Accuracy between Dynamical Dark
          Energy Cosmologies
          Authors: Matthew J. Francis, Geraint F. Lewis, Eric V. Linder
          Comments: 9 pages, 14 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          For dynamical dark energy cosmologies we carry out a series of
          N-body gravitational simulations, achieving percent level
          accuracy in the relative mass power spectra at any redshift.
          Such accuracy in the power spectrum is necessary for next
          generation cosmological mass probes. Our matching procedure
          reproduces the CMB distance to last scattering and delivers
          subpercent level power spectra at z=0 and z~3. We discuss the
          physical implications for probing dark energy with surveys of
          large scale structure.

          Title: The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue: The local supermassive
          black hole mass function in early- and late-type galaxies
          Authors: Alister W. Graham, Simon P. Driver, Paul D. Allen,
          Jochen Liske
          Comments: 10 pages of text plus 5 of figs and refs. MNRAS,
          accepted.
          We provide a new estimate of the local supermassive black hole
          mass function using (i) the empirical relation between
          supermassive black hole mass and the Sersic index of the host
          spheroidal stellar system and (ii) the measured (spheroid)
          Sersic indices drawn from 10k galaxies in the Millennium Galaxy
          Catalogue. The observational simplicity of our approach, and
          the direct measurements of the black hole predictor quantity,
          i.e. the Sersic index, for both elliptical galaxies and the
          bulges of disc galaxies makes it straightforward to estimate
          accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type galaxies
          alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass
          function with a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass
          end, a logarithmic slope (1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy
          sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy sample. Considering
          spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and
          integrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find
          that the local mass density of supermassive black holes in
          early-type galaxies rho_{bh, early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5
          h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type galaxies rho_{bh,
          late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The
          uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which
          include uncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of
          Sersic indices, the galaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The
          combined, cosmological, supermassive black hole mass density is
          thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70. That is,
          using a new and independent method, we conclude that
          (0.007+/-0.003) h^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are
          presently locked up in supermassive black holes at the centres
          of galaxies.

          The present status and understanding of the "spectral sequence"
          of blazars is discussed in the perspective of the upcoming

          Title: Diffuse X-ray Emission from the Carina Nebula Observed
          with Suzaku
          Authors: Kenji Hamaguchi, the Suzaku Eta Carinae team, the
          Carinae D-1 team
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, proceeding of the extreme
          universe in the Suzaku era, held in Kyoto, Japan on Dec. 4-8,
          2006
          A number of giant HII regions are associated with soft diffuse
          X-ray emission. Among these, the Carina nebula possesses the
          brightest soft diffuse emission. The required plasma
          temperature and thermal energy can be produced by collisions or
          termination of fast winds from main-sequence or embedded young
          O stars, but the extended emission is often observed from
          regions apart from massive stellar clusters. The origin of the
          X-ray emission is unknown.
          The XIS CCD camera onboard Suzaku has the best spectral
          resolution for extended soft sources so far, and is therefore
          capable of measuring key emission lines in the soft band.
          Suzaku observed the core and the eastern side of the Carina
          nebula (Car-D1) in 2005 Aug and 2006 June, respectively.
          Spectra of the south part of the core and Car-D1 similarly
          showed strong L-shell lines of iron ions and K-shell lines of
          silicon ions, while in the north of the core these lines were
          much weaker. Fitting the spectra with an absorbed thin-thermal
          plasma model showed kT~0.2, 0.6 keV and NH~1-2e21 cm-2 with a
          factor of 2-3 abundance variation in oxygen, magnesium, silicon
          and iron. The plasma might originate from an old supernova, or
          a super shell of multiple supernovae.

          Title: Giant Planet Migration in Viscous Power-Law Discs
          Authors: R. G. Edgar
          Comments: Accepted by ApJ Figures adjusted for 
astro-ph
          Many extra-solar planets discovered over the past decade are
          gas giants in tight orbits around their host stars. Due to the
          difficulties of forming these `hot Jupiters' in situ, they are
          generally assumed to have migrated to their present orbits
          through interactions with their nascent discs. In this paper,
          we present a systematic study of giant planet migration in
          power law discs. We find that the planetary migration rate is
          proportional to the disc surface density. This is inconsistent
          with the assumption that the migration rate is simply the
          viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be
          obtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with
          the viscous torque in the disc. We have verified that this
          result is not affected by adjusting the resolution of the grid,
          the smoothing length used, or the time at which the planet is
          released to migrate.

          Title: Dramatic Variability of X-ray Absorption Lines in the
          Black Hole Candidate Cygnus X-1
          Authors: Chulhoon Chang, Wei Cui
          Comments: 19 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, accepted by ApJ
          We report results from a 30 ks observation of Cygnus X-1 with
          the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on
          board the {\em Chandra X-ray Observatory}. Numerous absorption
          lines were detected in the HETGS spectrum. The lines are
          associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,
          some of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations.
          Surprisingly, however, we discovered dramatic variability of
          the lines over the duration of the present observation. For
          instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \AA\ was about $5
          \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of
          the observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a
          99% upper limit of $0.06 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$
          s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This implies that the line
          weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale of
          hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary
          during the observation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the
          absorption lines are generally attributed to the absorption of
          X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the binary system. Therefore,
          they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical condition
          of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.

          Force
          A space-based gravitational microlensing exoplanet survey will
          provide a statistical census of exoplanets with masses down to
          0.1 Earth-masses and orbital separations ranging from 0.5AU to
          infinity. This includes analogs to all the Solar System's
          planets except for Mercury, as well as most types of planets
          predicted by planet formation theories. Such a survey will
          provide results on the frequency of planets around all types of
          stars except those with short lifetimes. Close-in planets with
          separations < 0.5 AU are invisible to a space-based
          microlensing survey, but these can be found by Kepler. Other
          methods, including ground-based microlensing, cannot approach
          the comprehensive statistics on the mass and semi-major axis
          distribution of extrasolar planets that a space-based
          microlensing survey will provide. The terrestrial planet
          sensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to
          the vicinity of the Einstein radius at 2-3 AU, and space-based
          imaging is needed to identify and determine the mass of the
          planetary host stars for the vast majority of planets
          discovered by microlensing. Thus, a space-based microlensing
          survey is likely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive
          understanding of the nature of planetary systems, which is
          needed to understand planet formation and habitability. The
          proposed Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) mission is an example
          of a space-based microlensing survey that can accomplish these
          objectives with proven technology and a cost that fits
          comfortably under the NASA Discovery Program cost cap.

          Title: USco1606-1935: An Unusually Wide Low-Mass Triple System?
          Authors: Adam L. Kraus, Lynne A. Hillenbrand (Caltech)
          Comments: Accepted to ApJ; 11 pages, 6 figures in emulateapj
          format
          We present photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic
          observations of USco160611.9-193532 AB, a candidate ultrawide
          (~1600 AU), low-mass (M_tot~0.4 M_sun) multiple system in the
          nearby OB association Upper Scorpius. We conclude that both
          components are young, comoving members of the association; we
          also present high-resolution observations which show that the
          primary is itself a close binary system. If the Aab and B
          components are gravitationally bound, the system would fall
          into the small class of young multiple systems which have
          unusually wide separations as compared to field systems of
          similar mass. However, we demonstrate that physical association
          can not be assumed purely on probabilistic grounds for any
          individual candidate system in this separation range. Analysis
          of the association's two-point correlation function shows that
          there is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair
          of low-mass association members will be separated in projection
          by <15", so analysis of the wide binary population in Upper Sco
          will require a systematic search for all wide systems; the
          detection of another such pair would represent an excess at the
          98% confidence level.

          Title: Rotation Measures of Extragalactic Sources Behind the

          Accepted for publication in ApJ on March 26, 2007
          We present new Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for 148
          extragalactic radio sources behind the southern Galactic plane
          (253o < l < 356o, |b| < 1.5o), and use these data in
          combination with published data to probe the large-scale
          structure of the Milky Way's magnetic field. We show that the
          magnitudes of these RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner
          that correlates with the locations of the Galactic spiral arms.
          The observed pattern in RMs requries the presence of at least
          one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic
          quadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and
          Scutum-Crux spiral arms. To quantitatively compare our
          measurements to other recent studies, we consider all available
          extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed,
          and jointly fit these data to simple models in which the
          large-scale field follows the spiral arms. In the best-fitting
          model, the magnetic field in the fourth Galactic quadrant is
          directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm (as
          viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter-
          clockwise in the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent
          analyses of pulsar RMs alone, in which the fourth-quadrant
          field was presumed to be directed counter-clockwise in the
          Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent pulsar RM
          studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs

          reversals are not required to account for observations.

          The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) project is a
          survey for planetary transits of bright stars. It consists of a
          small-aperture, wide-field automated telescope located at Winer
          Observatory near Sonoita, Arizona. The telescope surveys a set
          of 26 x 26 degree fields, together covering about 25% of the
          Northern sky, targeting stars in the range of 8<V<10 mag. This
          paper describes the system hardware and software and discusses
          the quality of the observations. We show that KELT is able to
          achieve the necessary photometric precision to detect planetary
          transits around solar-type main sequence stars.

          Title: Extended solar emission - an analysis of the EGRET data
          Authors: Elena Orlando, Dirk Petry, Andrew Strong

          Symposium, February 5-8, 2007, Stanford University
          The Sun was recently predicted to be an extended source of
          gamma-ray emission, produced by inverse-Compton scattering of
          cosmic-ray electrons with the solar radiation. The emission was
          predicted to contribute to the diffuse extragalactic background
          even at large angular distances from the Sun. While this
          emission is expected to be readily detectable in future by
          GLAST, the situation for available EGRET data is more
          challenging. We present a detailed study of the EGRET database,
          using a time dependent analysis, accounting for the effect of
          the emission from 3C 279, the moon, and other sources, which
          interfere with the solar signal. The technique has been tested
          on the moon signal, with results consistent with previous work.
          We find clear evidence for emission from the Sun and its
          vicinity. The observations are compared with our model for the
          extended emission.

          We present photometric detections of dust emission at 850 and
          450 micron around the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf TWA 7 using
          the SCUBA camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These
          data confirm the presence of a cold dust disk around TWA 7, a
          member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron
          flux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses
          (0.2 Earth masses) assuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a
          temperature of 45 K. This makes the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an
          order of magnitude more massive than the disk reported around
          AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk
          detected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being
          slightly younger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and
          submillimeter data require the disk to be comprised of dust at
          a range of temperatures. A model in which the dust is at a
          single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures
          according to grain size, is as effective at fitting the
          emission spectrum as a model in which the dust is of uniform
          size, but has a range of temperatures according to distance. We
          discuss this disk in the context of known disks in the TW
          Hydrae Association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of
          masses of disks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or
          evolutionary state (gas-rich vs. debris) as a function of
          spectral type.

          Title: Modeling Accretion Disk X-ray Continuum of Black Hole
          Candidates
          Authors: Gabor Pszota, Wei Cui
          Comments: 15 pages, 4 figures, accepted to ApJ
          We critically examine issues associated with determining the
          fundamental properties of the black hole and the surrounding
          accretion disk in an X-ray binary based on modeling the disk
          X-ray continuum of the source. We base our work mainly on two
          XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided
          high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are
          critical for reliably modeling the spectrum of the accretion
          disk. A key issue examined is the determination of the
          so-called "color correction factor", which is often empirically
          introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk
          spectrum from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This
          factor cannot be pre-determined theoretically because it may
          vary with, e.g., mass accretion rate, among a number of
          important factors. We follow up on an earlier suggestion to
          estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the
          disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that
          the spectra can be fitted well and the approach yields
          reasonable values for the color correction factor. For
          comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra with
          other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum
          (which is dominated by the disk emission) cannot be
          satisfactorily fitted by state-of-the-art disk models. We
          discuss the implication of the results.

          We probe turbulence structure from centimetric to metric scales
          by simultaneous imagery at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths
          at the VLT telescope and show that it departs significantly
          from the commonly used Kolmogorov model. The data can be fitted
          by the von Karman model with an outer scale of the order of 30
          m and we see clear signs of the phase structure function
          saturation across the 8-m VLT aperture. The image quality
          improves in the infrared faster than the standard lambda^{-1/5}
          scaling and may be diffraction-limited at 30-m apertures even
          without adaptive optics at wavelengths longer than 8 micron.

          Comments: to appear in A&A
          We present an analysis of new Suzaku data and archival data
          from XMM-Newton of the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03, which
          has a strong soft X-ray excess emission component. The Suzaku
          observation confirms the presence of the soft excess emission,
          but it does not confirm the presence of redshifted OVII lines
          in the cluster. Radial profiles and 2D maps derived from
          XMM-Newton observations show that the soft excess emission has
          a strong peak at the position of the central cD galaxy and the
          maps do not show any significant azimuthal variations. Although
          the soft excess emission can be fitted equally well with both
          thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is
          neither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot
          filaments, nor with models of clumpy warm intracluster gas
          associated with infalling groups. Using the data obtained by
          the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers we do not
          confirm the presence of the warm gas in the cluster centre with
          the expected properties assuming the soft excess is of thermal
          origin. The observed properties of the soft excess emission are
          consistent with the non-thermal interpretation. While the high
          density of relativistic electrons associated with the peak of
          the soft emission in the cluster centre might have been
          provided by an active galactic nucleus in the central cD
          galaxy, the underlying population might have been accelerated
          in diffuse shocks.

          Title: The Transition from the First Stars to the Second Stars
          in the Early Universe
          Authors: Britton D. Smith, Steinn Sigurdsson
          Comments: 13 pages, 3 color figures, 1 table, submitted to ApJL
          We observe a sharp transition from a singular, high-mass mode
          of star formation, to a low-mass dominated mode, in numerical
          simulations, at a metallicity of 10^-3 Zsolar. We incorporate a
          new method for including the radiative cooling from metals into
          adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic simulations. Our results
          illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars, led to a
          transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III
          stars, to the low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran
          hydrodynamic simulations with cosmological initial conditions
          in the standard LambdaCDM model, with metallicities, from zero
          to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The
          simulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of
          a 5 x 10^5 Msolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the
          central 1 Msolar core reveals that the two simulations with the
          lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4 Zsolar, contain one clump
          with 99% of the mass, while the two with metallicities, Z =
          10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share most
          of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two
          low-mass proto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and
          10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >= 10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the
          temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower limit to the minimum
          fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second generation
          stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still
          more massive on average than stars formed in the local
          universe.

          Title: Super Star Cluster Velocity Dispersions and Virial
          Masses in the M82 Nuclear Starburst
          Authors: Nate McCrady, James R. Graham
          Comments: 19 pages, 8 figures, ApJ accepted
          We use high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy from Keck
          Observatory to measure the stellar velocity dispersions of 19
          super star clusters (SSCs) in the nuclear starburst of M82. The
          clusters have ages on the order of 10 Myr, which is many times
          longer than the crossing times implied by their velocity
          dispersions and radii. We therefore apply the Virial Theorem to
          derive the kinematic mass for 15 of the SSCs. The SSCs have
          masses of 2 x 10^5 to 4 x 10^6 solar masses, with a total
          population mass of 1.4 x 10^7 solar masses. Comparison of the
          loci of the young M82 SSCs and old Milky Way globular clusters
          in a plot of radius versus velocity dispersion suggests that
          the SSCs are a population of potential globular clusters. We
          present the mass function for the SSCs, and find a power law
          fit with an index of gamma = -1.91 +/- 0.06. This result is
          nearly identical to the mass function of young SSCs in the
          Antennae galaxies.

          Title: Kinematic Decoupling of Globular Clusters with Extended
          Horizontal-Branch
          Authors: Young-Wook Lee, Hansung B. Gim, Dana I.
          Casetti-Dinescu
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters
          About 25% of the Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) exhibit
          unusually extended color distribution of stars in the
          horizontal-branch (HB) phase. This phenomenon is now best
          understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced second
          generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that
          these peculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show
          that these GCs with extended HB are clearly distinct from other
          normal GCs in kinematics and mass. The GCs with extended HB are
          more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by random
          motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.
          Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs
          in the inner halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse
          that apparently led to the formation of the disk. Normal GCs in
          the outer halo share their kinematic properties with the
          extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion origin.
          Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and
          we anticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed
          investigations of Milky Way formation, including early mergers,
          collapse, and later accretion.

          Title: Scalar potential model progress
          Authors: J. C. Hodge
          Comments: Presented APS Apr07 meeting session s1.00014
          Because observations of galaxies and clusters have been found
          inconsistent with General Relativity (GR), the focus of effort
          in developing a Scalar Potential Model (SPM) has been on the
          examination of galaxies and clusters. The SPM has been found to
          be consistent with cluster cellular structure, the flow of IGM
          from spiral galaxies to elliptical galaxies, intergalactic
          redshift without an expanding universe, discrete redshift,
          rotation curve (RC) data without dark matter, asymmetric RCs,
          galaxy central mass, galaxy central velocity dispersion, and
          the Pioneer Anomaly. In addition, the SPM suggests a model of
          past expansion, past contraction, and current expansion of the
          universe. GR corresponds to the SPM in the limit in which the
          effect of the Sources and Sinks approximate a flat scalar
          potential field such as between clusters and on the solar
          system scale, which is small relative to the distance to a
          Source.

          Comments: 6 pages with 5 figures, accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          Intermediate polars (IPs) are cataclysmic variables which
          contain magnetic white dwarfs with a rotational period shorter
          than the binary orbital period. Evolutionary theory predicts
          that IPs with long orbital periods evolve through the 2-3 hour
          period gap, but it is very uncertain what the properties of the
          resulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of
          long-period IPs are known, very few of these have short orbital
          periods. We present phase-resolved spectroscopy and photometry
          of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the IP with the
          shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which
          contains a white dwarf with a relatively long spin period
          (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). We estimate the white dwarf's magnetic
          moment to be mu(WD) \approx 2 x 10^33 G cm^3, which is not only
          similar to three of the other four confirmed short-period IPs
          but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest
          that long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they
          evolve towards shorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant
          population of long-period IPs, which have white dwarf spin
          periods roughly ten times shorter than their orbital periods,
          will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with
          spin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.

          Aiming at a better understand of the physical and chemical
          processes in the hot molecular core stage of high-mass star
          formation, we observed the prototypical hot core G29.96-0.02 in
          the 862mu band with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at
          sub-arcsecond spatial resolution. The observations resolved the
          hot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the
          finest spatial resolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved
          so far. Four of them located within 7800(AU)^2 comprise a
          proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar densities of
          1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines
          allows us to study the molecular outflow(s), the core
          kinematics, the temperature structure of the region as well as
          chemical effects. The derived hot core temperatures are of the
          order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial
          differentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core
          and is enhanced at the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be
          explained by temperature sensitive desorption from grains and
          following gas phase chemistry. The SiO(8-7) emission outlines
          likely two molecular outflows emanating from this hot core
          region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on
          the hot core and is not dominated by any individual submm peak.
          Potential reasons for that are discussed. A few spectral lines
          that are associated with the main submm continuum source, show
          a velocity gradient perpendicular to the large-scale outflow.
          Since this velocity structure comprises three of the central
          protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the
          data are consistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or
          collapse, we cannot exclude the outflow(s) and/or nearby
          expanding UCHII region as possible alternative causes of this
          velocity pattern.

          The most massive elliptical galaxies show a prominent
          multi-modality in their globular cluster system color
          distributions. Understanding the mechanisms which lead to
          multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a
          complete picture of massive galaxy formation. By assuming that
          globular cluster formation traces the total star formation and
          taking into account the radial variations in the composite
          stellar populations predicted by the Pipino & Matteucci (2004)
          multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute the
          distribution of globular cluster properties as a function of
          galactocentric radius. We compare our results to the
          spectroscopic measurements of globular clusters in nearby
          early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) and show that the
          observed multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive
          ellipticals can be, at least partly, ascribed to the radial
          variation in the mix of stellar populations. Our model predicts
          the presence of a super-metal-rich population of globular
          clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in
          very good agreement with the spectroscopic observations.
          Furthermore, we investigate the impact of other non-linear
          mechanisms that shape the metallicity distribution of globular

          Title: Binaries, microquasars and GLAST
          Authors: Guillaume Dubus
          Comments: 5 pages, invited talk to appear in Proc. of the 1st
          GLAST Symposium, Feb 5-8, 2007, Stanford, AIP, Eds. S. Ritz, P.

          Radio and X-ray observations of the relativistic jets of
          microquasars show evidence for the acceleration of particles to
          very high energies. Signatures of non-thermal processes
          occurring closer in to the compact object can also be found. In
          addition, three binaries are now established emitters of high
          (> 100 MeV) and/or very high (> 100GeV) energy gamma-rays.
          High-energy emission can originate from a microquasar jet
          (accretion-powered) or from a shocked pulsar wind
          (rotation-powered). I discuss the impact GLAST will have in the
          very near future on studies of such binaries. GLAST is expected
          to shed new light on the link between accretion and ejection in
          microquasars and to enable to probe pulsar winds on small
          scales in rotation-powered binaries.

          Title: Swift/XRT observes the fifth outburst of the periodic
          Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient IGR J11215-5952

          IGR J11215-5952 is a hard X-ray transient source discovered in
          April 2005 with INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new
          class of High Mass X-ray Binaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray
          Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data and RXTE
          observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity
          of ~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT
          displaying periodic outbursts, possibly related to the orbital
          period. We performed a Target of Opportunity observation with
          Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source behaviour
          around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9.
          The source field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day)
          starting from 4th February, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and
          then for ~5 ks a day afterwards, during a monitoring campaign
          that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure of ~73 ks.
          This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst
          from a SFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well
          described by an absorbed power law with a photon index of 1 and
          N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak luminosity of ~10^36 erg
          s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of the optical
          counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set
          for an outburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of
          sensitivity and time coverage, and they allowed a study of IGR
          J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost quiescence. We find
          that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously thought
          on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only
          the brightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent
          with a smoothly increasing flux triggered at the periastron
          passage in a wide eccentric orbit with many flares
          superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous
          accretion.

          Title: Mid-Infrared Fine Structure Line Ratios in Active
          Galactic Nuclei Observed with Spitzer IRS: Evidence for
          Extinction by the Torus
          Authors: R. P. Dudik, J. C. Weingartner, S. Satyapal, J.

          Comments: Accepted by ApJ
          We present the first systematic investigation of the [NeV]
          (14um/24um) and [SIII] (18um/33um) infrared line flux ratios,
          traditionally used to estimate the density of the ionized gas,
          in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active galactic nuclei
          (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board
          Spitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines
          detected have observed [NeV] line flux ratios consistent with
          or below the theoretical low density limit, based on
          calculations using currently available collision strengths and
          ignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type
          2 AGNs have lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that
          all of the galaxies with line flux ratios below the low density
          limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that differential infrared
          extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in the
          obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low
          density limit and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of
          the inclination angle of the torus to our line of sight.
          Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of extinction,
          and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the
          line ratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the
          electron densities associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios
          for the objects in our sample. We also find that the [SIII]
          emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended and
          originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the
          emission from low-ionization species is extended, any analysis
          using line flux ratios from such species obtained from slits of
          different sizes is invalid for most nearby galaxies.
