          Title: Neutrino viscosity and drag: impact on the
          magnetorotational instability in proto-neutron stars

          The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is a promising
          mechanism to amplify the magnetic field in fast rotating
          proto-neutron stars (PNS). The diffusion of neutrinos trapped in
          the proto-neutron star induces a transport of momentum, which
          can be modeled as a viscosity on length scales longer than the
          neutrino mean free path. This neutrino-viscosity can slow down
          the growth of MRI modes to such an extent that a minimum initial
          magnetic field strength of $\gtrsim 10^{12}\, {\rm G}$ is needed
          for the MRI to grow on a sufficiently short timescale to
          potentially affect the explosion. It is uncertain whether the
          magnetic field of fast rotating progenitor cores is strong
          enough to yield such an initial magnetic field in proto-neutron
          stars. At MRI wavelengths shorter than the neutrino mean free
          path, on the other hand, neutrino radiation does not act as a
          viscosity but rather induces a drag on the velocity with a
          damping rate independent of the wavelength. We perform a linear
          analysis of the MRI in this regime, and apply our analytical
          results to the proto-neutron star structure from a
          one-dimensional numerical simulation. We show that in the outer
          layers of the PNS, the MRI can grow from weak magnetic fields at
          wavelengths shorter than the neutrino mean free path, while
          deeper in the PNS MRI growth takes place in the viscous regime
          and requires a minimum magnetic field strength.

          Title: Polarimetric and spectroscopic optical observations of
          the ultra-compact X-ray binary 4U 0614+091

          Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)

          Aims: We present a polarimetric and spectroscopic study of the
          persistent ultra compact X-ray binary 4U 0614+091 aimed at
          searching for the emission of a relativistic particle jet and at
          unveiling the orbital period of the system. Methods: We obtained
          r-band polarimetric observations with the Telescopio Nazionale
          Galileo (TNG) equipped with the PAOLO polarimeter and with the
          Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC
          instrument, covering ~ 2 hours and ~ 0.5 hours observations,
          respectively. We carried out low resolution spectroscopy of the
          system using the ESO Very Large Telescope equipped with FORS1
          for ~ 1.5 hours (16 spectra covering the range 430-800 nm).
          Results: The polarimetric analysis performed starting from the
          TNG dataset revealed a polarisation degree in the r-band of 3 %
          +/- 1 %. From the NOT dataset, due to the lower S/N ratio, we
          could obtain only a 3 sigma upper limit of 3.4 %. From the
          joining of a spectroscopic and photometric analysis, through the
          study of the equivalent width variations of the CII 724 nm line
          and the r-band light curve, we could find a hint of a ~ 45 min
          periodicity. Conclusions: A polarisation degree P of ~ 3 % in
          the r-band is consistent with the emission of a relativistic
          particle jet, which is supposed to emit intrinsically linearly
          polarised synchrotron radiation. Since no variations of P with
          time have been detected, and the accretion disc of the system
          does not contain ionised hydrogen, scattering by free electrons
          in the accretion disc has been rejected. The period of ~ 45 min
          obtained through the analysis of the system light curve and of
          the equivalent width variations of the selected spectral line is
          probably linked to the presence of a hot spot or a superhump in
          the accretion disc, and lead to an orbital period > 1 hour for
          the binary system.

          Title: A Density Spike on Astrophysical Scales from an

          Hybrid inflation models are especially interesting as they lead
          to a spike in the density power spectrum on small scales,
          compared to the CMB. Here we study hybrid inflation with
          $\mathcal{N}$ waterfall fields sharing a global
          $SO(\mathcal{N})$ symmetry. The inclusion of many waterfall
          fields has the obvious advantage of avoiding topologically
          stable defects for $\mathcal{N}>3$. We find that it also has
          another advantage: it is easier to engineer models that can
          simultaneously (i) be compatible with constraints on the
          primordial spectral index, which tends to otherwise disfavor
          hybrid models, and (ii) produce a spike on astrophysically large
          length scales. The latter may have significant consequences,
          possibly seeding the formation of astrophysically large black
          holes. We calculate correlation functions of the time-delay, a
          measure of density perturbations, produced by the waterfall
          fields, as a convergent power series in both $1/\mathcal{N}$ and
          the field's correlation function $\Delta(x)$. We show that for
          large $\mathcal{N}$, the two-point function is $<\delta t({\bf
          x})\,\delta t({\bf 0})>\propto\Delta^2(|{\bf x}|)/\mathcal{N}$
          and the three-point function is $<\delta t({\bf x})\,\delta
          t({\bf y})\,\delta t({\bf 0})>\propto\Delta(|{\bf x}-{\bf
          y}|)\Delta(|{\bf x}|)\Delta(|{\bf y}|)/\mathcal{N}^2$. In
          accordance with the central limit theorem, the density
          perturbations on the scale of the spike are Gaussian for large
          $\mathcal{N}$ and non-Gaussian for small $\mathcal{N}$.

          Title: The Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey. XVII. SPIRE

          We present three independent catalogs of point-sources extracted
          from SPIRE images at 250, 350, and 500 micron as a part of the
          Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS). The source positions are
          determined by estimating the likelihood to be a real source for
          each peak on the maps and the flux densities are estimated using
          the sourceExtractorTimeline, a timeline-based point source
          fitter. Afterwards, each source is subtracted from the maps,
          removing a Gaussian function in every position with the full
          width half maximum equal to that estimated in
          sourceExtractorTimeline. This procedure improves the robustness
          of our algorithm in terms of source identification. The HeViCS
          catalogs contain about 52000, 42200, and 18700 sources selected
          at 250, 350, and 500 micron above 3sigma and are ~ 75%, 62%, and
          50% complete at flux densities of 20 mJy at 250, 350, 500
          micron, respectively. We then measured source number counts at
          250, 350, and 500 micron and we also cross-correlated the
          catalogs with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to investigate the
          redshift distribution of the nearby sources. From this
          cross-correlation, we select ~2000 sources with reliable fluxes
          and a high signal-to-noise ratio, finding an average redshift
          z~0.3+/-0.22. The number counts at 250, 350, and 500 micron show
          an increase in the slope below 200 mJy, indicating a strong
          evolution in number of density for galaxies at these fluxes. In
          general, models tend to overpredict the counts at brighter flux
          densities, underlying the importance of studying the
          Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectral energy distribution to
          refine the theoretical recipes of the models. Our iterative
          method for source identification allowed the detection of a
          family of 500 micron sources that are not foreground objects
          belonging to Virgo and not found in other catalogs.

          We investigate the cosmic evolution of the internal structure of
          massive early-type galaxies over half of the age of the
          Universe. We perform a joint lensing and stellar dynamics
          analysis of a sample of 81 strong lenses from the SL2S and SLACS
          surveys and combine the results with a hierarchical Bayesian
          inference method to measure the distribution of dark matter mass
          and stellar IMF across the population of massive early-type
          galaxies. Lensing selection effects are taken into account. We
          find that the dark matter mass projected within the inner 5 kpc
          increases for increasing redshift, decreases for increasing
          stellar mass density, but is roughly constant along the
          evolutionary tracks of early-type galaxies. The average dark
          matter slope is consistent with that of an NFW profile, but is
          not well constrained. The stellar IMF normalization is close to
          a Salpeter IMF at $\log{M_*} = 11.5$ and scales strongly with
          increasing stellar mass. No dependence of the IMF on redshift or
          stellar mass density is detected. The anti-correlation between
          dark matter mass and stellar mass density supports the idea of
          mergers being more frequent in more massive dark matter halos.

          We report new observations of Galactic Center source G2 from the
          W. M. Keck Observatory. G2 is a dusty red object associated with
          gas that shows tidal interactions as it nears closest approach
          (periapse) with the Galaxy's central black hole. Our
          observations, conducted as G2 passed through periapse, were
          designed to test the proposal that G2 is a 3 earth mass gas
          cloud. Such a cloud should be tidally disrupted during periapse
          passage. The data were obtained using the Keck II laser guide
          star adaptive optics system (LGSAO) and the facility
          near-infrared camera (NIRC2) through the K' [2.1 $\mu$m] and L'
          [3.8 $\mu$m] broadband filters. Several key results emerge from
          these observations: 1) G2 has survived its closest approach to
          the central black hole as a compact, unresolved source at L'; 2)
          G2's L' brightness measurements are consistent with those over
          the last decade; 3) G2's motion continues to be consistent with
          a Keplerian model. These results rule out G2 as a pure gas cloud
          and imply that G2 has a central star. This star has a luminosity
          of 30 $L_{\odot} $ and is surrounded by a large (2 AU) optically
          thick dust shell. We suggest that G2 is a binary star merger
          product and will ultimately appear similar to the B-stars that
          are tightly clustered around the black hole (the so-called
          S-star cluster). In memoriam of Gerry Neugebauer (1932-2014).

          Title: Tidal stripping stellar substructures around four

          We investigate the spatial density configuration of stars around
          four metal-poor globular clusters (NGC 6266, NGC 6626, NGC 6642
          and NGC 6723) in the Galactic bulge region using wide-field deep
          J, H, and K imaging data obtained with the WFCAM near-infrared
          array on United Kingdom Infrared Telescope. Statistical weighted
          filtering algorithm for the stars on the color-magnitude diagram
          is applied in order to sort cluster member candidates from the
          field star contamination. In two-dimensional isodensity contour
          maps of the clusters, we find that all of the four globular
          clusters exhibit strong evidence of tidally stripping stellar
          features beyond tidal radius, in the form of tidal tail or small
          density lobes or chunk. The orientations of the extended stellar
          substructures are likely to be associated with the effect of the
          dynamic interaction with the Galaxy and the cluster space
          motion. The observed radial density profiles of the four
          globular clusters also describe the extended substructures; they
          depart from theoretical King and Wilson models and have an
          overdensity feature with a break in a slope of profile at the
          outer region of clusters. The observed results could imply that
          four globular clusters in the Galactic bulge region have
          experienced strong environmental effect such as tidal force or
          bulge or disk shock of the Galaxy in the dynamical evolution of
          the globular clusters. These observational results provide us
          further constraints to understand the evolution of clusters in
          the Galactic bulge region as well as the formation of the
          Galaxy.

          We present a spectral decomposition technique that separates the
          contribution of different kinematic components in galaxies from
          the observed spectrum. This allows to study the kinematics and
          properties of the stellar populations of the individual
          components (e.g., bulge, disk, counter-rotating cores,
          orthogonal structures). Here, we discuss the results of this
          technique for galaxies that host counter-rotating stellar disks
          of comparable size. In all the studied cases, the
          counter-rotating stellar disk is the less massive, the youngest
          and has different chemical content (metallicity and
          alpha-elements abundance ratio) than the main galaxy disk.
          Further applications of the spectral decomposition technique are
          also discussed.

          Title: The origins of light and heavy r-process elements
          identified by chemical tagging of metal-poor stars

          Growing interests in neutron star (NS) mergers as the origin of
          r-process elements have sprouted since the discovery of evidence
          for the ejection of these elements from a short-duration
          gamma-ray burst. The hypothesis of a NS merger origin is
          reinforced by a theoretical update of nucleosynthesis in NS
          mergers successful in yielding r-process nuclides with A>130. On
          the other hand, whether the origin of light r-process elements
          are associated with nucleosynthesis in NS merger events remains
          unclear. We find a signature of nucleosynthesis in NS mergers
          from peculiar chemical abundances of stars belonging to the
          Galactic globular cluster M15. This finding combined with the
          recent nucleosynthesis results implies a potential diversity of
          nucleosynthesis in NS mergers. Based on these considerations, we
          are successful in the interpretation of an observed correlation
          between [light r-process/Eu] and [Eu/Fe] among Galactic halo
          stars and accordingly narrow down the role of supernova
          nucleosynthesis in the r-process production site. We conclude
          that the tight correlation by a large fraction of halo stars is
          attributable to the fact that core-collapse supernovae produce
          light r-process elements while heavy r-process elements such as
          Eu and Ba are produced by NS mergers. On the other hand, stars
          in the outlier, composed of r-enhanced stars ([Eu/Fe]>+1) such
          as CS22892-052, were exclusively enriched by matter ejected by a
          subclass of NS mergers that is inclined to be massive and
          consist of both light and heavy r-process nuclides.

          Title: Origin of Magnetic Field in the Intracluster Medium:
          Primordial or Astrophysical?

          The origin of magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies is still
          an unsolved problem, which is largely due to our poor
          understanding of initial seed magnetic fields. If the seed
          magnetic fields have primordial origins, it is likely that
          large-scale pervasive magnetic fields were present before the
          formation of the large-scale structure. On the other hand, if
          they were ejected from astrophysical bodies, they were highly
          localized in space at the time of injection. In this paper,
          using turbulence dynamo models for high magnetic Prandtl number
          fluids, we find constraints on the seed magnetic fields. The
          hydrodynamic Reynolds number based on the Spitzer viscosity in
          the intracluster medium (ICM) is believed to be less than
          $O(10^2)$, while the magnetic Reynolds number can be much larger
          than that. In this case, if the seed magnetic fields have
          primordial origins, they should be stronger than $O(10^{-11})$G,
          which is very close to the upper limit of $O(10^{-9})$G set by
          the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. On the other
          hand, if the seed magnetic fields were ejected from
          astrophysical bodies, any seed magnetic fields stronger than
          $O(10^{-9})$G can safely magnetize the intracluster medium.
          Therefore, it is less likely that primordial magnetic fields are
          the direct origin of present-day magnetic fields in the ICM.

          Various programs aimed at exploring the still largely unknown
          low surface brightness Universe with deep imaging optical
          surveys have recently started. They open a new window for
          studies of galaxy evolution, pushing the technique of galactic
          archeology outside the Local Group (LG). The method, based on
          the detection and analysis of the diffuse light emitted by
          collisional debris or extended stellar halos (rather than on
          stellar counts as done for LG systems), faces however a number
          of technical difficulties, like the contamination of the images
          by reflection halos and Galactic cirrus. I review here the
          on-going efforts to address them and highlight the preliminary
          promising results obtained with a systematic survey with MegaCam
          on the CFHT of nearby massive early-type galaxies done as part
          of the Atlas3D, NGVS and MATLAS collaborations.

          Title: Reconstructing the initial mass function of disc-bulge
          Galactic globular clusters from N-body simulations

          We propose an evolutionary model to describe the dynamical
          evolution of star cluster systems in tidal fields, in which we
          calibrated the parametric equations defining the model by
          running direct N-body simulations of star clusters with a wide
          range of initial masses and set of orbital parameters, living
          within the external tidal field generated by a disc-like galaxy.
          We derived a new method to solve numerically the evolutionary
          equations, allowing us to infer constraints on the mass of a
          star cluster from its age, present-day mass, orbital parameters
          and external gravitational potential. The result has been
          applied to the metal-rich subsample of Galactic globular
          clusters, being a good representation of a disc-bulge
          population. We reconstructed the initial mass function of these
          objects from the present-day mass function, finding that a
          lognormal distribution is well preserved during the evolution of
          the globular cluster system. The evolution of a power-law
          initial mass function has been evaluated, confirming that it
          transforms into a lognormal distribution of the cluster masses
          within an Hubble time. Our results are consistent with a
          formation scenario in which metal-rich Galactic globular
          clusters formed from giant molecular clouds in high-pressure
          regions during the early phases of the evolution of the Galactic
          disc and bulge.

          We present the results of deep Chandra, XMM-Newton and Suzaku
          observations of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 85, which is
          currently undergoing at least two mergers, and in addition shows
          evidence for gas sloshing which extends out to r~600 kpc. One of
          the two infalling subclusters, to the south of the main cluster
          center, has a dense, X-ray bright cool core and a tail extending
          to the southeast. The northern edge of this tail is strikingly
          smooth and sharp (narrower than the Coulomb mean free path of
          the ambient gas) over a length of 200 kpc, while toward the
          southwest the boundary of the tail is blurred and bent,
          indicating a difference in the plasma transport properties
          between these two edges. The thermodynamic structure of the tail
          strongly supports an overall northwestward motion, with a
          sloshing-induced tangential ambient gas bulk flow bending the
          tail eastward. The brightest galaxy of this subcluster is at the
          leading edge of the dense core, and is trailed by the tail of
          stripped gas, suggesting that the cool core of the subcluster
          has been almost completely destroyed by the time it reached its
          current radius of r~500 kpc. The tail of the subcluster is
          visibly clumpy, and we see a clumpy surface-brightness excess
          extending toward the southeast out to at least r_500 of the main
          cluster. Thus, it appears that gas stripping from infalling
          subclusters can efficiently seed clumping in the intracluster
          medium. The second merging subcluster appears to be a diffuse
          non-cool core system. Its merger is supersonic with a Mach
          number of ~1.4.

          Title: Early Evolution of an Energetic Coronal Mass Ejection and
          Its Relation to EUV Waves

          Authors: Rui Liu, Yuming Wang, Chenglong Shen

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ

          Subjects: Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

          We study a coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with an
          X-class flare, whose initiation is clearly observed in low
          corona with high-cadence, high-resolution EUV images, providing
          us a rare opportunity to witness the early evolution of an
          energetic CME in detail. The eruption starts with a slow
          expansion of cool overlying loops (~1 MK) following a jet-like
          event in the periphery of the active region. Underneath the
          expanding loop system a reverse S-shaped dimming is seen
          immediately above the brightening active region in hot EUV
          passbands. The dimming is associated with a rising diffuse arch
          (~6 MK), which we interpret as a preexistent, high-lying flux
          rope. This is followed by the arising of a double hot channel
          (~10 MK) from the core of the active region. The higher
          structures rise earlier and faster than lower ones, with the
          leading front undergoing extremely rapid acceleration up to 35
          km s$^2$. This suggests that the torus instability is the major
          eruption mechanism and that it is the high-lying flux rope
          rather than the hot channels that drives the eruption. The
          compression of coronal plasmas skirting and overlying the
          expanding loop system, whose aspect ratio $h/r$ increases with
          time as a result of the rapid upward acceleration, plays a
          significant role in driving an outward-propagating global EUV
          wave and a sunward-propagating local EUV wave, respectively.

          Using two volume-limited Main galaxy samples of the Sloan
          Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 (SDSS DR10), I investigate
          the environmental dependence of galaxy age, and get the same
          conclusions in two volume-limited Main galaxy samples: old
          galaxies exist preferentially in the densest regions of the
          universe, while young galaxies are located preferentially in low
          density regions. Such an age-density relation is likely a
          combination of a strong age-stellar mass relation and the
          stellar mass-density relation.

          Title: Full Waveform Inversion of Solar Interior Flows

          and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

          The inference of flows of material in the interior of the Sun is
          a subject of major interest in helioseismology. Here we apply
          techniques of Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) to synthetic data to
          test flow inversions. In this idealized setup, we do not model
          seismic realization noise, training the focus entirely on the
          problem of whether a chosen supergranulation flow model can be
          seismically recovered. We define the misfit functional as a sum
          of L_2 norm deviations in travel times between prediction and
          observation, as measured using short-distance f and p_1 filtered
          and large-distance unfiltered $p$ modes. FWI allows for the
          introduction of measurements of choice and iteratively improving
          the background model, while monitoring the evolution of the
          misfit in all desired categories. Although the misfit is seen to
          uniformly reduce in all categories, convergence to the true
          model is very slow, possibly because it is trapped in a local
          minimum. The primary source of error is inaccurate depth
          localization, which, owing to density stratification, leads to
          wrong ratios of horizontal and vertical flow velocities (`cross
          talk'). In the present formulation, the lack of sufficient
          temporal frequency and spatial resolution makes it difficult to
          accurately localise flow profiles at depth. We therefore suggest
          that the most efficient way to discover the global minimum is to
          perform a probabilistic forward search, involving calculating
          the misfit associated with a broad range of models (generated,
          for instance, by a Monte-Carlo algorithm) and locating the
          deepest minimum. Such techniques possess the added advantage of
          being able to quantify model uncertainty as well as realization
          noise (data uncertainty).

          Subjects: Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

          To better understand the structures of active-region filaments
          and the eruption process, we study an active-region filament
          eruption in active region NOAA 11082 in detail on June 22, 2010.
          Before the filament eruption, the opposite unidirectional
          material flows appeared in succession along the spine of the
          filament. The rising of the filament triggered two B-class
          flares at the upper part of the filament. As the bright material
          was injected into the filament from the sites of the flares, the
          filament exhibited a rapid uplift accompanying the
          counterclockwise rotation of the filament body. From the
          expansion of the filament, we can see that the filament is
          consisted of twisted magnetic field lines. The total twist of
          the filament is at least 5$\pi$ obtained by using time slice
          method. According to the morphology change during the filament
          eruption, it is found that the active-region filament was a
          twisted flux rope and its unwinding motion was like a solar
          tornado. We also find that there was a continuous magnetic
          helicity injection before and during the filament eruption. It
          is confirmed that magnetic helicity can be transferred from the
          photosphere to the filament. Using the extrapolated potential
          fields, the average decay index of the background magnetic
          fields over the filament is 0.91. Consequently, these findings
          imply that the mechanism of solar filament eruption could be due
          to the kink instability and magnetic helicity accumulation.

          Title: Turbulence-Induced Relative Velocity of Dust particles
          IV: the Collision Kernel

          Authors: Liubin Pan, Paolo Padoan

          Comments: 20 pages, 9 figures, accepted to ApJ

          Subjects: Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

          Motivated by its importance for modeling dust particle growth in
          protoplanetary disks, we study turbulence-induced collision
          statistics of inertial particles as a function of the particle
          friction time, tau_p. We show that turbulent clustering
          significantly enhances the collision rate for particles of
          similar sizes with tau_p corresponding to the inertial range of
          the flow. If the friction time, tau_p,h, of the larger particle
          is in the inertial range, the collision kernel per unit cross
          section increases with increasing friction time, tau_p,l, of the
          smaller particle, and reaches the maximum at tau_p,l = tau_p,h,
          where the clustering effect peaks. This feature is not captured
          by the commonly-used kernel formula, which neglects the effect
          of clustering. We argue that turbulent clustering helps
          alleviate the bouncing barrier problem for planetesimal
          formation. We also investigate the collision velocity statistics
          using a collision-rate weighting factor to account for higher
          collision frequency for particle pairs with larger relative
          velocity. For tau_p,h in the inertial range, the rms relative
          velocity with collision-rate weighting is found to be invariant
          with tau_p,l and scales with tau_p,h roughly as ~ tau_p,h^(1/2).
          The weighting factor favors collisions with larger relative
          velocity, and including it leads to more destructive and less
          sticking collisions. We compare two collision kernel
          formulations based on spherical and cylindrical geometries. The
          two formulations give consistent results for the collision rate
          and the collision-rate weighted statistics, except that the
          spherical formulation predicts more head-on collisions than the
          cylindrical formulation.

          The thermal emission of comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) was
          observed on March 31, 2013, at a heliocentric distance of 6.48
          au using the PACS photometer camera of the Herschel Space
          Observatory. The comet was clearly active, showing a coma that
          could be traced to a distance of 10", i.e. 50000 km. Analysis of
          the radial intensity profiles of the coma provided dust mass and
          dust production rate; the derived grain size distribution
          characteristics indicate an overabundance of large grains in the
          thermal emission. We estimate that activity started about 6
          months before these observations, at a heliocentric distance of
          8 au.

          A recent XMM-Newton observation (Zhekov 2014) has revealed
          diffuse X-ray emission inside the nebula NGC 2359 around the
          Wolf-Rayet star WR 7. Taking advantage of an improved
          point-source rejection and background subtraction, and a
          detailed comparison of optical and X-ray morphology, we have
          reanalyzed these X-ray observations. Our analysis reveals
          diffuse X-ray emission from a blowout and the presence of
          emission at energies from 1.0 to 2.0 keV. The X-ray emission
          from NGC 2359 can be described by an optically-thin plasma
          emission model, but contrary to previous analysis, we find that
          the chemical abundances of this plasma are similar to those of
          the optical nebula, with no magnesium enhancement, and that two
          components at temperatures T_1=2x10^6 K and T_2=5.7x10^7 K are
          required. The estimated X-ray luminosity in the 0.3 - 2.0 keV
          energy range is L_X=2x10^33 erg s^-1. The averaged rms electron
          density of the X-ray-emitting gas (n_e \lesssim 0.6 cm^-3)
          reinforces the idea of mixing of material from the outer nebula
          into the hot bubble.

          When a core-collapse supernova (SN) happens in our galaxy,
          various detectors will detect gravitational waves (GWs) and
          neutrinos. Current numerical simula- tions have successfully
          introduced multi-dimensional effects to produce exploding SN
          models, but thus far the explosion mechanism is not well
          understood. In this paper, we focus on an investigation of
          progenitor core rotation via comparison of the start time of GW
          emission and that of the neutronization burst. The GW and
          neutrino detectors are assumed to be the KAGRA detector and
          EGADS detector, respectively. Our detection simulation studies
          show that for a nearby supernova(<0.2 kpc) we can confirm the
          lack of core rotation close to 100% of the time, and the
          presence of core rotation about 90% of the time.

          scale, a bipolar structure is seen at arcsecond-scale and
          multi-concentric shells are detected beyond 1". We present the
          first ALMA Cycle 0 band 9 data around 650 GHz. The
          full-resolution data have a spatial resolution of 0".42x0".24,
          allowing us to study the morpho-kinematical structure within
          ~6". Results: We have detected 25 molecular lines. The emission
          of all but one line is spatially resolved. The dust and
          molecular lines are centered around the continuum peak position.
          The dust emission has an asymmetric distribution with a central
          peak flux density of ~2 Jy. The molecular emission lines trace
          different regions in the wind acceleration region and suggest
          that the wind velocity increases rapidly from about 5 R* almost
          reaching the terminal velocity at ~11 R*. The channel maps for
          the brighter lines show a complex structure; specifically for
          the 13CO J=6-5 line different arcs are detected within the first
          few arcseconds. The curved structure present in the PV map of
          the 13CO J=6-5 line can be explained by a spiral structure in
          the inner wind, probably induced by a binary companion. From
          modeling the ALMA data, we deduce that the potential orbital
          axis for the binary system lies at a position angle of ~10-20
          deg to the North-East and that the spiral structure is seen
          almost edge-on. We infer an orbital period of 55 yr and a binary
          separation of 25 au (or ~8.2 R*). We tentatively estimate that
          the companion is an unevolved low-mass main-sequence star. The
          ALMA data hence provide us for the first time with the crucial
          kinematical link between the dust clumps seen at milli-arcsecond
          scale and the almost concentric arcs seen at arcsecond scale.

          The determination of the physical conditions in molecular clouds
          is a key step towards our understanding of their formation and
          evolution of associated star formation. We investigate the
          density, temperature, and column density of both dust and gas in
          the photodissociation regions (PDRs) located at the interface
          between the atomic and cold molecular gas of the NGC 7023
          reflection nebula. We study how young stars affect the gas and
          dust in their environment. Our approach combining both dust and
          gas delivers strong constraints on the physical conditions of
          the PDRs. We find dense and warm molecular gas of high column
          density in the PDRs.

          Title: Protoplanetary disk masses from CO isotopologues line
          emission

          Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A, 16 pages, 10 figures,

          Subjects: Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

          One of the methods for deriving disk masses relies on direct
          observations of the gas, whose bulk mass is in the outer cold
          ($T\lesssim30$K) regions. This zone can be well traced by
          rotational lines of less abundant CO isotopologues, that probe
          the gas down to the midplane. The total CO gas mass is then
          obtained with the isotopologue ratios taken to be constant at
          the elemental isotope values found in the local ISM. This
          approach is however imprecise, because isotope selective
          processes are ignored. The aim of this work is an isotopologue
          selective treatment of CO isotopologues, in order to obtain a
          more accurate determination of disk masses. The
          isotope-selective photodissociation, the main process
          controlling the abundances of CO isotopologues in the
          CO-emissive layer, is properly treated for the first time in a
          full disk model (DALI, Bruderer et al. 2012; Bruderer 2013). The
          chemistry, thermal balance, line and continuum radiative
          transfer are all considered together with a chemical network
          that treats $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, C$^{17}$O, isotopes of all
          included atoms, and molecules, as independent species. Isotope
          selective processes lead to regions in the disk where the
          isotopologues abundance ratios are considerably different from
          the elemental ratio. The results of this work show that
          considering CO isotopologue ratios as constants can lead to an
          underestimate of disk masses by up to almost two orders of
          magnitude if grains have grown to larger sizes. This may explain
          observed discrepancies in mass determinations from different
          tracers. The dependence of the various isotopologues emission on
          stellar and disk parameters is investigated. Including CO
          isotope selective processes is crucial to determine the gas mass
          of the disk accurately (through ALMA observations) and thus to
          provide the amount of gas which may eventually form planets or
          change the dynamics of forming planetary systems.

          Title: Fast gain calibration in radio astronomy using
          alternating direction implicit methods: Analysis and
          applications

          Authors: Stefano Salvini, Stefan J. Wijnholds

          Comments: accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics

          (astro-ph.IM)

          Context. Modern radio astronomical arrays have (or will have)
          more than one order of magnitude more receivers than classical
          synthesis arrays, such as the VLA and the WSRT. This makes gain
          calibration a computationally demanding task. Several
          alternating direction implicit (ADI) approaches have therefore
          been proposed that reduce numerical complexity for this task
          from $\mathcal{O}(P^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(P^2)$, where $P$ is the
          number of receive paths to be calibrated.
          Aims. We present an ADI method, show that it converges to the
          optimal solution, and assess its numerical, computational and
          statistical performance. We also discuss its suitability for
          application in self-calibration and report on its successful
          application in LOFAR standard pipelines.
          Methods. Convergence is proved by rigorous mathematical analysis
          using a contraction mapping. Its numerical, algorithmic, and
          statistical performance, as well as its suitability for
          application in self-calibration, are assessed using simulations.
          Results. Our simulations confirm the $\mathcal{O}(P^2)$
          complexity and excellent numerical and computational properties
          of the algorithm. They also confirm that the algorithm performs
          at or close to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB, lower bound on the
          variance of estimated parameters). We find that the algorithm is
          suitable for application in self-calibration and discuss how it
          can be included. We demonstrate an order-of-magnitude speed
          improvement in calibration over traditional methods on actual
          LOFAR data.
          Conclusions. In this paper, we demonstrate that ADI methods are
          a valid and computationally more efficient alternative to
          traditional gain calibration method and we report on its
          successful application in a number of actual data reduction
          pipelines.

          Title: C$_{60}$ in Photodissociation Regions

          Authors: Pablo Castellanos, Olivier Berné, Yaron Sheffer, Mark
          G. Wolfire, Alexander G.G.M. Tielens

          Journal-ref: ApJ, 794, 83 (2014)

          Subjects: Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

          Recent studies have confirmed the presence of
          buckminsterfullerene (C$_{60}$) in different interstellar and
          circumstellar environments. However, several aspects regarding
          C$_{60}$ in space are not well understood yet, such as the
          formation and excitation processes, and the connection between
          C$_{60}$ and other carbonaceous compounds in the interstellar
          medium, in particular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
          In this paper we study several photodissociation regions (PDRs)
          where C$_{60}$ and PAHs are detected and the local physical
          conditions are reasonably well constrained, to provide
          observational insights into these questions. C$_{60}$ is found
          to emit in PDRs where the dust is cool ($T_d = 20-40$ K) and
          even in PDRs with cool stars. These results exclude the
          possibility for C$_{60}$ to be locked in grains at thermal
          equilibrium in these environments. We observe that PAH and
          C$_{60}$ emission are spatially uncorrelated and that C$_{60}$
          is present in PDRs where the physical conditions (in terms of
          radiation field and hydrogen density) allow for full
          dehydrogenation of PAHs, with the exception of Ced 201. We also
          find trends indicative of an increase in C$_{60}$ abundance
          within individual PDRs, but these trends are not universal.
          These results support models where the dehydrogenation of
          carbonaceous species is the first step towards C$_{60}$
          formation. However, this is not the only parameter involved and
          C$_{60}$ formation is likely affected by shocks and PDR age.

          Title: The effect of Lyman $α$ radiation on mini-Neptune
          atmospheres around M stars: application to GJ 436b

          Authors: Yamila Miguel, Lisa Kaltenegger, Jeffrey L. Linsky,

          Mini-Neptunes orbiting M stars are a growing population of known
          exoplanets. Some of them are located very close to their host
          star, receiving large amounts of UV radiation. Many M stars emit
          strong chromospheric emission in the H I Lyman $\alpha$ line
          (Ly$\alpha$) at 1215.67 \AA, the brightest far-UV emission line.
          We show that the effect of incoming Ly$\alpha$ flux can
          significantly change the photochemistry of mini-Neptunes'
          atmospheres. We use GJ 436b as an example, considering different
          metallicities for its atmospheric composition. For solar
          composition, H$_2$O-mixing ratios show the largest change
          because of Ly$\alpha$ radiation. H$_2$O absorbs most of this
          radiation, thereby shielding CH$_4$, whose dissociation is
          driven mainly by radiation at other far-UV wavelengths
          ($\sim1300$ \AA). H$_2$O photolysis also affects other species
          in the atmosphere, including H, H$_2$, CO$_2$, CO, OH and O. For
          an atmosphere with high metallicity, H$_2$O- and CO$_2$-mixing
          ratios show the biggest change, thereby shielding CH$_4$. Direct
          measurements of the UV flux of the host stars are important for
          understanding the photochemistry in exoplanets' atmospheres.
          This is crucial, especially in the region between 1 and
          10$^{-6}$ bars, which is the part of the atmosphere that
          generates most of the observable spectral features.

          We report the electron density in a plasma tail of Comet ISON
          (C/2012 S1) derived from interplanetary scintillation (IPS)
          observations during November 1--28, 2013. Comet ISON showed a
          well-developed plasma tail (longer than 2.98 x 10^{7} km) before
          its perihelion passage on November 28. We identified a radio
          source whose line-of-sight approached the ISON's plasma tail in
          the above period and obtained its IPS data using the Solar Wind
          Imaging Facility at 327 MHz. We used the Heliospheric Imager
          onboard the Solar-Terrestrial Relation Observatory to
          distinguish between the cometary tail and solar eruption origins
          of their enhanced scintillation. From our examinations, we
          confirmed three IPS enhancements of a radio source 1148-00 on
          November 13, 16, and 17, which could be attributed to the
          disturbance in the cometary tail. They showed no appreciable
          change of fluctuation power spectra during the occultation by
          the plasma tail of Comet ISON. We estimated the electron density
          in the ISON's plasma tail and found 84 cm^{-3} around the tail
          axis at a distance of 3.74 x 10^{7} km from the cometary nucleus
          and an unexpected variation of the electron density in the
          vicinity of the tail boundary.

          We present an analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data of
          the Carina dSph galaxy, testing a new approach similar to that
          used to disentangle multiple populations in Galactic globular
          clusters (GCs). We show that a proper colour combination is able
          to separate a significant fraction of the red giant branch (RGB)
          of the two main Carina populations (the old one, \sim 12 Gyr,
          and the intermediate-age one, 4-8 Gyr). In particular, the
          c_UBI=(U-B)-(B-I) pseudo-colour allows us to follow the RGB of
          both populations along a relevant portion of the RGB. We find
          that the oldest stars have more negative c_UBI pseudo-colour
          than intermediate-age ones. We correlate the pseudo-colour of
          RGB stars with their chemical properties, finding a significant
          trend between the iron content and the c_UBI. Stars belonging to
          the old population are systematically more metal poor
          ([Fe/H]=-2.32\pm0.08 dex) than the intermediate-age ones
          ([Fe/H]=-1.82\pm0.03 dex). This gives solid evidence on the
          chemical evolution history of this galaxy, and we have a new
          diagnostic that can allow us to break the age-metallicity
          degeneracy of H-burning advanced evolutionary phases. We
          compared the distribution of stars in the c_UBI plane with
          theoretical isochrones, finding that no satisfactory agreement
          can be reached with models developed in a theoretical framework
          based on standard heavy element distributions. Finally, we
          discuss possible systematic differences when compared with
          multiple populations in GCs.

          from Solar Active Region NOAA 11719 to Earth Directed-CME

          An eruption event launched from solar active region (AR) NOAA
          11719 is investigated based on coronal EUV observations and
          photospheric magnetic field measurements obtained from Solar
          Dynamic Observatory. The AR consists of a filament channel
          originating from major sunspot and its south section is
          associated with inverse-S sigmoidal system as observed in AIA
          passbands. We regard the sigmoid as the main body of the flux
          rope (FR). There also exists a twisted flux bundle crossing over
          this FR. This overlying flux bundle transforms in shape similar
          to kink-rise evolution which has correspondence with rise motion
          of the FR. The emission measure and temperature along the FR
          exhibits increasing trend with its rising motion, indicating
          reconnection in the thinning current sheet underneath the FR.
          Net magnetic flux of the AR evaluated at north and south
          polarities showed decreasing behavior whereas the net current in
          these fluxes exhibits increasing trend. As the negative
          (positive) flux is having dominant positive (negative) current,
          the chirality of AR flux system is likely negative (left handed)
          to be consistent with the chirality of inverse S-sigmoidal FR.
          This analysis of magnetic fields of source AR suggest that the
          cancelling fluxes are prime factors to the monotonous twisting
          of the FR system reaching to a critical state to trigger kink
          instability and the rise motion. This rise motion possibly led
          to onset of torus instability resulting in Earth-directed CME
          and the progressive reconnection in thinning current sheet
          underneath the rising FR leads to M6.5 flare.

          Authors: Jack Ireland, R. T. James McAteer, Andrew R. Inglis

          Subjects: Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

          The dynamics of regions of the solar corona are investigated
          using Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171\AA\ and 193\AA\
          data. The coronal emission from the quiet Sun, coronal loop
          footprints, coronal moss, and from above a sunspot is studied.
          It is shown that the mean Fourier power spectra in these regions
          can be described by a power law at lower frequencies that tails
          to flat spectrum at higher frequencies, plus a Gaussian-shaped
          contribution that varies depending on the region studied. This
          Fourier spectral shape is in contrast to the commonly-held
          assumption that coronal time-series are well described by the
          sum of a long time-scale background trend plus
          Gaussian-distributed noise, with some specific locations also
          showing an oscillatory signal. The implications of this
          discovery to the field of coronal seismology and the automated
          detections of oscillations are discussed. The power law
          contribution to the shape of the Fourier power spectrum is
          interpreted as being due to the summation of a distribution of
          exponentially decaying emission events along the line of sight.
          This is consistent with the idea that the solar atmosphere is
          heated everywhere by small energy deposition events.

          Several claims have been made that we are located in a locally
          underdense region of the Universe based on observations of
          supernovae and galaxy density distributions. Two recent studies
          of K-band galaxy surveys have provided new support for a local
          underdensity in the galaxy distribution out to distances of 200
          - 300 Mpc. If confirmed, such large local underdensities would
          have important implications on the interpretation of local
          measurements of cosmological parameters. Galaxy clusters have
          been shown to be ideal probes to trace the large-scale structure
          of the Universe. In this paper we study the local density
          distribution in the southern sky with the X-ray detected galaxy
          clusters from the REFLEX II cluster survey. From the normalized
          comoving number density of clusters we find an average
          underdensity of ~30 - 40% in the redshift range out to z ~0.04
          (~170 Mpc) in the southern extragalactic sky with a significance
          larger than 3.4sigma. On larger scales from 300 Mpc to over 1
          Gpc the density distribution appears remarkably homogeneous. The
          local underdensity seems to be dominated by the South Galactic
          Cap region. A comparison of the cluster distribution with that
          of galaxies in the K-band from a recent study shows that
          galaxies and clusters trace each other very closely in density.
          In the South Galactic Cap region both surveys find a local

          attempt to interpret the cosmic acceleration by a large local
          void, since the local underdensity we find is not isotropic and
          limited to a size significantly smaller than 300 Mpc radius.

          Title: Variable stars in the open cluster NGC 2141

          Authors: Yanping Luo

          Comments: Accepted To Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics

          Subjects: Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

          We report the results of a search for variable stars in the open
          cluster NGC 2141. Ten variable stars are detected, among which
          nine are new variable stars and they are classified as three
          short period W UMa type eclipsing binaries, two EA type
          eclipsing binaries, one EB type eclipsing binary, one very short
          period RS CVn type eclipsing binary, one d type RR Lyrae
          variable star, and one unknown type variable star. The
          membership and physical properties are discussed, based on their
          light curves, positions in the CMDs, spatial locations and
          periods. A known EB type eclipsing binary is also identified as
          a blue struggler candidate of the cluster. Furthermore, we find
          that all eclipsing contact binaries have prominently asymmetric
          eclipses and O Connell effect (O Connell 1951) which increases
          with the decrease of the orbital periods. This suggests that the
          O Connell effect is probably related to the evolution of the
          orbital period in short period eclipsing binary systems.

          Title: Chemical abundances of the metal-poor horizontal-branch
          stars CS 22186-005 and CS 30344-033

          Subjects: Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

          We report on a chemical-abundance analysis of two very
          metal-poor horizontal-branch stars in the Milky Way halo: CS
          22186-005 ([Fe/H]=-2.70) and CS 30344-033 ([Fe/H]=-2.90). The
          analysis is based on high-resolution spectra obtained at ESO,
          with the spectrographs HARPS at the 3.6 m telescope, and UVES at
          the VLT. We adopted one-dimensional, plane-parallel model
          atmospheres assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium. We derived
          elemental abundances for 13 elements for CS 22186-005 and 14
          elements for CS 30344-033. This study is the first abundance
          analysis of CS 30344-033. CS 22186-005 has been analyzed
          previously, but we report here the first measurement of nickel
          (Ni; Z = 28) for this star, based on twenty-two NiI lines
          ([Ni/Fe]=-0.21$\pm$0.02); the measurement is significantly below
          the mean found for most metal-poor stars. Differences of up to
          0.5 dex in [Ni/Fe] ratios were determined by different authors
          for the same type of stars in the literature, which means that
          it is not yet possible to conclude that there is a real
          intrinsic scatter in the [Ni/Fe] ratios. For the other elements
          for which we obtained estimates, the abundance patterns in these
          two stars match the Galactic trends defined by giant and turnoff
          stars well. This confirms the value of horizontal-branch stars
          as tracers of the chemical properties of stellar populations in
          the Galaxy. Our radial velocities measurements for CS 22186-005
          differ from previously published measurements by more than the
          expected statistical errors. More measurements of the radial
          velocity of this star are encouraged to confirm or refute its
          radial velocity variability.

          Nuclear pasta, with non-spherical shapes, is expected near the
          base of the crust in neutron stars. Large scale molecular
          dynamics simulations of pasta show long lived topological
          defects that could increase electron scattering and reduce both
          the thermal and electrical conductivities. We model a possible
          low conductivity pasta layer by increasing an impurity parameter
          Q_{imp}. Predictions of light curves for the low mass X-ray
          binary MXB 1659-29, assuming a large Q_{imp}, find continued
          late time cooling that is consistent with Chandra observations.
          The electrical and thermal conductivities are likely related.
          Therefore observations of late time crust cooling can provide
          insight on the electrical conductivity and the possible decay of
          neutron star magnetic fields (assuming these are supported by
          currents in the crust).

          We present narrow-band Halpha and [OIII] images, and
          high-resolution, long-slit spectra of the planetary nebulae
          (PNe) Abell36, DeHt2, and RWT152 aimed at studying their
          morphology and internal kinematics. These data are complemented
          with intermediate-resolution, long-slit spectra to describe the
          spectral properties of the central stars and nebulae. The
          morphokinematical analysis shows that Abell36 consists of an
          inner spheroid and two bright point-symmetric arcs; DeHt2 is
          elliptical with protruding polar regions and a bright
          non-equatorial ring; and RWT152 is bipolar. The formation of
          Abell36 and DeHt2 requires several ejection events including
          collimated bipolar outflows that probably are younger than and
          have disrupted the main shell. The nebular spectra of the three
          PNe show a high excitation and also suggest a possible
          deficiency in heavy elements in DeHt2 and RWT152. The spectra of
          the central stars strongly suggest an sdO nature and their
          association with PNe points out that they have most probably
          evolved through the asymptotic giant branch. We analyze general
          properties of the few known sdOs associated to PNe and find that
          most of them are relatively or very evolved PNe, show complex
          morphologies, host binary central stars, and are located at
          relatively high Galactic latitudes.

          Subjects: Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

          We revisit the observed frequencies of Carbon-Enhanced
          Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars as a function of the metallicity in the
          Galaxy, using data from the literature with available
          high-resolution spectroscopy. Our analysis excludes stars
          exhibiting clear over-abundances of neutron-capture elements,
          and takes into account the expected depletion of surface carbon
          abundance that occurs due to CN processing on the upper
          red-giant branch. This allows for the recovery of the initial
          carbon abundance of these stars, and thus for an accurate
          assessment of the frequencies of carbon-enhanced stars. The
          correction procedure we develope is based on stellar-evolution
          models, and depends on the surface gravity, log g, of a given
          star. Our analysis indicates that, for stars with [Fe/H]<=-2.0,
          20% exhibit [C/Fe]>=+0.7. This fraction increases to 43% for
          [Fe/H]<=-3.0 and 81% for [Fe/H]<=-4.0, which is higher than have
          been previously inferred without taking the carbon-abundance
          correction into account. These CEMP-star frequencies provide
          important inputs for Galactic and stellar chemical-evolution
          models, as they constrain the evolution of carbon at early times
          and the possible formation channels for the CEMP-no stars. We
          also have developed a public online tool with which carbon
          corrections using our procedure can be easily obtained.

          In this contribution I show that by combining imaging and

          the photometric and kinematic evidence for discs linking them
          with stellar angular momentum content of early-type galaxies.
          Furthermore, I show that the existence of both fast rotators
          with core and slow rotators with core-less nuclear light
          profiles challenges the standard formation scenarios for fast
          and slow rotators and suggests new pathways of mass assembly.

          Dark matter is a vital component of the current best model of
          our universe, $\Lambda$CDM. There are leading candidates for
          what the dark matter could be (e.g. weakly-interacting massive
          particles, or axions), but no compelling observational or
          experimental evidence exists to support these particular
          candidates, nor any beyond-the-Standard-Model physics that might
          produce such candidates. This suggests that other dark matter
          candidates, including ones that might arise in the Standard
          Model, should receive increased attention. Here we consider a
          general class of dark matter candidates with characteristic
          masses and interaction cross-sections characterized in units of
          grams and cm$^2$, respectively -- we therefore dub these
          macroscopic objects as Macros. Such dark matter candidates could
          potentially be assembled out of Standard Model particles (quarks
          and leptons) in the early universe. A combination of
          earth-based, astrophysical, and cosmological observations
          constrain a portion of the Macro parameter space; however a
          large region remains, most notably for nuclear-dense objects
          with masses in the range between about $50 - 10^{17}$g and
          $10^{20} - 10^{24}$g.

          The determination of the birth radius of the Sun is important to
          understand the evolution and consequent disruption of the Sun's
          birth cluster in the Galaxy. Motivated by this fact, we study
          the motion of the Sun in the Milky Way during the last 4.6 Gyr
          in order to find its birth radius. We carried out orbit
          integrations backward in time using an analytical model of the
          Galaxy which includes the contribution of spiral arms and a
          central bar. We took into account the uncertainty in the
          parameters of the Milky Way potential as well as the uncertainty
          in the present day position and velocity of the Sun. We find
          that in general the Sun has not migrated from its birth place to
          its current position in the Galaxy (R_\odot). However,
          significant radial migration of the Sun is possible when: 1) The
          2:1 Outer Lindblad resonance of the bar is separated from the
          corrotation resonance of spiral arms by a distance ~1 kpc. 2)
          When these two resonances are at the same Galactocentric
          position and further than the solar radius. In both cases the
          migration of the Sun is from outer regions of the Galactic disk
          to R_\odot, placing the Sun's birth radius at around 11 kpc. We
          find that in general it is unlikely that the Sun has migrated
          significantly from the inner regions of the Galactic disk to
          R_\odot.

          We study dualities of the general Galileon theory in d
          dimensions in terms of coordinate transformations on the coset
          space corresponding to the spontaneously broken Galileon group.
          The most general duality transformation is found to be
          determined uniquely up to four free parameters and under
          compositions these transformations form a group which can be
          identified with GL(2,R). This group represents a unified
          framework for all the up to now known Galileon dualities. We
          discuss a representation of this group on the Galileon theory
          space and using concrete examples we illustrate its
          applicability both on the classical and quantum level.

          Ensemble averaged high resolution direct numerical simulations
          of reverse spectral transfer are presented, extending on the
          many single realization numerical studies done up to now. This
          identifies this type of spectral transfer as a statistical
          property of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and thus permits
          reliable numerical exploration of its dynamics. The magnetic
          energy decay exponent from these ensemble runs has been
          determined to be $n_E = (0.47 \pm 0.03) + (13.9 \pm
          0.8)/R_{\lambda}$ for initially helical magnetic fields. We show
          for the first time that even after removing the Lorentz force
          term in the momentum equation, thus decoupling it from the
          induction equation, reverse spectral transfer still persists.
          The induction equation is now linear with an externally imposed
          velocity field, thus amenable to numerous analysis techniques. A
          new door has opened for analyzing reverse spectral transfer,
          with various ideas discussed.

          We study a model in which dark matter couples to the Standard
          Model through a dilaton of a sector with spontaneously broken
          approximate scale invariance. Scale invariance fixes the dilaton
          couplings to the Standard Model and dark matter fields, leaving
          three main free parameters: the symmetry breaking scale $f$, the
          dilaton mass $m_{\sigma}$, and the dark matter mass $m_{\chi}$.
          We analyze the experimental constraints on the parameter space
          from collider, direct and indirect detection experiments
          including the effect of Sommerfeld enhancement, and show that
          dilaton exchange provides a consistent, calculable framework for
          cold dark matter with $f,\,m_\sigma,\,m_\chi$ of roughly similar
          magnitude and in the range $\sim 1-10$ TeV. Direct and indirect
          detection experiments, notably future ground-based gamma ray and
          space-based cosmic ray measurements, can probe the model all the
          way to dark matter mass in the multi-TeV regime.

          Lightspheres, surfaces where massless particles are confined in
          closed orbits, are expected to be common astrophysical
          structures surrounding ultra-compact objects. In this paper a
          semi-classical treatment to photons in a lightspheres is
          proposed. We consider the quantum Maxwell field and derive its
          energy spectra. A thermodynamic approach for the quantum
          lightsphere is explored. Within this treatment, an expression
          for the spectral energy density of the emitted radiation is
          presented. Our results suggest that lightspheres populated by
          photons, when thermalized with their environment, have non-usual
          thermodynamic properties, which could lead to distinct
          observational signatures.

          We present a new quasidilaton theory of Poincare invariant
          massive gravity, based on the recently proposed framework of
          matter coupling that makes it possible for the kinetic energy of
          the quasidilaton scalar to couple to both physical and fiducial
          metrics simultaneously. We find a scaling-type exact solution
          that expresses a self-accelerating de Sitter universe, and then
          analyze linear perturbations around it. It is shown that in a
          range of parameters all physical degrees of freedom have
          non-vanishing quadratic kinetic terms and are stable in the
          subhorizon limit, while the effective Newton's constant for the
          background is kept positive.

          has had in the subsequent 50 years. The review discusses the
          Penrose process, the four laws of black hole mechanics,
          uniqueness of the solution, and the no-hair theorems. It also
          includes Kerr perturbation theory and its application to black
          hole stability and quasi-normal modes. The Kerr metric's
          importance in the astrophysics of quasars and accreting
          stellar-mass black hole systems is detailed. A theme of the
          review is the "miraculous" nature of the solution, both in
          describing in a simple analytic formula the most general
          rotating black hole, and in having unexpected mathematical
          properties that make many calculations tractable. Also included
          is a pedagogical derivation of the solution suitable for a first
