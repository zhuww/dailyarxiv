          We  have  studied  the  nuclear  activity  in  a  sample  of six
          quiescent   early-type  galaxies,  with  new  Chandra  data  and
          archival  HST  optical  images. Their nuclear sources have X-ray
          luminosities  ~  10^{38}  - 10^{39} erg/s (L_X/L_Edd ~ 10^{-8} -
          10^{-7}),  and  colors  or  spectra  consistent  with  accreting
          supermassive  black holes (SMBHs)--except for the nucleus of NGC
          4486B, which is softer than typical AGN spectra. In a few cases,
          the  X-ray  morphology  of  the  nuclear  sources shows hints of
          marginally  extended  structures, in addition to the surrounding
          diffuse  thermal  emission  from hot gas, which is detectable on
          scales  >~  1  kpc.  In  one  case  (NGC 5845), a dusty disk may
          partially  obstruct  our  direct  view  of  the  SMBH.  We  have
          estimated  the  temperature  and density of the hot interstellar
          medium,  which  is  one  major  source of fuel for the accreting
          SMBH;  typical  central  densities  are  n_e  ~  (0.02 +/- 0.01)
          cm^{-3}.  Assuming  that  the hot gas is captured by the SMBH at
          the Bondi rate, we show that the observed X-ray luminosities are
          too  faint  to  be  consistent with standard disk accretion, but
          brighter  than  predicted  by  radiatively-inefficient solutions
          (eg,  ADAF).  In  total,  there are ~ 20 galaxies for which SMBH
          mass,   hot  gas  density,  and  nuclear  X-ray  luminosity  are
          simultaneously  known.  In  some  cases, the nuclear sources are
          brighter  than predicted by the ADAF model; in other cases, they
          are  consistent  or  fainter.  We  discuss  the apparent lack of
          correlations  between  Bondi  rate  and  X-ray  luminosity,  and
          suggest  that, in order to understand the observed distribution,
          we  need  to  know  two additional parameters: the amount of gas
          supplied  by the stellar population inside the accretion radius,
          and the fraction (possibly << 1) of the total gas available that
          is  accreted  by  the SMBH. We shall discuss these issues in our
          Paper II.

          Title:   Formation   of   Magnetically  Supported  Disks  During
          Hard-to-Soft Transition in Black Hole Accretion Flows
          Authors: Mami Machida, Kenji Nakamura, Ryoji Matsumoto

          resolution figures, see this http URL
          We    carried    out    three-dimensional    global    resistive
          magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the cooling instability
          in  optically  thin  hot  black hole accretion flows by assuming
          bremsstrahlung   cooling.   General   relativistic  effects  are
          simulated  by  using  the  pseudo-Newtonian  potential.  Cooling
          instability grows when the density of the accretion disk becomes
          sufficiently  large.  We found that as the instability grows the
          accretion   flow  changes  from  an  optically  thin,  hot,  gas
          pressure-supported   state   (low/hard   state)   to  a  cooler,
          magnetically   supported,   quasi-steady   state.   During  this
          transition,  magnetic  pressure exceeds the gas pressure because
          the disk shrinks in the vertical direction almost conserving the
          toroidal  magnetic  flux.  Since further vertical contraction of
          the disk is suppressed by magnetic pressure, the cool disk stays
          in an optically thin, spectrally hard state. In the magnetically
          supported  disk,  the  heating  rate balances with the radiative
          cooling  rate.  The  magnetically supported disk exists for time
          scale  much longer than the thermal time scale and comparable to
          the accretion time scale.
          We  examined  the  stability  of the magnetically supported disk
          analytically,  assuming  that  the  toroidal  magnetic  flux  is
          conserved,  and  found  it  thermally  and secularly stable. Our
          findings may explain why black hole candidates stay in luminous,
          X-ray   hard  state  even  when  their  luminosity  exceeds  the
          threshold for the onset of the cooling instability.

          Title:  Variations  in the spectral slope of Sgr A* during a NIR
          flare

          We  have  observed a bright flare of Sgr A* in the near infrared
          with  the  adaptive  optics assisted integral field spectrometer
          SINFONI.  The  observed  spectrum  is  featureless  and  can  be
          described  by  a  power law. We show for the first time that the
          spectral  index  is  correlated  with the instantaneous flux and
          that both flux and spectral index experience significant changes
          within  less  than  one  hour.  We  argue that the near infrared
          flares   from   Sgr  A*  are  due  to  synchrotron  emission  of
          transiently  heated  electrons,  the  emission being affected by
          orbital   dynamics  and  synchrotron  cooling,  both  acting  on
          timescales  of  ~20 minutes. The synchrotron cooling process may
          account  for  the observed variation in spectral index, which in
          turn  requires  a  magnetic  field  ~30G,  consistent  with  the
          equipartition  field  in  a hot accretion flow with an accretion
          rate of ~10^{-8} solar masses per year.

          Title:   Steady   shocks   around   black   holes   produced  by
          sub-keplerian flows with negative energy
          Authors: D. Molteni, G. Gerardi, V. Teresi
          Comments:  5  pages, 5 figures, accepted by MNRAS on 10 November
          2005
          We discuss a special case of formation of axisymmetric shocks in
          the accretion flow of ideal gas onto a Schwarzschild black hole:
          when the total energy of the flow is negative. The result of our
          analysis  enlarges  the  parameter  space for which these steady
          shocks  are  exhibited  in  the accretion of gas rotating around
          relativistic   stellar   objects.  Since  keplerian  disks  have
          negative  total energy, we guess that, in this energy range, the
          production  of  the shock phenomenon might be easier than in the
          case of positive energy. So our outcome reinforces the view that
          sub-keplerian  flows  of  matter  may  significantly  affect the
          physics  of  the  high energy radiation emission from black hole
          candidates.  We  give  a simple procedure to obtain analytically
          the  position  of  the  shocks. The comparison of the analytical
          results  with  the  data  of  1D  and  2D axisymmetric numerical
          simulations confirms that the shocks form and are stable.

          Title:   High-resolution  Millimeter  Imaging  of  Submillimeter
          Galaxies

          R.J.Ivison, F.Bertoldi, A.Blain, P.Cox, T.Greve, A.Omont
          Comments: accepted to be published in ApJ, 9 Figures
          We  present sub-arcsecond resolution IRAM PdBI interferometry of
          eight  submillimeter  galaxies at redshifts from 2 to 3.4, where
          we detect continuum at 1mm and/or CO lines at 3 and 1 mm. The CO
          3-2/4-3  line profiles in five of the sources are double-peaked,
          indicative of orbital motion either in a single rotating disk or
          of  a  merger of two galaxies. The millimeter line and continuum
          emission is compact; we marginally resolve the sources or obtain
          tight  upper  limits  to their intrinsic sizes in all cases. The
          median  FWHM  diameter  for  these  sources  and  the previously
          resolved  sources,  SMMJ023952-0136  and SMMJ140104+0252 is less
          than  or  equal  to 0.5" (4 kpc). The compactness of the sources
          does  not  support  a  scenario  where the far-IR/submm emission
          comes  from  a  cold,  very  extended  dust  distribution. These
          measurements  clearly  show  that  the submillimeter galaxies we
          have  observed  resemble scaled-up and more gas rich versions of
          the  local  Universe,  ultra-luminous galaxy (ULIRG) population.
          Their  central  densities  and  potential  well  depths are much
          greater  than  in  other  redshift 2-3 galaxy samples studied so
          far.  They  are  comparable  to  those of elliptical galaxies or
          massive  bulges.  The  SMG  properties  fulfill  the criteria of
          'maximal' starbursts, in which most of the available initial gas
          reservoir of 10^10-10^11 solar masses is converted to stars on a
          few dynamical timescales.

          Title: OVI in Elliptical Galaxies: Indicators of Cooling Flows
          Authors:  Joel  N. Bregman, Eric D. Miller, Alex E. Athey, Jimmy
          A. Irwin
          Comments: 49 pages, 26 figures, ApJ, in press
          Early-type   galaxies   often   contain  a  hot  X-ray  emitting
          interstellar medium (3-8E6 K) with an apparent radiative cooling
          time  much  less  than  a Hubble time. If unopposed by a heating
          mechanism, the gas will radiatively cool to temperatures <= 10E4
          K  at  a  rate proportional to L_X/T_X, typically 0.03-1 M_solar
          yr^-1.  We can test if gas is cooling through the 3E5 K range by
          observing  the  OVI doublet, whose luminosity is proportional to
          the  cooling  rate.  Here  we  report  on a study of an unbiased
          sample  of  24 galaxies, obtaining Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic
          Explorer  spectra  to  complement  the  X-ray data of ROSAT} and
          Chandra.  The OVI line emission was detected in about 40% of the
          galaxies  and  at  a  luminosity level similar to the prediction
          from  the  cooling  flow  model.  There is a correlation between
          Mdot_OVI  and  Mdot_X,  although there is significant dispersion
          about the relationship, where the OVI is brighter or dimmer than
          expected  by  a  factor  of  three  or more. If the cooling flow
          picture is to be retained, this dispersion requires that cooling
          flows  be  time-dependent,  as might occur by the activity of an
          AGN.  However,  of  detected  objects, those with the highest or
          lowest  values  of Mdot_OVI/Mdot_X are not systematically hot or
          cool, as one might predict from AGN heating.

          Title:  On  the spin-up/spin-down transitions in accreting X-ray
          binaries
          Authors:  Rosalba  Perna  (Colorado/JILA),  Enrico  Bozzo  (OAR,
          Rome), Luigi Stella (OAR, Rome)
          Comments:  37  pages,  11 figures, accepted to the Astrophysical
          Journal
          Accreting  X-Ray  Binaries  display  a wide range of behaviours.
          Some  of  them  are  observed  to  spin  up  steadily, others to
          alternate   between  spin-up  and  spin-down  states,  sometimes
          superimposed  on  a longer trend of either spin up or spin down.
          Here  we interpret this rich phenomenology within a new model of
          the  disk-magnetosphere  interaction.  Our  model,  based on the
          simplest  version  of a purely material torque, accounts for the
          fact  that,  when  a  neutron star is in the propeller regime, a
          fraction  of the ejected material does not receive enough energy
          to  completely  unbind,  and  hence falls back into the disk. We
          show  that  the  presence of this feedback mass component causes
          the occurrence of multiple states available to the system, for a
          given,  constant  value of the mass accretion rate dot{M}_* from
          the companion star. If the angle chi of the magnetic dipole axis
          with  respect  to the perpendicular to the disk is larger than a
          critical  value  chi_crit,  the  system  eventually settles in a
          cycle  of  spin-up/spin-down transitions for a constant value of
          dot{M}_*  and independent of the initial conditions. No external
          perturbations  are  required to induce the torque reversals. The
          transition  from  spin up to spin down is often accompanied by a
          large  drop  in  luminosity. The frequency range spanned in each
          cycle and the timescale for torque reversals depend on dot{M}_*,
          the magnetic field of the star, the magnetic colatitude chi, and
          the  degree  of  elasticity  regulating  the  magnetosphere-disk
          interaction. The critical angle chi_crit ranges from \~25-30 deg
          for a completely elastic interaction to ~40-45 deg for a totally
          anelastic  one.  For  chi  ~<  chi_crit,  cycles  are  no longer
          possible  and  the  long-term  evolution of the system is a pure
          spin  up.  We  specifically illustrate our model in the cases of
          the X-ray binaries GX 1+4 and 4U 1626-67.

          Timing  Explorer  (RXTE)  in  2004  December.  We  report on the
          detection  of  three cyclotron resonance features at 27, 51, and
          74  keV  in  the  phase-averaged  data, corresponding to a polar

          V0332+53  the  second  accreting neutron star in which more than
          two  cyclotron  lines have been detected; this has now also been
          confirmed   by   INTEGRAL.   Pulse-phase   spectroscopy  reveals

          25 pages, 14 figures
          We  investigate  the  properties  of massive galaxies at z=1-3.5
          using   HST  observations,  ground-based  near-IR  imaging,  and
          Spitzer Space Telescope observations at 3-24 micron. We identify
          153 distant red galaxies (DRGs) with J-K > 2.3 mag (Vega) in the
          southern  GOODS  field. This sample is approximately complete in
          stellar  mass  for passively evolving galaxies above 10^11 solar
          masses  and z < 3. The galaxies identified by this selection are
          roughly   split   between  objects  whose  optical  and  near-IR
          rest-frame  light  is  dominated  by evolved stars combined with
          ongoing star formation, and galaxies whose light is dominated by
          heavily  reddened  starbursts.  Very few of the galaxies (< 10%)
          have   no  indication  of  current  star  formation.  Using  SFR
          estimates  that  include the reradiated IR emission, the DRGs at
          z=1.5-3  with  stellar masses > 10^11 solar masses have specific
          SFRs (SFRs per unit stellar mass) ranging from 0.2 to 10 Gyr^-1,
          with a mean value of ~2.4 Gyr^-1. The DRGs with stellar masses >
          10^11 solar masses and 1.5 < z < 3 have integrated specific SFRs
          greater the global value over all galaxies. In contrast, we find
          that  galaxies  at  z  = 0.3-0.75 with these stellar masses have
          integrated  specific  SFRs  less than the global value, and more
          than an order of magnitude lower than that for massive DRGs at z
          =  1.5-3.  At  z  <  1, lower-mass galaxies dominate the overall
          cosmic  mass  assembly.  This  suggests  that  the  bulk of star
          formation  in massive galaxies occurs at early cosmic epochs and
          is largely complete by z~1.5. [Abridged]

          Title:  Bimodal  Galaxies  and  Bimodality  in  Globular Cluster
          Systems
          Authors: Duncan A. Forbes
          Comments:  11 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, accepted for publication
          in ApJ Letters
          Various  galaxy properties are not continuous over a large range
          in   mass,   but   rather  reveal  a  remarkable  transition  or
          `bimodality'  at  a  stellar  mass  of  3  x  10^{10}  Mo. These
          properties  include  colors,  stellar populations, Xray emission
          and  mass-to-light ratios. This behavior has been interpreted as
          the  transition  from  hot  to  cold  flows  by Dekel & Birnboim
          (2005).
          Here  we  explore  whether  globular  cluster  (GC) systems also
          reveal a bimodal nature with regard to this critical mass scale.
          Globular  clusters  probe  star formation at early epochs in the
          Universe  and  survive subsequent galaxy mergers and accretions.
          We  use  new  data  from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (Peng etal
          2005),  which  provides  a  homogeneous sample of the GC systems
          around one hundred Virgo early-type galaxies covering a range of
          five  hundred  in  galaxy  mass.  Their classification of the GC
          color  distributions  is  taken to examine a key quantity -- the
          number  of  GCs  per  unit galaxy luminosity. Below the critical
          mass, this quantity (called the GC specific frequency) increases
          dramatically  in its mean value and spread. This increase may be
          due  to  regulated star formation in low mass galaxies, which in
          turn  is  due to mass loss via winds and the transition from hot
          to  cold  gas  accretion  flows.  We  also  note  that above the
          critical mass, galaxies possess two GC subpopulations (with blue
          and  red  mean  colors)  but below this mass, galaxies reveal an
          increasing proportion of single (blue) GC systems.

          We  investigate marginally stable nuclear burning on the surface
          of  accreting  neutron  stars  as  an  explanation  for  the mHz
          quasi-periodic  oscillations (QPOs) observed from three low mass
          X-ray  binaries.  At  the  boundary  between unstable and stable
          burning,  the temperature dependence of the nuclear heating rate
          and  cooling  rate  almost  cancel. The result is an oscillatory
          mode  of  burning,  with  an  oscillation  period  close  to the
          geometric  mean  of the thermal and accretion timescales for the
          burning  layer.  We  describe  a  simple  one-zone  model  which
          illustrates  this  basic  physics,  and  then  present  detailed
          multizone  hydrodynamical  calculations of nuclear burning close
          to  the  stability  boundary  using  the KEPLER code. Our models
          naturally  explain the characteristic 2 minute period of the mHz
          QPOs, and why they are seen only in a very narrow range of X-ray
          luminosities.   The  oscillation  period  is  sensitive  to  the
          accreted hydrogen fraction and the surface gravity, suggesting a
          new  way  to  probe these parameters. A major puzzle is that the
          accretion   rate   at  which  the  oscillations  appear  in  the
          theoretical models is an order of magnitude larger than the rate
          implied  by  the X-ray luminosity when the mHz QPOs are seen. We
          discuss  the  implications  for  our  general  understanding  of
          nuclear  burning  on accreting neutron stars. One possibility is
          that  the accreted material covers only part of the neutron star
          surface at luminosities Lx > ~1E37 erg/s.

          We  have  studied  the  nuclear  activity  in  a  sample  of six
          quiescent   early-type  galaxies,  with  new  Chandra  data  and
          archival  HST  optical  images. Their nuclear sources have X-ray
          luminosities  ~  10^{38}  - 10^{39} erg/s (L_X/L_Edd ~ 10^{-8} -
          10^{-7}),  and  colors  or  spectra  consistent  with  accreting
          supermassive  black holes (SMBHs)--except for the nucleus of NGC
          4486B, which is softer than typical AGN spectra. In a few cases,
          the  X-ray  morphology  of  the  nuclear  sources shows hints of
          marginally  extended  structures, in addition to the surrounding
          diffuse  thermal  emission  from hot gas, which is detectable on
          scales  >~  1  kpc.  In  one  case  (NGC 5845), a dusty disk may
          partially  obstruct  our  direct  view  of  the  SMBH.  We  have
          estimated  the  temperature  and density of the hot interstellar
          medium,  which  is  one  major  source of fuel for the accreting
          SMBH;  typical  central  densities  are  n_e  ~  (0.02 +/- 0.01)
          cm^{-3}.  Assuming  that  the hot gas is captured by the SMBH at
          the Bondi rate, we show that the observed X-ray luminosities are
          too  faint  to  be  consistent with standard disk accretion, but
          brighter  than  predicted  by  radiatively-inefficient solutions
          (eg,  ADAF).  In  total,  there are ~ 20 galaxies for which SMBH
          mass,   hot  gas  density,  and  nuclear  X-ray  luminosity  are
          simultaneously  known.  In  some  cases, the nuclear sources are
          brighter  than predicted by the ADAF model; in other cases, they
          are  consistent  or  fainter.  We  discuss  the apparent lack of
          correlations  between  Bondi  rate  and  X-ray  luminosity,  and
          suggest  that, in order to understand the observed distribution,
          we  need  to  know  two additional parameters: the amount of gas
          supplied  by the stellar population inside the accretion radius,
          and the fraction (possibly << 1) of the total gas available that
          is  accreted  by  the SMBH. We shall discuss these issues in our
          Paper II.

          Title: A High-Mass Protobinary System in the Hot Core W3(H2O)
          Authors: Huei-Ru Chen, William J. Welch, David J. Wilner, Edmund
          C. Sutton
          Comments:  38  pages,  9  figures, accepted by The Astrophysical
          Journal
          We  have observed a high-mass protobinary system in the hot core
          W3(H2O)  with  the BIMA Array. Our continuum maps at wavelengths
          of   1.4mm   and   2.8mm   both  achieve  sub-arcsecond  angular
          resolutions  and  show  a  double-peaked morphology. The angular
          separation   of  the  two  sources  is  1.19"  corresponding  to
          2.43X10^3  AU  at  the  source  distance  of  2.04 kpc. The flux
          densities  of the two sources at 1.4mm and 2.8mm have a spectral
          index  of  3,  translating  to an opacity law of kappa ~ nu. The
          small  spectral  indices  suggest that grain growth has begun in
          the  hot core. We have also observed 5 K components of the CH3CN
          (12-11)  transitions.  A radial velocity difference of 2.81 km/s
          is found towards the two continuum peaks. Interpreting these two
          sources as binary components in orbit about one another, we find
          a  minimum  mass  of  22 Msun for the system. Radiative transfer
          models  are constructed to explain both the continuum and methyl
          cyanide    line   observations   of   each   source.   Power-law
          distributions  of  both  density  and  temperature  are derived.
          Density  distributions close to the free-fall value, r^-1.5, are
          found  for both components, suggesting continuing accretion. The
          derived  luminosities  suggest  the  two sources have equivalent
          zero-age  main  sequence  (ZAMS)  spectral  type  B0.5 - B0. The
          nebular masses derived from the continuum observations are about
          5 Msun for source A and 4 Msun for source C. A velocity gradient
          previously  detected  may  be  explained  by  unresolved  binary
          rotation with a small velocity difference.

          Title:   Formation   of   Magnetically  Supported  Disks  During
          Hard-to-Soft Transition in Black Hole Accretion Flows
          Authors: Mami Machida, Kenji Nakamura, Ryoji Matsumoto

          resolution figures, see this http URL
          We    carried    out    three-dimensional    global    resistive
          magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the cooling instability
          in  optically  thin  hot  black hole accretion flows by assuming
          bremsstrahlung   cooling.   General   relativistic  effects  are
          simulated  by  using  the  pseudo-Newtonian  potential.  Cooling
          instability grows when the density of the accretion disk becomes
          sufficiently  large.  We found that as the instability grows the
          accretion   flow  changes  from  an  optically  thin,  hot,  gas
          pressure-supported   state   (low/hard   state)   to  a  cooler,
          magnetically   supported,   quasi-steady   state.   During  this
          transition,  magnetic  pressure exceeds the gas pressure because
          the disk shrinks in the vertical direction almost conserving the
          toroidal  magnetic  flux.  Since further vertical contraction of
          the disk is suppressed by magnetic pressure, the cool disk stays
          in an optically thin, spectrally hard state. In the magnetically
          supported  disk,  the  heating  rate balances with the radiative
          cooling  rate.  The  magnetically supported disk exists for time
          scale  much longer than the thermal time scale and comparable to
          the accretion time scale.
          We  examined  the  stability  of the magnetically supported disk
          analytically,  assuming  that  the  toroidal  magnetic  flux  is
          conserved,  and  found  it  thermally  and secularly stable. Our
          findings may explain why black hole candidates stay in luminous,
          X-ray   hard  state  even  when  their  luminosity  exceeds  the
          threshold for the onset of the cooling instability.

          Title:  Variations  in the spectral slope of Sgr A* during a NIR

          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, emulateapj.cls, submitted to ApJL
          We  have  observed a bright flare of Sgr A* in the near infrared
          with  the  adaptive  optics assisted integral field spectrometer
          SINFONI.  The  observed  spectrum  is  featureless  and  can  be
          described  by  a  power law. We show for the first time that the
          spectral  index  is  correlated  with the instantaneous flux and
          that both flux and spectral index experience significant changes
          within  less  than  one  hour.  We  argue that the near infrared
          flares   from   Sgr  A*  are  due  to  synchrotron  emission  of
          transiently  heated  electrons,  the  emission being affected by
          orbital   dynamics  and  synchrotron  cooling,  both  acting  on
          timescales  of  ~20 minutes. The synchrotron cooling process may
          account  for  the observed variation in spectral index, which in
          turn  requires  a  magnetic  field  ~30G,  consistent  with  the
          equipartition  field  in  a hot accretion flow with an accretion
          rate of ~10^{-8} solar masses per year.

          Title:   Steady   shocks   around   black   holes   produced  by
          sub-keplerian flows with negative energy
          Authors: D. Molteni, G. Gerardi, V. Teresi
          Comments:  5  pages, 5 figures, accepted by MNRAS on 10 November
          2005
          We discuss a special case of formation of axisymmetric shocks in
          the accretion flow of ideal gas onto a Schwarzschild black hole:
          when the total energy of the flow is negative. The result of our
          analysis  enlarges  the  parameter  space for which these steady
          shocks  are  exhibited  in  the accretion of gas rotating around
          relativistic   stellar   objects.  Since  keplerian  disks  have
          negative  total energy, we guess that, in this energy range, the
          production  of  the shock phenomenon might be easier than in the
          case of positive energy. So our outcome reinforces the view that
          sub-keplerian  flows  of  matter  may  significantly  affect the
          physics  of  the  high energy radiation emission from black hole
          candidates.  We  give  a simple procedure to obtain analytically
          the  position  of  the  shocks. The comparison of the analytical
          results  with  the  data  of  1D  and  2D axisymmetric numerical
          simulations confirms that the shocks form and are stable.

          Title:   Spitzer/IRAC   Photometry   of   the  Eta  Chameleontis
          Association
          Authors:  S.  T. Megeath (1), L. Hartmann (2), K. L. Luhman (3),
          G. G. Fazio (1)
          Comments: Accepted to ApJ letters
          We present IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 micron photometry for the 17
          A,  K  and  M  type members of the Eta Chameleontis association.
          These  data  show infrared excesses toward six of the 15 K and M
          stars, indicating the presence of circumstellar disks around 40%
          of  the  stars  with masses of 0.1-1 solar mass. The two A-stars
          show no infrared excesses. The excess emission around one of the
          stars  is  comparable to the median excess for classical T Tauri
          stars  in  the  Taurus  association;  the  remaining  five  show
          comparatively   weak   excess   emission.  Taking  into  account
          published  Halpha  spectroscopy  that shows that five of the six
          stars   are  accreting,  we  argue  that  the  disks  with  weak
          mid-infrared  excesses  are  disks in which the inner disks have
          been  largely  depleted  of small grains by grain growth, or, in
          one  case,  the  small grains have settled to the midplane. This
          suggests that Eta Cha has a much higher fraction of disks caught
          in  the act of transitioning into optically thin disks than that
          measured in younger clusters and associations.

          Authors: A. Georgakakis (1,2), I. Georgantopoulos (2), A. Akylas
          (2) ((1) Imperial College, (2) National Athens Observatory)
          Comments: Accepted by MNRAS
          In  this  paper  we  combine archival and proprietary XMM-Newton
          observations  (about 5deg^2) that overlap with the Sloan Digital
          Sky  Survey  to  explore  the  nature  of  the  moderate-z X-ray
          population. We focus on X-ray sources with optically red colours
          (g-r>0.4),  which  we  argue are important for understanding the
          origin   of   the   X-ray  background.  Firstly,  these  systems
          constitute  a  significant fraction, about 2/3, of the z<1 X-ray
          population  to  the  limit  f(2-8keV)~2e-14cgs.  Secondly, their
          luminosity   function  under  evolution  of  the  form  ~(1+z)^3
          suggests that they could be responsible for about 17 per cent of
          the  diffuse  X-ray  background  to  z=1. Thirdly, their stacked
          X-ray  spectrum  in  the  range  1-8keV  is  consistent  with  a
          power-law distribution with Gamma~1.4 (without fitting intrinsic
          absorption),  i.e.  similar  to the diffuse X-ray background. We
          find  that  the optically red X-ray population comprises a mixed
          bag  of objects, both obscured (N_H>1e22 cm^{-2}) and unobscured
          (N_H<1e22  cm^{-2}),  with a wide range of X-ray luminosities up
          L_X~1e44cgs. We argue that dilution of the AGN light by the host
          galaxy may play a role in shaping the continuum optical emission
          of  this  population. Finally, we explore a possible association
          of  these  sources  and  the  moderate-z  red  (J-Ks>2mag)  AGNs
          identified  in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). The median
          N_H of the red X-ray sources studied here is ~1e21cm^{-2}, lower
          than  that  found  for  the  2MASS  AGNs,  suggesting  different
          populations.

          We  present sub-arcsecond resolution IRAM PdBI interferometry of
          eight  submillimeter  galaxies at redshifts from 2 to 3.4, where
          we detect continuum at 1mm and/or CO lines at 3 and 1 mm. The CO
          3-2/4-3  line profiles in five of the sources are double-peaked,
          indicative of orbital motion either in a single rotating disk or
          of  a  merger of two galaxies. The millimeter line and continuum
          emission is compact; we marginally resolve the sources or obtain
          tight  upper  limits  to their intrinsic sizes in all cases. The
          median  FWHM  diameter  for  these  sources  and  the previously
          resolved  sources,  SMMJ023952-0136  and SMMJ140104+0252 is less
          than  or  equal  to 0.5" (4 kpc). The compactness of the sources
          does  not  support  a  scenario  where the far-IR/submm emission
          comes  from  a  cold,  very  extended  dust  distribution. These
          measurements  clearly  show  that  the submillimeter galaxies we
          have  observed  resemble scaled-up and more gas rich versions of
          the  local  Universe,  ultra-luminous galaxy (ULIRG) population.
          Their  central  densities  and  potential  well  depths are much
          greater  than  in  other  redshift 2-3 galaxy samples studied so
          far.  They  are  comparable  to  those of elliptical galaxies or
          massive  bulges.  The  SMG  properties  fulfill  the criteria of
          'maximal' starbursts, in which most of the available initial gas
          reservoir of 10^10-10^11 solar masses is converted to stars on a
          few dynamical timescales.

          We  report  the discovery of a 16th magnitude star, HE0437-5439,
          with   a   heliocentric   radial   velocity  of  +723+-3km/s.  A
          quantitative   spectral   analysis  of  high-resolution  optical
          spectra  obtained  with  the VLT and the UVES spectrograph shows
          that   HE0437-5439   is   a   main  sequence  B-type  star  with
          Teff=20350K,  log  g=3.77, solar within a factor of a few helium
          abundance  and  metal content, rotating at v sin i=54km/s. Using
          appropriate evolutionary tracks we derive a mass of 8 Msun and a
          corresponding  distance  of  61  kpc.  Its  galactic  rest frame
          velocity  is  at  least 563km/s, almost twice the local Galactic
          escape  velocity,  indicating  that  the  star is unbound to the
          Galaxy.  Numerical  kinematical  experiments  are carried out to
          constrain  its  place  of birth. It has been suggested that such
          hyper-velocity  stars can be formed by the tidal disruption of a
          binary  through interaction with the super-massive black hole at
          the  Galactic  center  (GC).  HE0437-5439 needs about 100Myrs to
          travel  from the GC to its presentposition, much longer than its
          main sequence lifetime of 25Myrs. This can only be reconciled if
          HE0437-5439  is  a  blue  straggler  star.  In  this  case,  the
          predicted proper motion is so small that it can only be measured
          by  future  space missions. Since the star is much closer to the
          Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, 18kpc) than to the GC, it can reach
          its  position  from  the  center  of  the LMC. The proper motion
          predicted  in  this  case is about 2mas/y (relative to the LMC),
          large  enough to be measurable with conventional techniques from
          the   ground.   The  LMC  origin  could  also  be  tested  by  a
          high-precision abundance analysis.

          shows  that  US  708 is an extremely helium-rich (N(He)/N(H)=10)
          subluminous  O  type  star  with  Teff=44500K,  log  g=5.23 at a
          distance  of 19kpc. Its Galactic rest frame velocity is at least
          751km/s,  much  higher  than  the local Galactic escape velocity
          indicating  that  the star is unbound to the Galaxy. It has been
          suggested  that  such  hyper-velocity stars can be formed by the
          tidal  disruption  of  a  binary  through  interaction  with the
          super-massive  black  hole  (SMBH)  at the Galactic centre (GC).
          Numerical kinematical experiments are carried out to reconstruct
          the  path  from the GC.U S 708 needs about 32Myrs to travel from
          the  GC  to  its  present  position,  less than its evolutionary
          lifetime.     Its    predicted    proper    motion    mue(alpha)
          cos(delta)=-2.3mas/y    and   mue(delta)=-2.4mas/y   should   be
          measurable  by  future space missions. We conjecture that US 708
          is  formed  by  the merger of two helium white dwarfs in a close
          binary  induced  by  the interaction with the SMBH in the GC and
          then escaped.

          The basic theory of dynamic tides in close binaries is reviewed.
          Particular attention is paid to resonances between dynamic tides
          and free oscillation modes and to the role of the apsidal-motion
          rate in probing the internal structure of binary components. The
          discussed  effects  are generally applicable to stars across the
          entire   Hertzsprung-Russell   diagram,   including  the  binary
          OB-stars discussed at this meeting.

          Title: Turbulent Mixing in the Outer Solar Nebula
          Authors: N. J. Turner, K. Willacy, G. Bryden, H. W. Yorke
          Comments:  To  appear  in the Astrophysical Journal; 20 pages, 9
          figures
          The effects of turbulence on the mixing of gases and dust in the
          outer  Solar  nebula  are examined using 3-D MHD calculations in
          the shearing-box approximation with vertical stratification. The
          turbulence  is driven by the magneto-rotational instability. The
          magnetic  and hydrodynamic stresses in the turbulence correspond
          to  an  accretion  time  at  the  midplane  about  equal  to the
          lifetimes  of  T  Tauri  disks,  while  accretion in the surface
          layers  is  thirty  times  faster. The mixing resulting from the
          turbulence  is  also  fastest  in the surface layers. The mixing
          rate  is  similar  to  the  rate  of  radial exchange of orbital
          angular  momentum, so that the Schmidt number is near unity. The
          vertical  spreading  of  a  trace  species  is  well-matched  by
          solutions   of   a   damped  wave  equation  when  the  flow  is
          horizontally-averaged.  The  damped wave description can be used
          to  inexpensively  treat mixing in 1-D chemical models. However,
          even  in  calculations  reaching a statistical steady state, the
          concentration  at  any  given  time  varies  substantially  over
          horizontal planes, due to fluctuations in the rate and direction
          of  the transport. In addition to mixing species that are formed
          under  widely  varying conditions, the turbulence intermittently
          forces  the  nebula  away  from  local chemical equilibrium. The
          different transport rates in the surface layers and interior may
          affect estimates of the grain evolution and molecular abundances
          during the formation of the Solar system.

          Title:  Accurate  Evolutions  of  Orbiting  Black-Hole  Binaries
          Without Excision

          We  present  a  new  algorithm  for evolving orbiting black-hole
          binaries  that  does not require excision or a corotating shift.
          Our  algorithm  is  based  on  a  novel  technique to handle the
          singular  puncture  conformal  factor. This system, based on the
          BSSN  formulation  of  Einstein's  equations,  when  used with a
          `pre-collapsed'  initial  lapse, is non-singular at the start of
          the evolution, and remains non-singular and stable provided that
          a good choice is made for the gauge. As a test case, we use this
          technique to fully evolve orbiting black-hole binaries from near
          the  Innermost  Stable  Circular  Orbit  (ISCO)  regime. We show
          fourth  order  convergence of waveforms and compute the radiated
          gravitational energy and angular momentum from the plunge. These
          results  are  in  good  agreement  with  those  predicted by the
          Lazarus approach.

          Compton  Gamma  Ray  Observatory,  OSSE, SMM, TGRS, balloon and
          recent  INTEGRAL  data  reveal  a  feature  of  the  0.511  MeV
          annihilation  radiation  of  the Galactic Center with a flux of
          approximately  5x  10^{-4}~0.511 MeV photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. We
          argue that e+e- pairs can be generated when the X-ray radiation
          photons  and ~10-30 MeV photons interact with each other in the
          compact  region  in  the proximity of the Galactic Center black
          hole.  In fact, disks formed near black holes of 10^{17} g mass
          should  emit  the  ~ 10 MeV temperature blackbody radiation. If
          positron  e+ sources are producing about 10^{42} e+ s^{-1} near
          the  Galactic  Center  they would annihilate on the way out and
          result  in 0.511 MeV emission. We suggest that the annihilation
          radiation   can   be   an   observational  consequence  of  the
          interaction  of  the accretion disk radiation of the SMall Mass
          Black  Holes  (SMMBHs)  with  X-ray  radiation  in the Galactic
          Center.  This  is probably the only way to identify and observe
          these SMMBHs.

          Galaxies

          Comments:  19  pages,  20  figures, accepted for publication in
          MNRAS. High resolution version available at this http URL
          Recent HI observations reveal that the discs of spiral galaxies
          are  surrounded  by  extended gaseous haloes. This extra-planar
          gas  reaches  large  distances  (several kpc) from the disc and
          shows  peculiar  kinematics  (low rotation and inflow). We have
          modelled  the extra-planar gas as a continuous flow of material
          from  the  disc  of  a  spiral galaxy into its halo region. The
          output of our models are pseudo-data cubes that can be directly
          compared  to  the  HI data. We have applied these models to two
          spiral   galaxies   (NGC891   and  NGC2403)  known  to  have  a
          substantial  amount of extra-planar gas. Our models are able to
          reproduce  accurately the vertical distribution of extra-planar
          gas for an energy input corresponding to a small fraction (<4%)
          of  the energy released by supernovae. However they fail in two
          important  aspects: 1) they do not reproduce the right gradient
          in  rotation velocity; 2) they predict a general outflow of the
          extra-planar  gas,  contrary  to what is observed. We show that
          neither  of  these  difficulties  can  be removed if clouds are
          ionized and invisible at 21cm as they leave the disc but become
          visible  at some point on their orbits. We speculate that these
          failures  indicate  the need for accreted material from the IGM
          that   could  provide  the  low  angular  momentum  and  inflow
          required.

          Comments: 10 pages, 6 colour figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          Recent  observations  of the distant Universe suggest that much
          of  the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at
          $z>1$. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation
          because  massive  halos  are  assembled  late  in  hierarchical
          cosmologies  such  as cold dark matter (CDM). In this paper, we
          discuss  a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model
          in  which  feedback  due  to  active  galactic  nuclei (AGN) is
          assumed   to  quench  cooling  flows  in  massive  halos.  This
          mechanism  naturally  creates  a  break  in  the  local  galaxy
          luminosity   function   at  bright  magnitudes.  The  model  is
          implemented   within  the  Millennium  N-body  simulation;  the
          accurate   dark   matter  merger  trees  and  large  number  of
          realizations   of   the   galaxy  formation  process  that  the
          simulation  provides  results  in  highly  accurate statistics.
          After  adjusting  the  values of the physical parameters in the
          model  by reference to the properties of local galaxies, we use
          it  to  investigate  the evolution of the K-band luminosity and
          galaxy  stellar  mass  functions.  We also calculate the volume
          averaged  star  formation  rate  density  of  the Universe as a
          function  of  redshift and the way in which this is apportioned
          amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts
          a  substantial  population  of massive galaxies out to redshift
          $z\sim  5$  and  a star formation rate density which rises with
          increasing   redshift   in  objects  of  all  masses.  Although
          observational  data  on  these  properties  have  been cited as
          evidence  for  ``anti-hierarchical''  galaxy formation, we find
          that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally
          hierachical  CDM  model  provides  a  very  good match to these
          observations.

astro-ph/0511293
          Our  X-ray study of the nuclear activity in a new sample of six
          quiescent  early-type galaxies, and in a larger sample from the
          literature,  confirmed  (Soria  et al., Paper I) that the Bondi
          accretion  rate  of  diffuse hot gas is not a good indicator of
          the  supermassive  black  hole (SMBH) X-ray luminosity. Here we
          suggest  that  a  more  reliable estimate of the accretion rate
          must  include the gas released by the stellar population inside
          the  sphere  of influence of the SMBH, in addition to the Bondi
          inflow   of  hot  gas  across  that  surface.  We  use  optical
          surface-brightness profiles to estimate the mass-loss rate from
          stars  in  the  nuclear  region: we show that for our sample of
          galaxies  it  is  an  order  of  magnitude  higher (~ 10^{-4} -
          10^{-3}  M_sun/yr)  than  the  Bondi inflow rate of hot gas, as
          estimated  from  Chandra (Paper I). Only by taking into account
          both  sources of fuel can we constrain the true accretion rate,
          the  accretion  efficiency,  and  the power budget. Radiatively
          efficient  accretion  is  ruled  out,  for quiescent SMBHs. For
          typical  radiatively  inefficient  flows,  the  observed  X-ray
          luminosities  of  the SMBHs imply accretion fractions ~ 1 - 10%
          (ie,  ~  90 - 99% of the available gas does not reach the SMBH)
          for  at  least five of our six target galaxies, and most of the
          other   galaxies   with  known  SMBH  masses.  We  discuss  the
          conditions   for   mass   conservation  inside  the  sphere  of
          influence,  so  that  the  total  gas  injection is balanced by
          accretion  plus  outflows. We show that a fraction of the total
          accretion power (mechanical plus radiative) would be sufficient
          to  sustain  a self-regulating, slow outflow which removes from
          the  nuclear  region all the gas that does not sink into the BH
          (``BH  feedback'').  The  rest  of  the  accretion power may be
          carried  out  in  a jet, or advected. We also discuss scenarios
          that would lead to an intermittent nuclear activity.

          In   this   work   we   present  a  system  for  the  automatic

          with   {\em  Hipparcos}  data  of  seven  different  categories
          including  eccentric  binary systems and two types of pulsating

          Title: Common envelope evolution through planetary nebula eyes
          Authors: Orsola De Marco, Maxwell Moe
          Comments:  4  pages, one figure, proceedings of the 2005 Gdansk
          meeting PN as astronomical tools, in press
          The  common  envelope  interaction  is  responsible for evolved
          close  binaries.  Among them are a minority of central stars of
          planetary  nebula  (PN). Recent observational results, however,
          point to most PN actually being in binary systems. We therefore
          ask  the  question  if  it  is  feasible that most, or even all
          Galactic  PN  derive  from  a  common envelope interaction. Our
          recent  calculation finds that if all single and binary primary
          stars with mass between ~1-8 Mo eject a PN, there would be many
          more  PN  in  the  galaxy than observed. On the other hand, the
          predicted   number  of  post-common  envelope  PN  is  more  in
          agreement  with the total number of PN in the Galaxy. This is a
          new  indication that binary interactions play a functional role
          in the creation of PN and an encouragement to intensify efforts
          to detect binary companions.

          regions
          Authors: Sergey Mashchenko, H. M. P. Couchman, Alison Sills
          Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ApJ
          Using  a  large  set  of  high resolution numerical simulations
          incorporating  non-equilibrium molecular hydrogen chemistry and
          a  constant source of external radiation, we study gas collapse
          in   previously   photo-ionized   mini-galaxies   with   virial
          temperatures  less than 10^4 K in the early universe (redshifts
          z=10-20). We confirm that the mechanism of positive feedback of
          ionizing  radiation on star formation in mini-galaxies proposed
          by  Ricotti,  Gnedin, & Shull (2002) can be efficient despite a
          significant  flux of metagalactic photo-dissociating radiation.
          We  derive  critical  fluxes  for  the  Lyman-Werner background
          radiation   sufficient  to  prevent  the  collapse  of  gas  in
          mini-galaxies  as a function of the virial mass of the halo and
          redshift.  In  our  model,  the  formation  of mini-galaxies in
          defunct HII regions is most efficient at large redshifts (z>15)
          and/or  for  large local gas overdensity delta>10. We show that
          non-equilibrium chemistry plays an important dynamical role not
          only  during  the initial evolutionary phase leading to the gas
          becoming  gravitationally  unstable  inside  the mini-halo, but
          also  at the advanced stages of the core collapse, resulting in
          efficient  gas  accretion in the core region. We speculate on a
          possible connection between our objects and metal-poor globular
          clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

          should  emit  the  ~  10 MeV temperature blackbody radiation. If
          positron  e+  sources are producing about 10^{42} e+ s^{-1} near
          the  Galactic  Center  they  would annihilate on the way out and
          result  in  0.511 MeV emission. We suggest that the annihilation
          radiation can be an observational consequence of the interaction
          of  the  accretion  disk radiation of the SMall Mass Black Holes
          (SMMBHs)  with  X-ray  radiation in the Galactic Center. This is
          probably the only way to identify and observe these SMMBHs.

          Title:  A  Dynamical  Model  for  the Extra-planar Gas in Spiral
          Galaxies
          Authors: Filippo Fraternali, James Binney (University of Oxford)
          Comments:  19  pages,  20  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS. High resolution version available at this http URL
          Recent  HI observations reveal that the discs of spiral galaxies
          are surrounded by extended gaseous haloes. This extra-planar gas
          reaches  large  distances  (several kpc) from the disc and shows
          peculiar  kinematics (low rotation and inflow). We have modelled
          the  extra-planar  gas as a continuous flow of material from the
          disc  of a spiral galaxy into its halo region. The output of our
          models  are  pseudo-data  cubes that can be directly compared to
          the HI data. We have applied these models to two spiral galaxies
          (NGC891  and  NGC2403)  known  to  have  a substantial amount of
          extra-planar  gas.  Our  models are able to reproduce accurately
          the  vertical  distribution  of  extra-planar  gas for an energy
          input  corresponding  to  a  small  fraction (<4%) of the energy
          released  by  supernovae.  However  they  fail  in two important
          aspects: 1) they do not reproduce the right gradient in rotation
          velocity;  2) they predict a general outflow of the extra-planar
          gas, contrary to what is observed. We show that neither of these
          difficulties  can be removed if clouds are ionized and invisible
          at  21cm as they leave the disc but become visible at some point
          on  their  orbits. We speculate that these failures indicate the
          need  for  accreted material from the IGM that could provide the
          low angular momentum and inflow required.

          Comments: 10 pages, 6 colour figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of
          the  stellar  mass  of  bright  galaxies was already in place at
          $z>1$.  This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation
          because   massive  halos  are  assembled  late  in  hierarchical
          cosmologies  such  as  cold dark matter (CDM). In this paper, we
          discuss  a  new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model
          in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed
          to  quench  cooling  flows  in  massive  halos.  This  mechanism
          naturally  creates  a  break  in  the  local  galaxy  luminosity
          function  at  bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within
          the  Millennium  N-body  simulation;  the  accurate  dark matter
          merger  trees  and  large  number  of realizations of the galaxy
          formation process that the simulation provides results in highly
          accurate  statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical
          parameters  in the model by reference to the properties of local
          galaxies,  we  use it to investigate the evolution of the K-band
          luminosity  and galaxy stellar mass functions. We also calculate
          the  volume averaged star formation rate density of the Universe
          as  a  function  of  redshift  and  the  way  in  which  this is
          apportioned  amongst  galaxies  of  different  mass.  The  model
          robustly  predicts  a substantial population of massive galaxies
          out  to  redshift  $z\sim  5$  and a star formation rate density
          which  rises  with increasing redshift in objects of all masses.
          Although  observational data on these properties have been cited
          as  evidence for ``anti-hierarchical'' galaxy formation, we find
          that  when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally
          hierachical  CDM  model  provides  a  very  good  match to these
          observations.

astro-ph/0511293
          Our  X-ray  study of the nuclear activity in a new sample of six
          quiescent  early-type  galaxies, and in a larger sample from the
          literature,  confirmed  (Soria  et  al., Paper I) that the Bondi
          accretion rate of diffuse hot gas is not a good indicator of the
          supermassive black hole (SMBH) X-ray luminosity. Here we suggest
          that a more reliable estimate of the accretion rate must include
          the  gas released by the stellar population inside the sphere of
          influence  of  the  SMBH, in addition to the Bondi inflow of hot
          gas  across  that  surface.  We  use  optical surface-brightness
          profiles  to  estimate  the  mass-loss  rate  from  stars in the
          nuclear region: we show that for our sample of galaxies it is an
          order  of  magnitude  higher (~ 10^{-4} - 10^{-3} M_sun/yr) than
          the  Bondi  inflow  rate  of  hot gas, as estimated from Chandra
          (Paper  I). Only by taking into account both sources of fuel can
          we  constrain the true accretion rate, the accretion efficiency,
          and  the  power budget. Radiatively efficient accretion is ruled
          out,  for  quiescent  SMBHs. For typical radiatively inefficient
          flows,  the  observed  X-ray  luminosities  of  the  SMBHs imply
          accretion  fractions  ~ 1 - 10% (ie, ~ 90 - 99% of the available
          gas does not reach the SMBH) for at least five of our six target
          galaxies, and most of the other galaxies with known SMBH masses.
          We  discuss  the  conditions  for  mass  conservation inside the
          sphere of influence, so that the total gas injection is balanced
          by accretion plus outflows. We show that a fraction of the total
          accretion  power (mechanical plus radiative) would be sufficient
          to  sustain  a  self-regulating, slow outflow which removes from
          the  nuclear  region  all the gas that does not sink into the BH
          (``BH  feedback'').  The  rest  of  the  accretion  power may be
          carried  out  in  a  jet, or advected. We also discuss scenarios
          that would lead to an intermittent nuclear activity.

          In   this   work   we   present   a  system  for  the  automatic
          classification  of  the light curves of eclipsing binaries. This
          system is based on a classification scheme that aims to separate
          eclipsing   binary   sistems   according  to  their  geometrical
          configuration   in   a   modified  version  of  the  traditional
          classification  scheme.  The  classification  is  performed by a
          Bayesian   ensemble   of   neural  networks  trained  with  {\em
          Hipparcos}   data   of   seven  different  categories  including
          eccentric  binary systems and two types of pulsating light curve
          morphologies.

          Title: Common envelope evolution through planetary nebula eyes
          Authors: Orsola De Marco, Maxwell Moe
          Comments:  4  pages,  one figure, proceedings of the 2005 Gdansk
          meeting PN as astronomical tools, in press
          The common envelope interaction is responsible for evolved close
          binaries.  Among  them  are  a  minority  of  central  stars  of
          planetary  nebula  (PN).  Recent observational results, however,
          point  to most PN actually being in binary systems. We therefore
          ask  the  question  if  it  is  feasible  that most, or even all
          Galactic  PN  derive  from  a  common  envelope interaction. Our
          recent  calculation  finds that if all single and binary primary
          stars  with mass between ~1-8 Mo eject a PN, there would be many
          more  PN  in  the  galaxy  than observed. On the other hand, the
          predicted number of post-common envelope PN is more in agreement
          with  the  total  number  of  PN  in  the  Galaxy. This is a new
          indication  that  binary  interactions play a functional role in
          the  creation of PN and an encouragement to intensify efforts to
          detect binary companions.

          Title:  Formation  of  mini-galaxies in defunct cosmological HII
          regions
          Authors: Sergey Mashchenko, H. M. P. Couchman, Alison Sills
          Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ApJ
          Using  a  large  set  of  high  resolution numerical simulations
          incorporating non-equilibrium molecular hydrogen chemistry and a
          constant  source of external radiation, we study gas collapse in
          previously  photo-ionized mini-galaxies with virial temperatures
          less  than  10^4 K in the early universe (redshifts z=10-20). We
          confirm  that  the  mechanism  of  positive feedback of ionizing
          radiation   on  star  formation  in  mini-galaxies  proposed  by
          Ricotti,  Gnedin,  &  Shull  (2002)  can  be efficient despite a
          significant  flux  of metagalactic photo-dissociating radiation.
          We  derive  critical  fluxes  for  the  Lyman-Werner  background
          radiation   sufficient   to  prevent  the  collapse  of  gas  in
          mini-galaxies  as  a function of the virial mass of the halo and
          redshift.  In  our  model,  the  formation  of  mini-galaxies in
          defunct  HII regions is most efficient at large redshifts (z>15)
          and/or  for  large  local gas overdensity delta>10. We show that
          non-equilibrium  chemistry plays an important dynamical role not
          only  during  the  initial evolutionary phase leading to the gas
          becoming gravitationally unstable inside the mini-halo, but also
          at  the  advanced  stages  of  the  core  collapse, resulting in
          efficient  gas  accretion  in the core region. We speculate on a
          possible  connection between our objects and metal-poor globular
          clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

          Title:  The  Dynamical  Evolution  of  Black  Hole-Neutron Star
          Binaries in General Relativity: Simulations of Tidal Disruption
          Authors:  Joshua  A.  Faber,  Thomas  W.  Baumgarte,  Stuart L.

          PRD
          We  calculate  the  first dynamical evolutions of merging black
          hole-neutron  star  binaries  that construct the combined black
          hole-neutron   star   spacetime   in   a  general  relativistic
          framework.  We  treat  the  metric  in  the  conformal flatness
          approximation,   and   assume  that  the  black  hole  mass  is
          sufficiently large compared to that of the neutron star so that
          the  black  hole  remains  fixed  in  space. Using a spheroidal
          spectral methods solver, we solve the resulting field equations
          for  a  neutron  star  orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole. The
          matter  is  evolved  using a relativistic, Lagrangian, smoothed
          particle  hydrodynamics (SPH) treatment. We take as our initial
          data  recent  quasiequilibrium  models for synchronized neutron
          star   polytropes  generated  as  solutions  of  the  conformal
          thin-sandwich   (CTS)   decomposition  of  the  Einstein  field
          equations.  We  are able to construct from these models relaxed
          SPH  configurations whose profiles show good agreement with CTS
          solutions.  Our  adiabatic  evolution  calculations for neutron
          stars  with  low  compactness  show that mass transfer, when it
          begins  while  the  neutron  star  orbit  is  still outside the
          innermost  stable  circular  orbit,  is  more  unstable than is
          typically  predicted  by  analytical formalisms. This dynamical
          mass  loss  is found to be the driving force in determining the
          subsequent  evolution of the binary orbit and the neutron star,
          which  typically  disrupts  completely  within  a  few  orbital
          periods.  The  majority  of the mass transferred onto the black
          hole is accreted promptly; a significant fraction (~30%) of the
          mass  is  shed  outward  as  well,  some  of  which will become
          gravitationally unbound and ejected completely from the system.
          The  remaining portion forms an accretion disk around the black
          hole,  and  could  provide the energy source for short-duration
          gamma ray bursts.

          for March 2006 issue of Publ. Ast. Soc. Pacific
          We  present  the  software  tool  FITDisk, a precompiled-binary
          Windows  GUI  version  of  our  smoothed particle hydrodynamics
          cataclysmic  variable accretion disk research code. Cataclysmic
          variables  are  binary  star systems in which a compact stellar
          remnant, typically a white dwarf star, is stripping mass from a
          lower-main-sequence companion star by way of an accretion disk.
          Typically  the  disk  is the brightest component of the system,
          because the plasma is heated dramatically as it spirals down in
          the  gravitational  well  of  the primary white dwarf star. The
          shortest-period    systems   can   display   disk   "superhump"
          oscillations   driven  by  the  rotating  tidal  field  of  the
          secondary  star.  FITDisk models these accretion disk phenomena
          using  a fully three-dimensional hydrodynamics calculation, and
          data  can  be visualized as they are computed or stored to hard
          drive  for later playback at a fast frame rate. Simulations are
          visualized  using  OpenGL graphics and the viewing angle can be
          changed interactively. Pseudo light curves of simulated systems
          can  be  plotted  along  with  the associated Fourier amplitude
          spectrum.   FITDisk   is   available   for   free  download  at

          Title:  The  Evolution  of  the Water Distribution in a Viscous
          Protoplanetary Disk
          Authors: Fred J. Ciesla, Jeffrey N. Cuzzi
          Comments:  45  pages,  7  figures,  revised  for publication in
          Icarus
          (Abridged)    Astronomical   observations   have   shown   that
          protoplanetary  disks are dynamic objects through which mass is
          transported  and  accreted  by  the central star. Age dating of
          meteorite  constituents  shows  that their creation, evolution,
          and  accumulation occupied several Myr, and over this time disk
          properties   would  evolve  significantly.  Moreover,  on  this
          timescale,  solid  particles  decouple from the gas in the disk
          and their evolution follows a different path. Here we present a
          model  which tracks how the distribution of water changes in an
          evolving   disk   as   the   water-bearing  species  experience
          condensation,  accretion,  transport,  collisional destruction,
          and  vaporization.  Because solids are transported in a disk at
          different rates depending on their sizes, the motions will lead
          to  water  being  concentrated  in  some  regions of a disk and
          depleted  in  others.  These  enhancements  and  depletions are
          consistent  with  the conditions needed to explain some aspects
          of  the  chemistry  of  chondritic  meteorites and formation of
          giant  planets.  The  levels of concentration and depletion, as
          well  as  their  locations,  depend  strongly  on  the combined
          effects of the gaseous disk evolution, the formation of rapidly
          migrating  rubble, and the growth of immobile planetesimals. We
          present  examples  of  evolution  under  a  range  of plausible
          assumptions  and  demonstrate how the chemical evolution of the
          inner  region  of a protoplanetary disk is intimately connected
          to the physical processes which occur in the outer regions.

          Title:  Eddington-limited  X-ray Bursts as Distance Indicators.

          Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, accepted by ApJ
          We analyzed 123 thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts observed by
          the  Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer from the low-mass X-ray binary
          4U  1636-536.  All  but two of the 40 radius-exansion bursts in
          this sample reached peak fluxes which were normally distributed
          about  a  mean of 6.4e-8 ergs/cm^2/s, with a standard deviation
          of 7.6%. The remaining two radius-expansion bursts reached peak
          fluxes a factor of 1.69+/-0.13 lower than this mean value; as a
          consequence,  the  overall  variation  in  the peak flux of the
          radius-expansion  bursts  was a factor of ~2. This variation is
          comparable to the range of the Eddington limit between material
          with solar H-fraction (X=0.7) and pure He. Such a variation may
          arise  if,  for the bright radius-expansion bursts, most of the
          accreted  H  is  eliminated either by steady hot CNO burning or
          expelled  in a radiatively-driven wind. However, steady burning
          cannot  exhaust  the  accreted H for solar composition material
          within  the  typical  ~2  hr  burst recurrence time, nor can it
          result   in   sufficient   elemental  stratification  to  allow
          selective  ejection of the H only. An additional stratification
          mechanism  appears  to  be  required  to  separate the accreted
          elements  and thus allow preferential ejection of the hydrogen.
          We  found  no  evidence for a gap in the peak flux distribution
          between  the  radius-expansion and non-radius expansion bursts,
          previously observed in smaller samples. Assuming that the faint
          radius-expansion  bursts reached the Eddington limit for H-rich
          material (X~0.7), and the brighter bursts the limit for pure He
          (X=0), we estimate the distance to 4U 1636-536 (for a canonical
          neutron  star  with  M_NS=1.4M_sun, R_NS=10 km) to be 6.0+/-0.5
          kpc, or for M_NS=2M_sun at most 7.1 kpc. (Abstract abridged)

          Title:  Detection  of  the  Buried  AGN  in  NGC  6240 with the
          Infrared Spectrograph on The Spitzer Space Telescope

          Comments:  18 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in The
          Astrophysical Journal
          We  present  mid-infrared  spectra of the nearby, Ultraluminous
          Infrared  Galaxy  NGC  6240  taken with the IRS on Spitzer. The
          spectrum  of  NGC  6240  is  dominated by strong fine-structure
          lines,  rotational  H2 lines, and PAH emission features. The H2
          line fluxes suggest molecular gas at a variety of temperatures.
          A  simple  two-temperature  fit  to the S(0) through S(7) lines
          implies  a mass of 6.7E6 solar masses at T=957K and 1.6E9 solar
          masses  at T=164K, or about 15% of the total molecular gas mass
          in  this  system.  Noteably,  we  have  detected the [NeV] 14.3
          micron   emission  line,  with  a  flux  of  5E-14  erg/cm^2/s,
          providing  the  first direct detection of the buried AGN in the
          mid-infrared.   Modelling   of  the  total  SED  from  near  to
          far-infrared  wavelengths  requires  the presence of a hot dust
          (T=700K)  component,  which  we  also associate with the buried
          AGN.  The  small  [NeV]/[NeII]  and  [NeV]/IR  flux ratios, the
          relative  fraction  of  hot dust emission, as well as the large
          6.2  micron  PAH  EQW,  are all consistent with an apparent AGN
          contribution   of  only  3-5%  to  the  bolometric  luminosity.
          However,  correcting  the measured [NeV] flux by the extinction
          implied  by  the  silicate  optical  depth and our SED fitting,
          suggests  an  intrinsic  fractional  AGN  contribution  to  the
          bolometric  luminosity  of about 20-24% in NGC 6240, which lies
          within the range implied by fits to the hard X-ray spectrum.

          Title:  QPO  as  the Rosetta Stone for understanding black hole
          accretion
          Authors: Marek A. Abramowicz
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
          Journal-ref: Astronomische Nachrichten / AN 326, No. 9 (2005)
          Quasi  periodic  oscillations (QPO) seen in the X-ray fluxes of
          individual neutron stars and black hole sources are one of most
          intriguing phenomena in today's astrophysics. The QPO nature is
          visibly  determined by super-strong Einstein's gravity. I argue
          here  that  it also profoundly depends on the MRI turbulence in
          accretion  flows.  Understanding  the QPO physics may therefore
          guide accretion theory out of its present state of confusion.

          Title:  A  prominent  relativistic  iron  line in the Seyfert 1
          MCG-02-14-009
          Authors: Delphine Porquet
          Comments:  Accepted  for  publication,  A&A Letters, 5 pages, 3
          figures, and 1 table
          I  report  the  discovery of a prominent broad and asymmetrical
          feature  near  6.4 keV in the Seyfert 1 MCG-02-14-009 (z=0.028)
          with  XMM-Newton/EPIC.  The present short X-ray observation (PN
          net  exposure  time  ~5  ks)  is  the first one above 2 keV for
          MCG-02-14-009.  The  feature  can  be  explained  by  either  a
          relativistic   iron   line   around   either   a  Schwarzschild
          (non-rotating)  or a Kerr (rotating) black hole. If the feature
          is  a relativistic iron line around a Schwarzschild black hole,
          the  line  energy  is 6.51 (+0.21,-0.12) keV with an equivalent
          width  of  631 (+259,-243) eV and that the inclination angle of
          the   accretion   disc  should  be  less  than  43  degrees.  A
          relativistically  blurred  photoionized disc model gives a very
          good  spectral  fit over the broad band 0.2-12keV energy range.
          The  spectrum  is  reflection dominated and this would indicate
          that  the primary source in MCG-02-14-009 is located very close
          to  the black hole, where gravitational light bending effect is
          important  (about  3-4 Rg), and that the black hole may rapidly
          rotate.

          The  low mass X-ray binary system 4U 1812-12 was monitored with
          the  INTEGRAL  observatory  in  the  period  2003-2004 and with
          BeppoSAX  on April 20, 2000. We report here on the spectral and
          temporal  analysis  of  both persistent and burst emission. The
          full  data  set confirms the persistent nature of this burster,
          and  reveals  the  presence  of  emission  up  to  200 keV. The
          persistent  spectrum  is  well  described  by  a comptonization
          (CompTT)  model plus a soft blackbody component. The source was
          observed  in  a hard spectral state with a 1-200 keV luminosity
          of  2*10^(36)  ergs/s  and  L/LEdd~1%  and  no  meaningful flux
          variation  has  been revealed, as also confirmed by a 2004 RXTE
          observation.  We  have  also  detected  4 bursts showing double
          peaked profiles and blackbody spectra with temperatures ranging
          from 1.9 to 3.1 keV.

          Title:  Evolution  of Massive Blackhole Triples I -- Equal-mass
          binary-single systems
          Authors: Masaki Iwasawa, Yoko Funato, Junichiro Makino
          Comments: 20 pages, 12 figures
          We  present  the  result  of  $N$-body simulations of dynamical
          evolution  of triple massive blackhole (BH) systems in galactic
          nuclei.  We found that in most cases two of the three BHs merge
          through gravitational wave (GW) radiation in the timescale much
          shorter  than the Hubble time, before ejecting one BH through a
          slingshot.  In  order  for a binary BH to merge before ejecting
          out  the third one, it has to become highly eccentric since the
          gravitational  wave  timescale  would  be  much longer than the
          Hubble time unless the eccentricity is very high. We found that
          two  mechanisms  drive  the increase of the eccentricity of the
          binary.   One   is  the  strong  binary-single  BH  interaction
          resulting in the thermalization of the eccentricity. The second
          is  the  Kozai  mechanism which drives the cyclic change of the
          inclination  and  eccentricity  of the inner binary of a stable
          hierarchical  triple  system.  Our  result implies that many of
          supermassive blackholes are binaries.

          Title: Saturn's internal structure and carbon enrichment
          Authors: Olivier Mousis, Yann Alibert, Willy Benz
          Comments: accepted in A&A
          We  use  the clathrate hydrate trapping theory to calculate the
          enrichments  in  O,  N,  S,  Xe, Ar and Kr compared to solar in
          Saturn's  atmosphere.  For  this, we calibrate our calculations
          using  two different carbon abundance determinations that cover
          the  domain  of measurements published in the last decades: one
          derived   from   the   NASA   $Kuiper$   Airborne   Observatory
          measurements and the other obtained from the Cassini spacecraft
          observations.   We   show   that  these  two  different  carbon
          abundances  imply  quite  a  different  minimum  heavy  element
          content  for  Saturn.  Using  the  Kuiper  Airborne Observatory
          measurement  for  calibration,  the  amount of ices accreted by
          Saturn  is  found to be consistent with current interior models
          of   this   planet.  On  the  other  hand,  using  the  Cassini
          measurement  for  calibration  leads  to  an ice content in the
          planet's envelope which is higher than the one derived from the
          interior  models. In this latter case, reconciling the interior
          models  with the amount of C measured by the Cassini spacecraft
          requires  that  significant differential sedimentation of water
          and  volatile  species  have  taken  place in Saturn's interior
          during its lifetime.

          Title:    Models    of   Ultraluminous   X-Ray   Sources   with
          Intermediate-Mass Black Holes
          Authors:  N.  Madhusudhan, S. Justham, L. Nelson, B. Paxton, E.
          Pfahl, Ph. Podsiadlowski, S. Rappaport
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We   have  computed  models  for  ultraluminous  X-ray  sources
          ("ULXs")  consisting  of  a black-hole accretor of intermediate
          mass  ("IMBH"; e.g., ~1000 Msun) and a captured donor star. For
          each of four different sets of initial donor masses and orbital
          separations, we computed 30,000 binary evolution models using a
          full  Henyey  stellar  evolution code. To our knowledge this is
          the  first  time that a population of X-ray binaries this large
          has been carried out with other than approximation methods, and
          it  serves  to  demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to
          large-scale  population  studies  of mass-transfer binaries. In
          the  present  study,  we find that in order to have a plausible
          efficiency  for  producing active ULX systems with IMBHs having
          luminosities   >   10^{40}   ergs/sec,   there  are  two  basic
          requirements  for  the capture of companion/donor stars. First,
          the  donor stars should be massive, i.e., > 8 Msun. Second, the
          initial  orbital  separations, after circularization, should be
          close,  i.e., < 6-30 times the radius of the donor star when on
          the  main  sequence. Even under these optimistic conditions, we
          show  that  the  production  rate  of IMBH-ULX systems may fall
          short of the observed values by factors of 10-100.

          Title:  Discovery  and  disentangling  of  multi-mode delta-Sct
          pulsations in the eclipsing binary V994 Her
          Authors: S. Dallaporta, U. Munari
          Comments: submitted on Oct 27 to IBVS
          Accurate   and  extensive  photoelectric  photometry  has  been
          obtained  of  V994  Her  which  was  discovered as an eclipsing
          binary  by  Hipparcos satellite. A marked pulsation activity is
          evident   in   the   light-curve,   with  periods  0.152100488,
          0.116836079   and   0.09466580  day  that  appears  to  be  the
          contemporanous   presence  of  fundamental,  first  and  second
          overtone  periods  of  a  multi-mode  delta-Sct  pulsation. The
          latter is observed to remain stable in amplitude and phase over
          the whole observaing campaign that lasted between June 10, 2002

          Title:  Entropy  Profiles in the Cores of Cooling Flow Clusters
          of Galaxies
          Authors: Megan Donahue, Donald J. Horner, Kenneth W. Cavagnolo,
          G. Mark Voit
          Comments:  4 figures, as submitted to the Astrophysical Journal
          (except for a typo correction in the abstract)
          The  X-ray  properties  of  a  relaxed  cluster of galaxies are
          determined  primarily  by  its gravitational potential well and
          the  entropy distribution of its intracluster gas. That entropy
          distribution reflects both the accretion history of the cluster
          and  the  feedback  processes  which  limit the condensation of
          intracluster  gas.  Here we present Chandra observations of the
          core  entropy  profiles of nine classic "cooling-flow" clusters
          that appear relaxed and contain intracluster gas with a cooling
          time  less  than  a  Hubble  time.  We  show that those entropy
          profiles  are  remarkably  similar,  despite  the fact that the
          clusters  range  over  a  factor  of three in temperature. They
          typically  have  an  entropy level of ~ 130 keV cm^2 at 100 kpc
          that  declines  to  a  plateau ~10 keV cm^2 at \lesssim 10 kpc.
          Between  these  radii, the entropy profiles are \propto r^alpha
          with  alpha ~ 1.0 - 1.3. The non-zero central entropy levels in
          these   clusters   correspond  to  a  cooling  time  ~10^8  yr,
          suggesting  that  episodic  heating on this timescale maintains
          the central entropy profile in a quasi-steady state.

          Title: Lithium isotopes in population II dwarfs
          Authors: Laurent Piau
          Comments: 18 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables
          We  investigate  the history of $^6$Li and $^7$Li in population
          II  dwarfs  during the pre main sequence and main sequence. The
          evolution  is  followed  using  the  CESAM code and taking into
          account  the  most  recent  physics.  The effective temperature
          ranges  from $\approx$ 4700 K to $\approx$ 6400 K and therefore
          concerns  objects on the so-called Spite plateau and cooler. We
          find  the  $^7$Li  pre  main  sequence  depletion  is unable to
          account for the observations in the halo whatever the effective
          temperature.   This   supports  microscopic  diffusion  and  an
          additional  non  standard mixing process both acting during the
          main  sequence.  On  the  contrary  the  models $^6$Li pre main
          sequence   depletion  appears  too  strong  and  is  marginally
          compatible with recent detections.
          During the main sequence we introduce the effects of tachocline
          diffusion.  This  process  is  a  rotationnally  induced mixing
          acting  at  the  top  of  the  radiative core. We show that the
          differences  in  the  early  rotation  history cannot result in
          scattered lithium abundances on the Spite plateau. Moreover the
          tachocline  mixing  process  predicts $^7$Li abundances in good
          agreement   with  the  observations.  We  briefly  address  the
          question  of  turn off $^7$Li poor stars. A modest accretion of
          lithium  free  matter  would  be  enough  to  explain their low
          abundance in this element.
          We  expect  the  scatter  in $^7$Li abundances is correlated to
          variations  in  [Fe/O]  ratio  for  dwarfs  cooler than 5500 K.
          Finally  the  tachocline  mixing  is robust with respect to the
          recent  $^6$Li  observations  around the turn-off. We similarly
          suggest  the [Fe/O] should be higher in objects with $^6$Li and
          effective temperature below 6000 K.

          Many  EHB stars have been found in short-period binaries, where
          the companions in these post-common envelope systems are either
          white  dwarfs  or dM stars; these systems are catalogued as hot
          subdwarfs  because the subdwarf is the more luminous component.
          Hypothesized  Roche-lobe  overflow  systems  (with more massive
          companions) may largely be uncatalogued, since the G band or Ca
          II  K-line  from  the  companion  may  have  caused  them to be
          overlooked  or discarded. In particular, many candidate objects
          were excluded from the PG catalog because of such spectroscopic
          indicators.  Could  these  rejects  include  large  numbers  of
          "missing"  hot  subdwarfs?  We  have  examined 2MASS, SDSS, and
          GALEX  archival data for large subsets of these rejected stars,
          and conclude that only a handful (about 3%) show indications of
          binarity; most are consistent with (single) metal-poor F stars,
          as was originally supposed.

          Astronomy
          We  present  the results of a study of the late-type companions
          in  hot  subdwarf composite spectrum binaries. The exact nature
          of   these  late-type  companions  has  been  disputed  in  the
          literature -- some argue that they are main sequence stars, and
          others  have  claimed  they  are  subgiants.  To  determine the
          properties  of  the  late-type companions, we first conducted a
          survey  utilizing the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) All-Sky
          Data  Release Catalog to identify composite-colored binaries in
          the  "Catalogue  of Spectroscopically Identified Hot Subdwarfs"
          (Kilkenny,  Heber,  & Drilling 1988, 1992). We then conducted a
          spectroscopic    study   of   a   sub-sample   of   the   2MASS
          composite-colored   hot   subdwarfs.  The  sample  consists  of
          photometrically  and spectroscopically single and composite hot
          subdwarfs  (14  single  and  51  composite).  We  also obtained
          spectra  of 59 single late-type stars with Hipparcos parallaxes
          for calibration. We used measured equivalent width (EW) indices
          from  the  composite  systems  to  estimate the temperature and
          gravity of the late-type star, taking into account the dilution
          of  its  spectral  features  by  light  from  the hot subdwarf.
          Results from combining the spectroscopic data with model energy
          distributions   indicate   that  the  late-type  companions  in
          composite-spectrum  systems are best described by main sequence
          companions overall.

          Comments: 29 pages
          Subj-class: Mathematical Physics
          In  many  situations,  one  can  approximate  the behavior of a
          quantum  system,  i.e.  a  wave  function  subject to a partial
          differential  equation,  by effective classical equations which
          are  ordinary  differential  equations.  A  general  method and
          geometrical  picture  is  developed  and  shown  to  agree with
          effective   action   results,  commonly  derived  through  path
          integration,  for  perturbations  around  a harmonic oscillator
          ground  state.  The same methods are used to describe dynamical
          coherent states, which in turn provide means to compute quantum
          corrections to the symplectic structure of an effective system.

          Title:  Wind  accretion in the massive X-ray binary 4U 2206+54:
          abnormally slow wind and moderately eccentric orbit
          Authors:  M.  Ribo,  I.  Negueruela, P. Blay, J.M. Torrejon, P.
          Reig
          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A
          Massive  X-ray binaries are usually classified depending on the
          properties  of  the  donor star in classical, supergiant and Be
          X-ray  binaries.  The  massive X-ray binary 4U 2206+54 does not
          fit  in  any  of these groups, and deserves a detailed study to
          understand  how  the transfer of matter and the accretion on to
          the  compact  object  take  place.  To this end we study an IUE
          spectrum  of  the  donor  and  obtain  a wind terminal velocity
          (v_inf) of ~350 km/s, which is abnormally slow for its spectral
          type.  We  also  analyse  here  more  than 9 years of available
          RXTE/ASM  data. We study the long-term X-ray variability of the
          source  and  find  it  to  be  similar  to that observed in the
          wind-fed  supergiant system Vela X-1, reinforcing the idea that
          4U  2206+54  is  also a wind-fed system. We find a quasi-period
          decreasing  from  ~270 to ~130 d, noticed in previous works but
          never  studied  in  detail.  We  discuss possible scenarios and
          conclude   that  long-term  quasi-periodic  variations  in  the
          mass-loss  rate  of  the  primary  are  probably  driving  such
          variability  in  the measured X-ray flux. We obtain an improved
          orbital  period  of  9.5591  d  with  maximum X-ray flux at MJD
          51856.6.  Our  study  of  the  orbital X-ray variability in the
          context  of  wind  accretion  suggests  a moderate eccentricity
          around  0.15.  Moreover,  the  low  value  of  v_inf solves the
          long-standing  problem  of the relatively high X-ray luminosity
          for  the  unevolved  nature of the donor, BD +53 2790, which is
          probably  an  O9.5 V star. We note that changes in v_inf and/or
          the  mass-loss  rate  of  the  primary alone cannot explain the
          diferent  patterns  displayed by the orbital X-ray variability.
          We  finally  emphasize  that 4U 2206+54, together with LS 5039,
          could  be  part of a new population of wind-fed HMXBs with main
          sequence  donors,  the  natural progenitors of supergiant X-ray
          binaries. (Abridged)

          We  present  optical  long-slit  spectra  of  the  Virgo  dwarf
          elliptical   galaxy  VCC  510  at  high  spectral  and  spatial
          resolution. Heliocentric velocities and velocity dispersions as
          functions   of   galaxy  radius  are  derived  by  deconvolving
          line-of-sight   velocity   distributions.  A  maximum  rotation
          v_rot=8  km/s  inside  half the effective radius (re~20 arcsec)
          and a mean, radially flat velocity dispersion sigma=44 km/s are
          measured.  The core extending over the inner 2 arcsec (~140 pc)
          is  found  to  rotate  in the opposite sense with v_rot(core) ~
          -1/2  v_rot.  VCC  510  (M_B  ~  -15.7) is therefore by far the
          faintest  and  smallest  galaxy  with  a  counter-rotating core
          known.  From the main body rotation and the velocity dispersion
          profile  we  deduce that VCC 510 is anisotropic and clearly not
          entirely   supported   by   rotation.  By  comparison  of  Lick
          absorption-line  indices  with  stellar  population  models  we
          derive  an  old  luminosity-weighted age (10 Gyr) and sub-solar
          metallicity  ([Z/H]=-0.4) inside the effective radius. There is
          tentative  evidence  that  the  counter-rotating  core might be
          younger and less alpha/Fe enhanced. From the stellar population
          parameters  we  obtain  a  total stellar mass-to-light ratio of
          ~3.6  (M/L_B)_sun  which  is  significantly  lower than a rough
          dynamical  estimate  obtained  from  the kinematics through the
          virial   theorem  (~15).  This  discrepancy  hints  toward  the
          possible  presence  of dark matter in the centre of VCC 510. We
          discuss  the  origin  of  the counter-rotating core and exclude
          fly-by  encounters  as  a  viable possibility. Gas accretion or
          galaxy  merging  provide  more  likely explanations. VCC 510 is
          therefore the direct observational evidence that such processes
          do occur in cluster satellite galaxies on dwarf galaxy scales.

          Title:  The  Highest Dynamical Frequency in the Inner Region of
          an Accretion Disk
          Authors:  M.  Ali Alpar (Sabanci University), Dimitrios Psaltis
          (U. of Arizona)
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJ Letters
          In the inner regions of accretion disks around compact objects,
          the  orbital  frequency  of  the  gas  deviates  from the local
          Keplerian  value. For long-wavelength modes in this region, the
          radial  epicyclic  frequency kappa is higher than the azimuthal
          frequency  Omega.  This has significant implications for models
          of the twin kHz QPOs observed in many neutron-star sources that
          traditionally identify the frequencies of the two kHz QPOs with
          dynamical  frequencies  in  the accretion disk. The recognition
          that the highest frequency in the transition or boundary region
          of  the  disk is actually the epicyclic frequency also modifies
          significantly  the  constraints  imposed  by the observation of
          high-frequency  QPOs  on  the  mass  and  radius of the compact
          objects.

          Astrophysical Journal
          We  present  a photometric search for objects with point-source
          components   that  are  optically  variable  on  timescales  of
          weeks--months   in  the  Hubble  Ultra  Deep  Field  (HUDF)  to
          i'(AB)=28.0  mag.  The  data  are split into four sub-stacks of
          approximately  equal  exposure  times.  Objects  exhibiting the
          signature  of  optical variability are selected by studying the
          photometric  error  distribution  between  the  four  different
          epochs, and selecting 622 candidates as 3.0 sigma outliers from
          the original catalog of 4644 objects. Of these, 45 are visually
          confirmed  as  free  of  contamination  from close neighbors or
          various  types of image defects. Four lie within the positional
          error  boxes  of  Chandra  X-ray  sources, and two of these are
          spectroscopically   confirmed  AGN.  The  photometric  redshift
          distribution  of  the  selected  variable sample is compared to
          that of field galaxies, and we find that a constant fraction of
          ~1%  of  all  field  objects show variability over the range of
          0.1<z<4.5.  Combined with other recent HUDF results, as well as
          those  of  recent  state-of-the-art  numerical  simulations, we
          discuss  a  potential  link between the hierarchical merging of
          galaxies and the growth of AGN.

          Title:  First  Detection of PAHs and Warm Molecular Hydrogen in
          Tidal Dwarf Galaxies
          Authors: S. J. U. Higdon, J. L. Higdon, J. Marshall
          Comments: Accepted ApJ. 30 pages 14 figures
          We  observed  two  faint tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs), NGC 5291N
          and  NGC  5291  S with the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer
          Space   Telescope.   We   detect   strong  polycyclic  aromatic
          hydrocarbon  (PAH)  emission,  which  match models of groups of
          \~100 carbon atoms with an equal mixture of neutral and ionized
          PAHs.  The  TDGs  have a dominant warm ~140 K dust component in
          marked  contrast to the cooler, 40-60 K dust found in starburst
          galaxies.  For  the  first  time we detect the low-J rotational
          lines  from  molecular  hydrogen.  Adopting  LTE there is ~10^5
          solar  masses  of  ~400  K gas, which is <0.1 % of the cold gas
          mass.  The  combination  of  one-third solar metallicity with a
          recent, <5 million year, epsiode of star formation is reflected
          in  the  S and Ne ratios. The excitation is higher than typical
          values  for  starburst  galaxies  and  similar to that found in
          BCDs.  Using the Infared Array Camera we identify an additional
          13  PAH-rich  candidate  TDGs.  These sources occupy a distinct
          region of IRAC color space with [3.6] - [4.5] < 0.4 and [4.5] -
          [8.0]  >  3.2. NGC 5291 N and S have stellar masses of (1.5 and
          3.0)  10^8  solar  masses,  which  is  comparable to BCDs. This
          system appears to be a remarkable TDG nursery.

          Astrophysical Journal
          In  the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) an abundance of galaxies
          is  seen  with  a  knot  at  one  end  plus  an  extended tail,
          resembling   a   tadpole.   These   "tadpole  galaxies"  appear
          dynamically   unrelaxed--presumably   in   an   early   merging
          state--where  tidal  interactions  likely created the distorted
          knot-plus-tail   morphology.   Here  we  systematically  select
          tadpole  galaxies from the HUDF and study their properties as a
          function  of  their  photometric redshifts. In a companion HUDF
          variability  study,  Cohen et al. (2005) revealed a total of 45
          variable  objects  believed to be Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
          Here we show that this faint AGN sample has no overlap with the
          tadpole  galaxy  sample,  as predicted by theoretical work. The
          tadpole  morphology--combined with the lack of overlap with the
          variable  objects--supports the idea that these galaxies are in
          the  process  of  an early-stage merger event, i.e., at a stage
          that likely precedes the "turn-on" of any AGN component and the
          onset of any point-source variability.

          Title:  Connecting  Dense  Gas Tracers of Star Formation in our

          Authors:  Jingwen  Wu,  Neal  J.  Evans  II,  Yu Gao, Philip M.
          Solomon, Yancy L. Shirley, Paul A. Vanden Bout
          Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures. In press for ApJ Letters
          Observations have revealed prodigious amounts of star formation
          in starburst galaxies as traced by dust and molecular emission,
          even at large redshifts. Recent work shows that for both nearby
          spiral   galaxies  and  distant  starbursts,  the  global  star
          formation  rate, as indicated by the infrared luminosity, has a
          tight  and  almost  linear correlation with the amount of dense
          gas as traced by the luminosity of HCN. Our surveys of Galactic
          dense  cores  in  HCN  1-0  emission show that this correlation
          continues  to  a much smaller scale, with nearly the same ratio
          of  infrared luminosity to HCN luminosity found over 7-8 orders
          of magnitude in L_IR, with a lower cutoff around 10^{4.5} L_sun
          of infrared luminosity. The linear correlation suggests that we
          may  understand  distant  star  formation in terms of the known
          properties  of local star-forming regions. Both the correlation
          and the luminosity cutoff can be explained if the basic unit of
          star  formation  in  galaxies is a dense core, similar to those
          studied in our Galaxy.

          We present long-slit H- and K-band spectroscopy of the low-mass
          outflow  source  SVS  13,  obtained  with  the  adaptive-optics
          assisted  imager-spectrometer  NACO  on the VLT. With a spatial
          resolution  of  < 0.25 arcsec and a pixel scale of 0.027 arcsec
          we  precisely establish the relative offsets of H2, [FeII], CO,
          HI  and  NaI  components  from the source continuum. The H2 and
          [FeII] peaks are clearly associated with the jet, while the CO,
          HI  and  NaI peaks are spatially unresolved and coincident with
          the  source,  as  is  expected  for  emission  associated  with
          accretion  processes. The H2 profile along the slit is resolved
          into   multiple  components,  which  increase  in  size  though
          decrease in intensity with distance from the source. This trend
          might  be  consistent  with thermal expansion of packets of gas
          ejected during periods of increased accretion activity. Indeed,
          for  the  brightest component nearest the source, proper motion
          measurements   indicate   a   tangential   velocity   of  0.028
          arcsec/year.  It  therefore  seems  unlikely that this emission
          peak  is  associated  with a stationary zone of warm gas at the
          base  of  the  jet.  However,  the same can not be said for the
          [FeII]  peak, for which we see no evidence for motion downwind,
          even  though  radial  velocity  measurements  indicate that the
          emission is associated with higher jet velocities. We postulate
          that the [FeII] could be associated with a collimation shock at
          the base of the jet.

          Astrofisica de Canarias, Tenerife)
          Comments:  23  pages,  20  figures. Accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We  describe  improved  modelling  of the emission by dust in a
          toroidal--like  structure  heated  by  a  central  illuminating
          source  within  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We chose a simple
          but  realistic  torus geometry, a flared disc, and a dust grain
          distribution  function  including  a full range of grain sizes.
          The optical depth within the torus is computed in detail taking
          into  account  the  different  sublimation  temperatures of the
          silicate  and graphite grains, which solves previously reported
          inconsistencies in the silicate emission feature in type-1 AGN.
          We   exploit   this   model   to   study  the  spectral  energy
          distributions  (SEDs)  of  58  extragalactic  (both  type-1 and
          type-2)  sources using archival optical and infrared (IR) data.
          We  find  that  both  AGN and starburst contributions are often
          required  to  reproduce  the  observed  SEDs, although in a few
          cases  they  are  very well fitted by a pure AGN component. The
          AGN contribution to the far-IR luminosity is found to be higher
          in  type-1 sources, with all the type-2 requiring a substantial
          contribution  from  a  circum-nuclear  starburst.  Our  results
          appear  in  agreement  with  the  AGN Unified Scheme, since the
          distributions of key parameters of the torus models turn out to
          be compatible for type-1 and type-2 AGN. Further support to the
          unification     concept     comes    from    comparison    with
          medium-resolution  IR  spectra  of  type-1  AGN  by the Spitzer

          We  report  on observations of the X-ray pulsar IGR J16320-4751
          (a.k.a. AX J1631.9-4752) performed simultaneously with INTEGRAL
          and  XMM-Newton. We refine the source position and identify the
          most  likely  infrared  counterpart.  Our simultaneous coverage
          allows  us to confirm the presence of X-ray pulsations at ~1300
          s,  that  we  detect  above  20 keV with INTEGRAL for the first
          time. The pulse fraction is consistent with being constant with
          energy,  which is compatible with a model of polar accretion by
          a  pulsar.  We study the spectral properties of IGR J16320-4751
          during  two  major  periods  occurring  during the simultaneous
          coverage  with  both satellites, namely a flare and a non-flare
          period. We detect the presence of a narrow 6.4 keV iron line in
          both  periods.  The  presence  of  such a feature is typical of
          supergiant  wind  accretors  such  as  Vela X-1 or GX 301-2. We
          inspect the spectral variations with respect to the pulse phase
          during  the non-flare period, and show that the pulse is solely
          due  to  variations of the X-ray flux emitted by the source and
          not to variations of the spectral parameters.
          Our  results  are  therefore compatible with the source being a
          pulsar  in  a  High  Mass X-ray Binary. We detect a soft excess
          appearing  in  the spectra as a blackbody with a temperature of
          ~0.07  keV.  We discuss the origin of the X-ray emission in IGR
          J16320-4751:  while  the  hard  X-rays are likely the result of
          Compton  emission produced in the close vicinity of the pulsar,
          based  on  energy  argument  we suggest that the soft excess is
          likely the emission by a collisionally energised cloud in which
          the compact object is embedded.

          Title:  Masses  and  Radii  of  Low-Mass  Stars:  Theory versus
          Observations
          Authors: Ignasi Ribas (CSIC, IEEC, Spain)
          Comments:  8 pages, 1 figure, proceedings of the meeting "Close
          Binaries in the 21st Century"
          Eclipsing  binaries  with  M-type  components  are  still  rare
          objects.  Strong observational biases have made that today only
          a  few  eclipsing binaries with component masses below 0.6 Msun
          and  well-determined fundamental properties are known. However,
          even  in  these  small  numbers  the detailed comparison of the
          observed  masses  and  radii  with  theoretical predictions has
          revealed  large  disagreements.  Current models seem to predict
          radii  of  stars  in  the  0.4-0.8  Msun range to be some 5-15%
          smaller than observed. Given the high accuracy of the empirical
          measurements  (a  few  percent  in both mass and radius), these
          differences   are   highly   significant.   I  review  all  the
          observational  evidence  on  the properties of M-type stars and
          discuss  a  possible  scenario  based  on  stellar  activity to
          explain the observed discrepancies.

          Conference on "Astrophysics of Variable Stars"
          Binary  systems  have  long  been  recognized  as the source of
          powerful astrophysical diagnostics. Among the many applications
          of  binary  stars,  they  have  been  used as probes of stellar
          structure  and evolution (both of single and binary stars) in a
          broad  range  of  masses,  evolutionary  stages,  and  chemical
          compositions,  and as indicators of distance and time. With the
          numerous   ongoing   photometric  surveys  and  upcoming  space
          astrometry  and  photometry  missions,  the  future of binaries
          looks    bright.   The   various   aspects   of   binaries   as
          astrophysically  useful  laboratories  are  reviewed here, with
          emphasis   on   the   currently   open  problems  and  research
          opportunities.

          We  use  the  very deep XMM-Newton observations in the CDF-S to
          measure  the  distribution of absorption in the AGN population.
          We describe the Monte Carlo method used to unveil the intrinsic
          properties of the AGN using their multi-band X-ray colours. The
          measured  distribution  of  AGN  in  z,  L_X  and  N_H space is
          compared  with  the distributions predicted by a number of XLFs
          and  absorption models. In contrast to other studies, we do not
          find any evidence that the absorption distribution is dependent
          on redshift or intrinsic luminosity.

          In  the  recent  literature  on AGNs it has been often reported
          that  spectra  of  Seyfert  1 Galaxies show resonant absorption
          lines  of  Fe  K  which  are  redshifted  from  the  rest frame
          position. Such lines are often found with marginal significance
          but,  if  real,  could potentially open up new avenues to study
          the circumnuclear gas in the black hole environment. It is also
          extremely important to take them into account in X-ray spectral
          analysis  because  of  the  influence  they have in the correct
          estimation  of  spectral parameters, Fe K alpha line in primis.
          An XMM-Newton observation of Mrk 335 is reported here as a case
          study: a narrow feature has been detected at 5.9 keV, i.e. with
          a   redshift   corresponding  to  a  velocity  of  v  ~  0.15c.
          Preliminary  results  on the statistical significance of narrow
          absorption  and  emission lines in a sample of PG QSOs observed
          by XMM-Newton are also included.

          Metallicity:  Mass Loss, Explosions, Cosmology, Lamers, Langer,
          Nugis, Annuk (eds.), ASP Conf. Ser
          At  very  low metallicity, the effects of differential rotation
          have  a more important impact on the evolution of stars than at
          high  metallicity. Rotational mixing leads to the production of
          great  quantities  of helium and of primary $^{14}$N by massive
          stars. Rotation induces important mass loss and allows stars to
          locally   strongly   enrich  the  interstellar  medium  in  CNO
          elements. Stars formed from interstellar clouds enriched by the
          winds  of  fast  rotating  massive  stars would present surface
          abundances  similar  to  those  of  C-rich extremely metal-poor
          stars.  C-rich  stars can also be formed by mass accretion in a
          binary  system  where  the  primary  would  be  a fast rotating
          intermediate  mass  star  in the early-AGB phase. Fast rotation
          may  also  lead to the formation of collapsars even at very low
          metallicity  and  make  the  most  massive stars avoid the pair
          instability.

          Gamma  ray bursts (GRBs) belong to the most energetic events in
          the  Universe.  Recently,  the  extragalactic  nature  of these
          sources  has  been confirmed with the discovery of several host
          galaxies  (HGs)  and  the  measurement  of  their redshifts. To
          explain  the  origin of GRBs several models have been proposed,
          among   which  the  coalescence  of  compact  objects  and  the
          hypernova (or collapsar) scenarios are the most representative,
          being  the collapsar model one of the most accepted nowadays. A
          natural  consequence  of  the  collapsar model is that the GRBs
          would trace the star formation rate (SFR) of their HGs. In this
          contributed   paper  we  present  preliminary  results  of  the
          development  of  a  Montecarlo-based  model for hypernova event
          formation    which    is   coupled   to   chemical-cosmological
          simulations, with the aim at studying the GRB relationship with
          the  SFR  cosmic  history  and the properties of their HGs in a
          hierarchical scenario.

          The  most precise measurements are done at present by timing of
          radiopulsars  in  binary  systems  with  two neutron stars. The
          timing  measurements  of  the Taylor-Hulse pulsar give the most
          precise  results on testing of general relativity (GR), finding
          implicit  proof  of  existence  of gravitational waves. We show
          that   the   existing   measurements,  used  for  checking  the
          variability  of the fundamental constants, give the upper limit
          for   the   variation  of  the  gravitational  constant  ${\dot
          G}/{G}=(4.3\pm   4.9)\cdot   10^{-12}$   year{$^{-1}$}.  Timing
          measurements  of  the  binary  pulsar  J0737-3039  undoubtfully
          should give more precise results in the nearest future.

          Title: An Explanation for the soft X-ray excess in AGN
          Authors: J Crummy, AC Fabian, L Gallo, RR Ross
          Comments: 16 pages, MNRAS accepted
          We  present  a  large  sample  of type 1 active galactic nuclei
          (AGN) spectra taken with XMM-Newton, and fit them with both the
          conventional  model  (a  power  law  and  black  body)  and the
          relativistically-blurred  photoionized disc reflection model of
          Ross  and Fabian (2005). We find the disc reflection model is a
          better  fit.  The disc reflection model successfully reproduces
          the  continuum  shape,  including  the  soft excess, of all the
          sources.  The  model  also  reproduces many features that would
          conventionally  be interpreted as absorption edges. We are able
          to  use  the  model  to  infer  the  properties of the sources;
          specifically that the majority of black holes in the sample are
          strongly  rotating  and that there is a deficit in sources with
          an  inclination  >  70  degrees.  We  conclude  that  the  disc
          reflection model is an important tool in the study of AGN X-ray
          spectra.

          We  report  the first significant detection of an X-ray cluster
          associated  with  a  powerful (L(bol) ~1e47 erg/sec) radio-loud
          quasar  at  high  redshift  (z=1.06). Diffuse X-ray emission is
          detected  out  to ~120 kpc from the CSS quasar 3C 186. A strong
          Fe-line  emission  at  the  z(rest)=1.06  confirms  its thermal
          nature.   We   find   that  the  CSS  radio  source  is  highly
          overpressured  with  respect  to  the thermal cluster medium by
          ~2-3  orders  of  magnitude. This provides direct observational
          evidence  that  the  radio  source is not thermally confined as
          posited   in  the  ``frustrated''  scenario  for  CSS  sources.
          Instead, the radio source may be young and at an early stage of
          its  evolution. This source provides the first detection of the
          AGN  in  outburst  in  the  center  of  a cooling flow cluster.
          Powerful  radio  sources  are  thought  to  be triggered by the
          cooling   flows.   The   evidence  for  the  AGN  activity  and
          intermittent  outbursts  comes from the X-ray morphology of low
          redshift  clusters, which usually do not harbour quasars. 3C186
          is a young active radio source which can supply the energy into
          the  cluster  and  potentially  prevent its cooling. We discuss
          energetics  related  to  the  quasar  activity  and the cluster
          cooling  flow, and possible feedback between the evolving radio
          source and the cluster.

          Comments:   30  pages,  12  figures,  6  tables,  accepted  for
          publication in the Astronomical Journal
          We  present  new  radial  velocity results for 178 stars in the
          Fornax  dwarf  spheroidal  galaxy,  of  which  at least 158 are
          probable  Fornax  members. We combine with previously published
          data  to  obtain  a  radial  velocity sample with 209 stars, of
          which  at  least 179 are probable Fornax members. We detect the
          hint  of  rotation  about  an  axis near Fornax's morphological
          minor  axis,  though the significance of the rotation signal in
          the Galactocentric rest frame is sensitive to the adopted value
          of  Fornax's  proper  motion.  Regardless, the observed stellar
          kinematics  are dominated by random motions, and we do not find
          kinematic  evidence of tidal disruption. The projected velocity
          dispersion  profile of the binned dataset remains flat over the
          sampled  region,  which  reaches a maximum angular radius of 65
          arcmin.  Single-component  King  models  in  which mass follows
          light  fail  to reproduce the observed flatness of the velocity
          dispersion  profile.  Two-component (luminous plus dark matter)
          models  can  reproduce  the  data,  provided the dark component
          extends  sufficiently  beyond  the  luminous component, and the
          central dark matter density is of the same order as the central
          luminous  density.  These  requirements suggest a more massive,
          darker   Fornax   than   standard  core-fitting  analyses  have
          previously  concluded,  with  M/L_V  over  the  sampled  region
          reaching 10 to 40 times the M/L_V of the luminous component. We
          also   apply   a   non-parametric  mass  estimation  technique,
          introduced  in  a  companion  paper.  Though  it is designed to
          operate  on  datasets  containing velocities for $>$1000 stars,
          the estimation yields preliminary results suggesting M/L_V ~ 15
          inside r < 1.5 kpc.

          period,  have  been  found  during the superoutburst and may be
          positive  superhumps.  A  maximum  trough-to-peak  amplitude of
          around 0.3 magnitude is determined for this superhump.
          The  spectra  show  broad,  absorption-line profiles. The lines
          display  blue  and  red  troughs  which alternate in depth. The
          radial  velocity  curve of the absorption wings of H$\beta$ has
          an  amplitude  of  $40\pm11$  km s$^{-1}$ and a phase offset of
          $0.12\pm0.03$.  The  $\gamma$ velocity of the binary is $3\pm9$
          km  s$^{-1}$  and varies on an order of 50 km s$^{-1}$ from day
          to  day. From another clear evidence for a precessing eccentric
          disk,   we  obtain  a  solution  to  an  eccentric  outer  disk
          consistent  with  theoretical  works,  which  demonstrates  the
          validity  of the relation between superhumps and tidal effects.
          The  inner  part  of the disk is also eccentric as evidenced by
          asymmetric  and  symmetric  wings  in the lines. Therefore, the
          whole  disk is eccentric and the variation of $\gamma$ velocity
          and   the   evolutionary  asymmetric  line  profiles  could  be
          criterions for an precessing eccentric accretion disk.

          Title: X-ray source populations in galaxies
          Authors: G. Fabbiano
          Comments: 40 pages. This is a review submitted to Annual Review
          of  Astronomy  &  Astrophysics Comments are welcome and will be
          considered in a revised version
          Today's sensitive, high-resolution X-ray observations allow the
          study  of populations of X-ray sources, in the luminosity range
          of  Galactic  X-ray  binaries,  in galaxies as distant as 20-30
          Mpc. The traditional astronomical tools of photometric diagrams
          and  luminosity functions are now applied to these populations,
          providing  a  direct  probe  of the evolved binary component of
          different   stellar   populations.   The  study  of  the  X-ray
          populations of E and S0 galaxies has revamped the debate on the
          formation  and evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and
          on  the  role  of  globular  clusters in these processes. While
          overall stellar mass drives the amount of X-ray binaries in old
          stellar  populations,  the  amount  of  sources in star forming
          galaxies  is  related  to the star formation rate. Short-lived,
          luminous,  high-mass  binaries  (HMXBs)  dominate  these  young
          populations. The most luminous sources in these systems are the
          debated  ULXs,  which  have been suggested to be ~100-1000 Msol
          black  holes,  but  could  alternatively  include  a  number of
          binaries  with stellar mass black holes. Very soft sources have
          also  been  discovered  in  many  galaxies  and their nature is
          currently  being  debated.  Observations of the deep X-ray sky,
          and  comparison  with  deep  optical surveys, are providing the
          first evidence of the X-ray evolution of galaxies.

          Title:  Circular  Polarimetry  and  the Line of Sight to the BN
          Object
          Authors: D.K. Aitken, J.H. Hough, A. Chrysostomou
          Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures, accepted for MNRAS
          The  3.1  micron  absorption  feature  of  water-ice  has  been
          observed  spectroscopically  in many molecular clouds and, when
          it  has been observed spectropolarimetrically, usually a corre-
          sponding  polarization  feature  is  seen.  Typically  on these
          occasions,  and  particularly  for  the  BN  object, a distinct
          position angle shift between the feature and continuum is seen,
          which  indicates both a fractionation of the icy material and a
          changing alignment direction along the line of sight.
          Here  the  dependence  of circular polarimetry on fractionation
          along  the  line  of sight is investigated and it is shown that
          the  form  of  its  spectrum,  together  with  the  sign of the
          position  angle  shift, indicates where along the line of sight
          the  icy material lies. More specifically a coincidence between
          the sign of the position angle displacement in the ice feature,
          measured   north   through  east,  and  that  of  the  circular
          polarization ice feature means that the icy grains are overlaid
          by bare grains. Some preliminary circular polarimetry of BN has
          this  characteristic  and  a  similar situation is found in the
          only  two  other  cases  for which relevant observations so far
          exist.

          Title: The faintest accretors
          Authors: Andrew King, Rudy Wijnands
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS Letter
          Recent  X-ray  observations have detected a class of very faint
          X-ray   transients  in  the  Galaxy  which  probably  reveal  a
          previously  unrecognised  type of accretion on to neutron stars
          or  black  holes.  We  show  that  these  systems  cannot  have
          descended  from binaries with stellar-mass components of normal
          composition.   Accretion  of  hydrogen-depleted  matter  on  to
          stellar-mass  black  holes  can account for individual systems,
          but requires that these transients should be observed to repeat
          within  a  few  years,  and  does  not explain why the class is
          distinctly faint.
          Two  other explanations appear to be quite natural. One invokes
          accretion  by  neutron  stars  or stellar-mass black holes from
          companions  which were already brown dwarfs or planets when the
          systems formed, i.e. which did not descend from low-mass stars.
          The  other  possibility is that these systems are the endpoints
          of  primordial (zero-metallicity) binaries in which the primary
          was  extremely massive, and collapsed to a black hole of mass >
          1000  solar masses. The (primordial) companion must by now have
          reached  an  extremely  low  mass  (<  0.01  solar mass) and be
          transferring  mass  at  a very low rate to the black hole. This
          picture  avoids  the  main  difficulty  encountered  by  models
          invoking    intermediate-mass    black    hole   formation   at
          non-primordial  metallicities,  and is a natural consequence of
          some current ideas about Population III star formation.

          Title: The maximum contribution to reionization from metal-free
          stars
          Authors:   Jose   M.   Rozas,   Jordi   Miralda-Escude,  Eduard
          Salvador-Sole
          Comments: 34 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  estimate  the maximum contribution to reionization from the
          first generation of massive stars, with zero metallicity, under
          the  assumption that one of these stars forms with a fixed mass
          in  every  collapsed  halo  in  which metal-free gas is able to
          cool.  We  assume  that  any  halo  that  has already had stars
          previously  formed  in  one of their halo progenitors will form
          only  stars  with  metals,  which are assigned an emissivity of
          ionizing  radiation  equal  to  that determined at z=4 from the
          measured  intensity  of the ionizing background. We examine the
          impact  of molecular hydrogen photodissociation (which tends to
          reduce  cooling when a photodissociating background is produced
          by  the  first  stars)  and X-Ray photoheating (which heats the
          atomic  medium,  raising  the  entropy  of  the  gas  before it
          collapses  into  halos). We find that in the CDM$\Lambda$ model
          supported   by  present  observations,  and  even  assuming  no
          negative  feedbacks  for  the  formation of metal-free stars, a
          reionized  mass  fraction  of 50% is not reached until redshift
          $z\sim  12$.  The  combination of ordinary metal-enriched stars
          and  early  metal-free  stars  can yield a CMB optical depth to
          electron  scattering  of  at  most  0.13.  The  contribution of
          metal-free  stars to the present Cosmic Infrarred Background is
          negligibly small.

          Comments: 17 pages, 4 figures; ApJ, in press
          We  report  identification of the radio loud narrow-line quasar
          SDSS  J172206.03+565451.6  which  we  found  in the course of a
          search for radio loud narrow-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
          SDSSJ172206.03+565451.6  is  only  the ~4th securely identified
          radio loud narrow-line quasar and the second-most radio loudest
          with a radio index R_1.4 ~ 100-700. Its black hole mass, M_BH =
          (2-3)  10^7 M_sun, is unusually small given its radio loudness,
          and   the   combination   of   mass   and   radio   index  puts
          SDSSJ172206.03+565451.6  in  a  scarcely  populated  region  of
          M_BH-R   diagrams.   SDSSJ172206.03+565451.6   is  a  classical
          Narrow-Line  Seyfert1-type  object with FWHM_Hbeta = 1490 km/s,
          an  intensity  ratio  of  [OIII]/Hbeta  = 0.7 and FeII emission
          complexes  with  FeII4570/Hbeta = 0.7. The ionization parameter
          of  its  narrow-line  region,  estimated  from  the  line ratio
          [OII]/[OIII],  is  similar  to  Seyferts  and its high ratio of
          [NeV]/[NeIII]  indicates  a strong EUV to soft-X-ray excess. We
          advertise  the combined usage of [OII]/[OIII] and [NeV]/[NeIII]
          diagrams  as  a  useful  diagnostic tool to estimate ionization
          parameters  and to constrain the EUV continuum shape relatively
          independent from other parameters.

          Title:  Dissipative  Effects in the Worldline Approach to Black
          Hole Dynamics
          Authors: Walter D. Goldberger (Yale), Ira Z. Rothstein (CMU)
          Comments: 19 pages 2 figures
          We   derive   a   long   wavelength  effective  point  particle
          description  of  four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. In
          this  effective  theory, absorptive effects are incorporated by
          introducing  degrees of freedom localized on the worldline that
          mimic  the interaction between the horizon and bulk fields. The
          correlation  functions of composite operators in this worldline
          theory  can  be obtained by standard matching calculations. For
          example,  we  obtain  the  low  frequency two-point function of
          multipole  worldline  operators  by  relating  them to the long
          wavelength  graviton  black  hole absorptive cross section. The
          effective theory is then used to predict the leading effects of
          absorption   in  several  astrophysically  motivated  examples,
          including  the  dynamics  of non-relativistic black hole binary
          inspirals  and the motion of a small black hole in an arbitrary
          background  geometry.  Our  results can be written compactly in
          terms  of  absorption cross sections, and can be easily applied
          to the dissipative dynamics of any compact object, e.g. neutron
          stars. The relation of our methodology to that developed in the
          context of the AdS/CFT correspondence is discussed.

          Comments: 19 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; submitted to ApJ
          We present the discovery of the optical afterglow of GRB 050505
          and  an  optical  absorption  spectrum obtained with the Keck I
          10-m   telescope.   The   spectrum  exhibits  three  redshifted
          absorption  systems  with  the highest, at z=4.2748, arising in
          the  GRB host galaxy. The host absorption system is marked by a
          damped  Ly-alpha  (DLA)  feature with a neutral hydrogen column
          density  of  logN(HI)=22.05+/-0.10,  higher  than  that  of any
          QSO-DLA  detected  to date, but similar to several other recent
          measurements   from   GRB   spectra.  In  addition,  we  detect
          absorption  lines  from  both  low- and high-ionization species
          from  which  we  deduce  a  metallicity, Z~0.06 Z_solar, with a
          depletion  pattern  that  is  roughly  similar  to  that of the
          Galactic  warm halo, warm disk, or disk+halo. More importantly,
          we  detect  strong  absorption  from  SiII*  indicating a dense
          environment, n_H>10^2 cm^-3, in the vicinity of the burst, with
          a  size  of  about 4 pc. In addition, the CIV absorption system
          spans  a  velocity  range  of  about  1000  km/s,  which is not
          detected in any other absorption feature. We show that the most
          likely   interpretation   for   this  wide  velocity  range  is
          absorption  in  the  wind  from  the  progenitor  star. In this
          context,  the  lack  of corresponding SiIV absorption indicates
          that the progenitor had a mass of <25 M_solar and a metallicity
          <0.1  Z_solar,  and  therefore  required  a binary companion to
          eject  its  hydrogen  envelope  prior  to  the  GRB  explosion.
          Finally,  by extending the GRB-DLA sample to z~4.3 we show that
          these  objects  appear to follow a similar metallicity-redshift
          relation   as  in  QSO-DLAs,  but  with  systematically  higher
          metallicities.  It  remains  to  be  seen whether this trend is
          simply  due to the higher neutral hydrogen columns in GRB-DLAs,
          or  if  it  is  a  manifestation  of  different  star formation
          properties in GRB-DLAs. [abridged]

          Title:  AGN  Feedback  and Cooling Flows: The Failure of Simple
          Hydrodynamical Models
          Authors:  John C. Vernaleo, Christopher S. Reynolds (University
          of Maryland)
          Comments:   14  pages,  Submitted  to  ApJ.  PDF  version  with

          URL  Our  modified  version of the ZEUS-MP code is available at
          this http URL
          In  recent  years  it has become increasingly clear that Active
          Galactic  Nuclei,  and  radio-galaxies  in  particular, have an
          impact  on  large  scale  structure  and  galaxy  formation. In
          principle,  radio-galaxies  are  energetic  enough  to halt the
          cooling in the inner regions clusters, solving the cooling flow
          problem  and  explaining the high-mass truncation of the galaxy
          luminosity  function.  We explore this process through a series
          of  high resolution, three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations
          of   jetted   active   galaxies   which   act  in  response  to
          cooling-mediated  accretion  of an ICM atmosphere. We find that
          such  models  are incapable of producing a long term balance of
          heating and cooling; catastrophic cooling can be delayed by the
          jet  action  but  inevitably  takes  hold.  At the heart of the
          failure  of  these  models  is  the  formation of a low density
          channel  through  which  the  jet can freely flow, carrying its
          energy out of the cooling core. While this obviously highlights
          the  need  to  include  physics  beyond the ideal hydrodynamics
          considered   here,   it  also  underscores  the  importance  of
          including  jet  dynamics  in  such  models  as  opposed  to the
          isotropically inflated bubble approach.

          Title:  Flares  in  long  and  short Gamma-Ray Bursts: a common
          origin in a hyperaccreting accretion disk
          Authors:  Rosalba  Perna  (Colorado/JILA),  Philip  J. Armitage
          (Colorado/JILA), Bing Zhang (U. of Nevada)
          Comments: Accepted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters
          Early-time  X-ray observations of GRBs with the Swift satellite
          have  revealed  a more complicated phenomenology than was known
          before.  In  particular,  the presence of flaring activity on a
          wide  range  of  time scales probably requires late-time energy
          production within the GRB engine. Since the flaring activity is
          observed in both long and short GRBs, its origin must be within
          what  is  in  common  for the two likely progenitors of the two
          classes  of  bursts:  a  hyperaccreting accretion disk around a
          black  hole  of  a few solar masses. Here, we show that some of
          the  observational  properties  of  the  flares,  such  as  the
          duration-time   scale   correlation,   and   the  duration-peak
          luminosity  anticorrelation  displayed  by most flares within a
          given  burst,  are  qualitatively  consistent with viscous disk
          evolution,  provided  that  the  disk  at  large  radii  either
          fragments  or otherwise suffers large amplitude variability. We
          discuss the physical conditions in the outer parts of the disk,
          and  conclude that gravitational instability, possibly followed
          by  fragmentation,  is  the  most  likely  candidate  for  this
          variability.

          We  investigate  the  nature  of a sample of 92 Spitzer/MIPS 24
          micron  selected  galaxies  in the CDFS, showing power law-like
          emission  in the Spitzer/IRAC 3.6-8 micron bands. The main goal
          is  to  determine  whether  the galaxies not detected in X-rays
          (47%  of the sample) are part of the hypothetical population of
          obscured  AGN  not  detected  even  in  deep X-ray surveys. The
          majority  of  the  IR power-law galaxies are ULIRGs at z>1, and
          those  with  LIRG-like  IR luminosities are usually detected in
          X-rays.  The optical to IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
          of  the  X-ray  detected  galaxies  are  almost equally divided
          between  a  BLAGN  SED  class (similar to an optically selected
          QSO)  and  a  NLAGN  SED  (similar to the BLAGN SED but with an
          obscured  UV/optical  continuum).  A  small  fraction  of  SEDs
          resemble  warm ULIRG galaxies (e.g., Mrk231). Most galaxies not
          detected  in  X-rays have SEDs in the NLAGN+ULIRG class as they
          tend  to  be  optically  fainter,  and  possibly more obscured.
          Moreover,  the  IR  power-law  galaxies have SEDs significantly
          different from those of high-z (z_sp>1) IR (24 micron) selected
          and  optically  bright  (VVDS  I_AB<=24)  star-forming galaxies
          whose  SEDs  show  a very prominent stellar bump at 1.6 micron.
          The  galaxies  detected  in  X-rays  have  2-8  keV  rest-frame
          luminosities  typical  of  AGN.  The  galaxies  not detected in
          X-rays  have  global  X-ray  to mid-IR SED properties that make
          them  good  candidates to contain IR bright X-ray absorbed AGN.
          If  all  these  sources  are  actually  obscured  AGN, we would
          observe  a  ratio  of obscured to unobscured 24 micron detected
          AGN  of  2:1,  whereas  models  predict  a  ratio of up to 3:1.
          Additional  studies using Spitzer to detect X-ray-quiet AGN are
          likely to find more such obscured sources.

          Title: Extended X-Ray Emission from QSOs
          Authors:  Alan  Stockton (1), Hai Fu (1), J. Patrick Henry (1),
          Gabriela Canalizo (2) ((1) IfA Hawaii, (2) Univ. of California,
          Riverside)
          Comments: Accepted by ApJ. 9 pages including 5 figures
          We  report  Chandra  ACIS  observations of the fields of 4 QSOs
          showing  strong  extended optical emission-line regions. Two of
          these show no evidence for significant extended X-ray emission.
          The  remaining two fields, those of 3C 249.1 and 4C 37.43, show
          discrete (but resolved) X-ray sources at distances ranging from
          ~10 to ~40 kpc from the nucleus. In addition, 4C 37.43 also may
          show  a  region  of diffuse X-ray emission extending out to ~65
          kpc  and  centered  on  the  QSO.  It  has  been suggested that
          extended  emission-line  regions such as these may originate in
          the  cooling  of  a  hot  intragroup medium. We do not detect a
          general  extended  medium  in  any of our fields, and the upper
          limits  we  can place on its presence indicate cooling times of
          at  least a few 10^9 years. The discrete X-ray emission sources
          we detect cannot be explained as the X-ray jets frequently seen
          associated  with  radio-loud  quasars,  nor  can they be due to
          electron  scattering  of  nuclear  emission. The most plausible
          explanation  is  that  they  result from high-speed shocks from
          galactic  superwinds  resulting  either from a starburst in the
          QSO  host  galaxy  or  from  the  activation of the QSO itself.
          Evidence  from  densities  and velocities found from studies of
          the  extended  optical  emission around QSOs also supports this
          interpretation.

          Title: A Possible Rossby Wave Instability Origin for the Flares
          in Sagittarius A*
          Authors: Michel Tagger, Fulvio Melia
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters
          In  recent  years,  near-IR and X-ray flares have been detected
          from  the  Galaxy's  central radio point source, Sagittarius A*
          (Sgr  A*),  believed to be a \~3.10^6 solar masses supermassive
          black hole. In some cases, the transient emission appears to be
          modulated  with a (quasi-)periodic oscillation (QPO) of ~ 17-20
          minutes.  The  implied ~ 3 r_S size of the emitter (where r_S =
          2GM/c^2 is the Schwarzschild radius) points to an instability -
          possibly  induced  by  accretion  -  near the Marginally Stable
          Orbit  (MSO)  of  a  slowly  spinning object. But Sgr A* is not
          accreting  via  a  large,  `standard'  disk;  instead,  the low
          density  environment  surrounding it apparently feeds the black
          hole   with   low   angular  momentum  clumps  of  plasma  that
          circularize  within  ~ 10-300 r_S and merge onto a compact, hot
          disk.  In  this  Letter,  we  follow  the evolution of the disk
          following   such   an  event,  and  show  that  a  Rossby  wave
          instability,  particularly  in  its  magnetohydrodynamic  (MHD)
          form, grows rapidly and produces a period of enhanced accretion
          lasting several hours. Both the amplitude of this response, and
          its  duration,  match the observed flare characteristics rather
          well.

          Comments: 19 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  report  the  discovery  of  PSR  J1906+0746, a young 144-ms
          pulsar   in   a  highly  relativistic  3.98-hr  orbit  with  an
          eccentricity   of   0.085   and   expected  gravitational  wave
          coalescence  time  of  300 Myr. The new pulsar was found during
          precursor  survey  observations  with  the Arecibo 1.4-GHz feed
          array   system  and  retrospectively  detected  in  the  Parkes
          Multibeam  plane  pulsar  survey  data.  From  radio  follow-up
          observations  with  Arecibo,  Jodrell  Bank,  Green  Bank,  and
          Parkes, we have measured the spin-down and binary parameters of
          the  pulsar and its basic spectral and polarization properties.
          We  also present evidence for pulse profile evolution, which is
          likely due to geodetic precession, a relativistic effect caused
          by  the  misalignment  of  the  pulsar  spin  and total angular
          momentum  vectors. Our measurements show that PSR J1906+0746 is
          a  young  object with a characteristic age of 112 kyr. From the
          measured rate of orbital periastron advance 7.57+/-0.03 deg/yr,
          we  infer  a total system mass of 2.61+/-0.02 Msun. While these
          parameters  suggest that the PSR J1906+0746 binary system might
          be  a  younger  version  of the double pulsar system, intensive
          searches  for  radio pulses from the companion have so far been
          unsuccessful.  It  is therefore not known whether the companion
          is another neutron star or a massive white dwarf. Regardless of
          the nature of the companion, a simple calculation suggests that
          the  Galactic  birth rate of binaries similar to PSR J1906+0746
          is  60/Myr.  This  implies  that  PSR  J1906+0746  will  make a
          significant  contribution  to the computed cosmic inspiral rate
          of compact binary systems.

          we  study  the long-term evolution of the accretion disk around
          the  neutron  star in Be/X-ray binaries. We confirm the earlier
          result by Hayasaki & Okazaki (2004) that the disk evolves via a
          two-stage  process,  which  consists  of the initial developing
          stage  and  the  later developed stage. The peak mass-accretion
          rate  is  distributed  around  apastron after the disk is fully
          developed.  This  indicates  that  the  modulation  of the mass
          accretion  rate  is essentially caused by an inward propagation
          of  the one-armed spiral wave. The X-ray luminosity peak around
          the  apastron  could  provide  circumstatial  evidence  for  an
          persistent disk around the neutron star in Be/X-ray binaries.

          We  compare the accretion flow onto the neutron star induced by
          Roche lobe overflow with that by the overflow from the Be disk,
          in  a zero eccentricity, short period binary with the same mass
          transfer  rate,  performing three-dimensional Smoothed Particle
          Hydrodynamics  simulations. We find that a persistent accretion
          disk  is  formed  around  the  neutron  star in both cases. The
          circularization  radius  of  the material transferred via Roche
          lobe  overflow  is  larger than that of the material transfered
          from the Be disk. Thus, the growth of the accretion disk in the
          former  case  becomes  significantly  slower than in the latter
          case.  In both cases, the mass accretion rate is very small and
          varies  little with orbital phase, which is consistent with the
          observed  X-ray  behaviour  of  Be/X-ray binaries with circular
          orbits (e.g. XTE J1543-568).

          Title: X-ray reflections on AGN
          Authors: A.C. Fabian (Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge, UK)
          Comments:  5  pages,  9  figures, to appear in Proc. "The X-ray
          Universe  2005",  San  Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain, September
          2005
          X-ray  reflection  generates much of the spectral complexity in
          the X-ray spectra of AGN. It is argued that strong relativistic
          blurring of the reflection spectrum should commonly be expected
          from  objects  accreting  at  a  high  Eddington rate. The good
          agreement  found  between  the  local  density in massive black
          holes  and  the energy density in quasar and AGN light requires
          that   the  accretion  which  built  massive  black  holes  was
          radiatively  efficient, involving thin discs extending within 6
          gravitational  radii.  The  soft excess found in the spectra of
          many  AGN  can  be  explained  by  X-ray  reflection  when such
          blurring  is  included  in  the  spectral analysis. Some of the
          continuum   variability   and   in   particular   the  puzzling
          variability  of  the  broad  iron  line can be explained by the
          strong  light bending expected in the region immediately around
          a  black  hole. Progress in understanding this behaviour in the
          brightest  sources can be made now with long observations using
          instruments on XMM-Newton and Suzaku. Future missions like Xeus
          and  Con-X, with large collecting areas, are required to expand
          the  range  of  accessible  objects  and  to make reverberation
          studies possible.

          Title: RODEO: a new method for planet-disk interaction
          Authors: S. Paardekooper, G. Mellema
          Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A
          In  this  paper  we  describe  a  new  method  for studying the
          hydrodynamical  problem of a planet embedded in a gaseous disk.
          We  use  a  finite  volume  method  with an approximate Riemann
          solver  (the  Roe  solver),  together  with  a  special  way to
          integrate  the  source  terms. This new source term integration
          scheme sheds new light on the Coriolis instability, and we show
          that  our  method  does  not  suffer from this instability. The
          first   results   on  flow  structure  and  gap  formation  are
          presented,  as well as accretion and migration rates. For Mpl <
          0.1  M_J and Mpl > 1.0 M_J (M_J = Jupiter's mass) the accretion
          rates do not depend sensitively on numerical parameters, and we
          find  that  within the disk's lifetime a planet can grow to 3-4
          M_J.  In  between  these two limits numerics play a major role,
          leading  to  differences  of  more  than  50  %  for  different
          numerical  parameters.  Migration  rates  are  not  affected by
          numerics  at  all  as long as the mass inside the Roche lobe is
          not  considered.  We  can  reproduce  the  Type  I  and Type II
          migration for low-mass and high-mass planets, respectively, and
          the  fastest  moving  planet of 0.1 M_J has a migration time of
          only 2.0 10^4 yr.

          Title:   An   Optical   Study   of   Stellar  and  Interstellar

          Comments: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal
          We  have  studied  the stellar and interstellar environments of
          two luminous X-ray sources and five ultraluminous X-ray sources
          (ULXs)  in  order  to  gain insight into their nature. Archival
          Hubble Space Telescope images were used to identify the optical
          counterparts  of  the  ULXs  Ho IX X-1 and NGC 1313 X-2, and to
          make  photometric measurements of the local stellar populations
          of  these  and  the  luminous  source  IC  10  X-1. We obtained
          high-dispersion   spectroscopic  observations  of  the  nebulae
          around  these  seven  sources  to  search for He II lambda-4686
          emission  and  to estimate the expansion velocities and kinetic
          energies  of  these  nebulae.  Our  observations did not detect
          nebular  He  II emission from any source, with the exception of
          LMC X-1; this is either because we missed the He III regions or
          because  the  nebulae  are too diffuse to produce He II surface
          brightnesses  that  lie  within our detection limit. We compare
          the  observed  ionization  and  kinematics  of  the supershells
          around  the  ULXs  Ho  IX  X-1 and NGC 1313 X-2 with the energy
          feedback  expected  from  the  underlying stellar population to
          assess  whether  additional  energy contributions from the ULXs
          are  needed.  In  both cases, we find insufficient UV fluxes or
          mechanical  energies  from  the  stellar population; thus these
          ULXs  may  be  partially  responsible  for  the  ionization and
          energetics  of  their supershells. All seven sources we studied
          are  in young stellar environments and six of them have optical
          counterparts  with  masses  >~7  M_sun; thus, these sources are
          most likely high-mass X-ray binaries.

          content.  The  HI  mass of the cloud is 2.0 x 10^7 (d/27 kpc)^2
          Msun,  making  Complex  H  one  of the most massive HVCs if its
          distance is > ~20 kpc. Virtually all similar HI clouds in other
          galaxy  groups  are  associated  with  LSB  dwarf  galaxies. We
          selected  mid-IR MSX sources in the direction of Complex H that
          appeared likely to be star-forming regions and observed them at
          the  wavelength of the CO 1-0 transition. 59 of the 60 observed
          sources  show emission at Milky Way velocities, and we detected
          no emission at velocities consistent with that of Complex H. We
          use  these  observations  to  set an upper limit on the ongoing
          star  formation  rate  in the HVC of < 5 x 10^-4 Msun yr^-1. We
          also   searched   the   2MASS  database  for  evidence  of  any
          dwarf-galaxy-like  stellar  population  in the direction of the
          HVC  and found no trace of a distant red giant population, with
          an  upper  limit  on  the stellar mass of ~10^6 Msun. Given the
          lack  of  evidence  for  either  current  star  formation or an
          evolved  population,  we  conclude  that  Complex H cannot be a
          dwarf  galaxy with properties similar to those of known dwarfs.
          Complex  H is therefore one of the most massive known HI clouds
          without stars. If Complex H is self-gravitating, then it is one
          of  the  few  known  dark galaxy candidates. These findings may
          offer  observational  support  for  the idea that the Cold Dark
          Matter  substructure  problem  is  related to the difficulty of
          forming  stars  in  low-mass  dark matter halos; alternatively,
          Complex H could be an example of a cold accretion flow onto the
          Milky Way. [slightly abridged]

          Title:  Ultraluminous  X-ray  Sources  Powered  by  Radiatively
          Efficient  Two-Phased  Super-Eddington  Accretion  onto Stellar
          Mass Black holes
          Authors: Aristotle Socrates, Shane W. Davis
          Comments: 11 pages
          The  radiation  spectra  of many of the brightest ultraluminous
          X-ray  sources  (ULXs)  are  dominated  by  a  hard  power  law
          component,  likely powered by a hot, optically thin corona that
          Comptonizes  soft  seed  photons emitted from a cool, optically
          thick  black  hole  accretion  disk. Before its dissipation and
          subsequent conversion into coronal photon power, the randomized
          gravitational  binding  energy  responsible  for  powering  ULX
          phenomena  must separate from the mass of its origin by a means
          other  than,  and  quicker  than,  electron scattering-mediated
          radiative  diffusion. Therefore, the release of accretion power
          in  ULXs is not necessarily subject to Eddington-limited photon
          trapping,  as long as it occurs in a corona. Motivated by these
          basic  considerations,  we  present  a model of ULXs powered by
          geometrically  thin accretion onto stellar mass black holes. We
          argue that the radiative efficiency of the flow remains high if
          the  corona is magnetized or optically thin and the majority of
          the  accretion  power  escapes  in the form of radiation rather
          than  an  outflow. Within the context of the current black hole
          X-ray  binary  paradigm,  our  ULX  model  may  be viewed as an
          extension  of the very high state observed in Galactic sources.

          2005
          X-ray  surveys  of  the  extragalactic universe are now able to
          detect  significant  numbers of AGN out to high redshift (z~5).
          We  highlight  some  results  from  the Chandra Multiwavelength
          Project (ChaMP) to measure the X-ray luminosity function out to
          these  early  epochs. At z > 3, we show that the comoving space
          density  of luminous (log Lx > 44.5) AGN has a behavior similar
          to  the  optical QSO luminosity function. With a newly compiled
          sample   of   AGN  from  ChaMP  supplemented  with  those  from
          additional  surveys  including  the  Chandra  Deep  fields,  we
          present a preliminary measure of the luminosity function in the
          hard (2-8 keV) band. With 37 AGN at z > 3, we continue to see a
          decline  in  the  space  density  at high redshift over a wider
          range  in  luminosity. We discuss the need to identify a larger
          sample  of  obscured  AGN  at  high redshift to determine if an
          early epoch of hidden supermassive black hole growth occurred.

          Title:  A  closer  look  at  the X-ray transient XTE J1908+094:
          identification of two new near-infrared candidate counterparts
          Authors:  Sylvain  Chaty  (AIME),  Roberto  P.  Mignani (AIME),
          Gianluca Israel (AIME)
          Comments: accepted for publication in MNRAS, 5 pages, 3 figures
          We  had  reported  in  Chaty,  Mignani,  Israel  (2002)  on the
          near-infrared (NIR) identification of a possible counterpart to
          the  black  hole  candidate  XTE  J1908+094  obtained  with the
          ESO/NTT.  Here, we present new, follow-up, CFHT adaptive optics
          observations  of  the  XTE  J1908+094 field, which resolved the
          previously  proposed  counterpart  in  two objects separated by
          about  0.8". Assuming that both objects are potential candidate
          counterparts,  we  derive  that the binary system is a low-mass
          system   with  a  companion  star  which  could  be  either  an
          intermediate/late  type  (A-K) main sequence star at a distance
          of  3-10  kpc,  or  a  late-type ($>$K) main sequence star at a
          distance  of 1-3 kpc. However, we show that the brighter of the
          two  objects  (J ~ 20.1, H ~ 18.7, K' ~ 17.8) is more likely to
          be  the  real  counterpart of the X-ray source. Its position is
          more  compatible with our astrometric solution, and colours and
          magnitudes  of  the  other  object  are not consistent with the
          lower  limit  of  3  kpc  derived  independently  from the peak
          bolometric  flux  of  XTE  J1908+094.  Further multi-wavelength
          observations  of  both  candidate  counterparts  are crucial in
          order to solve the pending identification.

          Comments:  53 pages, 18 figures. To appear in The Astrophysical
          Journal
          We  present self-consistent disk models for T Tauri stars which
          include  a  parameterized  treatment of dust settling and grain
          growth,  building on techniques developed in a series of papers
          by    D'Alessio   etal.   The   models   incorporate   depleted
          distributions   of   dust  in  upper  disk  layers  along  with
          larger-sized  particles  near  the  disk  midplane, as expected
          theoretically  and  as  we  suggested  earlier  is necessary to
          account for mm-wave emission, SEDs, scattered light images, and
          silicate  emission  features  simultaneously.  By comparing the
          models  with recent mid- and near-IR observations, we find that
          the  dust to gas mass ratio of small grains at the upper layers
          should  be  <  10 % of the standard value. The grains that have
          disappeared from the upper layers increase the dust to gas mass
          ratio  of  the  disk  interior; if those grains grow to maximum
          sizes of the order of mm during the settling process, then both
          the   millimeter-wave   fluxes   and  spectral  slopes  can  be
          consistently explained. Depletion and growth of grains can also
          enhance   the   ionization   of  upper  layers,  enhancing  the
          possibility  of  the  magnetorotational instability for driving
          disk accretion.

          Title: The Slingshot Revisited
          Authors:  Sverre Aarseth (Institute of Astronomy, University of
          Cambridge, England)
          Comments:  8  pages,  3 figures. To appear in Few-Body Problem,
          Annales Universitatis Turkuensis, C. Flynn, ed
          (Abridged)  In  this  celebratory contribution, we present some
          new  data  from  standard  star  cluster  modelling  containing
          primordial  binaries  and  triples,  as  well as results from a
          binary  black  hole simulation with two massive members. In the
          star  cluster  case,  the  process  of  mass loss from evolving
          stars,   together   with  general  mass  segregation,  promotes
          favourable   interactions   involving   compact  subsystems  of
          binaries   and   triples  in  the  central  region.  Three-body
          interactions  often  lead  to  energetic ejections, with one or
          more  of  the  components  attaining  relatively large terminal
          velocities  which can be observed in principle. The second type
          of  stellar  system to be discussed is based on the scenario of
          two  approaching galactic cores with density cusps, each having
          a  massive  black hole. After the subsystems become well mixed,
          the  two massive components soon form a hard binary which gains
          energy  by  ejecting other members. Such a massive binary has a
          large  cross  section  and  can  be very effective in depleting
          bound  stars  from  the  core. Again high-velocity escapers are
          produced,  with  their terminal speeds related to the shrinking
          binary size which eventually leads to coalescence.

          Title:  An  explanation  for  the  soft  X-ray  excess  in  AGN
          (Conference proceedings version)

          Comments:  5  pages,  Proceedings of "The X-ray Universe 2005",
          Madrid, Spain, 2005-9-26 to 2005-9-30
          We  present  a  large  sample  of type 1 AGN spectra taken with
          XMM-Newton.  We  fit  them  with  the  relativistically blurred
          photoionized  disc model of Ross & Fabian (2005). This model is
          based  on  an  illuminated  accretion  disc  of fluorescing and
          Compton-scattering   gas,  and  includes  relativistic  Doppler
          effects  due  to  the  rapid  motion  of  the  disc and general
          relativistic  effects  such  as  gravitational  redshift due to
          presence  of  the  black  hole.  The  disc  model  successfully
          reproduces  the  X-ray  continuum  shape,  including  the  soft
          excess,  of  all the sources. It provides a natural explanation
          for  the  observation  that  the  soft  excess is at a constant
          temperature over a wide range of AGN properties. The model also
          reproduces   many   features   that   would  conventionally  be
          interpreted  as  absorption  edges. We use the model to measure
          properties of the AGN such as inclination, black hole rotation,
          and metallicity.

          Title: A possible mechanism for QPOs modulation in neutron star
          sources

          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
          Journal-ref: Astronomische Nachrichten 326 (2005), 845-848
          It   was  pointed  out  by  Paczynski  (1987)  that  the  X-ray
          luminosity  of accreting neutron stars is very sensitive to the
          physical   properties  of  the  accretion  flow  close  to  the
          innermost   stable  circular  orbit.  The  X-ray  radiation  is
          dominated by that emitted in the boundary layer, where accreted
          matter  hits  a  star  surface.  The  X-ray  luminosity  of the
          boundary  layer is proportional to the local accretion rate. In
          this note, we estimate local accretion rate variations from the
          disk  that undergoes non-stationary axisymmetric perturbations.
          The perturbations are given by the poloidal-velocity potential.
          We  obtain  a  simple  formula describing the modulation of the
          accretion  rate for the particular case of global vertical disk
          oscillations  that  have been recently studied by Abramowicz et
          al. (2005).

          Two  short  (<2  s)  g-ray  bursts  (GRBs)  have  recently been
          localized  and  fading  afterglow  counterparts  detected.  The
          combination of these two results left unclear the nature of the
          host  galaxies  of  the  bursts, because one was a star-forming
          dwarf,  while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. Here
          we  report the X-ray localization of a short burst (GRB 050724)
          with  unusual  g-ray  and X-ray properties. The X-ray afterglow
          lies  off  the  centre of an elliptical galaxy at a redshift of
          z=0.258,   coincident   with   the   position   determined   by
          ground-based  optical  and radio observations. The low level of
          star   formation  typical  for  elliptical  galaxies  makes  it
          unlikely  that  the burst originated n a supernova explosion. A
          supernova origin was also ruled out for GRB 050709, even though
          that  burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation.
          The  isotropic  energy  for  the  short bursts is 2-3 orders of
          magnitude  lower  han  that  for  the  long bursts. Our results
          therefore  suggest  that an alternative source of bursts -- the
          of binary systems of neutron stars or a neutron star-black hole
          pair -- are the progenitors of short bursts.

          We present new techniqes for evolving binary black hole systems

          waveforms  directly  from the wave zone region of the numerical
          simulations. Rather than excising the black hole interiors, our
          approach  follows  the "puncture" treatment of black holes, but
          utilzing  a new gauge condition which allows the black holes to
          move  successfully  through  the computational domain. We apply
          these   techniques  to  an  inspiraling  binary,  modeling  the
          radiation  generated  during  the final plunge and ringdown. We
          demonstrate  convergence of the waveforms and good conservation
          of  mass-energy,  with  just  over  3%  of  the  system's  mass
          converted to gravitional radiation.

          In  this  brief note, we investigate some possible experimental
          consequences  of  the  de-Sitter  or  Anti-de-Sitter background
          spacetime  structure for d-dimensional evaporating black holes.
          Possible  observational  signatures  in  Large  Hadron Collider
          (LHC)   events   are   considered   in  the  framework  of  the
          Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali  (ADD)  braneworld  model.  Lower
          bounds  on the value of the bulk cosmological constant required
          to  produce  visible  effects are derived thanks to a dynamical
          Monte-Carlo  simulation.  This  preliminary  study  has  to  be
          refined by the accurate computation of the greybody factors. It
          opens   a   new   way   to   investigate   the   structure   of
          non-asymptotically flat higher-dimensional spacetimes.

          Universe  2005",  San  Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain, September
          2005
          Cold   fronts  are  sharp  surface  brightness  discontinuities
          characterized  by  a  jump  in gas temperature accompanied by a
          decline  in X-ray surface brightness such that the gas pressure
          remains continuous across the front and, thus, these structures
          differ  from bow shocks. Models suggest that cold fronts can be
          generated  by  external mechanisms involving the accretion of a
          subsystem   with  a  remnant  "cold  core".  However,  internal
          mechanisms  can  also create cold fronts, such as gravitational
          scattering  of subclumps or cD oscillation around the bottom of
          the  potential well. These competing models for their formation
          can  be  discriminated  through the measurements of the SN Type
          contamination across the front, which in turn can be determined
          from  metal  abundance  ratios  as measured from an ensemble of
          elements.  Here  we  present  the  preliminary  results of such
          analysis using a sample of clusters observed with Chandra.

          the  afterglows  of  the  short  bursts  050709  and  050724 to
          constrain  the  blast-wave  energy,  its  collimation  and  the
          density  of  the  circumburst  medium.  For  GRB  050709 (whose
          duration was 0.07 s), we identify two models: i) a high-density
          solution,   where  the  ejecta  are  collimated  in  a  jet  of
          half-angle  theta_{jet}  >  6 deg and interact with a medium of
          particle density 10^{-4}/cc < n < 0.1/cc, and ii) a low-density
          solution  with  theta_{jet}  >  2 deg and n < 10^{-5}/cc. These
          density  ranges  are  compatible  with  those  expected  in the
          vicinity  of  the  host galaxy and in the intergalactic medium,
          lending  support  to  the hypothesis that the progenitor of GRB
          050907 is a NS-NS or NS-BH merger. For GRB 050724 (which last 3
          s), we obtain 0.1/cc < n < 1000/cc and theta_{jet} > 8 deg. The
          range  of  allowed  densities shows that this burst occurred in
          the  intragalactic environment. The dynamical parameters of the
          high-density  model for the GRB afterglow 050709 are similar to
          those  for  050724.  If these parameters are representative for
          short-GRB  outflows,  then  these  jets are less collimated and
          have  a  lower  kinetic energy than those of long bursts, which
          suggests  that GRB jets are not magnetically collimated and are
          powered  by  the  gravitational energy of the torus. Evidently,
          the  analysis  of  more  short-GRB afterglows is required for a
          more robust conclusion.

          Title:  Thermal  X-Ray  Iron  Line  Emission  from the Galactic
          Center Black Hole Sagittarius A*
          Authors:  Ya-Di  Xu, Ramesh Narayan, Eliot Quataert, Feng Yuan,

          Astrophysical Journal
          We model thermal X-ray emission from the accreting supermassive
          black  hole  Sagittarius  A*  at  the  Galactic Center. For the
          region  inside  $1.^{\prime\prime}5$  of  the  center, we use a
          {generalized}  radiatively  inefficient  accretion  flow (RIAF)
          model,  and  for  the  region out to $10^{\prime\prime}$ we use
          published  models  of  the  ambient  hot  gas. We calculate the
          equivalent  widths  of  Hydrogen-like  and Helium-like emission
          lines  of  various  elements,  notably  iron. We predict that a
          strong  Helium-like  iron line with an equivalent width $\sim1$
          keV should be emitted by both the external medium and the RIAF.
          The equivalent width in the external medium is sensitive to the
          metallicity $Z$ of the gas as well as the mean temperature. For
          reasonable  choices of these parameters, the calculated results
          agree  with  Chandra's  detection  of  an  iron  line  with  an
          equivalent  width  of  1.3  keV within $10^{\prime\prime}$. The
          emission  from  within $1.^{\prime\prime}5$ is not sensitive to
          the  external temperature, but is sensitive to the density and,
          especially,  temperature  profile  inside the Bondi radius. For
          the  range of profiles we consider, we calculate the equivalent
          width  of  the  iron  line to be $\sim0.6-1.5 (Z/Z_\odot)$ keV,
          where  $Z_\odot$  is  the  solar  metallicity. We present a new
          Chandra    spectrum    of   the   quiescent   emission   within
          $1.^{\prime\prime}5$  of  Sgr A*. The measured equivalent width
          of  the  iron  line is 0.7 keV. Although this measurement has a
          large  uncertainty,  it  is  consistent  with  our predictions,
          provided the metallicity of the gas is approximately solar.

          We  present  Spitzer  24micron imaging of 1.5 < z < 2.5 Distant
          Red Galaxies (DRGs) in the 10arcmin by 10arcmin Extended Hubble
          Deep  Field  South of the Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile.
          We  detect 65% of the DRGs with K_AB < 23.2 mag at S_24micron >
          40uJy,  and  conclude  that  the bulk of the DRG population are
          dusty active galaxies. A mid-infrared (MIR) color analysis with
          IRAC  data  suggests  that  the MIR fluxes are not dominated by
          buried  AGN,  and  we  interpret  the  high  detection  rate as
          evidence  for  a  high  average  star formation rate of <SFR> =
          130+/-30  M/yr.  From  this,  we  infer that DRGs are important
          contributors  to  the cosmic star formation rate density at z ~
          2, at a level of \~0.02 M/yr/Mpc^3 to our completeness limit of

          We   report  the  discovery  of  propeller-driven  outflows  in
          axisymmetric  magnetohydrodynamic simulations of disk accretion
          to rapidly rotating magnetized stars. Matter outflows in a wide
          cone and is centrifugally ejected from the inner regions of the
          disk.  Closer  to  the  axis  there  is  a  strong, collimated,
          magnetically  dominated  outflow of energy and angular momentum
          carried  by  the  open  magnetic field lines from the star. The
          ``efficiency'' of the propeller may be very high in the respect
          that  most  of  the  incoming  disk matter is expelled from the
          system  in  winds.  The  star  spins-down  rapidly  due  to the
          magnetic  interaction  with the disk through closed field lines
          and with corona through open field lines. Diffusive and viscous
          interaction  between  magnetosphere and the disk are important:
          no  outflows  were  observed  for  very  small  values  of  the
          diffusivity   and   viscosity.  These  simulation  results  are
          applicable  to  the  early  stages  of evolution of classical T
          Tauri stars and to different stages of evolution of cataclysmic
          variables  and  neutron stars in binary systems. As an example,
          we  have  shown  that  young  rapidly rotating magnetized CTTSs
          spin-down  to  their  present  slow  rotation in less than 10^6
          years.

          determined  by  cyclotron  line  studies of all accreting X-ray

          instruments  in past outbursts. The source went into quiescence
          for  more  than  ten  years  since  its last outbursts in 1994.
          Observing during a `normal' outburst August/September 2005 with

          MNRAS
          We present an extensive X-ray spectral analysis of the cores of
          19  FRII  sources  in  the  redshift range 0.5<z<1.0 which were
          selected  to  be  matched  in isotropic radio power. The sample
          consists  of  10  radio  galaxies and 9 quasars. We compare our
          results  with  the  expectations  from a unification model that
          ascribes  the  difference between these two types of sources to
          the  viewing  angle  to  the  line  of  sight,  beaming and the
          presence  of a dust and gas torus. We find that the spectrum of
          all the quasars can be fitted with a single power law, and that
          the  spectral  index flattens with decreasing angle to the line
          of  sight.  We  interpret  this  as  the effect of increasingly
          dominant  inverse  Compton X-ray emission, beamed such that the
          jet  emission outshines other core components. For up to 70 per
          cent  of  the  radio  galaxies  we detect intrinsic absorption;
          their  core  spectra  are  best fitted with an unabsorbed steep
          power  law  of  average  spectral  index  $\Gamma=2.1$  and  an
          absorbed  power  law  of  spectral  index  Gamma=1.6,  which is
          flatter  than that observed for radio-quiet quasars. We further
          conclude  that  the  presence  of  a  jet  affects the spectral
          properties  of  absorbed  nuclear  emission  in  AGN.  In radio
          galaxies,   any   steep-spectrum  component  of  nuclear  X-ray
          emission,  similar to that seen in radio-quiet quasars, must be
          masked by a jet or by jet-related emission.

          Title:  Collimation  of  astrophysical  jets  - the role of the
          accretion disk magnetic field distribution
          Authors: Christian Fendt
          Comments: 27 pp, 11 figs, submitted to ApJ
          We  have  applied  axisymmetric  MHD  simulations  in  order to
          investigate  the  impact  of  the  accretion disk magnetic flux
          profile  on  jet  collimation.  Our  simulations evolve from an
          initially  hydrostatic  equilibrium  and  a force-free magnetic
          field  configuration.  We apply a self-consistent model for the
          turbulent  magneticdiffusivity  and internal turbulent Alfvenic
          pressure.  Considering  a  power  law  for  the  disk  poloidal
          magnetic  field  profile  $B_p \sim r^{-\mu}$ and the mass flow
          rate  from  the  disk surface into the jet, we have performed a
          systematic  study over a wide range of parameters. We find that
          the  degree  of collimation decreases for steeper disk magnetic
          field.  Varying  the  total  magnetic  flux does not change the
          degree of jet collimation substantially. As our major result we
          find a general interrelation between the collimation degree and
          the  disk  wind  magnetization  power  law  exponent.  We  also
          performed   simulations  of  jet  formation  with  artificially
          enhanced  decay  of  the  toroidal  magnetic  field in order to
          investigate   the  idea  of  a  purely  "poloidal  collimation"
          previously discussed in the literature. These outflows are only
          weakly  collimated and have lower velocity. Thanks to our large
          numerical  grid of about 7 x 14 AU, we may apply our results to
          recently   observed   protostellar  jet  rotation  of  DG  Tau,
          indicating  a  flat  disk magnetic field profile in this source
          $\mu  \simeq 0.5$. Our results in general are applicable to all
          sources of MHD jets.

          Following  the  suggestion of Zuckerman et al. (2001, ApJ, 562,
          L87),  we  consider the evidence that 51 Eri (spectral type F0)
          and  GJ  3305  (M0),  historically classified as unrelated main
          sequence  stars  in  the solar neighborhood, are instead a wide
          physical binary system and members of the young beta Pic moving
          group  (BPMG).  The  BPMG is the nearest (d < 50 pc) of several
          groups  of  young  stars  with  ages  around  10  Myr  that are
          kinematically   convergent  with  the  Oph-Sco-Cen  Association
          (OSCA), the nearest OB star association. Combining SAAO optical
          photometry,      Hobby-Eberly     Telescope     high-resolution
          spectroscopy, Chandra X-ray data, and UCAC2 catalog kinematics,
          we  confirm  with  high  confidence  that  the system is indeed
          extremely  young.  GJ 3305 itself exhibits very strong magnetic
          activity  but  has rapidly depleted most of its lithium. The 51
          Eri/GJ 3305 system is the westernmost known member of the OSCA,
          lying  110 pc from the main subgroups. The system is similar to
          the  BPMG  wide  binary HD 172555/CD -64d1208 and the HD 104237
          quintet,  suggesting  that dynamically fragile multiple systems
          can  survive  the  turbulent  environments of their natal giant
          molecular  cloud  complexes,  while  still  being imparted high
          dispersion  velocities.  Nearby young systems such as these are
          excellent  targets for evolved circumstellar disk and planetary
          studies,  having  stellar  ages  comparable to that of the late
          phases of planet formation.

          Title: Perturbations of self-similar Bondi accretion
          Authors: Jose Gaite
          Comments:  10  pages,  2  figures,  accepted  in  Astronomy and
          Astrophysics
          The  question  of  stability  of steady spherical accretion has
          been  studied  for  many  years  and,  recently, the concept of
          spatial   instability   has  been  introduced.  Here  we  study
          perturbations   of  steady  spherical  accretion  flows  (Bondi
          solutions),  restricting  ourselves to the case of self-similar
          flow,  as  a  case  amenable  to  analytic  treatment  and with
          physical   interest.  We  further  restrict  ourselves  to  its
          acoustic perturbations. The radial perturbation equation can be
          solved  in  terms of Bessel functions. We study the formulation
          of   adequate   boundary   conditions   and   decide   for   no
          matter-flux-perturbation conditions (at the Bondi radius and at
          r=0).  We  also  consider the problem of initial conditions and
          time  evolution,  in  particular,  of  radial perturbations. No
          spatial instability at r=0 is found. The time evolution is such
          that  perturbations  eventually become ergodic-like and show no
          trace of instability or of acquiring any remarkable pattern.

          Comments:  5 pages, 1 Figure, Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          (Letters)
          We consider the production of $^6$Li in spallation reactions by
          cosmic  rays in order to explain the observed abundance in halo
          metal-poor stars. We show that heating of ambient gas by cosmic
          rays is an inevitable consequence of this process, and estimate
          the  energy  input required to reproduce the observed abundance
          of  $^6$Li/H$\sim 10^{-11}$ to be of order a few hundred eV per
          particle.  We draw attention to the possibility that this could
          explain  the  excess  entropy  in  gas  in  galaxy  groups  and
          clusters.  The evolution of $^6$Li and the accompanying heating
          of  gas  is calculated for structures collapsing at the present
          epoch  with  injection  of  cosmic  rays  at  high redshift. We
          determine  the  energy  required  to  explain  the abundance of
          $^6$Li  at  $z  \sim 2$ corresponding to the formation epoch of
          halo  metal-poor  stars, and also an increased entropy level of
          $\sim  300$  keV cm$^2$ necessary to explain X-ray observations
          of  clusters.  The energy budget for this process is consistent
          with  the  expected  energy  output of radio-loud AGNs, and the
          diffusion  length  scale  of cosmic-ray protons responsible for
          heating  is  comparable  to  the  size  of  regions with excess
          entropy.  We  also  discuss  the  constraints  imposed  by  the
          extragalactic gamma-ray background.

          The  Advanced  Liquid-Mirror  Probe of Asteroids, Cosmology and
          Astrophysics  (ALPACA)  is  a  proposed  8-meter  liquid mirror
          telescope    surveying    ~1000    square    degree    of   the
          southern-hemisphere  sky.  It  will  be a remarkably simple and
          inexpensive telescope, that nonetheless will deliver a powerful
          sample  of  optical  data for studying dark energy. The bulk of
          the    cosmological    data    consists    of   nightly,   high
          signal-to-noise, multiband light curves of SN Ia. At the end of
          the  three-years run ALPACA is expected to collect >100,000 SNe
          Ia  up  to  z~1.  This  will  allow to accurately calibrate the
          standard-candle   relation   and   reduce   present  systematic
          uncertainties.  The  survey  will  also  provide  several other
          datasets  such as the detection of baryon acoustic oscillations
          in   the   matter   power   spectrum  and  shear  weak  lensing
          measurements.   In   this   preliminary  analysis  we  forecast
          constraints  on  dark  energy  parameters from SN Ia and baryon
          acoustic  oscillations.  The  combination of these two datasets
          will   provide  competitive  constraints  on  the  dark  energy
          parameters under minimal prior assumptions. Further studies are
          needed to address the accuracy of weak lensing measurements.

          Title: Galactic Globular Clusters with Luminous X-Ray Binaries
          Authors: Joel N. Bregman
          Comments:  20  pages,  8 figures; accepted in The Astrophysical
          Journal
          Luminous  X-ray  binaries  (>1E34  erg/s, LMXBs) have a neutron
          star  or  black hole primary, and in globular clusters, most of
          these close binaries are expected to be have evolved from wider
          binaries  through  dynamical  interactions with other stars. We
          sought  to  find  a  predictor  of  this formation rate that is
          representative  of  the initial properties of globular clusters
          rather  than  of  the  highly  evolved  core quantities. Models
          indicate  the  half-light  quantities  best reflect the initial
          conditions,  so  we  examine  whether  the associated dynamical
          interaction  rate,  proportional  to L^1.5 r^-2.5, is useful in
          understanding  the  presence  of luminous LMXBs in the Galactic
          globular  cluster system. We find that while LMXB clusters with
          large  values  of  L^1.5  r^-2.5 preferentially host LMXBs, the
          systems  must  also have half-mass relaxation times below about
          1E9  yr.  This  relaxation  time effect probably occurs because
          several   relaxation   times  are  required  to  modify  binary
          separations,  a  timescale  that  must  be shorter than cluster
          ages.  The  frequency of finding an LMXB cluster is enhanced if
          the  cluster  is  metal-rich  and  if  it is close to the bulge
          region.  The  dependence  upon  metallicity  is most likely due
          either  to  differing  initial  mass functions at the high mass
          end,  or  because  bulge systems evolve more rapidly from tidal
          interactions  with  the  bulge.  This  approach  can be used to
          investigate  globular  cluster  systems  in  external galaxies,
          where core properties are unresolved.

          Comments:  To  be  published  in  the  March  2006 issue of the
          Astronomical  Journal.  Paper  consists  of  40  pages  with 10
          figures.  Complete  set  of  47  figures  and 2 full electronic
          tables can be found at this http URL
          We  present  near and mid-infrared photometry obtained with the
          Spitzer  Space  Telescope  of  300  known  members of the IC348
          cluster.  We  merge  this photometry with existing ground-based
          optical  and  near-infrared  photometry  in  order to construct
          optical-infrared  spectral  energy distributions (SEDs) for all
          the cluster members and present a complete atlas of these SEDs.
          We  employ these observations to both investigate the frequency
          and nature of the circumstellar disk population in the cluster.
          The observations are sufficiently sensitive to enable the first
          detailed  measurement  of  the disk frequency for very low mass
          stars  at  the  peak  of the stellar IMF. Using measurements of
          infrared  excess  between  3.6  and 8 microns we find the total
          frequency of disk-bearing stars in the cluster to be 50 +/- 6%.
          However,  only  30 +/- 4% of the member stars are surrounded by
          optically   thick,   primordial   disks,  while  the  remaining
          disk-bearing   stars  are  surrounded  by  what  appear  to  be
          optically  thin,anemic disks. The disk fraction appears to be a
          function  of spectral type and stellar mass. The disk longevity
          and  thus  conditions  for  planet  formation appear to be most
          favorable  for  stars  which are of comparable mass to the sun.
          The optically thick disks around later type (> M4) stars appear
          to  be  less  flared  than the disks around earlier type stars.
          This  may indicate a greater degree of dust settling and a more
          advanced  evolutionary  state  for  the late M disk population.
          Finally  we  find  that the presence of an optically thick dust
          disk  is  correlated  with gaseous accretion as measured by the
          strength  of  Halpha emission. These results suggest that it is
          more  likely for dust disks to persist in the absence of active
          gaseous  accretion  than for active accretion to persist in the
          absence of dusty disks.

          Title:   Precession   of  neutrino-cooled  accretion  disks  in
          gamma-ray burst engines
          Authors: Matias M. Reynoso, Gustavo E. Romero, Oscar A. Sampayo
          Comments: 6 pages, 7 figures, submitted
          We  study  the  precession of accretion disks in the context of
          gamma-ray  burst  inner  engines.  With an accretion disk model
          that  allows  for  neutrino  cooling,  we evaluate the possible
          periods   of   disk   precession   and   nutation  due  to  the
          Lense-Thirring  effect.  Assuming jet ejection perpendicular to
          the  disk  midplane and a typical intrinsic time dependence for
          the  burst,  we  find  possible  gamma-ray  light  curves  with
          temporal  microstructure  similar  to  what is observed in some
          subsamples.  We  conclude that the precession and nutation of a
          neutrino-cooled  accretion  disk  in  the burst engine might be
          responsible for some events.

          Title:  A  Blue  Straggler  Binary  System  with at least Three

          Comments: 15 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  show  that the X-ray source W31 in the core of the globular
          cluster  47  Tucanae  is  physically associated with the bright
          blue  straggler  BSS-7.  The  two  sources  are astrometrically
          matched   to   0.061  arcseconds,  with  a  chance  coincidence
          probability  of  less  than 1 per cent. We then analyse optical
          time-series photometry obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope
          (HST)  and  find that BSS-7 displays a 1.56 day periodic signal
          in  the I band. We also construct a broad-band (far-ultraviolet
          through far-red) spectral energy distribution for BSS-7 and fit
          this  with  single  and  binary  models.  The binary model is a
          better fit to the data, and we derive the corresponding stellar
          parameters.
          All of our findings suggest that the BSS-7 system consists of a
          blue     straggler     primary     with     an    X-ray-active,
          upper-main-sequence  companion.  The formation of such a system
          must  have  involved at least three stars, so the simplest blue
          straggler  formation scenarios -- primordial binary coalescence
          or a single 2-body collision -- cannot account for it. However,
          our  results are consistent with recent N-body models, in which
          blue  stragglers  often  form  via multiple encounters that can
          involve both single and binary stars.

          Title:  Interferometric Measurements of Variable 340 GHz Linear
          Polarization in Sagittarius A*
          Authors:  D.  P.  Marrone,  J.  M.  Moran,  J.-H.  Zhao, R. Rao
          (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)
          Comments: 12 pages, 4 figures. To appear in ApJ
          Using  the  Submillimeter  Array,  we  have made the first high
          angular  resolution  measurements of the linear polarization of
          Sagittarius  A*  at  submillimeter  wavelengths,  and the first
          detection  of intra-day variability in its linear polarization.
          We  detected  linear polarization at 340 GHz (880um) at several
          epochs.  At  the  typical resolution of 1.4"x2.2", the expected
          contamination  from  the surrounding (partially polarized) dust
          emission  is  negligible.  We  found that both the polarization
          fraction and position angle are variable, with the polarization
          fraction  dropping  from  8.5% to 2.3% over three days. This is
          the  first significant measurement of variability in the linear
          polarization fraction in this source. We also found variability
          in  the  polarization and total intensity within single nights,
          although  the  relationship  between  the two is not clear from
          these  data.  The  simultaneous 332 and 342 GHz position angles
          are  the  same, setting a one-sigma rotation measure (RM) upper
          limit  of  7x10^5  rad/m^2.  From position angle variations and
          comparison  of "quiescent" position angles observed here and at
          230  GHz  we  infer  that the RM is a few times 10^5 rad/m^2, a
          factor of a few below our direct detection limit. A generalized
          model  of  the  RM produced in the accretion flow suggests that
          the accretion rate at small radii must be low, below 10^{-6} to
          10^{-7}  M_{sun}/year  depending  on  the  radial  density  and
          temperature  profiles,  but  in all cases below the gas capture
          rate inferred from X-ray observations.

          Title:  Thick  fireballs and the steep decay in the early X-ray
          afterglow of gamma-ray bursts
          Authors:  Davide  Lazzati, Mitch Begelman (JILA - University of
          Colorado)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          We  study  the early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts produced by
          geometrically thick fireballs, following the development of the
          external shock as energy is continually supplied to the shocked
          material.  We study the dependence of the early afterglow slope
          on  the luminosity history of the central engine. The resulting
          light  curves  are  modeled  with  power-law  functions and the
          importance  of  a  correct  choice of the reference time t_0 is
          investigated.  We  find that deviations from a simple power-law
          are observed only if a large majority of the energy is released
          at late times. The light curve in this case can be described as
          a  simple power-law if the reference time is set to be close to
          the  end  of the burst. We applied our analysis to the cases of
          GRB  050219a and GRB 030515. We show that the early steep decay
          of  the  afterglow  cannot  result  from the interaction of the
          fireball  with  the  ambient medium. We conclude that the early
          X-ray  afterglow  emission  is associated with the prompt phase
          and  we  derive  limits  on  the  radius  at  which  the prompt
          radiation is produced.

          Only  seven  radio-quiet isolated neutron stars (INSs) emitting
          thermal X rays are known, a sample that has yet to definitively
          address  such  fundamental  issues  as the equation of state of
          degenerate  neutron  matter.  We describe a selection algorithm
          based on a cross-correlation of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS)
          and  the  Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that identifies X-ray
          error  circles  devoid of plausible optical counterparts to the
          SDSS  g~22  magnitudes  limit.  We  quantitatively characterize
          these  error  circles as optically blank; they may host INSs or
          other  similarly  exotic  X-ray  sources such as radio-quiet BL
          Lacs,  obscured  AGN,  etc. Our search is an order of magnitude
          more  selective than previous searches for optically blank RASS
          error  circles,  and  excludes  the 99.9% of error circles that
          contain  more  common  X-ray-emitting  subclasses.  We  find 11
          candidates, nine of which are new. While our search is designed
          to  find  the best INS candidates and not to produce a complete
          list  of  INSs in the RASS, it is reassuring that our number of
          candidates  is  consistent with predictions from INS population
          models.   Further   X-ray  observations  will  obtain  pinpoint
          positions  and  determine  whether  these  sources are entirely
          optically  blank  at  g~22,  supporting  the presence of likely
          isolated  neutron stars and perhaps enabling detailed follow-up
          studies of neutron star physics.

          Process
          Authors: Govind Menon, Charles D. Dermer
          Comments: 8 pages, no figures
          We  analyze  the  constraint  equation giving allowed solutions
          describing  fields  and  currents in a force-free magnetosphere
          around   a   rotating  black  hole.  Utilizing  the  divergence
          properties  of  the  energy  and  angular-momentum  fluxes  for
          physically   allowed   solutions,  we  conclude  that  poloidal
          surfaces  are  independent  of  the radial coordinate for large
          values  of  $r$.  Using  this  fact  and  the Znajek regularity
          condition,  we  explicitly  derive all possible exact solutions
          admitted   by  the  constraint  equation  for  $r$  independent
          poloidal   surfaces,   which   are   given   in  terms  of  the
          electromagnetic    angular    velocity   function   $\Omega   =
          1/a\sin^2\theta$,  where  $a$  is the angular momentum per unit
          mass of the black hole.

          Title: Observational Constraints on the Braneworld Geometry
          Authors: Gonzalo A. Palma (DAMTP, University of Cambridge)
          Comments: 11 pages, 6 figures
          The  low  energy  regime  of  5-D braneworld models with a bulk
          scalar  field  is  studied.  The  setup  is  rather general and
          includes  the  Randall-Sundrum and dilatonic braneworlds models
          as  particular  cases. We discuss the cosmological evolution of
          the  system  and  conclude  that,  in  a  two brane system, the
          negative  tension brane is generally expected to evolve towards
          a   null   warp-factor  state.  This  implies,  for  late  time
          cosmology,  that both branes end up interacting weakly. We also
          analyze  the  observational constraints imposed by solar-system
          and  binary-pulsar  tests on the braneworld configuration. This
          is  done  by  considering  the small deviations produced by the
          branes  on  the 4-D gravitational interaction between bodies in
          the  same  brane.  Using  these  constraints  we  show that the
          geometry  around  the  braneworld  is strongly warped, and that
          both branes must be far apart.

          Title:  Gamma-Ray  Burst  Synthetic  Spectra from Collisionless
          Shock PIC Simulations
          Authors: Christian Busk Hededal, ke Nordlund
          Comments:  5  pages,  4 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical
          Journal Letters
          The  radiation from afterglows of gamma-ray bursts is generated
          in   the   collisionless   plasma  shock  interface  between  a
          relativistic  outflow  and a quiescent circum-burst medium. The
          two   main   ingredients  responsible  for  the  radiation  are
          high-energy, non-thermal electrons and a strong magnetic field.
          In  this  Letter  we  present,  for  the  first time, synthetic
          spectra    extracted    directly    from    first    principles
          particle-in-cell simulations of relativist collisionless plasma
          shocks.  The  spectra  are  generated  by  a  numerical Fourier
          transformation of the electrical far-field from each of a large
          number of particles, sampled directly from the particle-in-cell
          simulations. Both the electromagnetic field and the non-thermal
          particle  acceleration  are  self-consistent  products  of  the
          Weibel  two-stream  instability.  We  find  that  the radiation
          spectrum   from  a  $\Gamma=15$  shock  simulation  show  great
          resemblance   with   observed   GRB   spectra   --  we  compare
          specifically with that of GRB000301C.

          Title: ISM gas removal from starburst galxies and the premature
          death of star clusters
          Authors: C. Melioli, E. M. de Gouveia Dal Pino
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, A&A Letter accepted
          Recent  observational  studies  of the age distribution of star
          clusters in nearby merging galaxies and starburst (SB) galaxies
          indicate  a  premature death of the young clusters. The fate of
          an  evolving star cluster crucially depends of its gas content.
          This  behaves  like  a  glue that helps to keep the star system
          gravitationally   bound.  In  SB  systems  where  the  rate  of
          supernovae  (SNe)  explosions  is elevated one should expect an
          efficient  heating  of  the  gas and its complete removal which
          could  then  favor  the rapid dissociation of the evolving star
          clusters.  Based  on  a  contemporaneous study of the dynamical
          evolution of the interstellar gas in SB environments (Melioli &
          de Gouveia Dal Pino 2004) where it has been considered also the
          presence   of   dense  clouds  that  may  inhibit  the  heating
          efficiency  of  the  interstellar  gas by the SNe, we have here
          computed  the  timescales  for  gas removal from young clusters
          embedded  in  these  systems and found that they are consistent

          We  present  the results of a deep optical survey in the Corona
          Australis  and  Chamaeleon II star forming regions. Our optical
          photometry  is  combined  with available near- and mid-infrared
          photometry to identify very low-mass candidate members in these
          dark  clouds.  In  our  Chamaeleon  II  field,  only one object
          exhibits  clear  H-alpha  emission, but the discrepancy between
          its optical and near-infrared colours suggests that it might be
          a foreground star. We also identify two objects without H-alpha
          emission that could be planetary mass members of Chamaeleon II.
          In  Corona  Australis,  we find ten stars and three brown dwarf
          candidates  in the Coronet cluster. Five of our new members are
          identified  with  ISOCAM  sources.  Only  two  of  them  have a
          mid-infrared  excess,  indicating  the presence of an accretion
          disk.  On the other hand, one brown dwarf candidate has a faint
          close  companion,  seen  only  in our deepest I-band image. For
          many  of the candidates in both clouds, membership could not be
          inferred  from their H-alpha emission or near-infrared colours;
          these objects need spectroscopic confirmation of their status.

          Here  we  investigate the variability of physical parameters in
          the  broad  line  region  (BLR) of NGC 5548 using the BP method
          given  by  Popovic  (2003).  We  apply the method on the Balmer
          lines  observed from 1996 till 2004, and found that variability
          seen  in lines, is also present in the electron temperature. We
          found that the averaged electron temperature for the period was
          T=  22600 K, and that varies from 12 000 K (in 2002) till 34000
          K  (in  1998).  This  variation  cannot  be  explained  with an
          intrinsic  extinction  and  it  presents  real  variability  in
          physical  parameters:  the electron temperature and density. We
          found   a   high  correlation  between  the  optical  continuum
          intensity  and  electron  temperature  (r=0.85)  that  supports
          existence of an accretion disk in the BLR of NGC 5548.

          Title:  Gamma-Ray  Burst  Synthetic  Spectra from Collisionless

          Authors: Christian Busk Hededal, ke Nordlund
          Comments:  5  pages,  4 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical
          Journal Letters
          The  radiation from afterglows of gamma-ray bursts is generated
          in   the   collisionless   plasma  shock  interface  between  a
          relativistic  outflow  and a quiescent circum-burst medium. The
          two   main   ingredients  responsible  for  the  radiation  are
          high-energy, non-thermal electrons and a strong magnetic field.
          In  this  Letter  we  present,  for  the  first time, synthetic
          spectra    extracted    directly    from    first    principles
          particle-in-cell simulations of relativist collisionless plasma
          shocks.  The  spectra  are  generated  by  a  numerical Fourier
          transformation of the electrical far-field from each of a large
          number of particles, sampled directly from the particle-in-cell
          simulations. Both the electromagnetic field and the non-thermal
          particle  acceleration  are  self-consistent  products  of  the
          Weibel  two-stream  instability.  We  find  that  the radiation
          spectrum   from  a  $\Gamma=15$  shock  simulation  show  great
          resemblance   with   observed   GRB   spectra   --  we  compare
          specifically with that of GRB000301C.

          Title: ISM gas removal from starburst galxies and the premature
          death of star clusters
          Authors: C. Melioli, E. M. de Gouveia Dal Pino
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, A&A Letter accepted
          Recent  observational  studies  of the age distribution of star
          clusters in nearby merging galaxies and starburst (SB) galaxies
          indicate  a  premature death of the young clusters. The fate of
          an  evolving star cluster crucially depends of its gas content.
          This  behaves  like  a  glue that helps to keep the star system
          gravitationally   bound.  In  SB  systems  where  the  rate  of
          supernovae  (SNe)  explosions  is elevated one should expect an
          efficient  heating  of  the  gas and its complete removal which
          could  then  favor  the rapid dissociation of the evolving star
          clusters.  Based  on  a  contemporaneous study of the dynamical
          evolution of the interstellar gas in SB environments (Melioli &
          de Gouveia Dal Pino 2004) where it has been considered also the
          presence   of   dense  clouds  that  may  inhibit  the  heating
          efficiency  of  the  interstellar  gas by the SNe, we have here
          computed  the  timescales  for  gas removal from young clusters
          embedded  in  these  systems and found that they are consistent
          with  the  very  short timescales for cluster dissolution which
          are  inferred from the observational studies above. Our results
          indicate   that  typical  SB  proto-clusters  should  start  to

          Comments: New Astronomy, in press
          Hot  gaseous  haloes  surrounding  galaxies  and extending well
          beyond the distribution of stars are a ubiquitous prediction of
          galaxy  formation scenarios. The haloes are believed to consist
          of  gravitationally  trapped gas with a temperature of millions
          of  Kelvin.  The  existence  of  such hot haloes around massive
          elliptical  galaxies  has  been established through their X-ray
          emission.  While gas out-flowing from starburst spiral galaxies
          has  been  detected,  searches  for  hot  haloes around normal,
          quiescent spiral galaxies have so far failed, casting doubts on
          the  fundamental  physics  in  galaxy formation models. Here we
          present  the first detection of a hot, large-scale gaseous halo
          surrounding  a  normal,  quiescent  spiral  galaxy,  NGC  5746,
          alleviating   a  long-standing  problem  for  galaxy  formation
          models. In contrast to starburst galaxies, where the X-ray halo
          can  be powered by the supernova energy, there is no such power
          source  in NGC 5746. The only compelling explanation is that we
          are  here witnessing a galaxy forming from gradually in-flowing
          hot and dilute halo gas.

          Title:  Reviving  Dead  Zones  in  Accretion  Disks  by  Rossby
          Vortices at their Boundaries
          Authors: P.varniere, M.Tagger
          Comments: accepted by A&A letters
          Models  of  the  accretion  disks of Young Stellar Objects show
          that  they should not be ionized at a few AU from the star, and
          thus  not  subject  to  the  MHD  turbulence  believed to cause
          accretion.  This  has  been  suggested  to create a 'Dead Zone'
          where  accretion  remains  unexplained.  Here  we show that the
          existence  of the Dead Zone self-consistently creates a density

          Title: Direct magnetic field detection in the innermost regions
          of an accretion disc

          Models  predict that magnetic fields play a crucial role in the
          physics  of  astrophysical accretion disks and their associated
          winds  and  jets.  For example, the rotation of the disk twists
          around the rotation axis the initially vertical magnetic field,
          which  responds  by  slowing down the plasma in the disk and by
          causing  it  to  fall  towards  the  central star. The magnetic
          energy flux produced in this process points away from the disk,
          pushing the surface plasma outwards, leading to a wind from the
          disk and sometimes a collimated jet. But these predictions have
          hitherto not been supported by observations. Here we report the
          direct  detection  of  the  magnetic  field  in the core of the
          protostellar  accretion  disk  FU  Orionis.  The  surface field
          reaches  strengths  of  about  1  kG close to the centre of the
          disk,  and  it  includes  a significant azimuthal component, in
          good  agreement  with recent models. But we find that the field
          is  very  filamentary  and slows down the disk plasma much more
          than  models  predict,  which  may  explain why FU Ori fails to
          collimate its wind into a jet.

          The  most  intense  monitoring  observations  yet  made  in the
          optical  (UBV)  and near-infrared (JHK) wave bands were carried
          out  for  nearby  Seyfert1  galaxies of NGC 5548, NGC 4051, NGC
          3227,  and  NGC  7469.  Over  three  years of observations with
          MAGNUM  telescope since early 2001, clear time-delayed response
          of the K-band flux variations to the V-band flux variations was
          detected for all of these galaxies. Their H-K color temperature
          was  estimated  to  be  1500-1800  K  from  the  observed  flux
          variation gradients, which supports a view that the bulk of the
          K  flux  should  originate in the thermal radiation of hot dust
          that  surrounds  the central engine. Cross-correlation analysis
          was  performed  to  quantify  the lag time corresponding to the
          light-travel  distance  of the hot dust region from the central
          engine. The measured lag time is 47-53 days for NGC 5548, 11-18
          days  for  NGC 4051, about 20 days for NGC 3227, and 65-87 days
          for  NGC 7469. We found that the lag time is tightly correlated
          with the optical luminosity as expected from dust reverberation
          ($\Delta  t  \propto  L^{0.5}$),  while  only  weakly  with the
          central virial mass, which suggests that an inner radius of the
          dust   torus   around  the  active  nucleus  has  a  one-to-one
          correspondence  to  central  luminosity. In the lag time versus
          central luminosity diagram, the K-band lag times place an upper
          boundary  on  the  similar lag times of broad-emission lines in
          the  literature.  This  not only supports the unified scheme of
          AGNs,  but  also implies a physical transition from the BLR out
          to  the  dust  torus  that  encircles the BLR. Furthermore, our
          V-band  flux  variations  of NGC 5548 on timescales of up to 10
          days  are  found  to  correlate with X-ray variations and delay
          behind  them  by  one  or  two  days,  indicating  the  thermal
          reprocessing of X-ray emission by the central accretion flow.

          Title: Curvature effect in structured GRB jets
          Authors: J. Dyks, Bing Zhang, Y. Z. Fan
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We study the influence of jet structure on the curvature effect
          in a GRB-lightcurve. Using a simple model of jet emissivity, we
          numerically  calculate  lightcurves  for  a  short flash from a
          relativistic  outflow  having  various  profiles of the Lorentz
          factor     and    outflowing    energy    density    (gaussian,
          core+power-law).  We  find that for "on-beam" viewing geometry,
          with  the  line of sight passing through the bright core of the
          outflow,  the  shape  of  the  lightcurve  practically does not
          depend  on  the jet structure, initially following the temporal
          slope  2+delta,  where  delta  is  the spectral index. When the
          viewing angle is larger than the core, the light curve decaying
          slope  is shallower. We discuss the implications of our results
          for the Swift data.

          Title: Resonance Overlap is Responsible for Ejecting Planets in
          Binary Systems
          Authors: Lawrence R. Mudryk, Yanqin Wu
          Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophyical Journal.
          Consists of 8 pages, 6 figures
          A  planet  orbiting  around  a  star  in a binary system can be
          ejected  if  it  lies  too far from its host star. We find that
          instability  boundaries first obtained in numerical studies can
          be   explained   by   overlap   between  sub-resonances  within
          mean-motion resonances (mostly of the j:1 type). Strong secular
          forcing from the companion displaces the centroids of different
          sub-resonances,  producing  large regions of resonance overlap.
          Planets  lying  within  these  overlapping  regions  experience
          chaotic  diffusion, which in most cases leads to their eventual
          ejection.  The  overlap region extends to shorter-period orbits
          as  either  the  companion's mass or its eccentricity increase.
          Our   analytical   calculations   reproduce   the   instability
          boundaries   observed   in  numerical  studies  and  yield  the
          following  two  additional  results.  Firstly,  the instability
          boundary  as  a  function  of eccentricity is jagged; thus, the
          widest  stable  orbit  could  be reduced from previously quoted
          values  by as much as 20%. Secondly, very high order resonances
          (e.g.,  50:3)  do  not  significantly  modify  the  instability
          boundary  despite  the  fact  that  these  weak  resonances can
          produce   slow   chaotic  diffusion  which  may  be  missed  by
          finite-duration   numerical   integrations.   We  present  some
          numerical   evidence  for  the  first  result.  More  extensive
          experiments  are  called  for to confirm these conclusions. For
          the  special  case  of circular binaries, we find that the Hill
          criterion  (based  on  the  critical Jacobi integral) yields an
          instability  boundary  that is very similar to that obtained by
          resonance overlap arguments, making the former both a necessary
          and a sufficient condition for planet instability.

          Title: Roche Lobe Sizes in Deep-MOND Gravity
          Authors: HongSheng Zhao
          Comments:  4  pages,  2  figures,  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics
          Letter, in press
          MOdified   Newtonian   Dynamics  (MOND)  is  evolving  from  an
          empirical  to  a  decent  theory respecting fundamental physics
          after   Bekenstein   (2004)  showed  that  lensing  and  Hubble
          expansion  can be modeled rigourously in a Modified Relativity.
          However, many properties of MOND are obscured by its non-linear
          Poisson's  equation.  Here  we  study the effect of tides for a
          binary  stellar  system  or  a  baryonic  satellite-host galaxy
          system.  We  show that the Roche lobe is more squashed than the
          Newtonian  case  due  to  the  anisotropic  dilation  effect in
          deep-MOND.  We  prove  analytically  that the Roche lobe volume
          scales  linearly  with  the  "true" baryonic mass ratio in both
          Newtonian   and   deep-MOND   regimes,   insensitive   to   the
          modification to the inertia mass. Hence accurate Roche radii of
          satellites  can  break  the  degeneracy of MOND and dark matter
          theory.  Globular  clusters  and  dwarf  galaxies of comparable
          luminosities  and  distances  show  a  factor of ten scatter in
          limiting   radii;   this   is   difficult  to  explain  in  any
          "mass-tracing-light" universe.

          We  report  on  high  resolution  spectra  of  the  bright  QSO
          HS0747+4259  (zem  =  1.90,  V  =  15.8) observed to search for
          intermediate  redshift OVI absorption systems. The spectra were
          obtained  by  means of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
          (STIS)  at  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  (HST)  and  the High
          Resolution  Echelle  Spectrometer  (HIRES)  at  the  W. M. Keck
          telescope. We identify 16 OVI systems in the range 1.07 <= z <=
          1.87.  Among  them,  six systems with zabs = 1.46-1.8 exhibit a
          sufficient  number  of  lines of different ionic transitions to
          estimate the shape of the ionizing radiation field in the range
          1  Ryd  <  E  <  10  Ryd. All recovered UV ionizing spectra are
          characterized  by  the enhanced intensity at E > 3 Ryd compared
          to  the  model  spectrum of Haardt and Madau (1996). This is in
          line  with the observational evidence of a deficiency of strong
          Ly-alpha  absorbers with N(HI) > 10^{15} cm^{-2}, at z < 2. The
          UV  background shows significant local variations: the spectral
          shape  estimated  at z = 1.59 differs from that obtained at z =
          1.81  and  1.73.  A  possible  cause of these variations is the
          presence  of  a  QSO/AGN at z ~= 1.54-1.59 close to the line of
          sight.  No  features favoring the input of stellar radiation to
          the  ionizing  background  are  detected,  limiting  the escape
          fraction of the galactic UV photons to f_esc < 0.05.

          Astronomy and Astrophysics
          We  report  the  results  of  an observation of Cygnus X-1 with
          INTEGRAL,  that we combine with simultaneous radio observations
          with   the   Ryle  telescope.  Both  spectral  and  variability
          properties  of  the  source  indicate that Cygnus X-1 was in an
          Intermediate  State.  The INTEGRAL spectrum shows a high-energy
          cut-off  or  break  around  100  keV. The shape of this cut-off
          differs   from  pure  thermal  Comptonisation,  suggesting  the
          presence  of  a  non-thermal  component  at higher energies.The
          average  broad  band  spectrum  is  well  represented by hybrid
          thermal/non-thermal  Comptonisation  models.  During  the 4 day
          long  observation  the  source showed an important spectral and
          flux  variability.  A principal component analysis demonstrates
          that  most  of  this  variability  occurs through 2 independent
          modes.  The  first  mode  consists  in  changes  in the overall
          luminosity  on time scale of hours with almost constant spectra
          that  are strikingly uncorrelated with the variable radio flux.
          We  interpret  this  variability  mode  as  variations  of  the
          dissipation  rate  in  the  corona. The second variability mode
          consists  in  a pivoting of the spectrum around 10 keV. It acts
          on a longer time-scale: initially soft, the spectrum hardens in
          the  first part of the observation and then softens again. This
          pivoting pattern is strongly correlated with the radio (15 GHz)
          emission:  radio fluxes are stronger when the INTEGRAL spectrum
          is  harder.  We  propose  that  the  pivoting mode represents a
          'mini'  state  transition  from  a  nearly High Soft State to a
          nearly  Low Hard State, and back. This mini-transition would be
          caused  by  changes in the soft cooling photons flux in the hot
          Comptonising   plasma   associated  with  an  increase  of  the
          temperature  of  the accretion disc. The jet power then appears
          to be anti-correlated with the disc luminosity and unrelated to
          the coronal power.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJS
          We present integrated optical spectrophotometry for a sample of
          417  nearby  galaxies.  Our  observations  consist of spatially
          integrated,  S/N=10-100  spectroscopy  between  3600  and  6900
          Angstroms  at  ~8  Angstroms  FWHM  resolution. In addition, we
          present  nuclear  (2.5"x2.5")  spectroscopy  for  153  of these
          objects.  Our  sample  targets a diverse range of galaxy types,
          including  starbursts,  peculiar  galaxies, interacting/merging
          systems,  dusty,  infrared-luminous galaxies, and a significant
          number of normal galaxies. We use population synthesis to model
          and  subtract  the  stellar  continuum  underlying  the nebular
          emission   lines.   This  technique  results  in  emission-line
          measurements  reliably  corrected for stellar absorption. Here,
          we  present  the  integrated  and  nuclear spectra, the nebular
          emission-line fluxes and equivalent widths, and a comprehensive
          compilation  of  ancillary data available in the literature for
          our  sample. In a series of subsequent papers we use these data
          to   study  optical  star-formation  rate  indicators,  nebular
          abundance diagnostics, the luminosity-metallicity relation, the
          dust  properties  of  normal  and  starburst  galaxies, and the

          Hot  gaseous  haloes  surrounding  galaxies  and extending well
          beyond the distribution of stars are a ubiquitous prediction of
          galaxy  formation scenarios. The haloes are believed to consist
          of  gravitationally  trapped gas with a temperature of millions
          of  Kelvin.  The  existence  of  such hot haloes around massive
          elliptical  galaxies  has  been established through their X-ray
          emission.  While gas out-flowing from starburst spiral galaxies
          has  been  detected,  searches  for  hot  haloes around normal,
          quiescent spiral galaxies have so far failed, casting doubts on
          the  fundamental  physics  in  galaxy formation models. Here we
          present  the first detection of a hot, large-scale gaseous halo
          surrounding  a  normal,  quiescent  spiral  galaxy,  NGC  5746,
          alleviating   a  long-standing  problem  for  galaxy  formation
          models. In contrast to starburst galaxies, where the X-ray halo
          can  be powered by the supernova energy, there is no such power
          source  in NGC 5746. The only compelling explanation is that we
          are  here witnessing a galaxy forming from gradually in-flowing
          hot and dilute halo gas.

          Title:  Reviving  Dead  Zones  in  Accretion  Disks  by  Rossby
          Vortices at their Boundaries
          Authors: P.varniere, M.Tagger
          Comments: accepted by A&A letters
          Models  of  the  accretion  disks of Young Stellar Objects show
          that  they should not be ionized at a few AU from the star, and
          thus  not  subject  to  the  MHD  turbulence  believed to cause
          accretion.  This  has  been  suggested  to create a 'Dead Zone'
          where  accretion  remains  unexplained.  Here  we show that the
          existence  of the Dead Zone self-consistently creates a density
          profile favorable to the Rossby Wave Instability of Lovelace et
          al.  (1999).  This  instability  will create and sustain Rossby
          vortices  in  the  disk  which  could  lead  to enhanced planet
          formation.

          Models  predict that magnetic fields play a crucial role in the
          physics  of  astrophysical accretion disks and their associated
          winds  and  jets.  For example, the rotation of the disk twists
          around the rotation axis the initially vertical magnetic field,
          which  responds  by  slowing down the plasma in the disk and by
          causing  it  to  fall  towards  the  central star. The magnetic
          energy flux produced in this process points away from the disk,
          pushing the surface plasma outwards, leading to a wind from the
          disk and sometimes a collimated jet. But these predictions have
          hitherto not been supported by observations. Here we report the
          direct  detection  of  the  magnetic  field  in the core of the
          protostellar  accretion  disk  FU  Orionis.  The  surface field
          reaches  strengths  of  about  1  kG close to the centre of the
          disk,  and  it  includes  a significant azimuthal component, in
          good  agreement  with recent models. But we find that the field
          is  very  filamentary  and slows down the disk plasma much more
          than  models  predict,  which  may  explain why FU Ori fails to
          collimate its wind into a jet.

          The  most  intense  monitoring  observations  yet  made  in the
          optical  (UBV)  and near-infrared (JHK) wave bands were carried
          out  for  nearby  Seyfert1  galaxies of NGC 5548, NGC 4051, NGC
          3227,  and  NGC  7469.  Over  three  years of observations with
          MAGNUM  telescope since early 2001, clear time-delayed response
          of the K-band flux variations to the V-band flux variations was
          detected for all of these galaxies. Their H-K color temperature
          was  estimated  to  be  1500-1800  K  from  the  observed  flux
          variation gradients, which supports a view that the bulk of the
          K  flux  should  originate in the thermal radiation of hot dust
          that  surrounds  the central engine. Cross-correlation analysis
          was  performed  to  quantify  the lag time corresponding to the
          light-travel  distance  of the hot dust region from the central
          engine. The measured lag time is 47-53 days for NGC 5548, 11-18
          days  for  NGC 4051, about 20 days for NGC 3227, and 65-87 days
          for  NGC 7469. We found that the lag time is tightly correlated
          with the optical luminosity as expected from dust reverberation
          ($\Delta  t  \propto  L^{0.5}$),  while  only  weakly  with the
          central virial mass, which suggests that an inner radius of the
          dust   torus   around  the  active  nucleus  has  a  one-to-one
          correspondence  to  central  luminosity. In the lag time versus
          central luminosity diagram, the K-band lag times place an upper
          boundary  on  the  similar lag times of broad-emission lines in
          the  literature.  This  not only supports the unified scheme of
          AGNs,  but  also implies a physical transition from the BLR out
          to  the  dust  torus  that  encircles the BLR. Furthermore, our
          V-band  flux  variations  of NGC 5548 on timescales of up to 10
          days  are  found  to  correlate with X-ray variations and delay
          behind  them  by  one  or  two  days,  indicating  the  thermal
          reprocessing of X-ray emission by the central accretion flow.

          Title: Curvature effect in structured GRB jets
          Authors: J. Dyks, Bing Zhang, Y. Z. Fan
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We study the influence of jet structure on the curvature effect
          in a GRB-lightcurve. Using a simple model of jet emissivity, we
          numerically  calculate  lightcurves  for  a  short flash from a
          relativistic  outflow  having  various  profiles of the Lorentz
          factor     and    outflowing    energy    density    (gaussian,
          core+power-law).  We  find that for "on-beam" viewing geometry,
          with  the  line of sight passing through the bright core of the
          outflow,  the  shape  of  the  lightcurve  practically does not
          depend  on  the jet structure, initially following the temporal
          slope  2+delta,  where  delta  is  the spectral index. When the
          viewing angle is larger than the core, the light curve decaying
          slope  is shallower. We discuss the implications of our results
          for the Swift data.

          Title: Resonance Overlap is Responsible for Ejecting Planets in
          Binary Systems
          Authors: Lawrence R. Mudryk, Yanqin Wu
          Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophyical Journal.
          Consists of 8 pages, 6 figures
          A  planet  orbiting  around  a  star  in a binary system can be
          ejected  if  it  lies  too far from its host star. We find that
          instability  boundaries first obtained in numerical studies can
          be   explained   by   overlap   between  sub-resonances  within
          mean-motion resonances (mostly of the j:1 type). Strong secular
          forcing from the companion displaces the centroids of different
          sub-resonances,  producing  large regions of resonance overlap.
          Planets  lying  within  these  overlapping  regions  experience
          chaotic  diffusion, which in most cases leads to their eventual
          ejection.  The  overlap region extends to shorter-period orbits
          as  either  the  companion's mass or its eccentricity increase.
          Our   analytical   calculations   reproduce   the   instability
          boundaries   observed   in  numerical  studies  and  yield  the
          following  two  additional  results.  Firstly,  the instability
          boundary  as  a  function  of eccentricity is jagged; thus, the
          widest  stable  orbit  could  be reduced from previously quoted
          values  by as much as 20%. Secondly, very high order resonances
          (e.g.,  50:3)  do  not  significantly  modify  the  instability
          boundary  despite  the  fact  that  these  weak  resonances can
          produce   slow   chaotic  diffusion  which  may  be  missed  by
          finite-duration   numerical   integrations.   We  present  some
          numerical   evidence  for  the  first  result.  More  extensive
          experiments  are  called  for to confirm these conclusions. For
          the  special  case  of circular binaries, we find that the Hill
          criterion  (based  on  the  critical Jacobi integral) yields an
          instability  boundary  that is very similar to that obtained by
          resonance overlap arguments, making the former both a necessary
          and a sufficient condition for planet instability.

          Title: Roche Lobe Sizes in Deep-MOND Gravity
          Authors: HongSheng Zhao
          Comments:  4  pages,  2  figures,  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics
          Letter, in press
          MOdified   Newtonian   Dynamics  (MOND)  is  evolving  from  an
          empirical  to  a  decent  theory respecting fundamental physics
          after   Bekenstein   (2004)  showed  that  lensing  and  Hubble
          expansion  can be modeled rigourously in a Modified Relativity.
          However, many properties of MOND are obscured by its non-linear
          Poisson's  equation.  Here  we  study the effect of tides for a
          binary  stellar  system  or  a  baryonic  satellite-host galaxy
          system.  We  show that the Roche lobe is more squashed than the
          Newtonian  case  due  to  the  anisotropic  dilation  effect in
          deep-MOND.  We  prove  analytically  that the Roche lobe volume
          scales  linearly  with  the  "true" baryonic mass ratio in both
          Newtonian   and   deep-MOND   regimes,   insensitive   to   the
          modification to the inertia mass. Hence accurate Roche radii of
          satellites  can  break  the  degeneracy of MOND and dark matter
          theory.  Globular  clusters  and  dwarf  galaxies of comparable
          luminosities  and  distances  show  a  factor of ten scatter in
          limiting   radii;   this   is   difficult  to  explain  in  any
          "mass-tracing-light" universe.

          Title:  Spectral  shape  of  the UV ionizing background and OVI
          absorbers at z ~ 1.5 towards HS0747+4259

          publication in A&A
          We  report  on  high  resolution  spectra  of  the  bright  QSO
          HS0747+4259  (zem  =  1.90,  V  =  15.8) observed to search for
          intermediate  redshift OVI absorption systems. The spectra were
          obtained  by  means of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
          (STIS)  at  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  (HST)  and  the High
          Resolution  Echelle  Spectrometer  (HIRES)  at  the  W. M. Keck
          telescope. We identify 16 OVI systems in the range 1.07 <= z <=
          1.87.  Among  them,  six systems with zabs = 1.46-1.8 exhibit a
          sufficient  number  of  lines of different ionic transitions to
          estimate the shape of the ionizing radiation field in the range
          1  Ryd  <  E  <  10  Ryd. All recovered UV ionizing spectra are
          characterized  by  the enhanced intensity at E > 3 Ryd compared
          to  the  model  spectrum of Haardt and Madau (1996). This is in
          line  with the observational evidence of a deficiency of strong
          Ly-alpha  absorbers with N(HI) > 10^{15} cm^{-2}, at z < 2. The
          UV  background shows significant local variations: the spectral
          shape  estimated  at z = 1.59 differs from that obtained at z =
          1.81  and  1.73.  A  possible  cause of these variations is the
          presence  of  a  QSO/AGN at z ~= 1.54-1.59 close to the line of
          sight.  No  features favoring the input of stellar radiation to
          the  ionizing  background  are  detected,  limiting  the escape
          fraction of the galactic UV photons to f_esc < 0.05.

          Astronomy and Astrophysics
          We  report  the  results  of  an observation of Cygnus X-1 with
          INTEGRAL,  that we combine with simultaneous radio observations
          with   the   Ryle  telescope.  Both  spectral  and  variability
          properties  of  the  source  indicate that Cygnus X-1 was in an
          Intermediate  State.  The INTEGRAL spectrum shows a high-energy
          cut-off  or  break  around  100  keV. The shape of this cut-off
          differs   from  pure  thermal  Comptonisation,  suggesting  the
          presence  of  a  non-thermal  component  at higher energies.The
          average  broad  band  spectrum  is  well  represented by hybrid
          thermal/non-thermal  Comptonisation  models.  During  the 4 day
          long  observation  the  source showed an important spectral and
          flux  variability.  A principal component analysis demonstrates
          that  most  of  this  variability  occurs through 2 independent
          modes.  The  first  mode  consists  in  changes  in the overall
          luminosity  on time scale of hours with almost constant spectra
          that  are strikingly uncorrelated with the variable radio flux.
          We  interpret  this  variability  mode  as  variations  of  the
          dissipation  rate  in  the  corona. The second variability mode
          consists  in  a pivoting of the spectrum around 10 keV. It acts
          on a longer time-scale: initially soft, the spectrum hardens in
          the  first part of the observation and then softens again. This
          pivoting pattern is strongly correlated with the radio (15 GHz)
          emission:  radio fluxes are stronger when the INTEGRAL spectrum
          is  harder.  We  propose  that  the  pivoting mode represents a
          'mini'  state  transition  from  a  nearly High Soft State to a
          nearly  Low Hard State, and back. This mini-transition would be
          caused  by  changes in the soft cooling photons flux in the hot
          Comptonising   plasma   associated  with  an  increase  of  the
          temperature  of  the accretion disc. The jet power then appears
          to be anti-correlated with the disc luminosity and unrelated to
          the coronal power.

          Title:   An  Integrated  Spectrophotometric  Survey  of  Nearby
          Star-Forming Galaxies
          Authors: John Moustakas, Robert C. Kennicutt Jr
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJS
          We present integrated optical spectrophotometry for a sample of
          417  nearby  galaxies.  Our  observations  consist of spatially
          integrated,  S/N=10-100  spectroscopy  between  3600  and  6900
          Angstroms  at  ~8  Angstroms  FWHM  resolution. In addition, we
          present  nuclear  (2.5"x2.5")  spectroscopy  for  153  of these
          objects.  Our  sample  targets a diverse range of galaxy types,
          including  starbursts,  peculiar  galaxies, interacting/merging
          systems,  dusty,  infrared-luminous galaxies, and a significant
          number of normal galaxies. We use population synthesis to model
          and  subtract  the  stellar  continuum  underlying  the nebular
          emission   lines.   This  technique  results  in  emission-line
          measurements  reliably  corrected for stellar absorption. Here,
          we  present  the  integrated  and  nuclear spectra, the nebular
          emission-line fluxes and equivalent widths, and a comprehensive
          compilation  of  ancillary data available in the literature for
          our  sample. In a series of subsequent papers we use these data
          to   study  optical  star-formation  rate  indicators,  nebular
          abundance diagnostics, the luminosity-metallicity relation, the
          dust  properties  of  normal  and  starburst  galaxies, and the
          star-formation histories of infrared-luminous galaxies.

          Title:  The nature of X-ray absorbed starburst QSOs and the QSO
          evolutionary scheme

          (IFCA), J.A. Stevens (IFCA), R.J. Ivison (ATC)
          Comments:  To  appear in the proceedings of "The X-Ray Universe
          2005" conference, 2005 Sept 26-30, El Escorial, Madrid, Spain
          In  contradiction  to the simple AGN unification schemes, there
          exists  a  significant population of broad line, z~2 QSOs which
          have   heavily  absorbed  X-ray  spectra.  These  objects  have
          luminosities  and  redshifts characteristic of the sources that
          produce  the  bulk  of  the QSO luminosity in the universe. Our
          follow  up  observations  in  the submillimetre show that these
          QSOs  are  embedded in ultraluminous starburst galaxies, unlike
          most  unabsorbed  QSOs  at the same redshifts and luminosities.
          The  radically  different star formation properties between the
          absorbed  and unabsorbed QSOs implies that the X-ray absorption
          is  unrelated  to the torus invoked in AGN unification schemes.
          The most puzzling question about these objects is the nature of
          the X-ray absorber. We present our study of the X-ray absorbers
          based   on   deep   (50-100ks)   XMM-Newton  spectroscopy.  The
          hypothesis  of  a  normal QSO continuum, coupled with a neutral
          absorber  is  strongly  rejected.  We  consider the alternative
          hypotheses  for  the absorber, originating either in the QSO or
          in   the   surrounding   starburst.   Finally  we  discuss  the
          implications  for  QSO/host  galaxy  formation,  in terms of an
          evolutionary  sequence of star formation and black hole growth.
          We  propose  that  both  processes  occur simultaneously in the
          gas-and-dust-rich  heavily  obscured centres of young galaxies,
          and  that  absorbed QSOs form a transitional stage, between the
          main obscured growth phase, and the luminous QSO.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  present  XMM-Newton  observations  of  the  Seyfert  1  AGN
          H0557-385.  We  have  conducted  a study into the warm absorber
          present  in  this source, and using high-resolution RGS data we
          find  that the absorption can be characterised by two phases: a
          phase  with log ionisation parameter xi of 0.50 (where xi is in
          units  of  ergs cm/s) and a column of 0.2e21 cm^-2, and a phase
          with  log  xi  of  1.62 and a column of 1.3e22 cm^-2. An iron K
          alpha  line  is detected. Neutral absorption is also present in
          the  source,  and  we discuss possible origins for this. On the
          assumption  that  the ionised absorbers originate as an outflow
          from  the  inner  edge  of  the  torus, we use a new method for
          finding  the  volume  filling  factor. Both phases of H0557-385
          have  small  volume  filling factors (< 1%). We also derive the
          volume  filling  factors  for  a  sample  of  23 AGN using this
          assumption  and  for  the  absorbers  with log xi > 0.7 we find
          reasonable  agreement with the filling factors obtained through
          the  alternative  method  of  equating the momentum flow of the
          absorbers  to  the  momentum  loss  of  the radiation field. By
          comparing  the  filling factors obtained by the two methods, we
          infer   that  some  absorbers  with  log  xi  <  0.7  occur  at
          significantly  larger distances from the nucleus than the inner
          edge of the torus.

          Title:  Magnetic Braking of Ap/Bp Stars: Application to Compact
          Black-Hole X-Ray Binaries
          Authors: S. Justham, S. Rappaport, Ph. Podsiadlowski
          Comments:  Accepted  by  MNRAS.  10  pages  with 5 figures (one
          reduced-quality to minimise file size)
          We  examine  the  proposal  that the subset of neutron-star and
          black-hole  X-ray  binaries  that  form  with  Ap  or  Bp  star
          companions will experience systemic angular-momentum losses due
          to    magnetic    braking,   not   otherwise   operative   with
          intermediate-mass  companion  stars.  We suggest that for donor
          stars   possessing   the   anomalously   high  magnetic  fields
          associated  with  Ap  and  Bp  stars,  a  magnetically coupled,
          irradiation-driven   stellar   wind  can  lead  to  substantial
          systemic  loss of angular-momentum. In this paper we apply this
          mechanism  to  a  specific  astrophysics  problem involving the
          formation  of  compact  black-hole binaries with low-mass donor
          stars. At present, it is not understood how these systems form,
          given  that  low-mass companion stars are not likely to provide
          sufficient  gravitational  potential  to unbind the envelope of
          the  massive  progenitor  of  the  black  hole  during  a prior
          `common-envelope'  phase.  However,  in the absence of magnetic
          braking,  such  systems tend to evolve to long orbital periods.
          We  show  that,  with  the proposed magnetic braking properties
          afforded  by  Ap and Bp companions, such a scenario can lead to
          the  formation  of  compact  black-hole  binaries  with orbital
          periods, donor masses, lifetimes, and production rates that are
          in  accord  with the observations. In spite of these successes,
          our   models  reveal  a  significant  discrepancy  between  the
          calculated  effective  temperatures  and  the observed spectral
          types   of   the  donor  stars.  Finally,  we  show  that  this
          temperature  discrepancy  would still exist for other scenarios
          invoking  initially  intermediate-mass  donor  stars,  and this
          presents a substantial unresolved mystery.

          The  physical  mechanism that allows massive stars to form is a
          major  unsolved  problem  in  astrophysics.  Stars  with masses
          $\gtsim  20$  $\msun$  reach  the  main  sequence  while  still
          embedded  in  their  natal  clouds,  and  the immense radiation
          output  they  generate  once  fusion  begins  can exert a force
          stronger  than  gravity  on  the dust and gas around them. They
          also  produce  huge  Lyman  continuum  luminosities,  which can
          ionize  and  potentially unbind their parent clouds. This makes
          massive  star  formation  a  more  daunting  problem  than  the
          formation  of  low  mass  stars.  In  this review I present the
          current  state  of  the  field,  and  discuss  the  two primary
          approaches  to  massive star formation. One holds that the most
          massive  stars  form  by  direct  collisions between lower mass
          stars  and  their  disks.  The  other approach is to see if the
          radiation  barrier can be overcome by improved treatment of the
          radiation-hydrodynamic   accretion   process.   I  discuss  the
          theoretical   background   to  each  model,  the  observational
          predictions  that can be used to test them, and the substantial
          parts of the problem that neither theory has fully addressed.

          Title:   Statistics   of  Pressure  Fluctuations  in  Decaying,

          Subj-class:  Statistical  Mechanics;  Fluid  Dynamics;  Chaotic
          Dynamics
          We   present   results   from   a  systematic  direct-numerical
          simulation  study  of  pressure  fluctuations  in  an unforced,
          incompressible,  homogeneous,  and isotropic, three-dimensional
          turbulent  fluid.  At  cascade  completion,  isosurfaces of low
          pressure  are  found  to  be  organised  as  slender filaments,
          whereas  the  predominant  isostructures  appear sheet-like. We
          exhibit  several  new  results,  including plots of probability
          distributions   of   the   spatial   pressure-difference,   the
          pressure-gradient    norm,   and   the   eigenvalues   of   the
          pressure-hessian tensor. Plots of the temporal evolution of the
          mean  pressure-gradient  norm,  and the mean eigenvalues of the
          pressure-hessian   tensor  are  also  exhibited.  We  find  the
          statistically  preferred  orientations between the eigenvectors
          of  the  pressure-hessian  tensor,  the  pressure-gradient, the
          eigenvectors  of the strain-rate tensor, the vorticity, and the
          velocity.  Statistical  properties of the non-local part of the
          pressure-hessian tensor are also exhibited, for the first time.
          We  present  numerical  tests  (in  the  viscous  case) of some
          conjectures  of  Ohkitani [Phys. Fluids A {\bf 5}, 2570 (1993)]
          and  Ohkitani  and  Kishiba  [Phys. Fluids {\bf 7}, 411 (1995)]

          Title:   Post-Minkowski   action   for  point-particles  and  a
          helically symmetric binary solution
          Authors: John L. Friedman (UWM), Koji Uryu (SISSA)
          Comments: 32 pages, 7 figures
          Two  Fokker  actions  and corresponding equations of motion are
          obtained for two point particles in a post-Minkowski framework,
          in   which   the  field  of  each  particle  is  given  by  the
          half-retarded   +  half-advanced  solution  to  the  linearized
          Einstein   equations.   The  first  action  is  parametrization
          invariant,   the   second  a  generalization  of  the  affinely
          parametrized  quadratic  action  for  a  relativistic particle.
          Expressions  for  a  conserved  4-momentum and angular momentum
          tensor  are obtained in terms of the particles' trajectories in
          this  post-Minkowski  approximation.  A  formal solution to the
          equations  of motion is found for a binary system with circular
          orbits.  For  a  bound  system of this kind, the post-Minkowski
          solution  is a toy model that omits nonlinear terms of relevant
          post-Newtonian  order;  and we also obtain a Fokker action that
          is  accurate  to  first  post-Newtonian order, by adding to the
          post-Minkowski  action  a  term  cubic  in the particle masses.
          Curiously, the conserved energy and angular momentum associated
          with  the  Fokker  action  are each finite and well-defined for
          this  bound  2-particle  system despite the fact that the total
          energy  and  angular  momentum  of the radiation field diverge.
          Corresponding  solutions  and conserved quantites are found for
          two  scalar charges (for electromagnetic charges we exhibit the
          solution   found   by   Schild).   For   a   broad   class   of
          parametrization-invariant  Fokker  actions and for the affinely
          parametrized   action,  binary  systems  with  circular  orbits
          satisfy  the relation $dE = \Omega dL$ (a form of the first law
          of  thermodynamics),  relating  the energy,angular velocity and
          angular momentum of nearby equilibrium configurations.

          Title: Binary neutron stars in a waveless approximation

          Comments: 4 pages, 6 figures
          Equilibria of binary neutron stars in close circular orbits are
          computed  numerically  in  a  waveless approximation to general
          relativity.  The full Einstein equation is solved on an initial
          hypersurface  to  obtain  an  asymptotically  flat  form of the
          4-metric  and  an  extrinsic  curvature  whose  time derivative
          vanishes  in a comoving frame. Two independent numerical codes,
          one  based  on  a  finite  difference  method,  the  other on a
          spectral  method,  are  developed,  and solution sequences that
          model inspiraling binary neutron stars during the final several
          orbits  are  successfully  computed.  The binding energy of the
          system  near  its  final orbit deviates from earlier results of
          third   post-Newtonian   and   of  spatially  conformally  flat
          calculations.  The  new solutions may serve as initial data for
          merger simulations and as members of quasiequilibrium sequences
          to  generate  gravitational  wave  templates,  and  may improve
          estimates of the gravitational-wave cutoff frequency set by the
          last inspiral orbit.

          Title:  The nature of X-ray absorbed starburst QSOs and the QSO
          evolutionary scheme
          Authors:  M.J.Page  (UCL-MSSL),  F.J.Carrera  (IFCA),  J.Ebrero
          (IFCA), J.A. Stevens (IFCA), R.J. Ivison (ATC)
          Comments:  To  appear in the proceedings of "The X-Ray Universe
          2005" conference, 2005 Sept 26-30, El Escorial, Madrid, Spain
          In  contradiction  to the simple AGN unification schemes, there
          exists  a  significant population of broad line, z~2 QSOs which
          have   heavily  absorbed  X-ray  spectra.  These  objects  have
          luminosities  and  redshifts characteristic of the sources that
          produce  the  bulk  of  the QSO luminosity in the universe. Our
          follow  up  observations  in  the submillimetre show that these
          QSOs  are  embedded in ultraluminous starburst galaxies, unlike
          most  unabsorbed  QSOs  at the same redshifts and luminosities.
          The  radically  different star formation properties between the
          absorbed  and unabsorbed QSOs implies that the X-ray absorption
          is  unrelated  to the torus invoked in AGN unification schemes.
          The most puzzling question about these objects is the nature of
          the X-ray absorber. We present our study of the X-ray absorbers
          based   on   deep   (50-100ks)   XMM-Newton  spectroscopy.  The
          hypothesis  of  a  normal QSO continuum, coupled with a neutral
          absorber  is  strongly  rejected.  We  consider the alternative
          hypotheses  for  the absorber, originating either in the QSO or
          in   the   surrounding   starburst.   Finally  we  discuss  the
          implications  for  QSO/host  galaxy  formation,  in terms of an
          evolutionary  sequence of star formation and black hole growth.
          We  propose  that  both  processes  occur simultaneously in the
          gas-and-dust-rich  heavily  obscured centres of young galaxies,
          and  that  absorbed QSOs form a transitional stage, between the
          main obscured growth phase, and the luminous QSO.

          Title: XMM-Newton observations of the Seyfert 1 AGN H0557-385

          G.Branduardi-Raymont (UCL-MSSL), A.J.Blustin (UCL-MSSL)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  present  XMM-Newton  observations  of  the  Seyfert  1  AGN
          H0557-385.  We  have  conducted  a study into the warm absorber
          present  in  this source, and using high-resolution RGS data we
          find  that the absorption can be characterised by two phases: a
          phase  with log ionisation parameter xi of 0.50 (where xi is in
          units  of  ergs cm/s) and a column of 0.2e21 cm^-2, and a phase
          with  log  xi  of  1.62 and a column of 1.3e22 cm^-2. An iron K
          alpha  line  is detected. Neutral absorption is also present in
          the  source,  and  we discuss possible origins for this. On the
          assumption  that  the ionised absorbers originate as an outflow
          from  the  inner  edge  of  the  torus, we use a new method for
          finding  the  volume  filling  factor. Both phases of H0557-385
          have  small  volume  filling factors (< 1%). We also derive the
          volume  filling  factors  for  a  sample  of  23 AGN using this
          assumption  and  for  the  absorbers  with log xi > 0.7 we find
          reasonable  agreement with the filling factors obtained through
          the  alternative  method  of  equating the momentum flow of the
          absorbers  to  the  momentum  loss  of  the radiation field. By
          comparing  the  filling factors obtained by the two methods, we
          infer   that  some  absorbers  with  log  xi  <  0.7  occur  at
          significantly  larger distances from the nucleus than the inner
          edge of the torus.

          Title:  Magnetic Braking of Ap/Bp Stars: Application to Compact
          Black-Hole X-Ray Binaries
          Authors: S. Justham, S. Rappaport, Ph. Podsiadlowski
          Comments:  Accepted  by  MNRAS.  10  pages  with 5 figures (one
          reduced-quality to minimise file size)
          We  examine  the  proposal  that the subset of neutron-star and
          black-hole  X-ray  binaries  that  form  with  Ap  or  Bp  star
          companions will experience systemic angular-momentum losses due
          to    magnetic    braking,   not   otherwise   operative   with
          intermediate-mass  companion  stars.  We suggest that for donor
          stars   possessing   the   anomalously   high  magnetic  fields
          associated  with  Ap  and  Bp  stars,  a  magnetically coupled,
          irradiation-driven   stellar   wind  can  lead  to  substantial
          systemic  loss of angular-momentum. In this paper we apply this
          mechanism  to  a  specific  astrophysics  problem involving the
          formation  of  compact  black-hole binaries with low-mass donor
          stars. At present, it is not understood how these systems form,
          given  that  low-mass companion stars are not likely to provide
          sufficient  gravitational  potential  to unbind the envelope of
          the  massive  progenitor  of  the  black  hole  during  a prior
          `common-envelope'  phase.  However,  in the absence of magnetic
          braking,  such  systems tend to evolve to long orbital periods.
          We  show  that,  with  the proposed magnetic braking properties
          afforded  by  Ap and Bp companions, such a scenario can lead to
          the  formation  of  compact  black-hole  binaries  with orbital
          periods, donor masses, lifetimes, and production rates that are
          in  accord  with the observations. In spite of these successes,
          our   models  reveal  a  significant  discrepancy  between  the
          calculated  effective  temperatures  and  the observed spectral
          types   of   the  donor  stars.  Finally,  we  show  that  this
          temperature  discrepancy  would still exist for other scenarios
          invoking  initially  intermediate-mass  donor  stars,  and this
          presents a substantial unresolved mystery.

          Equilibria of binary neutron stars in close circular orbits are
          computed  numerically  in  a  waveless approximation to general
          relativity.  The full Einstein equation is solved on an initial
          hypersurface  to  obtain  an  asymptotically  flat  form of the
          4-metric  and  an  extrinsic  curvature  whose  time derivative
          vanishes  in a comoving frame. Two independent numerical codes,
          one  based  on  a  finite  difference  method,  the  other on a
          spectral  method,  are  developed,  and solution sequences that
          model inspiraling binary neutron stars during the final several
          orbits  are  successfully  computed.  The binding energy of the
          system  near  its  final orbit deviates from earlier results of
          third   post-Newtonian   and   of  spatially  conformally  flat
          calculations.  The  new solutions may serve as initial data for
          merger simulations and as members of quasiequilibrium sequences
          to  generate  gravitational  wave  templates,  and  may improve
          estimates of the gravitational-wave cutoff frequency set by the
          last inspiral orbit.

          Title:  The nature of X-ray absorbed starburst QSOs and the QSO
          evolutionary scheme
          Authors:  M.J.Page  (UCL-MSSL),  F.J.Carrera  (IFCA),  J.Ebrero
          (IFCA), J.A. Stevens (IFCA), R.J. Ivison (ATC)
          Comments:  To  appear in the proceedings of "The X-Ray Universe
          2005" conference, 2005 Sept 26-30, El Escorial, Madrid, Spain
          In  contradiction  to the simple AGN unification schemes, there
          exists  a  significant population of broad line, z~2 QSOs which
          have   heavily  absorbed  X-ray  spectra.  These  objects  have
          luminosities  and  redshifts characteristic of the sources that
          produce  the  bulk  of  the QSO luminosity in the universe. Our
          follow  up  observations  in  the submillimetre show that these
          QSOs  are  embedded in ultraluminous starburst galaxies, unlike
          most  unabsorbed  QSOs  at the same redshifts and luminosities.
          The  radically  different star formation properties between the
          absorbed  and unabsorbed QSOs implies that the X-ray absorption
          is  unrelated  to the torus invoked in AGN unification schemes.
          The most puzzling question about these objects is the nature of
          the X-ray absorber. We present our study of the X-ray absorbers
          based   on   deep   (50-100ks)   XMM-Newton  spectroscopy.  The
          hypothesis  of  a  normal QSO continuum, coupled with a neutral
          absorber  is  strongly  rejected.  We  consider the alternative
          hypotheses  for  the absorber, originating either in the QSO or
          in   the   surrounding   starburst.   Finally  we  discuss  the
          implications  for  QSO/host  galaxy  formation,  in terms of an
          evolutionary  sequence of star formation and black hole growth.
          We  propose  that  both  processes  occur simultaneously in the
          gas-and-dust-rich  heavily  obscured centres of young galaxies,
          and  that  absorbed QSOs form a transitional stage, between the
          main obscured growth phase, and the luminous QSO.

          G.Branduardi-Raymont (UCL-MSSL), A.J.Blustin (UCL-MSSL)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  present  XMM-Newton  observations  of  the  Seyfert  1  AGN
          H0557-385.  We  have  conducted  a study into the warm absorber
          present  in  this source, and using high-resolution RGS data we
          find  that the absorption can be characterised by two phases: a
          phase  with log ionisation parameter xi of 0.50 (where xi is in
          units  of  ergs cm/s) and a column of 0.2e21 cm^-2, and a phase
          with  log  xi  of  1.62 and a column of 1.3e22 cm^-2. An iron K
          alpha  line  is detected. Neutral absorption is also present in
          the  source,  and  we discuss possible origins for this. On the
          assumption  that  the ionised absorbers originate as an outflow
          from  the  inner  edge  of  the  torus, we use a new method for
          finding  the  volume  filling  factor. Both phases of H0557-385
          have  small  volume  filling factors (< 1%). We also derive the
          volume  filling  factors  for  a  sample  of  23 AGN using this
          assumption  and  for  the  absorbers  with log xi > 0.7 we find
          reasonable  agreement with the filling factors obtained through
          the  alternative  method  of  equating the momentum flow of the
          absorbers  to  the  momentum  loss  of  the radiation field. By
          comparing  the  filling factors obtained by the two methods, we
          infer   that  some  absorbers  with  log  xi  <  0.7  occur  at
          significantly  larger distances from the nucleus than the inner
          edge of the torus.

          Title:  Magnetic Braking of Ap/Bp Stars: Application to Compact
          Black-Hole X-Ray Binaries
          Authors: S. Justham, S. Rappaport, Ph. Podsiadlowski
          Comments:  Accepted  by  MNRAS.  10  pages  with 5 figures (one
          reduced-quality to minimise file size)
          We  examine  the  proposal  that the subset of neutron-star and
          black-hole  X-ray  binaries  that  form  with  Ap  or  Bp  star
          companions will experience systemic angular-momentum losses due
          to    magnetic    braking,   not   otherwise   operative   with
          intermediate-mass  companion  stars.  We suggest that for donor
          stars   possessing   the   anomalously   high  magnetic  fields
          associated  with  Ap  and  Bp  stars,  a  magnetically coupled,
          irradiation-driven   stellar   wind  can  lead  to  substantial
          systemic  loss of angular-momentum. In this paper we apply this
          mechanism  to  a  specific  astrophysics  problem involving the
          formation  of  compact  black-hole binaries with low-mass donor
          stars. At present, it is not understood how these systems form,
          given  that  low-mass companion stars are not likely to provide
          sufficient  gravitational  potential  to unbind the envelope of
          the  massive  progenitor  of  the  black  hole  during  a prior
          `common-envelope'  phase.  However,  in the absence of magnetic
          braking,  such  systems tend to evolve to long orbital periods.
          We  show  that,  with  the proposed magnetic braking properties
          afforded  by  Ap and Bp companions, such a scenario can lead to
          the  formation  of  compact  black-hole  binaries  with orbital
          periods, donor masses, lifetimes, and production rates that are
          in  accord  with the observations. In spite of these successes,
          our   models  reveal  a  significant  discrepancy  between  the
          calculated  effective  temperatures  and  the observed spectral
          types   of   the  donor  stars.  Finally,  we  show  that  this
          temperature  discrepancy  would still exist for other scenarios
          invoking  initially  intermediate-mass  donor  stars,  and this
          presents a substantial unresolved mystery.

          Authors:   Mark   R.   Krumholz  (Department  of  Astrophysical
          Sciences, Princeton University)
          Comments:  15 pages, 3 figures, ASP conference style; to appear

          2005:  New  Horizons  in  Astronomy", editors: S. Kannappan, S.

          The  physical  mechanism that allows massive stars to form is a
          major  unsolved  problem  in  astrophysics.  Stars  with masses
          $\gtsim  20$  $\msun$  reach  the  main  sequence  while  still
          embedded  in  their  natal  clouds,  and  the immense radiation
          output  they  generate  once  fusion  begins  can exert a force
          stronger  than  gravity  on  the dust and gas around them. They
          also  produce  huge  Lyman  continuum  luminosities,  which can
          ionize  and  potentially unbind their parent clouds. This makes
          massive  star  formation  a  more  daunting  problem  than  the
          formation  of  low  mass  stars.  In  this review I present the
          current  state  of  the  field,  and  discuss  the  two primary
          approaches  to  massive star formation. One holds that the most
          massive  stars  form  by  direct  collisions between lower mass
          stars  and  their  disks.  The  other approach is to see if the
          radiation  barrier can be overcome by improved treatment of the
          radiation-hydrodynamic   accretion   process.   I  discuss  the
          theoretical   background   to  each  model,  the  observational
          predictions  that can be used to test them, and the substantial
          parts of the problem that neither theory has fully addressed.

          Title:   Statistics   of  Pressure  Fluctuations  in  Decaying,
          Isotropic Turbulence

          Subj-class:  Statistical  Mechanics;  Fluid  Dynamics;  Chaotic
          Dynamics
          We   present   results   from   a  systematic  direct-numerical
          simulation  study  of  pressure  fluctuations  in  an unforced,
          incompressible,  homogeneous,  and isotropic, three-dimensional
          turbulent  fluid.  At  cascade  completion,  isosurfaces of low
          pressure  are  found  to  be  organised  as  slender filaments,
          whereas  the  predominant  isostructures  appear sheet-like. We
          exhibit  several  new  results,  including plots of probability
          distributions   of   the   spatial   pressure-difference,   the
          pressure-gradient    norm,   and   the   eigenvalues   of   the
          pressure-hessian tensor. Plots of the temporal evolution of the
          mean  pressure-gradient  norm,  and the mean eigenvalues of the
          pressure-hessian   tensor  are  also  exhibited.  We  find  the
          statistically  preferred  orientations between the eigenvectors
          of  the  pressure-hessian  tensor,  the  pressure-gradient, the
          eigenvectors  of the strain-rate tensor, the vorticity, and the
          velocity.  Statistical  properties of the non-local part of the
          pressure-hessian tensor are also exhibited, for the first time.
          We  present  numerical  tests  (in  the  viscous  case) of some
          conjectures  of  Ohkitani [Phys. Fluids A {\bf 5}, 2570 (1993)]
          and  Ohkitani  and  Kishiba  [Phys. Fluids {\bf 7}, 411 (1995)]
          concerning  the  pressure-hessian  and the strain-rate tensors,
          for   the  unforced,  incompressible,  three-dimensional  Euler
          equations.

          Title:   Post-Minkowski   action   for  point-particles  and  a
          helically symmetric binary solution
          Authors: John L. Friedman (UWM), Koji Uryu (SISSA)
          Comments: 32 pages, 7 figures
          Two  Fokker  actions  and corresponding equations of motion are
          obtained for two point particles in a post-Minkowski framework,
          in   which   the  field  of  each  particle  is  given  by  the
          half-retarded   +  half-advanced  solution  to  the  linearized
          Einstein   equations.   The  first  action  is  parametrization
          invariant,   the   second  a  generalization  of  the  affinely
          parametrized  quadratic  action  for  a  relativistic particle.
          Expressions  for  a  conserved  4-momentum and angular momentum
          tensor  are obtained in terms of the particles' trajectories in
          this  post-Minkowski  approximation.  A  formal solution to the
          equations  of motion is found for a binary system with circular
          orbits.  For  a  bound  system of this kind, the post-Minkowski
          solution  is a toy model that omits nonlinear terms of relevant
          post-Newtonian  order;  and we also obtain a Fokker action that
          is  accurate  to  first  post-Newtonian order, by adding to the
          post-Minkowski  action  a  term  cubic  in the particle masses.
          Curiously, the conserved energy and angular momentum associated
          with  the  Fokker  action  are each finite and well-defined for
          this  bound  2-particle  system despite the fact that the total
          energy  and  angular  momentum  of the radiation field diverge.
          Corresponding  solutions  and conserved quantites are found for
          two  scalar charges (for electromagnetic charges we exhibit the
          solution   found   by   Schild).   For   a   broad   class   of
          parametrization-invariant  Fokker  actions and for the affinely
          parametrized   action,  binary  systems  with  circular  orbits
          satisfy  the relation $dE = \Omega dL$ (a form of the first law
          of  thermodynamics),  relating  the energy,angular velocity and
          angular momentum of nearby equilibrium configurations.

          Title:  Time  Variability in the X-ray Nebula Powered by Pulsar
          B1509-58
          Authors: T. DeLaney, B. M. Gaensler, J. Arons, M. J. Pivovaroff
          Comments: accepted to ApJ, 14 pages, 8 figures
          We  use  new  and  archival Chandra and ROSAT data to study the
          time  variability  of  the  X-ray emission from the pulsar wind
          nebula  (PWN) powered by PSR B1509-58 on timescales of one week
          to  twelve years. There is variability in the size, number, and
          brightness of compact knots appearing within 20" of the pulsar,
          with  at  least one knot showing a possible outflow velocity of
          ~0.6c  (assuming  a  distance  to  the  source of 5.2 kpc). The
          transient  nature  of  these  knots  may indicate that they are
          produced  by  turbulence in the flows surrounding the pulsar. A
          previously  identified  prominent  jet  extending  12 pc to the
          southeast  of  the pulsar increased in brightness by 30% over 9
          years;  apparent outflow of material along this jet is observed
          with a velocity of ~0.5c. However, outflow alone cannot account
          for   the   changes  in  the  jet  on  such  short  timescales.
          Magnetohydrodynamic  sausage or kink instabilities are feasible
          explanations  for  the jet variability with timescale of ~1.3-2
          years.  An  arc structure, located 30"-45" north of the pulsar,
          shows  transverse  structural  variations  and  appears to have
          moved  inward  with  a velocity of ~0.03c over three years. The
          overall structure and brightness of the diffuse PWN exterior to
          this  arc  and excluding the jet has remained the same over the
          twelve  year  span.  The  photon indices of the diffuse PWN and
          possibly   the  jet  steepen  with  increasing  radius,  likely
          indicating synchrotron cooling at X-ray energies.

          Comments:  To  appear  in the "QSO Host Galaxies: Evolution and
          Environment"  conference  proceedings;  meeting held in Leiden,
          August 2005
          We  present a study of the dynamical evolution of Ultraluminous
          Infrared   Galaxies  (ULIRGs),  merging  galaxies  of  infrared
          luminosity  >10^12 L_sun. During our Very Large Telescope large
          program,  we have obtained ISAAC near-infrared, high-resolution
          spectra  of  54  ULIRGs (at several merger phases) and 12 local
          Palomar-Green  QSOs  to investigate whether ULIRGs go through a
          QSO  phase  during  their  evolution. One possible evolutionary
          scenario  is  that  after  nuclear  coalescence, the black hole
          radiates  close  to  Eddington to produce QSO luminosities. The
          mean  stellar  velocity  dispersion  that  we  measure from our
          spectra  is  similar (~160 km/s) for 30 post-coalescence ULIRGs
          and  7 IR-bright QSOs. The black holes in both populations have
          masses  of  order 10^7-10^8 M_sun (calculated from the relation
          to  the  host  dispersion) and accrete at rates >0.5 Eddington.
          Placing  ULIRGs  and IR-bright QSOs on the fundamental plane of
          early-type  galaxies  shows  that they are located on a similar
          region  (that  of  moderate-mass  ellipticals),  in contrast to

          comparison  of  the  ULIRG  and QSO host kinematical properties
          indicates  that  (some) ULIRGs may undergo a QSO phase in their
          evolutionary  history  before  they settle down as ellipticals,
          further  data  on non-IR excess QSOs are necessary to test this
          scenario.

          Title:  GMRT  observations  of  the  field  of  INTEGRAL  X-ray
          sources- II (newly discovered hard X-ray sources)
          Authors:  M. Pandey, A. P. Rao, R. Manchanda, P. Durouchoux, C.

          Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures. Accepted A&A
          We  have  conducted  low-frequency  radio observations with the
          Giant  Metrewave  Radio  Telescope  (GMRT) of 40 new hard X-ray
          sources  discovered  by the INTEGRAL satellite. This survey was
          conducted  in  order,  to  study  radio  emissions  from  these
          sources,  to  provide  precise  position  and  to  identify new
          microquasar  candidates.  From our observations we find that 24
          of  the X-ray sources have radio candidates within the INTEGRAL
          error  circle.  Based  on the radio morphology, variability and
          information available from different wavelengths, we categorize
          them as seventeen Galactic sources (4 unresolved, 7 extended, 6
          extended  sources  in  diffuse  region) and seven extragalactic
          sources  (2  unresolved,  5  extended).  Detailed  account  for
          seventeen  of  these  sources  was  presented in earlier paper.
          Based  on the radio data for the remaining sources at 0.61 GHz,
          and the available information from NVSS, DSS, 2MASS and NED, we
          have  identified possible radio counterparts for the hard X-ray
          sources.  The  three unresolved sources, viz IGR J17303$-$0601,
          IGR  J17464$-$3213,  and  IGR  J18406$-$0539  are  discussed in
          detail.  These  sources  have been identified as X-ray binaries
          with  compact  central  engine and variable in X-ray and in the
          radio,   and   are  most  likely  microquasar  candidates.  The
          remaining  fourteen  sources have extended radio morphology and
          are either diffuse Galactic regions or extragalactic in origin.

          Title:  Imaging  and  integral field spectroscopy of shocked H2
          around G25.65+1.05

          MNRAS
          Near-infrared  imaging  of the emission from molecular hydrogen
          is  a  powerful method for discovering outflows in star-forming
          regions.  We  present  new  near-infrared images, long slit and
          integral  field  spectroscopy  of  the ultra-compact HII region
          G25.65+1.05.  These new observations reveal shocked H2 emission
          associated  with  a bipolar outflow from a young high mass star
          at  the  centre  of  the source. The physical parameters of the
          outflow  are  discussed  and  compared with outflows from lower
          mass stars.

          Title:  Revealing  the  mid-infrared emission structure of IRAS
          16594-4656 and IRAS 07027-7934

          resolution) accepted for publication in ApJ
          TIMMI2  diffraction-limited mid-infrared images of a multipolar
          proto-planetary   nebula  IRAS  16594-4656  and  a  young  [WC]
          elliptical  planetary  nebula  IRAS  07027-7934  are presented.
          Their  dust  shells  are  for  the  first  time  resolved (only
          marginally  in  the  case  of  IRAS 07027-7934) by applying the
          Lucy-Richardson  deconvolution  algorithm  to  the  data, taken
          under   exceptionally  good  seeing  conditions  (<0.5").  IRAS
          16594-4656  exhibits  a  two-peaked morphology at 8.6, 11.5 and
          11.7  microns which is mainly attributed to emission from PAHs.
          Our observations suggest that the central star is surrounded by
          a  toroidal  structure  observed  edge-on with a radius of 0.4"
          (~640 AU at an assumed distance of 1.6 kpc) with its polar axis
          at  P.A.~80 degrees, coincident with the orientation defined by
          only  one of the bipolar outflows identified in the HST optical
          images.  We suggest that the material expelled from the central
          source is currently being collimated in this direction and that
          the  multiple  outflow  formation  has  not  been  coeval. IRAS
          07027-7934   shows   a  bright,  marginally  extended  emission
          (FWHM=0.3") in the mid-infrared with a slightly elongated shape
          along   the  N-S  direction,  consistent  with  the  morphology
          detected by HST in the near-infrared. The mid-infrared emission
          is  interpreted  as  the result of the combined contribution of
          small,  highly  ionized PAHs and relatively hot dust continuum.
          We propose that IRAS 07027-7934 may have recently experienced a
          thermal pulse (likely at the end of the AGB) which has produced
          a radical change in the chemistry of its central star.

          Title:   Stochastic   Background  from  Coalescences  of  NS-NS
          Binaries
          Authors: T. Regimbau, J.A de Freitas Pacheco
          Comments: 22 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          In  this  work,  numerical simulations were used to investigate
          the    gravitational    stochastic   background   produced   by
          coalescences  occurring up to $z \sim 5$ of double neutron star
          systems.  The  cosmic  coalescence  rate was derived from Monte
          Carlo methods using the probability distributions for forming a
          massive  binary and to occur a coalescence in a given redshift.
          A  truly  continuous  background  is produced by events located
          only   beyond  the  critical  redshift  $z_*  =  0.23$.  Events
          occurring  in  the redshift interval $0.027<z<0.23$ give origin
          to  a  "popcorn"  noise,  while  those arising closer than $z =
          0.027$   produce   a  shot  noise.  The  gravitational  density
          parameter $\Omega_{gw}$ for the continuous background reaches a
          maximum around 670 Hz with an amplitude of $1.1\times 10^{-9}$,
          while  the  "popcorn" noise has an amplitude about one order of
          magnitude  higher  and the maximum occurs around a frequency of
          1.2  kHz.  The  signal  is  below  the sensitivity of the first
          generation  of  detectors but could be detectable by the future
          generation  of  ground  based  interferometers. Correlating two
          coincident  advanced-LIGO detectors or two EGO interferometers,
          the expected S/N ratio are respectively 0.5 and 10.

          Title: A survey of weak MgII absorbers at redshift <z>=1.78

          Comments: 25 pages, 14 figures, to be published in ApJ 01 March
          2006, v639, 1
          The exact nature of weak MgII absorbers (those with W_r(2796) <
          0.3  A)  is  a matter of debate, but most are likely related to
          areas of local star formation or supernovae activity outside of
          giant   galaxies.  Using  18  QSO  spectra  obtained  with  the
          Ultra-Violet  Echelle  Spectrograph  (UVES)  on  the Very Large
          Telescope  (VLT),  we  have  conducted  a  survey for weak MgII
          absorbers  at 1.4 < z < 2.4. We searched a redshift path length
          of  8.51, eliminating regions badly contaminated by atmospheric
          absorption  so  that  the  survey  is close to 100% complete to
          W_r(2796)  =  0.02  A.  We  found  a total of 9 weak absorbers,
          yielding a number density of absorbers of dN/dz = 1.06 +/- 0.12
          for  0.02  <=  W_r(2796) < 0.3 A. Narayanan et al. (2005) found
          dN/dz  =  1.00  +/-  0.20  at  0 < z < 0.3 and Churchill et al.
          (1999) found dN/dz = 1.74 +/- 0.10 at 0.4 < z < 1.4. Therefore,
          the  population  of weak MgII absorbers appears to peak at z~1.
          We  explore  the  expected evolution of the absorber population
          subject  to a changing extragalactic background radiation (EBR)
          from  z  = 0.9 to z = 1.78 (the median redshift of our survey),
          and  find that the result is higher than the observed value. We
          point  out  that the peak epoch for weak MgII absorption at z~1
          may  coincide  with  the peak epoch of global star formation in
          the dwarf galaxy environment.

          appear in 01 April 2006 issue of the Astrophysical Journal
          (Abridged)    We    present   spectroscopic   and   photometric
          observations of the eclipsing system V1061 Cyg (P = 2.35 days).
          We  show  that  it  is a hierarchical triple in which the third
          star   is  visible  in  the  spectra.  We  combine  the  radial
          velocities   for   the  three  stars,  times  of  eclipse,  and
          intermediate   astrometric  data  from  the  HIPPARCOS  mission
          (abscissa  residuals)  to  establish  the elements of the outer
          orbit  (P  =  15.8  yr)  and accurate values for the masses and
          radii  (1-2%  errors)  and  the  effective  temperatures of the
          binary  components.  Both  stars  are rotating rapidly and have
          their  rotation synchronized with the orbital motion. There are
          signs  of activity including strong X-ray emission and possibly
          spots.  Current  stellar  evolution  models agree well with the
          properties of the primary, but show a very large discrepancy in
          the radius of the secondary: the predicted values are about 10%
          smaller than observed (a 5-sigma effect). Also, the temperature
          is cooler than predicted by some 200 K. These discrepancies are
          quite  remarkable  given  that the star is only 7% less massive
          than  the  Sun, the calibration point of all stellar models. We
          identify  the chromospheric activity as the likely cause of the
          effect.  Inactive  stars agree very well with the models, while
          active  ones  such  as  V1061  Cyg Ab appear systematically too
          large and too cool. Theory provides an understanding of this in
          terms  of  the  strong magnetic fields commonly associated with
          stellar   activity,  which  tend  to  inhibit  convective  heat
          transport.

          Recent  observations  (Burnes2002,Veillet2002,Margot2002a) have
          revealed   an  unexpectedly  high  binary  fraction  among  the
          Trans-Neptunian  Objects  (TNOs) that populate the Kuiper Belt.
          The   TNO  binaries  are  strikingly  different  from  asteroid
          binaries  in four respects (Veillet2002): their frequency is an
          order  of  magnitude larger, the mass ratio of their components
          is  closer  to  unity,  and  their  orbits are wider and highly
          eccentric.  Two  explanations  have  been  proposed  for  their
          formation,   one  assuming  large  numbers  of  massive  bodies
          (Weidenschilling2002),  and one assuming large numbers of light
          bodies  (Goldreich2002).  We  argue  that  both assumptions are
          unwarranted,  and we show how TNO binaries can be produced from
          a  modest  number  of  intermediate-mass  bodies  of  the  type
          predicted  by  the  gravitational  instability  theory  for the
          formation  of  planetesimals (Goldreich and Ward1973). We start
          with  a  TNO  binary  population similar to the asteroid binary
          population,  but  subsequently  modified by three-body exchange
          reactions,  a  process that is far more efficient in the Kuiper
          belt,  because  of  the much smaller tidal perturbations by the
          Sun.   Our   mechanism  can  naturally  account  for  all  four
          characteristics  that  distinguish  TNO binaries from main-belt
          asteroid binaries.

          Title:   Cannonballs  in  the  context  of  Gamma  Ray  Bursts:
          Formation sites ?
          Authors: Jan E. Staff, Christian Fendt, Rachid Ouyed
          Comments: 10 pages, 12 figures
          We  investigate possible formation sites of the cannonballs (in
          the  gamma  ray  bursts  context) by calculating their physical
          parameters,  such  as  density,  magnetic field and temperature
          close  to  the  origin.  Our  results favor scenarios where the
          cannonballs  form  as  instabilities  (knots) within magnetized
          jets  from hyperaccreting disks. These instabilities would most
          likely  set  in  beyond  the light cylinder where flow velocity
          with  Lorentz  factors  as  high  as  2000 can be achieved. Our
          findings  challenge the cannonball model of gamma ray bursts if
          these  indeed  form  inside  core-collapse  supernovae (SNe) as
          suggested  in  the  literature; unless hyperaccreting disks and
          the  corresponding jets are common occurrences in core-collapse
          SNe.

          Title: Birth and fate of hot-Neptune planets
          Authors: I. Baraffe, Y. Alibert, G. Chabrier, W. Benz
          Comments:  4 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and
          Astrophysics
          This  paper  presents a consistent description of the formation
          and  the  subsequent evolution of gaseous planets, with special
          attention   to   short-period,   low-mass  hot-Neptune  planets
          characteristic  of  $\mu$  Ara-like  systems. We show that core
          accretion including migration and disk evolution and subsequent
          evolution  taking  into  account  irradiation  and  evaporation
          provide  a viable formation mechanism for this type of strongly
          irradiated light planets. At an orbital distance $a \simeq$ 0.1
          AU, this revised core accretion model leads to the formation of
          planets  with  total  masses  ranging  from $\sim$ 14 $\mearth$
          (0.044  $\mjup$)  to  $\sim$  400 $\mearth$ (1.25 $\mjup$). The
          newly  born  planets  have  a dense core of $\sim$ 6 $\mearth$,
          independent of the total mass, and heavy element enrichments in
          the envelope, $M_{\rm Z,env}/M_{\rm env} $, varying from 10% to
          80%  from  the  largest to the smallest planets. We examine the
          dependence   of  the  evolution  of  the  born  planet  on  the
          evaporation rate due to the incident XUV stellar flux. In order
          to  reach  a  $\mu$  Ara-like  mass ($\sim$ 14 $\mearth$) after
          $\sim  $  1  Gyr,  the  initial planet mass must range from 166
          $\mearth$  ($\sim$  0.52  $\mjup$)  to  about 20 $\mearth$, for
          evaporation   rates   varying   by   2   orders  of  magnitude,
          corresponding  to  90%  to  20% mass loss during evolution. The
          presence  of  a core and heavy elements in the envelope affects
          appreciably  the  structure and the evolution of the planet and
          yields  $\sim  8%-9%$ difference in radius compared to coreless
          objects  of  solar  composition  for Saturn-mass planets. These
          combinations  of  evaporation  rates  and internal compositions
          translate  into  different  detection  probabilities,  and thus
          different   statistical   distributions  for  hot-Neptunes  and
          hot-Jupiters.

          Title: On the Detection of Artefacts in Spectro-astrometry
          Authors: E. Brannigan, M. Takami, A. Chrysostomou, J. Bailey
          Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We   demonstrate  that  artificial  bipolar  structure  can  be
          detected   using   spectro-astrometry  when  the  point  spread
          function  (PSF)  of  a  point  source  suffers  distortion in a
          relatively  wide  slit. Spectro-astrometry is a technique which
          allows  us  to  probe  the  spatial  structure  of astronomical
          sources  on  milliarcsecond scales making it possible to detect
          close  binaries  and  to  study  the geometry and kinematics of
          outflowing  gas  on  scales much smaller than the seeing or the
          diffraction  limit  of  the  telescope. It is demonstrated that
          distortion  of  the  PSF,  caused  by  tracking  errors  of the
          telescope  or  unstable  active  optics  during an exposure can
          induce  artificial  signals  which  may  be misinterpreted as a
          real-astrometric  signal.  Using simulations we show that these
          may be minimised by using a narrow slit relative to the seeing.
          Spectra  should  be  obtained  at  anti-parallel  slit position
          angles (eg. 0 and 180 degrees) for comparison in order to allow
          artificial signatures to be identified.

          laboratory  to  probe  the velocity and density profile of such
          winds.  Here,  we have measured the variation of the absorption
          column  density  along  with other spectral parameters over the
          binary  orbit  for  two HMXBP in elliptical orbits, as observed
          with  the  Rossi  X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the BeppoSAX
          satellites.  A spherically symmetric wind profile was used as a
          model  to compare the observed column density variations. In 4U
          1538-52,  we  find  the  model  corroborating the observations;
          whereas in GX 301-2, the stellar wind appears to be very clumpy
          and  a  smooth  symmetric  wind model seems to be inadequate in
          explaining the variation in column density.

          and Astrophysics
          We present a NIR analysis of a sample of H2 outflows from young
          embedded sources to compare the physical properties and cooling
          mechanisms  of  the  different  flows.  The sample comprises 23
          outflows   driven   by   Class   0   and   I   sources   having
          low-intermediate  luminosity.  We  have  obtained  narrow  band
          images   in   H2  2.12um  and  FeII  1.64um  and  spectroscopic
          observations  in  the  range  1-2.5um. H2 line ratios have been
          used  to estimate the visual extinction and average temperature
          of  the molecular gas. Av values range from 2 to 15mag; average
          temperatures  range  between 2000 and 4000K. In several knots a
          stratification  of temperatures is found with maximum values up
          to  5000K.  Such  a stratification is more commonly observed in
          those  knots which also show FeII emission, while a thermalized
          gas  at  a  single  temperature  is  generally  found  in knots
          emitting only in molecular lines. Combining narrow band imaging
          with  the parameters derived from the spectral analysis, we are
          able to measure the total luminosity of the H2 and FeII shocked
          regions  in  each  flow.  H2  is  the  major IR coolant with an
          average L(H2)/L(FeII) ratio of 10^{-2}. 83% of the sources have
          a  L(H2)/L(bol) ratio of 0.04, irrespective of the Class of the
          driving   source,   while  a  smaller  group  of  sources  have
          L(H2)/L(bol)  an  order  of magnitude smaller.Such a separation
          reveals  the non-homogeneous behaviour of ClassI, where sources
          with  very  different  outflow  activity  can be found. This is
          consistent with other studies showing that among ClassI one can
          find   objects  with  different  accretion  properties  and  it
          demonstrates  that  the  H2  power in the jet can be a powerful
          tool to identify the most active sources of this class.

          Title:  Do  fast  winds  dominate  the  dynamics  of  planetary

          A  review  of  recent  observations  of  the  kinematics of six
          objects  that  represent  the  broad  range of phenomena called
          planetary  nebulae  (PNe) is presented. It is demonstrated that
          Hubble-type outflows are predominant, consequently it is argued
          that  ballistic  ejections  from  the  central stars could have
          dominated  the  dynamical effects of the fast winds in several,
          and  perhaps all, of these objects. An alternative possibility,
          which  involves an extension to the Interacting Winds model, is
          considered   to  explain  the  dynamics  of  evolved  planetary
          nebuale.

          Title: Multiplicity-Study of Exoplanet Host Stars
          Authors: M. Mugrauer, R. Neuhuser, T.Mazeh, E. Guenther
          Comments: 3 pages, 1 figure
          We  carry  out a systematic search campaign for wide companions
          of  exoplanet  host  stars  to study their multiplicity and its
          influence on the long-term stability and the orbital parameters
          of  the  exoplanets.  We  have already found 6 wide companions,
          raising  the  number  of confirmed binaries among the exoplanet
          host  stars  to  20  systems.  We  have  also searched for wide
          companions  of Gl86, the first known exoplanet host star with a
          white  dwarf companion. Our Sofi/NTT observations are sensitive
          to  substellar  companions  with  a minimum-mass of 35 Mjup and
          clearly  rule  out  further  stellar  companions with projected
          separations between 40 and 670AU.

          Title: Probing dark matter with X-ray binaries
          Authors: Walter Dehnen, Andrew King (Leicester)
          Comments: 3 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Low-mass  X-ray  binaries  (LMXBs),  which occur in old stellar
          populations,  have  velocities  exceeding those of their parent
          distribution  by at least 20 km/s. This makes them ideal probes
          for  dark  matter,  in  particular in dwarf spheroidals (dSph),
          where  the  LMXBs  should  penetrate  well  outside the visible
          galaxy.  We  argue  that  the  most  likely  explanation of the
          observation  of  LMXBs  in the Sculptor dSph by Maccarone et al
          (2005)  is  the presence of a dark matter halo of >~ 10^9 Msun,
          corresponding  to  a  total-mass  to  light  ratio  of  >~  600
          (M/L_V)_sun.  In  this case there should be an extended halo of
          LMXBs which may be observable.

          Title: A model for the X-ray absorption in Compton--thin AGN
          Authors: Alessandra Lamastra, G. Cesare Perola, Giorgio Matt
          Comments: Astronomy and Astrophysics, in press
          The fraction of AGN with photoelectric absorption in the X-rays
          ranging  from  NH  of  10^{22}  up  to  about  10^{24}  cm^{-2}
          (Compton-thin)  appears observationally to be anticorrelated to
          their  luminosity  Lx.  This recently found evidence is used to
          investigate  the  location  of the absorbing gas. The molecular
          torus  invoked  in  the unified picture of AGN, while it can be
          regarded  as  confirmed  on  several  grounds  to  explain  the
          Compton-thick  objects,  do not conform to this new constraint,
          at  least  in  its  physical models as developed so far. In the
          frame  of  observationally  based evidence that in Compton-thin
          sources  the  absorbing  gas might be located far away from the
          X-ray source, it is shown that the gravitational effects of the
          black  hole  (BH) on the molecular gas in a disk, within 25-450
          pc  (depending on the BH mass, from 10^6 to 10^9 M_solar, leads
          naturally to the observed anticorrelation, under the assumption
          of  a  statistical  correlation between the BH mass and Lx. Its
          normalization  is  also  reproduced  provided  that the surface
          density,  Sigma,  of  this  gas  is  larger  than about 150-200
          M_solar pc^{-2}, and assuming that the bolometric luminosity is
          one  tenth  of the Eddington limit. Interestingly, the required
          values  are  consistent  with the value of the 300 pc molecular
          disk in our own galaxy, namely 500 M_solar pc^{-2}. In a sample
          of  nearby galaxies from the BIMA SONG survey, it is found that
          half  of the objects have central Sigma larger than 150 M_solar
          pc${-2}.  Given  the  simplicity  of  the  proposed model, this
          finding   is   very  encouraging,  waiting  for  future  higher
          resolution surveys in CO on more distant galaxies.

          Title: Chaplygin gas may prevent big trip
          Authors: Jos A. Jimnez Madrid (IAA, Granada & IMAFF, Madrid)
          Comments: 6 pages, no figures, uses Revtex
          This  paper  deals  with  the  study  of  the  accretion  of  a
          generalized    Chaplygin    gas    with   equation   of   state
          $p=-A/\rho^\alpha$  onto  wormholes. We have obtained that when
          dominant  energy  condition  is  violated  the size of wormhole
          increases  with  the scale factor up to a given plateau. On the
          regime  where  the  dominant  energy condition is satisfied our
          model  predicts  a  steady  decreasing  of the wormhole size as
          generalized  Chaplygin  gas is accreted. Our main conclusion is
          that  the  big trip mechanism is prevented in a large region of
          the physical parameters of the used model.

          We present the first images of the 691.473 GHz CO J=6-5 line in
          a  protoplanetary  disk,  obtained  along with the 690 GHz dust
          continuum,  toward  the classical T Tauri star TW Hya using the
          Submillimeter  Array.  Imaging  in  the CO J=6-5 line reveals a
          rotating  disk,  consistent  with  previous  observations of CO
          J=3-2  and  2-1 lines. Using an irradiated accretion disk model
          and  2D Monte Carlo radiative transfer, we find that additional
          surface  heating  is  needed to fit simultaneously the absolute
          and relative intensities of the CO J=6-5, 3-2 and 2-1 lines. In
          particular,  the  vertical gas temperature gradient in the disk
          must  be  steeper  than that of the dust, mostly likely because
          the  CO emission lines probe nearer to the surface of the disk.
          We  have  used an idealized X-ray heating model to fit the line
          profiles  of CO J=2-1 and 3-2 with Chi-square analysis, and the
          prediction  of  this  model yields CO J=6-5 emission consistent
          with the observations.

          Title:   Polarization  of  light  from  warm  clouds  above  an
          accretion disk: effects of strong-gravity near a black hole
          Authors: J. Horak, V. Karas
          Comments: Accepted for publication in PASJ; 7 pages, 4 figures
          We  study  polarization  from scattering of light on a cloud in
          radial  motion  along  the  symmetry axis of an accretion disk.
          Radiation  drag  from  the disk and gravitational attraction of
          the  central  black hole are taken into account, as well as the
          effect  of  the  cloud  cooling  in  the  radiation field. This
          provides  us  with  a  self-consistent  toy-model for predicted
          lightcurves, including the linear polarization that arises from
          the  scattering.  Strong gravitational lensing creates indirect
          images;  these  are  formed  by photons that originate from the
          disk,  get  backscattered  onto  the  photon circular orbit and
          eventually  redirected  towards  an  observer.  Under  suitable
          geometrical   conditions   the  indirect  photons  may  visibly
          influence   the   resulting   magnitude   of  polarization  and
          light-curve  profiles.  Relevant  targets  are  black  holes in
          active  galactic  nuclei  and stellar-mass Galactic black-holes
          exhibiting episodic accretion/ejection events.

          Title: Roche Lobes in the Second Post-Newtonian Approximation
          Authors: Sasa Ratkovic, Madappa Prakash, James M. Lattimer
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          Close  binary  systems of compact stars, due to the emission of
          gravitational  radiation,  may evolve into a phase in which the
          less  massive star transfers mass to its companion. We describe
          mass  transfer  by  using  the model of Roche lobe overflow, in
          which  mass  is  transferred  through  the first, or innermost,
          Lagrange  point.  Under  conditions in which gravity is strong,
          the  shapes  of  the equipotential surfaces and the Roche lobes
          are  modified  compared  to  the  Newtonian  case.  We  present
          calculations  of  the  Roche  lobe  utilizing  the second order
          post-Newtonian (2PN) approximation in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner
          gauge.  Heretofore,  calculations  of  the  Roche lobe geometry
          beyond  the  Newtonian  case have not been available. Beginning
          from  the  general  N-body  Lagrangian  derived  by  Damour and
          Schaffer,  we develop the Lagrangian for a test particle in the
          vicinity of two massive compact objects. As an exact result for
          the   transverse-traceless   part  of  the  Lagrangian  is  not
          available, we devise an approximation that is valid for regions
          close  to  the  less  massive star. We calculate the Roche lobe
          volumes, and provide a simple fitting formula for the effective
          Roche  lobe  radius  analogous  to  that for the Newtonian case
          furnished  by  Eggleton.  In contrast to the Newtonian case, in
          which  the  effective  Roche  radius depends only upon the mass
          ratio  $q=m_1/m_2$,  in  the  2PN case the effective Roche lobe
          radius also depends on the ratio $z=2 (m_1+m_2)/a$ of the total
          mass and the orbital separation.

          Title: The Role of the Equation of State in Binary Mergers
          Authors: Sasa Ratkovic, Madappa Prakash, James M.Lattimer
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          Binary  mergers  involving  black  holes and neutron stars have
          been   proposed   as  major  sources  of  gravitational  waves,
          r--process   nucleosynthesis,   and   gamma  ray  bursters.  In
          addition,  they  represent  an  important, and possibly unique,
          observable   that   could   distinguish   between   normal  and
          self--bound  neutron  stars.  These  two families of stars have
          distinctly  different mass--radius relationships resulting from
          their  equations  of  state  which can be revealed during their
          mergers  if  stable mass transfer ensues. We consider two cases
          of  gravitational-radiation induced binary mergers: (i) a black
          hole  and  a  normal  neutron star, and (ii) a black hole and a
          self-bound  strange  quark  matter  star.  We  extend  previous
          Newtonian    analyses   to   incorporate   the   pseudo-general
          relativistic Paczy\'nski-Wiita potential or a potential correct
          to second--order post-Newtonian order in
          Arnowitt--Deser--Misner   coordinates.   These  potentials  are
          employed  to study both the orbital evolution of the binary and
          the Roche lobe geometry that determines when and if stable mass
          transfer  between  the  components  is possible. The Roche lobe
          geometry  with  pseudo-general  relativistic  or post-Newtonian
          potentials  has  not  heretofore  been considered. Our analysis
          shows that differences in the evolution of normal neutron stars
          and  strange  quark  matter  stars are significant and could be
          detected  in  gravity waves. Both the amplitude and frequencies
          of  the  wave pattern are affected. In addition, details of the
          equation  of  state  for either normal neutron stars or strange
          quark stars may be learned. A single merger could reveal one or
          two   individual   points  of  the  mass-radius  relation,  and
          observations of several mergers could map a significant portion
          of this relation.

          Hydrodynamical  simulations of semi-detached, polytropic binary
          stars  are  presented  in  an  effort  to  study  the onset and
          stability   of   dynamical   mass   transfer  events.  Initial,
          synchronously rotating equilibrium models are constructed using
          a  self-consistent-field  technique  and  then  evolved with an
          Eulerian  hydrodynamics code in a fully self-consistent manner.
          We  describe  code  improvements  introduced  over the past few
          years  that  permit us to follow dynamical mass-transfer events
          through  more  than  30  orbits.  Mass-transfer  evolutions are
          presented   for   two   different   initial  configurations:  A
          dynamically   unstable   binary   with   initial   mass   ratio
          (donor/accretor) $q_0 = 1.3$ that leads to a complete merger in
          $\sim  10$  orbits; and a double-degenerate binary with initial
          mass ratio $q_0 = 0.5$ that, after some initial unstable growth
          of  mass  transfer, tends to separate as the mass-transfer rate
          levels off.

          We  observed a new and poorly studied cataclysmic variable (CV)
          SDSS  J123813.73-033933.0  to  determine its classification and
          binary  parameters.  Simultaneous time-resolved photometric and
          spectroscopic  observations  were carried out to conduct period
          analysis  and  Doppler tomography mapping. From radial velocity
          measurements of the Ha line we determined its orbital period to
          be  0.05592+/-0.00035$  days  (80.53min). This period is longer
          than  the first estimate of 76 min by Szkody et al. (2003), but
          still  at  the  very edge of the period limit for hydrogen-rich
          CVs.  The  spectrum  shows  double-peaked Balmer emission lines
          flanked   by  strong  broad  Balmer  absorption,  indicating  a
          dominant  contribution  by the white dwarf primary star, and is
          similar  to  the  spectra  of short-period low-mass transfer WZ
          Sge-like  systems.  The  photometric  light curve shows complex
          variability.  The system undergoes cyclic brightening up to 0.4
          mags,  which  are  of  semi-periodic nature with periods of the
          order  of 8-12 hours. We also detect a 40.25 min variability of
          ~0.15   mag  corresponding  to  half  of  the  orbital  period.
          Amplitude  of  the latter increases with the cyclic brightening
          of  the  system. We discuss the variable accretion rate and its

          Title:  Discovery  of  Counter-Rotating  Gas  in  the  Galaxies
          NGC1596  and  NGC3203 and the Incidence of Gas Counter-Rotation
          in S0 Galaxies

          We  have  identified two new galaxies with gas counter-rotation
          (NGC1596  and  NGC3203) and have confirmed similar behaviour in
          another  one (NGC128), this using results from separate studies
          of  the  ionized-gas  and  stellar kinematics of a well-defined
          sample  of  30 edge-on disc galaxies. Gas counter-rotators thus
          represent  10+/-5%  of  our  sample, but the fraction climbs to
          21+/-11%  when only lenticular (S0) galaxies are considered and
          to  27+/-13%  for  S0s  with  detected  ionized-gas only. Those
          fractions are consistent with but slightly higher than previous
          studies.  A compilation from well-defined studies of S0s in the
          literature   yields   fractions   of   15+/-4%   and   23+/-5%,
          respectively. Although mainly based on circumstantial evidence,
          we  argue  that  the  counter-rotating gas originates primarily
          from  minor  mergers  and  tidally-induced transfer of material
          from  nearby objects. Assuming isotropic accretion, twice those
          fractions  of  objects  must  have undergone similar processes,
          underlining  the  importance  of  (minor)  accretion for galaxy
          evolution.  Applications  of  gas  counter-rotators  to  barred
          galaxy dynamics are also discussed.

          Title: The periods of the intermediate polar RX J0153.3+7446
          Authors: A.J. Norton, J.D. Tanner (The Open University)
          Comments: 4 pages, submitted to A&A Letters
          We  present  the first optical photometry of the counterpart to
          the  candidate intermediate polar RX J0153.3+7446. This reveals
          an  optical  pulse  period  of  2333s +/- 5s. Reanalysis of the
          previously  published  ROSAT  X-ray  data reveals that the true
          X-ray  pulse  period is probably 1974s +/- 30s, rather than the
          1414  s  previously  reported.  Given that the previously noted
          orbital period of the system is 3.94 h, we are able to identify
          the X-ray pulse period with the white dwarf spin period and the
          optical  pulse  period  with  the  rotation period of the white
          dwarf  in the binary reference frame, as commonly seen in other
          intermediate  polars.  We  thus confirm that RX J0153.3+7446 is
          indeed a typical intermediate polar.

          Title: NLTE analyses of sdB stars: progress and prospects
          Authors: N. Przybilla, M.F. Nieva, H. Edelmann
          Comments:  8  pages, 5 figures; to appear in: Baltic Astronomy,
          Proceedings  of  the  Second  Meeting  on Hot Subdwarf Stars an
          Related Objects, La Palma, June 2005
          We  report  on preliminary results of a hybrid non-LTE analysis
          of   high-resolution,   high-S/N  spectra  of  the  helium-rich
          subdwarf  B  star  Feige49  and  the  helium-poor sdB HD205805.
          Non-LTE  effects  are  found  to  have  a notable impact on the
          stellar  parameter  and  abundance determination. In particular
          the   HeI  lines  show  significant  deviations  from  detailed
          balance, with the computed equivalent widths strengthened by up
          to ~35%. Non-LTE abundance corrections for the metals (C, N, O,
          Mg,  S)  are  of  the  order  ~0.05-0.25 dex on the mean, while
          corrections  of  up  to  ~0.7  dex  are  derived for individual
          transitions. The non-LTE approach reduces systematic trends and
          the  statistical  uncertainties in the abundance determination.
          Consequently,  non-LTE  analyses  of a larger sample of objects
          have  the  potential  to  put  much  tighter constraints on the
          formation   history  of  the  different  sdB  populations  than
          currently discussed.

          Proceedings  of  the  Second  Meeting  on Hot Subdwarf Stars an
          Related Objects, La Palma, June 2005
          Two  evolutionary  scenarios  are proposed for the formation of
          extreme  helium  stars:  a  post-AGB star suffering from a late
          thermal   pulse,   or  the  merger  of  two  white  dwarfs.  An
          identification  of  the  evolutionary  channel  for  individual
          objects   has   to  rely  on  surface  abundances.  We  present
          preliminary  results  from  a non-LTE analysis of CNO, Mg and S
          for   two  unique  objects,  V652  Her  and  HD144941.  Non-LTE
          abundance  corrections for these elements range from negligible
          values   to   ~0.7  dex.  Non-LTE  effects  typically  lead  to
          systematic  shifts in the abundances relative to LTE and reduce
          the uncertainties.

          Title:  Accreting White Dwarfs among the Planetary Nebulae Most
          Luminous in [O III]5007 Emission
          Authors: Noam Soker (Technion, Israel)
          Comments: The Astrophysical Journal, in press (5 pages)
          I  propose  that  some  of  the most luminous planetary nebulae
          (PNs)  are  actually  proto-PNs,  where a companion white dwarf
          (WD)   accretes  mass  at  a  relatively  high  rate  from  the
          post-asymptotic  giant branch star that blew the nebula. The WD
          sustains  a  continuous nuclear burning and ionizes the nebula.
          The  WD is luminous enough to make the dense nebula luminous in
          the  [O  III]5007  line,  In young stellar populations these WD
          accreting   systems   account   for  a  small  fraction  of  [O
          III]-luminous   PNs,  but  in  old  stellar  populations  these
          binaries   might   account  for  most,  or  even  all,  of  the
          [OIII]-luminous  PNs.  This might explain the puzzling constant
          cutoff (maximum) [O III]5007 luminosity of the planetary nebula
          luminosity function across different galaxy types.

          Title:  Possible  evidence  for  "dark radiation" from Big Bang
          Nucleosynthesis Data
          Authors: V.V. Flambaum, E.V. Shuryak
          We  address  the  emerging  discrepancy  between  the  Big Bang
          Nucleosynthesis  data  and standard cosmology, which asks for a
          bit longer evolution time. If this effect is real, one possible
          implication  (in  a framework of brane cosmology model) is that
          there  is  a ``dark radiation'' component which is negative and
          makes  few  percents  of  ordinary  matter  density. If so, all
          scales  of  this  model  can  be  fixed, provided brane-to-bulk
          leakage problem is solved.

          Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to MNRAS
          We  present  a 19 ks Chandra ACIS-S observation of the globular
          cluster  Terzan  1.  Fourteen  sources  are detected within 1.4
          arcmin  of the cluster center with 2 of these sources predicted
          to  be  not  associated  with  the  cluster  (background AGN or
          foreground   objects).   The   neutron  star  X-ray  transient,
          X1732-304, has previously been observed in outburst within this
          globular cluster with the outburst seen to last for at least 12
          years.  Here  we  find  4  sources that are consistent with the
          ROSAT  position for this transient, but none of the sources are
          fully  consistent  with the position of a radio source detected
          with  the VLA that is likely associated with the transient. The
          most  likely  candidate  for  the  quiescent counterpart of the
          transient  has  a  relatively  soft  spectrum and an unabsorbed
          0.5-10  keV luminosity of 2.6E32 ergs/s, quite typical of other
          quiescent  neutron  stars. Assuming standard core cooling, from
          the  quiescent  flux  of  this source we predict long (>400 yr)
          quiescent   episodes   to  allow  the  neutron  star  to  cool.
          Alternatively,  enhanced  core  cooling processes are needed to
          cool  down the core. However, if we do not detect the quiescent
          counterpart  of  the  transient this gives an unabsorbed 0.5-10
          keV  luminosity  upper  limit  of  8E31 ergs/s. We also discuss
          other X-ray sources within the globular cluster.
          From  the  estimated  stellar  encouter rate of this cluster we
          find  that  the  number  of  sources we detect is significantly
          higher  than  expected  by  the  relationship  of Pooley et al.
          (2003).

          Comments: 9 pages, 3 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Using  RXTE  archival  observations  of  4U 1907+09 between MJD
          $\sim$51980 and $\sim$52340, we found the source, after a $\sim
          0$  spin-down  rate  episode,  to be spinning-down at a rate of
          $(-1.887\mp  0.042)\times  10^{-14}$  Hz s$^-1$ which is $\sim$
          0.60 times lower than the long term ($\sim 14$ years) spin-down
          rate (Baykal et al. 2001). Our pulse frequency measurements for
          the   first   time   resolved   significant   pulse   frequency
          fluctuations  since  the  discovery  of the source. We have not
          observed  any  significant  change  in  X-ray flux and spectral
          parameters  after  the spin-down rate of the source changed. We
          stated  that  the  apparent uncorrelation between the spin-down
          rate  and  the X-ray flux might be related to the fact that the
          source  accretes  not  only  via transient retrograde accretion
          disc  but  also  via the stellar wind of the companion, so that
          the  variation  of  the  accretion  rate from the disc does not
          cause significant variation in the observed X-ray flux. Lack of
          significant  change in spectral parameters was interpreted as a
          sign  of  the fact that the change in the spin-down rate of the
          source  is  not  related  to  a  significant  variation  in the
          accretion geometry.

          Title:   Two-dimensional   radiation-hydrodynamic   model   for
          limit-cycle oscillations of luminous accretion disks
          Authors: K. Ohsuga
          Comments:  6  pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          (ApJ 01 April 2006, v640, 2 issue)
          We  investigate  the time evolution of luminous accretion disks
          around    black    holes,    conducting   the   two-dimensional
          radiation-hydrodynamic   simulations.   We   adopt   the  alpha
          prescription  for the viscosity. The radial-azimuthal component
          of  viscous  stress tensor is assumed to be proportional to the
          total  pressure  in  the  optically thick region, while the gas
          pressure in the optically thin regime. The viscosity parameter,
          alpha, is taken to be 0.1. We find the limit-cycle variation in
          luminosity  between  high  and low states. When we set the mass
          input  rate from the outer disk boundary to be 100 L_E/c^2, the
          luminosity suddenly rises from 0.3L_E to 2L_E, where L_E is the
          Eddington  luminosity. It decays after retaining high value for
          about  40  s.  Our  numerical results can explain the variation
          amplitude  and  duration of the recurrent outbursts observed in
          microquasar,  GRS  1915+105. We show that the multi-dimensional
          effects play an important role in the high-luminosity state. In
          this  state,  the  outflow  is  driven  by the strong radiation
          force,  and some part of radiation energy dissipated inside the
          disk  is swallowed by the black hole due to the photon-trapping
          effects.  This  trapped  luminosity  is  comparable to the disk
          luminosity.  We  also calculate two more cases: one with a much
          larger   accretion   rate  than  the  critical  value  for  the
          instability  and the other with the viscous stress tensor being
          proportional  to  the gas pressure only even when the radiation
          pressure   is   dominant.   We  find  no  quasi-periodic  light
          variations  in  these cases. This confirms that the limit-cycle
          behavior  found  in  the  simulations  is  caused  by  the disk
          instability.

          Title:  The  Very  Early  Gamma-ray Burst Afterglows Powered by
          Structured Jets
          Authors: T. Yan, D. M. Wei, Y. Z. Fan
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          If  X-ray flashes (XRFs) and X-ray rich Gamma-ray Bursts(XRRGs)
          have  the  same  origin  with  Gamma-ray  Bursts (GRBs) but are
          viewed  from  larger  angles  of  structured  jets, their early
          afterglows   may   differ   from   those   of  GRBs.  When  the
          ultra-relativistic   outflow   interact  with  the  surrounding
          medium,  there  are  two shocks formed, one is a forward shock,
          the  other  is  a  reverse  shock.  In  this paper we calculate
          numerically   the  early  afterglow  powered  by  uniform  jet,
          Gaussian  jet  and  power-law  jet in the forward-reverse shock
          scenario.  A  set  of differential equations are used to govern
          the dynamical evolution and synchrotron self-Compton effect has
          been  taken  into account to calculate the emission. In uniform
          jets,   the  very  early  afterglows  of  XRRGs  and  XRFs  are
          significantly lower than GRBs and the observed peak times of RS
          emission  are longer in interstellar medium environment. The RS
          components  in XRRGs and XRFs are difficult to be detected. But
          in stellar wind, the reduce of very early flux and the delay of
          RS  peak time are not so remarkable. In nonuniform jet(Gaussian
          jet  and  power-law jet), where there are emission materials on
          the  line  of  sight,  the  very  early  light  curve resembles
          isotropic-equivalent  ejecta  in  general  although the RS flux
          decay   index   shows   notable   deviation   if   the   RS  is
          relativistic(in stellar wind).

          Title: Reduced Wolf-Rayet Line Luminosities at Low Metallicity
          Authors: Paul A Crowther, L J Hadfield (Sheffield)
          Comments: 14 pages, 12 figures, accepted for A&A
          New  NTT/EMMI  spectrophotometry  of  single WN2-5 stars in the
          Magellanic  Clouds  are  presented,  from  which HeII 4686 line
          luminosities  have been derived, and compared with observations
          of  other  Magellanic  Cloud  WR stars. SMC WN3-4 stars possess
          line  luminosities which are a factor of 4 times lower than LMC
          counterparts,  incorporating  several  binary  SMC WN3-4 stars.
          Similar  results  are  found  for  WN5-6 stars, despite reduced
          statistics,  incorporating  observations  of  single  LMC WN5-9
          stars.  CIV  5808 line luminosities of carbon sequence WR stars
          in  the  SMC  and  IC1613  (both WO subtypes) are a factor of 3
          lower  than LMC WC stars from Mt Stromlo/DBS spectrophotometry,
          although  similar results are also obtained for the sole LMC WO
          star.  We  demonstrate  how  reduced  line  luminosities at low
          metallicity  follow  naturally  if WR winds are Z-dependent, as
          recent  results  suggest.  We  apply  mass  loss-Z  scalings to
          atmospheric  non-LTE  models  of  Milky Way and LMC WR stars to
          predict  the wind signatures of WR stars in the metal-poor star
          forming  WR  galaxy  IZw18.  WN HeII 4686 line luminosities are
          7-20  times  lower  than  in  Z-rich  counterparts of identical
          bolometric luminosity, whilst WC CIV 5808 line luminosities are
          3-6  times  lower.  Significant He^+ Lyman continuum fluxes are
          predicted  for  Z-poor  early-type  WR stars. Consequently, our
          results  suggest  the need for larger population of WR stars in
          IZw18  than  is  presently  assumed, particularly for WN stars,
          potentially posing a severe challenge to evolutionary models at
          very  low  Z.  Finally, reduced wind strengths from WR stars at
          low  Z  impacts upon the immediate circumstellar environment of
          long  duration  GRB  afterglows,  particularly  since  the host
          galaxies of high-redshift GRBs tend to be Z-poor.

          Title: Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays from Sequestered X Bursts
          Authors: Peter L. Biermann, Paul H. Frampton
          Comments: 12 pages LaTeX
          Assuming that there is no GZK (Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin) cut-off
          and  that  super-GZK  cosmic  rays  correlate  with AGN (Active
          Galactic  Nuclei)  at  cosmological distances, it is speculated
          that  a relic superheavy particle (X) has its lifetime enhanced
          by  sequestration  in an extra dimension. This sequestration is
          assumed  to  be  partially  liberated  by  proximity of merging
          supermassive black holes in an AGN, temporarily but drastically
          reducing  the  lifetime,  thus stimulating an X burst. Based on
          sequestration  of  the  decay  products  of  X,  a  speculative
          explanation of the observed $\gamma/N$ ratio is proposed.

          Title: SS 433 : a phenomenon imitating a Wolf-Rayet star

          ((1)  SAp  CEA/Saclay,  France; (2) LAOG, Grenoble, France; (3)

          Comments:  12  pages, 6 figures (3 colour figures), accepted by
          A&A (in press)
          We   present   mid-infrared   (2-12   micron)  spectra  of  the
          microquasar SS 433 obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory
          (spectroscopic  mode of ISOPHOT and ISOCAM). We compare them to
          the  spectra  of four Wolf-Rayet stars: WR78, WR134, WR136, and
          WR147  in  the same wavelength range. The mid-infrared spectrum
          of  SS  433  mainly shows HI and HeI emission lines and is very
          similar  to  the  spectrum of WR147, a WN8(h)+B0.5V binary. The
          2-12  micron  continuum  emission  of  SS  433  corresponds  to
          optically   thin   and   partially  optically  thick  free-free
          emission,  from  which  we  calculate a mass loss rate of 2-3 x
          10^{-4} Msun/yr if the wind is homogeneous and a third of these
          values  if  it  is  clumped.  This  is consistent with a strong
          stellar  wind from a WN star. However, following recent studies
          concluding  that  the  mass  donor  star  of  SS  433  is not a
          Wolf-Rayet  star,  we  propose  that this strong wind out flows
          from  a geometrically thick envelope of material that surrounds
          the  compact  object  like  a stellar atmosphere, imitating the
          Wolf-Rayet phenomenon. This wind could also wrap the mass donor
          star,  and  at larger distances (~ 40 AU), it might form a dust
          envelope from which the thermal emission, detected with ISOPHOT
          at  25  micron  and  60 micron, would originate. This wind also
          probably  feeds  the  material  that  is ejected in the orbital
          plane  of  the  binary  system  and  that  forms the equatorial
          outflow detected in radio at distances > 100 AU.

          We  present  preliminary  results  from  the  first part of the
          LuckyCam late M-dwarf binarity survey. We survey a sample of 48

          angular   resolution  visible  light  imaging  technique  Lucky
          Imaging, in only 8 hours of 2.5m telescope time. We discover 10
          new  binaries;  although the survey is sensitive to brown dwarf
          companions  none  are detected. The orbital radius distribution
          of  the  newly  discovered  binaries  broadly  matches  that of
          previous  detections  by  other groups, although we do discover
          one wide binary at ~40AU.

          Aims.  Filamentary  structures of early type stars are found to
          be  a  common feature of the Magellanic Clouds formed at an age
          of  about  0.9-2*10^8  yr. As we go to younger ages these large
          structures  appear  fragmented  and  sooner or later form young
          clusters  and  associations.  In  the  optical  domain  we have
          detected  56  such  large structures of young objects, known as
          stellar  complexes in the LMC for which we give coordinates and
          dimensions.  We  also  investigate  star formation activity and
          evolution  of  these  stellar  complexes  and  define  the term
          "starburst  region".  Methods.  IR  properties of these regions
          have  been  investigated  using  IRAS  data. A colour-magnitude
          diagram  (CMD) and a two-colour diagram from IRAS data of these
          regions  ware  compared with observations of starburst galaxies
          and  cross-matching  with HII regions and SNRs was made . Radio
          emission  maps  at  8.6-GHz  and the CO (1 to 0) line were also
          cross  correlated  with  the  map  of  the  stellar  complexes.
          Results.  It  has  been  found  that  nearly 1/3 of the stellar
          complexes  are  extremely active resembling the IR behaviour of
          starburst  galaxies  and  HII  regions. These stellar complexes
          illustrating   such   properties  are  called  here  "starburst
          regions".  They  host  an  increased  number of HII regions and
          SNRs.  The  main starburst tracers are their IR luminosity (F60
          well  above 5.4 Jy) and the 8.6-GHz radio emission. Finally the
          evolution of all stellar complexes is discussed based on the CO
          emission.

          Title: Constraints on Alternatives to Supermassive Black Holes
          Authors: M. Coleman Miller (University of Maryland)
          Comments: 5 pages including 1 figure, accepted by MNRAS
          Observations of the centers of galaxies continue to evolve, and
          it is useful to take a fresh look at the constraints that exist
          on  alternatives  to supermassive black holes at their centers.
          We  discuss  constraints  complementary to those of Maoz (1998)
          and   demonstrate   that  an  extremely  wide  range  of  other
          possibilities  can  be  excluded. In particular, we present the
          new  argument  that  for  the velocity dispersions inferred for
          many galactic nuclei, even binaries made of point masses cannot
          stave off core collapse because hard binaries are so tight that
          they  merge via emission of gravitational radiation before they
          can  engage  in  three-body  or four-body interactions. We also
          show that under these conditions core collapse leads inevitably
          to  runaway  growth  of a central black hole with a significant
          fraction  of  the initial mass, regardless of the masses of the
          individual  stars.  For  clusters  of  noninteracting  low-mass
          objects   (from   low-mass   stars  to  elementary  particles),
          relaxation  of  stars  and compact objects that pass inside the
          dark  region  will be accelerated by interactions with the dark
          mass.  If  the  dark  region is instead a self-supported object
          such  as a fermion ball, then if stellar-mass black holes exist
          they  will collide with the object, settle, and consume it. The
          net  result  is  that the keyhole through which alternatives to
          supermassive black holes must pass is substantially smaller and
          more contrived than it was even a few years ago.

          Title:  Spatially-resolved  mid-infrared  spectroscopy  of  NGC
          1068: the nature and distribution of the nuclear material

          2006, ApJ, 640, 2
          We   present  spatially-resolved,  near-diffraction-limited  10
          micron spectra of the nucleus of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068,
          obtained  with  Michelle, the mid-IR imager and spectrometer on
          the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope. The spectra cover the nucleus
          and  the  central  6.0"  x  0.4"  of  the ionization cones at a
          spatial  resolution of approximately 0.4" (approx. 30 parsecs).
          The  spectra  extracted  in  0.4"  steps  along the slit reveal
          striking   variations  in  continuum  slope,  silicate  feature
          profile   and   depth,   and  fine  structure  line  fluxes  on
          subarcsecond  scales,  illustrating in unprecedented detail the
          complexity  of  the  circumnuclear  regions  of  this galaxy at
          mid-IR  wavelengths.  A  comparison  of  photometry  in various
          apertures  reveals  two  distinct components: a compact (radius
          <15  pc),  bright  source  within  the  central 0.4" x 0.4" and
          extended,  lower  brightness  emission. We identify the compact
          source  with the AGN obscuring torus, and the diffuse component
          with  the  AGN-heated  dust  in the ionization cones. While the
          torus  emission dominates the flux observed in the near-IR, the
          mid-IR  flux  measured  with  apertures larger than about 1" is
          dominated  instead  by  the  dust  emission from the ionization
          cones.  Many  previous attempts to determine the torus spectral
          energy   distribution  are  thus  likely  to  be  significantly
          affected  by  contamination  from  the  extended  emission. The
          observed spectrum of the compact source is compared with clumpy
          torus  models, which require most of the mid-IR emitting clouds
          to  be  located  within a few parsecs of the central engine. We
          also  present  a UKIRT/CGS4 5 micron spectrum covering the R(0)
          --  R(4)  lines  of  the fundamental vibration-rotation band of
          12CO.  None  of  these lines was detected, and we discuss these
          non-detections  in  terms of the filling factor and composition
          of the nuclear clouds. (Abridged)

          Title: First Resolved Images of the Mira AB Symbiotic Binary at

          Authors:     Lynn     D.     Matthews,    Margarita    Karovska
          (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)
          Comments: accepted to ApJ Letters
          We   report   the  first  spatially  resolved  radio  continuum
          measurements  of  the Mira AB symbiotic binary system, based on
          observations  obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA). This is
          the  first  time  that  a  symbiotic  binary  has been resolved
          unambiguously   at  centimeter  wavelengths.  We  describe  the
          results  of  VLA  monitoring  of  both  stars  over a ten month
          period,  together with constraints on their individual spectral
          energy   distributions,   variability,   and   radio   emission
          mechanisms.  The  emission  from  Mira  A  is  consistent  with
          originating  from  a radio photosphere, while the emission from
          Mira  B  appears  best  explained as free-free emission from an
          ionized circumstellar region ~(1-10)x10**13 cm in radius.

          Institute for Theory and Computation, (2) Harvard University)
          Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJ Letters
          We  consider  a  model  in  which  Sgr  A*,  the 3.5x10^6 M_sun
          supermassive  black hole candidate at the Galactic Center, is a
          compact  object  with  a  surface. Given the very low quiescent
          luminosity  of  Sgr A* in the near infrared, the existence of a
          hard  surface, even in the limit in which the radius approaches
          the  horizon,  places  severe  constraints upon the steady mass
          accretion   rate  in  the  source,  requiring  dM/dt  <  10^-12
          M_sun/yr.  This  limit is well below the minimum accretion rate
          needed  to  power  the observed submillimeter luminosity of Sgr
          A*. We thus argue that Sgr A* does not have a surface, i.e., it
          must  have  an  event  horizon. The argument could be made more
          restrictive  by  an  order  of  magnitude  with  microarcsecond
          resolution imaging, e.g., with submillimeter VLBI.

          Title:  Prospects  of  LIGO  for  constraining  inclination  of
          merging  compact  binaries  associated with three-dimensionally
          localized short-hard GRBs
          Authors: Naoki Seto
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          We  propose  a  new  method  to  constrain the inclination of a
          coalescing  compact binary by detecting its gravitational waves
          associated  with a three-dimensionally localized (direction and
          distance)  short-hard  gamma-ray  burst. We take advantage of a
          synergy  of  these  two  observations,  and  our  method can be
          applied  with  a  single  interferometer  or  aligned  multiple
          interferometers  as  LIGO.  For  a  nearly  face-on  binary the
          inclination   angle   $I$  can  be  constrained  in  the  range
          1-SNR_{GW}^{-1}  <  cos  I  \le  1  with  an  accurate distance
          estimation.  This  method would help us to study the properties
          of  the  short-hard  bursts,  including  potentially collimated
          jet-like structures as indicated by recent observation.

          We  present  low-resolution  (64 < R < 124) mid-infrared (8--38
          micron) Spitzer/IRS spectra of two z~1.3 ultraluminous infrared
          galaxies  (LFIR~10^13)  discovered  in a Spitzer/MIPS survey of
          the  Bootes  field  of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey (NDWFS).
          MIPS  J142824.0+352619  is  a  bright  160 micron source with a
          large  infrared-to-optical  flux  density  ratio and a possible
          lensing  amplification  of  <~10.  The 6.2, 7.7, 11.3, and 12.8
          micron  PAH  emission  bands  in  its  IRS  spectrum indicate a
          redshift of z~1.3. The large equivalent width of the 6.2 micron
          PAH  feature  indicates  that  at least 50% of the mid-infrared
          energy  is  generated in a starburst, an interpretation that is
          supported by a large [NeII]/[NeIII] ratio and a low upper limit
          on  the  X-ray  luminosity.  SST 24J142827.19+354127.71 has the
          brightest 24 micron flux (10.55 mJy) among optically faint (R >
          20)  galaxies  in  the  NDWFS.  Its mid-infrared spectrum lacks
          emission features, but the broad 9.7 micron silicate absorption
          band  places  this  source  at  z~1.3. Given this redshift, SST
          24J142827.19+354127.71  has  among  the  largest  rest-frame  5
          micron  luminosities  known. The similarity of its SED to those
          of  known  AGN-dominated  ULIRGs  and  its  lack  of either PAH
          features  or  large  amounts  of  cool  dust  indicate that the
          powerful  mid-infrared  emission  is  dominated  by  an  active
          nucleus  rather  than  a  starburst. Our results illustrate the
          power  of  the  IRS  in  identifying  massive  galaxies  in the
          ``redshift  desert''  and  in  discerning  their power sources.
          Because  they are bright, MIPS J142824.0+352619 (pending future
          observations  to  constrain  its lensing amplification) and SST
          24J142827.19+354127.71  are  useful  z>1  templates  of  a high
          luminosity starburst and AGN, respectively.

          Title:  Self-similar  pressure  oscillations  in  neutron  star
          envelopes as probes of neutron star structure
          Authors:  A.  I.  Chugunov  (1),  ((1) Ioffe Physical-Technical
          Institute, St.-Petersburg, Russia)
          Comments: 7 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We   study   eigenmodes   of   acoustic  oscillations  of  high
          multipolarity  l  ~  100  - 1000 and high frequency (~100 kHz),
          localized   in   neutron  star  envelopes.  We  show  that  the
          oscillation  problem  is  self-similar.  Once  the  oscillation
          spectrum  is  calculated for a given equation of state (EOS) in
          the  envelope  and given stellar mass M and radius R, it can be
          rescaled  to  a  star with any M and R (but the same EOS in the
          envelope). For l>300 the modes can be subdivided into the outer
          and  inner  ones.  The  outer modes are mainly localized in the
          outer  envelope.  The inner modes are mostly localized near the
          neutron  drip point, being associated with the softening of the
          EOS  after  the  neutron drip. We calculate oscillation spectra
          for  the  EOSs  of  cold-catalyzed and accreted matter and show
          that  the spectra of the inner modes are essentially different.
          A detection and identification of high-frequency pressure modes
          would  allow one to infer M and R and determine also the EOS in
          the  envelope  (accreted  or ground-state) providing thus a new
          and  simple  method to explore the main parameters and internal
          structure of neutron stars.

          Title: Condensation temperature trends among stars with planets
          Authors: Guillermo Gonzalez
          Comments: 5 pages, 7 figures, MNRAS Letter in press
          Results  from  detailed spectroscopic analyses of stars hosting
          massive  planets  are  employed  to  search  for trends between
          abundances  and  condensation  temperatures. The elements C, S,
          Na,  Mg,  Al, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Zn are included
          in  the  analysis  of  64  stars with planets and 33 comparison
          stars. No significant trends are evident in the data. This null
          result  suggests  that  accretion  of  rocky  material onto the
          photospheres   of   stars  with  planets  is  not  the  primary
          explanation   for   their   high  metallicities.  However,  the
          differences  between  the  solar  photospheric  and  meteoritic
          abundances  do  display  a  weak  but  significant  trend  with
          condensation temperature. This suggests that the metallicity of
          the  sun's  envelope has been enriched relative to its interior
          by about 0.07 dex.

          Title:   IRAS   16293-2422:   Evidence   for   Infall   onto  a
          Counter-Rotating Protostellar Accretion Disk
          Authors: Anthony J. Remijan, J. M. Hollis
          Comments:  18 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We  report  high  spatial  resolution  VLA  observations of the
          low-mass   star-forming   region  IRAS  16293-2422  using  four
          molecular   probes:   ethyl  cyanide  (CH$_3$CH$_2$CN),  methyl
          formate  (CH$_3$OCHO),  formic  acid  (HCOOH),  and  the ground
          vibrational  state  of  silicon  monoxide  (SiO). Ethyl cyanide
          emiss  ion  has  a  spatial scale of $\sim20''$ and encompasses
          binary cores A and B as determined by continuum emission peaks.
          Surrounded by formic acid emission, methyl formate emission has
          a  spatial  scale  of  $\sim6''$and  is confined to core B. SiO
          emission shows two velocity components with spatial scales less
          than 2$''$ that map $\sim2''$ northeast of the A and B symmetry
          axis.  The redshifted SiO is $\sim2''$ northwest of blueshifted
          SiO   along   a   position   angle   of  $\sim135^o$  which  is
          approximately  parallel  to  the  A  and  B  symmetry  axis. We
          interpret  the  spatial  position offset in red and blueshifted
          SiO  emission  as  due  to rotation of a protostellar accretion
          disk  and  we  derive $\sim$1.4 M$_{\odot}$ interior to the SiO
          emission.  In  the  same  vicinity,  Mundy  et  al. (1986) also
          concluded   rotation   of  a  nearly  edge-on  disk  from  OVRO
          observations of much stronger and ubiquitous $^{13}$CO emission
          but  the  direction of rotation is opposite to the SiO emission
          findings.  Taken  together,  SiO  and  $^{13}$CO  data  suggest
          evidence  for  a counter-rotating disk. Moreover, archival BIMA
          array  $^{12}$CO  data show an inverse P Cygni profile with the
          strongest  absorption  in  close proximity to the SiO emission,
          indicating    unambiguous    material    infall    toward   the
          counter-rotating  protostellar  disk  at  a new source location
          within  the  IRAS  16293-2422  complex.  The  details  of these
          observations and our interpretations are discussed.

          Comments: 14 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We report phase-referenced VLBA observations of H$_{2}$O masers
          near  the  star-forming region W3(OH) to measure their parallax
          and  absolute  proper  motions. The measured annual parallax is
          0.489  $\pm$ 0.017 milli-arcseconds (2.04 $\pm$ 0.07 kpc) where
          the   error   is   dominated   by   a   systematic  atmospheric
          contribution.  This  distance  is  consistent  with photometric
          distances  from  previous  observations  and  with the distance
          determined  from  CH$_3$OH  maser  astrometry  presented  in  a
          related  paper.  We  also  find  that  the  source  driving the
          H$_{2}$O outflow, the ``TW-object'', moves with a 3-dimensional
          velocity   of   $\approx$   10  km  s$^{-1}$  relative  to  the
          ultracompact \ion{H}{2} region W3(OH).

          Authors:  John  F.  Hawley  (1),  Julian  H.  Krolik  (2)  ((1)
          University of Virginia, (2) Johns Hopkins University)
          Comments:  43  pages  12 figures To Appear in the Astrophysical
          Journal
          We  compute  a series of three-dimensional general relativistic
          magnetohydrodynamic  simulations of accretion flows in the Kerr
          metric  to  investigate  the properties of the unbound outflows
          that  result.  The overall strength of these outflows increases
          sharply  with increasing black hole rotation rate, but a number
          of  generic  features  are  found in all cases. The mass in the
          outflow is concentrated in a hollow cone whose opening angle is
          largely  determined  by  the  effective  potential  for  matter
          orbiting  with  angular  momentum  comparable  to  that  of the
          innermost   stable   circular   orbit.   The   dominant   force
          accelerating  the matter outward comes from the pressure of the
          accretion  disk's corona. The principal element that shapes the
          outflow   is   therefore  the  centrifugal  barrier  preventing
          accreting matter from coming close to the rotation axis. Inside
          the  centrifugal  barrier, the cone contains very little matter
          and  is  dominated  by  electromagnetic fields that rotate at a
          rate  tied  closely  to  the  rotation of the black hole. These
          fields  carry  an  outward-going  Poynting flux whose immediate
          energy source is the rotating spacetime of the Kerr black hole.
          When the spin parameter a/M of the black hole exceeds ~0.9, the
          energy  carried to infinity by these outflows can be comparable
          to   the   nominal   radiative   efficiency  predicted  in  the
          Novikov-Thorne  model. Similarly, the expelled angular momentum
          can  be comparable to that accreted by the black hole. Both the
          inner  electromagnetic  part  and  the  outer  matter  part can
          contribute  in  significant  fashion  to the energy and angular
          momentum of the outflow.

          Comments: Accepted by The Astrophysical Journal, in press
          We present new K-band long baseline interferometer observations
          of  three  young stellar objects of the FU Orionis class, V1057
          Cyg,   V1515   Cyg   and   Z   CMa-SE,  obtained  at  the  Keck
          Interferometer  during  its  commissioning  science period. The
          interferometer  clearly  resolves  the  source of near-infrared
          emission  in all three objects. Using simple geometrical models
          we derive size scales (0.5-4.5 AU) for this emission. All three
          objects  appear  significantly more resolved than expected from
          simple  models  of  accretion  disks tuned to fit the broadband
          optical  and infrared spectro-photometry. We explore variations
          in  the  key  parameters  that  are able to lower the predicted
          visibility amplitudes to the measured levels, and conclude that
          accretion  disks  alone  do  not  reproduce the spectral energy
          distributions   and   K-band  visibilities  simultaneously.  We
          conclude that either disk models are inadequate to describe the
          near-infrared  emission,  or  additional  source components are
          needed. We hypothesize that large scale emission (10s of AU) in
          the  interferometer  field  of  view  is  responsible  for  the
          surprisingly  low  visibilities.  This  emission  may  arise in
          scattering  by  large  envelopes  believed  to  surround  these
          objects.

          Title:  Modeling Luminosity-Dependent Galaxy Clustering Through
          Cosmic Time
          Authors:  Charlie  Conroy, Risa H. Wechsler, Andrey V. Kravtsov
          (University of Chicago)
          Comments: 15 pages 11 figures, ApJ submitted
          We  employ  high-resolution  dissipationless simulations of the
          concordance   LambdaCDM   cosmology   to   model  the  observed
          luminosity   dependence  and  evolution  of  galaxy  clustering
          through  most  of  the age of the universe, from z~5 to z~0. We
          use  a simple, non-parametric model which monotonically relates
          galaxy  luminosities  to  the maximum circular velocity of dark
          matter   halos   (V_max)  by  preserving  the  observed  galaxy
          luminosity  function in order to match the halos in simulations
          with  observed  galaxies. The novel feature of the model is the
          use  of the maximum circular velocity at the time of accretion,
          V_max,acc,  for  subhalos,  the  halos  located  within  virial
          regions  of  larger  halos.  We  argue  that  for  subhalos  in
          dissipationless  simulations, V_max,acc reflects the luminosity
          and  stellar  mass  of  the associated galaxies better than the
          circular  velocity  at the epoch of observation, V_max,now. The
          simulations  and  our model L-V_max relation predict the shape,
          amplitude,   and   luminosity   dependence   of  the  two-point
          correlation  function  in excellent agreement with the observed
          galaxy  clustering  in  the  SDSS  data at z~0 and in the DEEP2
          samples  at  z~1  over  the  entire  probed  range of projected
          separations,   0.1<r_p/(h^-1   Mpc)<10.0.  In  particular,  the
          small-scale   upturn  of  the  correlation  function  from  the
          power-law  form  in  the  SDSS  and  DEEP2  luminosity-selected
          samples is reproduced very well. At z~3-5, our predictions also
          match the observed shape and amplitude of the angular two-point
          correlation  function  of  Lyman-break  galaxies (LBGs) on both
          large  and  small  scales,  including  the  small-scale upturn.

          Title:  Formation  of  an  early-type  galaxy from cosmological
          initial conditions?
          Authors:  Thorsten Naab, Peter H. Johansson, George Efstathiou,
          Jeremiah P. Ostriker
          Comments: submitted to ApJL
          We  describe  a high resolution Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
          (SPH)  simulation  of  a  spheroidal galaxy starting from \LCDM
          initial  conditions which is intentionally simple, and includes
          photoionization and cooling of the intergalactic medium but not
          feedback  from  AGN  or  supernovae.  The  galaxy  undergoes an
          initial  burst  of star formation at $z \approx 5$, accompanied
          by  the  formation  of  a  bubble  of  heated  gas and does not
          experience  a major merger after $z=3$. Heating from shocks and
          -PdV  work  dominates  over cooling so that for most of the gas
          the  temperature  is  an  increasing  function  of  time. By $z
          \approx  1$,  80% of the final stellar spheroid is in place and
          the  spectral  energy  distribution resembles those of observed
          extremely red objects (EROs). By the present day, the simulated
          galaxy  is  an old ($\approx 10 {\rm Gyrs}$), kinematically hot
          stellar  system  with  a  stellar  mass  of $\approx 1.2 \times
          10^{11} M_{\odot}$, surrounded by a hot gaseous halo containing
          40%  of  the  baryonic  matter.  Stars dominate the mass of the
          galaxy  up  to  $\approx 4$ effective radii ($\approx 10$ kpc).
          Projected  photometric  and  kinematic  properties  are in good
          agreement   with   observed   field   elliptical  galaxies.  In
          particular,  unlike  some recent simulations, the final stellar
          system  has  a  concentration  that  is  quite  typical of real
          elliptical  galaxies.  Our  simulation  shows  that a realistic
          intermediate  mass  giant  elliptical  galaxy  with a plausible
          formation  history  can be formed from \LCDM initial conditions
          without   requiring  recent  major  mergers  or  feedback  from
          supernovae or AGN.

          Title:  Capture  of  a  Red Giant by the Black Hole Sgr A* as a
          Possible Origin for the TeV Gamma-Rays from the Galactic Center
          Authors: Y. Lu, K.S. Cheng, Y.F. Huang
          Comments: 15 pages, 1 figure, Accepted to ApJ
          Non-thermal TeV $\gamma$-ray emission within multi-pc scale has
          been  observed  from  the center region of our galaxy. We argue
          that these $\gamma$-rays are the result of a transient activity
          of  the  massive  black  hole  Sgr  A$^*$  which resides at the
          Galactic  center.  About thousands of years ago, the black hole
          may  have  experienced an active phase by capturing a red giant
          star  and  forming an accretion disk, temporarily behaving like
          an  active  galactic  nuclear.  A  powerful jet, which contains
          plenty  of high speed protons, was launched during the process.
          These  runaway  protons interact with the dense ambient medium,
          producing     TeV    $\gamma$-ray    emission    through    the
          $\pi^\circ$-decay  process.  We  show  that  the  total  energy
          deposited   in   this  way  is  large  enough  to  account  for
          observations.   The   diffusion   length  of  protons  is  also
          consistent with the observed size of the TeV source.

          publication in the ApJL
          We  have  mapped  the  SiO  J=5-4 line at 217GHz from the HH211
          molecular  outflow with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The high
          resolution  map (1.6''x0.9'') shows that the SiO J=5-4 emission
          comes from the central narrow jet along the outflow axis with a
          width of ~0.8'' (~250 AU) FWHM. The SiO jet consists of a chain
          of  knots  separated  by  3-4''  (~1000 AU) and most of the SiO
          knots  have counterparts in shocked H_2 emission seen in a new,
          deep  VLT  near-infrared image of the outflow. A new, innermost
          pair  of  knots  are discovered at just +/-2'' from the central
          star.  The  line  ratio  between  the  SiO J=5-4 data and upper
          limits  from  the  SiO  J=1-0  data of Chandler & Richer (2001)
          suggests  that  these  knots  have  a  temperature in excess of
          300-500  K  and  a density of (0.5-1) x10^7 cm^{-3}. The radial
          velocity  measured  for  these knots is ~30 km/s, comparable to
          the   maximum  velocity  seen  in  the  entire  jet.  The  high
          temperature,  high  density, and velocity structure observed in
          this pair of SiO knots suggest that they are closely related to
          the primary jet launched close to the protostar.

          Title:  Infrared  Spectroscopy  of  Symbiotic  Stars. IV. V2116

          Authors: Kenneth H. Hinkle, Francis C. Fekel, Richard R. Joyce,
          Peter R. Wood, Verne V. Smith, Thomas Lebzelter
          Comments:  In press to The Astrophysical Journal (10 April 2006
          issue). 23 pages
          We  have  computed, based on 17 infrared radial velocities, the
          first  set of orbital elements for the M giant in the symbiotic
          binary V2116 Ophiuchi. The giant's companion is a neutron star,
          the  bright  X-ray  source GX 1+4. We find an orbital period of
          1161  days  by  far  the longest of any known X-ray binary. The
          orbit  has  a  modest  eccentricity  of  0.10  with  an orbital
          circularization  time  of  less than 10^6 years. The large mass
          function of the orbit significantly restricts the mass of the M
          giant.  Adopting a neutron-star mass of 1.35M(Sun), the maximum
          mass  of  the M giant is 1.22M(Sun), making it the less massive
          star.   Derived   abundances   indicate   a  slightly  subsolar
          metallicity.  Carbon  and  nitrogen  are  in the expected ratio
          resulting from the red-giant first dredge-up phase. The lack of
          O-17  suggests that the M-giant has a mass less than 1.3M(Sun),
          consistent  with  our  maximum  mass.  The  red giant radius is
          103R(Sun),  much  smaller than the estimated Roche lobe radius.
          Thus,  the  mass  loss  of the red giant is via a stellar wind.
          Although  the  M giant companion to the neutron star has a mass
          similar  to  the late-type star in low-mass X-ray binaries, its
          near-solar  abundances  and  apparent  runaway velocity are not
          fully consistent with the properties of this class of stars.

          has attracted attention in the past as a candidate post-T Tauri
          star  although  this  has  subsequently  been ruled out. It was
          previously  known  to  be  a  double-lined spectroscopic binary
          (F8+G6)  with  a  period  of  17.6  days,  and to show velocity
          residuals  indicating  a  more  distant massive third companion
          with a period of at least 8 years. Based on our radial velocity
          measurements  covering more than two cycles of the outer orbit,
          along  with  other  measurements,  we derive an accurate triple
          orbital  solution giving an outer period of 9.447 +/- 0.017 yr.
          The  third  object is more massive than either of the other two
          components of HD 27638B, but is not apparent in the spectra. We
          derive  absolute  visual  magnitudes and effective temperatures
          for  the  three  visible  stars  in HD 27638. Isochrone fitting
          based  on  those  properties gives an age of 200 +/- 50 Myr for
          the  system.  We  infer also an inclination angle of about 53.3
          degrees  for  the  inner  orbit  of  HD  27638B.  We  detect  a
          near-infrared  excess  in  HD  27638B which we attribute to the
          third  star  being  a close binary composed of late-type stars.
          This  explains  its large mass and lack of a visible signature.
          Modeling  of this excess allows us to infer not only the masses
          of  the  components  of  the  unseen  companion,  but  also the
          inclination  angle  of  the outer orbit (approximately 73 deg).
          The HD 27638 system is thus at least quintuple.

          Title:  Massive  stars  in  sub-parsec  rings  around  galactic
          centers
          Authors: Sergei Nayakshin (U of Leicester)
          Comments: submitted to MNRAS, 7 pages, 4 figures
          We consider the structure of self-gravitating marginally stable
          accretion  disks  in galactic centers in which a small fraction
          of  the  disk mass has been converted into proto-stars. We find
          that  proto-stars  accrete  gaseous  disk  matter at prodigious
          rates. Mainly due to the stellar accretion luminosity, the disk
          heats  up and geometrically thickens, shutting off further disk
          fragmentation.  The  existing  proto-stars  however continue to
          gain  mass  by  gas  accretion.  As a results, the initial mass
          function  for  disk-born  stars  at distances R ~ 0.03-3 parsec
          from  the  super-massive  black  hole  should be top-heavy. The
          effect  is most pronounced at around R ~ 0.1 parsec. We suggest
          that  this  result  explains  observations  of  rings  of young
          massive  stars  in our Galaxy and in M31, and predict that more
          of such rings will be discovered.

          We  report  the  initial  results  of  a  VLT/NACO high spatial
          resolution  imaging survey for multiple systems among 58 M-type
          members of the nearby Upper Scorpius OB association. Nine pairs
          with  separations  below  100  have  been resolved. Their small
          angular separations and the similarity in the brightness of the
          components  (DMagK  <1  for  all  of them), indicate there is a
          reasonable  likelihood several of them are true binaries rather
          than  chance  projections.  Follow-up imaging observations with
          WHT/LIRIS  of  the  two  widest  binaries  confirm  that  their
          near-infrared  colours  are  consistent  with physical very low
          mass binaries. For one of these two binaries, WHT/LIRIS spectra
          of   each  component  were  obtained.  We  find  that  the  two
          components  have similar M6-M7 spectral types and signatures of
          low-gravity, as expected for a young brown dwarf binary in this
          association.   Our  preliminary  results  indicate  a  possible
          population of very low-mass binaries with semimajor axis in the
          range  100  AU  150 AU, which has not been seen in the Pleiades
          open  cluster.  If  these  candidates  are  confirmed  (one  is
          confirmed  by this work), these results would indicate that the
          binary  properties  of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs may
          depend on the environment where they form.

          to ApJ
          We  present  the  results  of X-ray observations of four bright
          transients   sources  detected  in  the  July  2004  XMM-Newton
          observations  of  the  central bulge of M31. Two X-ray sources,
          XMMU   J004315.5+412440   and   XMMU   J004144.7+411110,   were
          discovered  for  the  first  time.  Two  other  sources, CXOM31
          J004309.9+412332  and  CXOM31 J004241.8+411635, were previously
          detected  by  Chandra.  The  properties  of the sources suggest
          their  identification with accreting binary systems in M31. The
          X-ray   spectra   and   variability   of   two   sources,  XMMU
          J004144.7+411110  and  CXOM31  J004241.8+411635, are similar to
          that  of the Galactic black hole transients, making them a good
          black  hole  candidates. The X-ray source XMMU J004315.5+412440
          demonstrates  a  dramatic  decline  of the X-ray flux on a time
          scale  of  three  days,  and a remarkable flaring behavior on a
          short  time scales. The X-ray data on XMMU J004315.5+412440 and
          CXOM31  J004309.9+412332  suggest that they can be either black
          hole   or  neutron  star  systems.  Combining  the  results  of
          2000-2004  XMM observations of M31, we estimate a total rate of
          the  bright transient outbursts in the central region of M31 to
          be 6-12 per year, in agreement with previous studies.

          Title:  Simple, Accurate, Approximate Orbits in the Logarithmic
          and a Range of Power-Law Galactic Potentials
          Authors: Curtis Struck (Iowa State)
          Comments:  38  pages,  8  figures,  1  table,  accepted for the
          Astron. J
          Curves  in a family derived from powers of the polar coordinate
          formula  for  ellipses  are found to provide good fits to bound
          orbits  in a range of power-law potentials. This range includes
          the  well-known  $1/r$  (Keplerian) and logarithmic potentials.
          These approximate orbits, called p-ellipses, retain some of the
          basic  geometric  properties  of  ellipses.  They  satisfy  and
          generalize Newton's apsidal precession formula, which is one of
          the  reasons  for  their  surprising accuracy. Because of their
          simplicity  the  p-ellipses make very useful tools for studying
          trends among power-law potentials, and especially the occurence
          of  closed  orbits.  The  occurence  of closed or nearly closed
          orbits  in  different  potentials highlights the possibility of
          period  resonances  between  precessing,  eccentric  orbits and
          circular   orbits,   or   between   the  precession  period  of
          multi-lobed  closed  orbits and satellite periods. These orbits
          and  their  resonances  promise  to help illuminate a number of
          problems in galaxy and accretion disk dynamics.

          Title:  The MHD collapsar model for GRBs: an inflow produces an
          outflow
          Authors: Daniel Proga (UNLV)
          Comments:  12  pages,  to  appear  in  "Triggering Relativistic
          Jets", an invited talk
          We  present  our recent results from numerical simulations of a
          magnetized  flow in the vicinity of a black hole in the context
          of  the  collapsar  model  for  GRBs. The simulations show that
          after  an  initial  transient,  the flow settles into a complex
          convolution of several distinct, time-dependent flow components
          including an accretion torus, its corona and outflow, an inflow
          and  an  outflow  in the polar funnel. We focus on studying the
          nature  and  connection between these components, in particular
          between   the  inflows  and  related  outflows.  We  find  that
          rotational  and MHD effects launch, accelerate, and sustain the
          outflows.  We also find that an outflow can be formed even when
          the  collapsing  envelope  has  initially  a very weak magnetic
          field and a very small angular momentum. Our main conclusion is
          that  even  for  a relatively weak initial magnetic field and a
          slow  rotation,  a gravitational collapse of a stellar envelope
          can lead to formation of a very strong and very fast jet.

          Title:  The  Youngest Stellar clusters Clusters associated with
          massive protostellar candidates
          Authors: M. S. N. Kumar, E. Keto, E. Clerkin
          Comments: 14pages, 5 figures and 1 table
          We  report on the identification of 54 embedded clusters around
          217  massive  protostellar  candidates of which 34 clusters are
          new detections. The embedded clusters are identified as stellar
          surface  density  enhancements  in  the 2 $\mu$m All Sky Survey
          (2MASS)  data.  Because  the  clusters  are all associated with
          massive   stars  in  their  earliest  evolutionary  stage,  the
          clusters  should  also  be in an early stage of evolution. Thus
          the  properties  of  these  clusters  should reflect properties
          associated  with  their  formation rather than their evolution.
          For each cluster, we estimate the mass, the morphological type,
          the  photometry  and  extinction. The clusters in our study, by
          their association with massive protostars and massive outflows,
          reinstate the notion that massive stars begin to form after the
          first  generation  of  low  mass  stars  have  completed  their
          accretion  phase.  Further, the observed high gas densities and
          accretion  rates at the centers of these clusters is consistent
          with  the  hypothesis  that  high mass stars form by continuing
          accretion onto low mass stars.

          Comments: 41 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables
          We  present  infrared echelle spectroscopy of three Herbig-Haro
          (HH)  driving  sources  (SVS  13, B5-IRS 1 and HH 34 IRS) using
          Subaru-IRCS.  The  large  diameter  of  the  telescope and wide
          spectral  coverage  of  the  spectrograph  allowed us to detect
          several  H_2  and  [Fe  II]  lines in the H- and K-bands. These
          include  H_2  lines  arising from v=1-3 and J=1-11, and [Fe II]
          lines  with upper level energies of E/k=1.1-2.7x10^4 K. For all
          objects  the  outflow is found to have two velocity components:
          (1) a high-velocity (-70 to -130 km s^-1) component (HVC), seen
          in  [Fe  II]  or  H_2 emission and associated with a collimated
          jet;  and  (2)  a  low-velocity  (-10 to -30 km s^-1) component
          (LVC), which is seen in H_2 emission only and is spatially more
          compact. Such a kinematic structure resembles optical forbidden
          emission line outflows associated with classical T Tauri stars,
          whereas   the   presence   of   H_2   emission   reflects   the
          low-excitation  nature  of  the  outflowing  gas close to these
          protostars. The observed H_2 flux ratios indicate a temperature
          of  2-3x10^3  K,  and  a  gas  density  of  10^5 cm^-3 or more,
          supporting  shocks  as the heating mechanism. B5-IRS 1 exhibits
          faint  extended  emission associated with the H_2-LVC, in which
          the  radial  velocity  slowly  increases with distance from the
          protostar  (by  ~20  km  s^-1 at ~500 AU). This is explained as
          warm molecular gas entrained by an unseen wide-angled wind. The
          [Fe  II]  flux  ratios  indicate electron densities to be ~10^4
          cm^-3 or greater, similar to forbidden line outflows associated
          with  classical  T Tauri stars. Finally the kinematic structure
          of  the [Fe II] emission associated with the base of the B5-IRS
          1 and HH 34 IRS outflows is shown to support disk-wind models.

          Title: On the Spectral Lags of the Short Gamma-Ray Bursts
          Authors: Tingfeng Yi (GXU), Enwei Liang (GXU, UNLV), Yiping Qin
          (YNAO), Ruijing Lu (GXU, YNAO)
          Comments: 6 pages in MNRAS compact format, 7 figures, submitted
          to MNRAS
          We  present a detail analysis on the spectral lags of the short
          gamma-ray  bursts (GRBs) and compare them with that of the long
          GRBs  by  using  the CGRO/BATSE GRB Catalog. Our results are as
          follows.  (1)The spectral lag distribution of the short GRBs is
          significantly  different  from that of the long GRBs. Excluding
          the statistical fluctuation effect, a proportion of ~17% of the
          short GRBs have a negative spectral lag, i.e., the hard photons
          being  lag behind the soft photons. We do not find any peculiar
          features  from  their  light curves to distinguish these bursts
          from  those  with a positive spectral lag. We argue that a more
          physical mechanism dominated the hard lag may be hid behind the
          morphological  features  of  the light curves. This should be a
          great  challenge to the current GRB models. We notice that this
          proportion  is  consistent  with  the  proportion of short GRBs
          correlated  with  nearby galaxies newly discovered by Tanvir et
          al.,  although  it  is  unclear  if these short GRBs are indeed
          associated   with  the  sources  originated  at  low  redshift.
          (2)While  the  spectral  lags  of  the  long  GRBs are strongly
          correlated with the pulse durations, they are not for the short
          GRBs.  However,  the  ratios  of  the spectral lag to the pulse
          duration  for  the  short and long GRBs normally distributed at
          0.023   and   0.046,   respectively,  with  the  sample  width,
          indicating  that  the  curvature effect alone could not explain
          the  difference  of  the spectral lags between the two types of
          GRBs.  The  hydrodynamic  timescales  of  the  outflows and the
          radiative  processes  at  work  in  GRBs  might  also  play  an
          important role as suggested by Daigne and Mochkovitch.

          Title:  On  the  Collapsar  Model  of  Long  Gamma-Ray  Bursts:
          Constraints from Cosmic Metallicity Evolution
          Authors: N. Langer, C.A. Norman
          Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures; accepted as ApJ Letter
          We   explore   the   consequences   of  new  observational  and
          theoretical  evidence  that  long  gamma-ray  bursts prefer low
          metallicity     environments.     Using     recently    derived
          mass-metallicity  correlations  and the mass function from SDSS
          studies,  and  adopting an average cosmic metallicity evolution
          from  \citet{kewley2005}  and  \citet{savaglio2005}  we  derive
          expressions for the the relative number of massive stars formed
          below  a  given  fraction  of solar metallicity, $\epsilon$, as
          function  of  redshift. We demonstrate that about 1/10th of all
          stars  form  with  $\epsilon < 0.1$. Therefore, a picture where
          the  majority  of  GRBs  form  with  $\epsilon  <  0.1$  is not
          inconsistent  with  an empirical global SN/GRB ratio of 1/1000.
          It  implies  that  (1)  GRB's  peak  at  a significantly higher
          redshift  than  supernovae;  (2)  massive star evolution at low
          metallicity  may be qualitatively different and; (3) the larger
          the  low-metallicity  bias  of  GRBs  the  less  likely  binary
          evolution channels can be significant GRB producers.

          Title:   Cluster   Formation   in  Protostellar  Outflow-Driven
          Turbulence
          Authors:  Zhi-Yun  Li  (Univ.  of  Virginia), Fumitaka Nakamura
          (Niigata Univ.)
          Comments: 11 pages (aastex format), 2 figures submitted to ApJL
          Most, perhaps all, stars go through a phase of vigorous outflow
          during  formation.  We  examine, through 3D MHD simulation, the
          effects  of protostellar outflows on cluster formation. We find
          that  the  initial  turbulence in the cluster-forming region is
          quickly   replaced   by  motions  generated  by  outflows.  The
          protostellar    outflow-driven    turbulence    (``protostellar
          turbulence''  for  short) can keep the region close to a virial
          equilibrium long after the initial turbulence has decayed away.
          We   argue   that  there  exist  two  types  of  turbulence  in
          star-forming   clouds:   a   primordial  (or  ``interstellar'')
          turbulence  and  a  protostellar  turbulence,  with  the former
          transformed into the latter mostly in embedded clusters such as
          NGC  1333.  Since  the majority of stars are thought to form in
          clusters,  an  implication  is  that  the  stellar initial mass
          function   is  determined  to  a  large  extent  by  the  stars
          themselves,  through outflows which individually limit the mass
          accretion   onto  forming  stars  and  collectively  shape  the
          environments  (density  structure  and velocity field) in which
          most   cluster   members   form.   We  speculate  that  massive
          cluster-forming  clumps  supported  by  protostellar turbulence
          gradually   evolve   towards   a   highly  centrally  condensed
          ``pivotal''  state,  culminating  in rapid formation of massive
          stars in the densest part through accretion.

          Title:  The Impact of Box Size on the Properties of Dark Matter
          Haloes in Cosmological Simulations
          Authors: Chris Power, Alexander Knebe
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS; 10 pages, 12 figures
          We investigate the impact finite simulation box size has on the
          structural  and kinematic properties of Cold Dark Matter haloes
          forming  in  cosmological  simulations.  Our  approach involves
          generating  a  single realisation of the initial power spectrum
          of  density  perturbations  and studying how truncation of this
          power   spectrum  on  scales  larger  than  L_cut  affects  the
          structure  of dark matter haloes at z=0. In particular, we have
          examined the cases of L_cut = f_cut L_box with f_cut=1 (i.e. no
          truncation), 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4. In common with previous studies,
          we  find  that the suppression of long wavelength perturbations
          reduces   the   strength   of  clustering,  as  measured  by  a
          suppression  of  the  2-point  correlation  function xi(r), and
          reduces the numbers of the most massive haloes, as reflected in
          the  depletion  of the high mass end of the mass function n(M).
          Interestingly, we find that truncation has little impact on the
          internal  properties  of haloes. The masses of high mass haloes
          decrease  in  a  systematic manner as L_cut is reduced, but the
          distribution  of  concentrations  is  unaffected.  On the other
          hand,  the  median  spin  parameter  is ~50% lower in runs with
          f_cut<1.  We argue that this is an imprint of the linear growth
          phase  of  the  halo's  angular momentum by tidal torquing, and
          that  the  absence of any measurable trend in concentration and
          the weak trend observed in halo shape reflect the importance of
          virialisation  and  complex  mass accretion histories for these
          quantities.  These  results  are  of  interest for studies that
          require   high  mass  resolution  and  statistical  samples  of
          simulated  haloes,  such  as  simulations  of the population of
          first  stars.  Our analysis shows that large-scale tidal fields
          have  relatively  little  effect  on the internal properties of
          Cold  Dark  Matter  haloes  and  hence  may  be ignored in such
          studies.

          Title:  Multi-periodic  variations  in the last 104 years light
          curve of the symbiotic star BF Cyg
          Authors:   Elia   Leibowitz,   Liliana   Formiggini  (Tel  Aviv
          University-Israel)
          Comments: 9 pages 7 figures. Accepted by MNRAS
          We analyse a light curve of the symbiotic star BF Cyg, covering
          114  years  of  its  photometric  history. The star had a major
          outburst  around  the  year  1894.  Since then the mean optical
          brightness of the system is in steady decline, reaching only in
          the  last  few years its pre-outburst value. Superposed on this
          general  decline  are  some  6  less  intense  outbursts of 1-2
          magnitude  and  duration  of 2000-5000 days. We find a cycle of
          ~6376 days, or possibly twice this period, in the occurrence of
          these  outbursts.  We  suggest  that  the  origin of the system
          outbursts  is in some magnetic cycle in the outer layers of the
          giant  star  of the system, akin to the less intense ~8000 days
          magnetic cycle of our Sun. We further find, that in addition to
          its  well  known  binary period of 757.3 days, BF Cyg possesses
          also  another  photometric  period of 798.8 days. This could be
          the  rotation period of the giant star of the system. If it is,
          the  beat period of these two periodicities, 14580 days, is the
          rotation  period of a tidal wave on the surface of the giant. A
          4th  period  of 4436 days, the beat period of the 14580 and the
          6376 cycles is possibly also present in the LC. We predict that
          BF  Cyg  will  be  at  the peak of its next outburst around the
          month  of May in the year 2007. The newly discovered 798.8 days
          period  explains the disappearance of the orbital modulation at
          some  epochs in the light curve. The 757.3 oscillations will be
          damped again around the year 2013.

          Title:  Correlated X-ray spectral and timing variability of the
          Be/X-ray binary V0332+53/BQ Cam during a type II outburst
          Authors:  P. Reig (FORTH/U. of Crete), S. Martinez-Nunez (GACE,
          U. of Valencia), V. Reglero (GACE, U. of Valencia)
          Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures, accepted by A&A
          We  have  used  INTEGRAL  & RXTE data to investigate the timing
          properties  of  the  source  in  correlation  with its spectral
          states  as  defined by different positions in the colour-colour
          diagram.   The  source  shows  two  distinct  branches  in  the
          colour-colour diagram that resemble those of the Z sources. The
          hard  branch (similar to the horizontal branch of Z sources) is
          characterised  by  a  low-amplitude  change  of the hard colour
          compared  to  the change in the soft colour. In the soft branch
          (analogue to the normal branch) the amplitude of variability of
          the  hard  colour  is about three times larger than that of the
          soft  colour.  As  the count rate decreases the source moves up
          gradually  through  the  soft to the hard branch. The aperiodic
          variability   (excluding   the   pulse   noise)   consists   of
          band-limited  noise  (represented  by  three  broad  Lorentzian
          components)  and  two QPOs at 0.05 Hz and 0.22 Hz. The strength
          of  the  lower frequency QPO increases as the source approaches
          the  hard  branch  (similar  to  HBOs in Z sources). The higher
          frequency  QPO  reaches maximum significance when the source is
          in  the middle of the branch (like NBOs). We have performed the
          first  measurements  of  phase  lags  in the band limited noise
          below  8  Hz  in  an accreting X-ray pulsar and found that soft
          lags  dominate  at  high frequencies. Above the pulse frequency
          (0.23 Hz), the amplitude of the lag increases as the X-ray flux
          increases.  The  Z  topology  appears  to be a signature of the
          neutron  star  binaries  as  it  is  present  in  all  types of
          neutron-star  binaries  (Z,  atoll  and,  as  we  show here, in
          accreting  pulsars  as  well).  However,  the motion along this
          track,  the  time  scales through the different branches of the
          diagram  and the aperiodic variability associated with portions
          of the Z track differ for each subclass of neutron-star binary.

          Title: Gas Flow Across Gaps in Protoplanetary Disks
          Authors: Steve H. Lubow, Gennaro D'Angelo
          Comments:  10  pages,  3  figures,  1  table.  To appear in The
          Astrophysical Journal
          We analyze the gas accretion flow through a planet-produced gap
          in  a  protoplanetary  disk.  We adopt the alpha disk model and
          ignore   effects   of   planetary   migration.   We  develop  a
          semi-analytic,  one-dimensional  model  that  accounts  for the
          effects  of  the  planet  as  a  mass  sink  and also carry out
          two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a planet embedded
          in  a  disk.  The predictions of the mass flow rate through the
          gap  based  on the semi-analytic model generally agree with the
          hydrodynamical  simulations  at  the  25%  level. Through these
          models, we are able to explore steady state disk structures and
          over  large  spatial  ranges.  The  presence  of  an  accreting
          Jupiter-mass  planet  significantly  lowers  the density of the
          disk  within  a  region  of  several times the planet's orbital
          radius. The mass flow rate across the gap (and onto the central
          star)  is  typically  10%  to  25%  of  the mass accretion rate
          outside the orbit of the planet, for planet-to-star mass ratios
          that range from 5e-5 to 1e-3.

          Title: Submillimeter emission from the hot molecular jet HH 211

          Comments: 3 pages, 3 figures. Accepted by Astrophysical Journal
          Letters
          We  observed  the HH 211 jet in the submillimeter continuum and
          the  CO(3-2)  and  SiO(8-7)  transitions with the Submillimeter
          Array.  The  continuum  source  detected  at  the center of the
          outflow  shows  an  elongated  morphology, perpendicular to the
          direction  of  the  outflow axis. The high-velocity emission of
          both  molecules shows a knotty and highly collimated structure.
          The  SiO(8-7) emission at the base of the outflow, close to the
          driving  source,  spans a wide range of velocities, from -20 up
          to  40  km  s^{-1}. This suggests that a wide-angle wind may be
          the  driving  mechanism  of  the  HH 211 outflow. For distances
          greater  than  5"  (1500  AU) from the driving source, emission
          from  both  transitions  follows  a  Hubble-law  behavior, with
          SiO(8-7)  reaching  higher  velocities  than CO(3-2), and being
          located  upstream of the CO(3-2) knots. This indicates that the
          SiO(8-7) emission is likely tracing entrained gas very close to
          the  primary  jet,  while  the  CO(3-2)  is  tracing less dense
          entrained  gas. From the SiO(5-4) data of Hirano et al. we find
          that  the  SiO(8-7)/SiO(5-4) brightness temperature ratio along
          the  jet  decreases for knots far from the driving source. This
          is  consistent  with the density decreasing along the jet, from
          (3-10)x10^6  cm^{-3}  at 500 AU to (0.8-4)x10^6 cm^{-3} at 5000
          AU from the driving source.

          We  study the colors, structural properties, and star formation
          histories  of  a sample of ~1600 dwarfs over look-back times of
          ~3  Gyr  (z=0.002-0.25).  The  sample  consists  of 401 distant
          dwarfs  drawn  from  the Galaxy Evolution from Morphologies and
          SEDs (GEMS) survey, which provides high resolution Hubble Space
          Telescope  (HST)  Advanced  Camera for Surveys (ACS) images and
          accurate  redshifts,  and  of 1291 dwarfs at 10-90 Mpc compiled
          from  the  Sloan  Digitized Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the
          GEMS dwarfs are bluer than the SDSS dwarfs, which is consistent
          with  star formation histories involving starbursts and periods
          of  continuous  star formation. The full range of colors cannot
          be  reproduced  by single starbursts or constant star formation
          alone.  We  derive  the star formation rates of the GEMS dwarfs
          and  estimate the mechanical luminosities needed for a complete
          removal of their gas. We find that a large fraction of luminous
          dwarfs  are  likely to retain their gas, whereas fainter dwarfs
          are  susceptible  to  a  significant  gas  loss,  if they would
          experience a starburst.

          Title:  Chandra Observations of A2670 and A2107: A Comet Galaxy
          and cDs with Large Peculiar Velocities
          Authors:  Yutaka  Fujita (Osaka U.), Craig L. Sarazin., Gregory
          R. Sivakoff (UVa)
          Comments: PASJ in press
          We  present  an  analysis of Chandra observations of the galaxy
          clusters A2670 and A2107. Their cD galaxies have large peculiar
          velocities  (>200km/s)  and  thus  the  clusters  appear  to be
          undergoing  mergers.  In  A2670, we find a comet-like structure
          around  one  of  the brightest galaxies. At the leading edge of
          the structure, there is a cold front. The mass of the X-ray gas
          in  the  comet-like structure suggests that the galaxy was in a
          small  cluster  or  group, and its intracluster medium (ICM) is
          being   stripped   by   ram-pressure.   The   regions  of  cool
          interstellar medium (ISM) of the cD galaxies in A2670 and A2107
          are  very compact. This is similar to the brightest galaxies in
          the  Coma  cluster,  which  is  also a merging cluster. In each
          galaxy,  the  short  cooling time of the ISM requires a heating
          source;  the  compact  nature of the ISM makes it unlikely that
          the heating source is a central active galactic nucleus (AGN).

          The  collapse  of non-collisional dark matter and the formation
          of   pancake   structures  in  the  Universe  are  investigated
          approximately.  Collapse  is  described by a system of ordinary
          differential  equations,  in the model of a uniformly rotating,
          three-axis, uniform density ellipsoid. Violent relaxation, mass
          and   angular   momentum   losses   are   taken   into  account
          phenomenologically.    The   formation   of   the   equilibrium
          configuration,  secular  instability  and the transition from a
          spheroid to a three-axis ellipsoid are investigated numerically
          and analytically in this dynamical model.

          Title: Modeling the Warm Absorber in AGN
          Authors: A. Rozanska, R. Goosmann, A.-M. Dumont., B. Czerny
          Comments: 15 pages, 17 figures, submitted to A&A
          We  present  a  wide  grid  of  models  for  the  structure and
          transmission  properties  of  warm absorbers in active galactic
          nuclei  (AGN).  Contrary  to  commonly  used  constant  density
          models,  our  absorbing  cloud  is assumed to be under constant
          total  (gas  plus  radiation) pressure. This assumption implies
          the  coexistence  of  material  at  different  temperatures and
          ionization  states,  which is a natural consequence of pressure
          and  thermal equilibrium. Our photoionization code allows us to
          compute  the  profiles of the density, the temperature, the gas
          pressure,  the  radiation  pressure  and  the  ionization state
          across  the  cloud,  and to calculate the radiative transfer of
          continuum  and  lines  including Compton scattering. Therefore,
          equivalent  widths  of both saturated and unsaturated lines are
          properly  modeled. For each pair of the incident spectrum slope
          and  the  ionization  parameter at the cloud surface there is a
          natural  upper limit to the total column densities of the cloud
          due   to   thermal  instabilities.  These  maximum  values  are
          comparable  to  the  observational  constraints  on  the column
          density  of  warm  absorbers which may give support to constant
          total  pressure  models.  In  all  models  we note considerable
          absorption   around   6.4  keV  which  modifies  the  intrinsic
          relativistically  broadened iron line profile originating in an
          accretion  disk  illuminated  atmosphere.  Our  models  can  be
          applied  to  fitting  the  spectroscopic  data  from  the  {\it
          XMM-Newton} and {\it Chandra} satellites.

          Title: Spectral Variability of Quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky

          Authors: B. C. Wilhite, D. E. Vanden Berk, R. J. Brunner, J. V.

          Comments: 52 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We examine the variability of the high-ionizaton C IV line in a
          sample  of 105 quasars observed at multiple epochs by the Sloan
          Digital  Sky  Survey.  We find a strong correlation between the
          change  in the C IV line flux and the change in the line width,
          but  no  correlations between the change in flux and changes in
          line center and skewness. The relation between line flux change
          and  line  width  change  is consistent with a model in which a
          broad  line  base  varies  with greater amplitude than the line
          core.  The objects studied here are more luminous and at higher
          redshift  than  those normally studied for variability, ranging
          in  redshift from 1.65 to 4.00 and in absolute r-band magnitude
          from  roughly  -24  to  -28. Using moment analysis line-fitting
          techniques,   we  measure  line  fluxes,  centers,  widths  and
          skewnesses for the C IV line at two epochs for each object. The
          well-known  Baldwin  Effect  is  seen for these objects, with a
          slope  beta  = -0.22. The sample has a median intrinsic Baldwin
          Effect  slope  of  beta  =  -0.85;  the  C  IV  lines  in these
          high-luminosity   quasars  appear  to  be  less  responsive  to
          continuum  variations  than  those  in  lower  luminosity  AGN.
          Additionally,  we  find no evidence for variability of the well
          known   blueshift  of  the  C  IV  line  with  respect  to  the
          low-ionization   Mg  II  line  in  the  highest  flux  objects,
          indicating  that this blueshift might be useful as a measure of
          orientation.

          Physics, Lisbon (Portugal), 21 - 27/07/2005
          We  use  the  formalism  of  finite-temperature field theory to
          study  the  interactions  of  ultra-high  energy  (UHE)  cosmic
          neutrinos  with the thermal background of relic neutrinos. From
          the  imaginary  part of the neutrino self-energy, calculated in
          terms  of  the Z boson propagator near the resonance, we derive
          general   expressions   for   the   UHE  neutrino  transmission
          probability.  This  allows  us to take into account the thermal
          effects  introduced  by  the momentum distribution of the relic
          neutrinos.   We   compare  our  results  with  the  approximate
          expressions   existing   in  the  literature  and  discuss  the
          influence  of  thermal  effects  on  the absorption dips in the
          context  of realistic UHE neutrino fluxes and favoured neutrino

          We  report  a  discovery of the Zeeman resolved spectral lines,
          corresponding  to  the  extremely  large magnetic field modulus
          <Bs>=17.5  kG,  in  the  cool  Ap  star  HD  178892.  The  mean
          longitudinal  field  of  this  star  reaches  7.5  kG,  and its
          rotational  modulation  implies  the  strength  of  the dipolar
          magnetic  component  Bp>=23 kG. We have revised rotation period
          of  the  star using the All Sky Automated Survey photometry and
          determined  P=8.2478  d.  Rotation  phases  of the magnetic and
          photometric  maxima  of  the  star coincide with each other. We
          obtained  Geneva  photometric  observation  of  HD  178892  and
          estimated  Teff=7700+/-250  K using photometry and the hydrogen
          Balmer  lines. Preliminary abundance analysis reveals abundance
          pattern typical of rapidly oscillating Ap stars.

          Title: Spectroscopic companions of very young brown dwarfs
          Authors: Joergens Viki (Leiden Observatory)
          Comments: Proceeding of ESO workshop 'Multiple Stars across the
          HRD' (Garching 2005). 6 pages, 4 figures
          I   review  here  the  results  of  the  first  RV  survey  for
          spectroscopic  companions  to very young brown dwarfs (BDs) and
          (very)  low-mass stars in the ChaI star-forming cloud with UVES
          at  the  VLT.  This survey studies the binary fraction in an as
          yet  unexplored  domain  not  only  in  terms of primary masses
          (substellar  regime)  and ages (a few Myr) but also in terms of
          companion  masses  (sensitive  down  to  planetary  masses) and
          separations  (< 1 AU). The UVES spectra obtained so far hint at
          spectroscopic  companions of a few Jupiter masses around one BD
          and  around one low-mass star (M4.5) with orbital periods of at
          least   several   months.  Furthermore,  the  data  indicate  a
          multiplicity  fraction  consistent  with  field BDs and stellar
          binaries for periods < 100 days.

          Title: Laboratory tests on dark energy
          Authors: Christian Beck
          Comments:  7  pages, 1 figure. Invited talk given at the 21 COE
          symposium  'Astrophysics  as Interdisciplinary Science', Waseda
          University,  Tokyo, 1-3 September 2005. To appear in Journal of
          Physics: Conference Series
          The  physical  nature  of the currently observed dark energy in
          the   universe   is  completely  unclear,  and  many  different
          theoretical  models  co-exist.  Nevertheless, if dark energy is
          produced by vacuum fluctuations then there is a chance to probe
          some  of  its  properties  by  simple laboratory tests based on
          Josephson  junctions.  These  electronic devices can be used to
          perform   `vacuum   fluctuation   spectroscopy',   by  directly
          measuring  a noise spectrum induced by vacuum fluctuations. One
          would expect to see a cutoff near 1.7 THz in the measured power
          spectrum,  provided  the  new  physics  underlying  dark energy
          couples  to  electric  charge.  The  effect  exploited  by  the
          Josephson junction is a subtile nonlinear mixing effect and has
          nothing to do with the Casimir effect or other effects based on
          van  der  Waals forces. A Josephson experiment of the suggested
          type  will  now  be built, and we should know the result within
          the next 3 years.

          We  use  line-of-sight  velocity information on the filamentary
          emission-line  nebula of NGC 1275 to infer a dynamical model of
          the  nebula's flow through the surrounding intracluster gas. We
          detect  outflowing gas and flow patterns that match simulations
          of  buoyantly  rising bubbles from which we deduce that some of
          the nebula filaments have been drawn out of NGC 1275. We find a
          radial gradient of the ratio [NII]6584/H-alpha which may be due
          to   a   variation   in   metallicity,  interactions  with  the
          surrounding   intracluster   medium   or  a  hardening  of  the
          excitation  mechanism. We find no preferred spatial correlation
          of stellar clusters within the filaments and there is a notable
          lack  of [OIII]5007 emission, therefore it is unlikely that the
          filaments are ionized by stellar UV.

          (abridged)  We  have  investigated  136  Chandra  extragalactic
          sources  without  broad  optical  emission  lines, including 93
          galaxies  with  narrow  emission  lines (NELG) and 43 with only
          absorption  lines  (ALG).  Based  on  fx/fo, Lx, X-ray spectral
          hardness   and  optical  emission  line  diagnostics,  we  have
          conservatively classified 36 normal galaxies (20 spirals and 16
          ellipticals) and 71 AGNs. We found no statistically significant
          evolution  in  Lx/LB, within the limited z range. We have built
          log(N)-log(S),  after  correcting  for  completeness based on a
          series  of  simulations.  The best-fit slope is -1.5 for both S
          and  B energy bands, which is considerably steeper than that of
          the  AGN-dominated  cosmic  background  sources,  but  slightly
          flatter  than the previous estimate, indicating normal galaxies
          will not exceed the AGN population until fx ~ 2 x 10-18 erg s-1
          cm-2 (a factor of ~5 lower than the previous estimate). A group
          of  NELGs  appear  to  be  heavily  obscured in X-rays, i.e., a
          typical  type 2 AGN. After correcting for intrinsic absorption,
          their  X-ray  luminosities  could be Lx > 10^44 erg s-1, making
          them  type  2 quasar candidates. While most X-ray luminous ALGs
          (XBONG  -  X-ray bright, optically normal galaxy candidates) do
          not  appear  to be significantly absorbed, we found two heavily
          obscured  objects,  which could be as luminous as an unobscured
          broad-line  quasar.  Among  43  ALGs,  we  found two E+A galaxy
          candidates  with  strong  Balmer absorption lines, but no [OII]
          line.  The  X-ray  spectra of both galaxies are soft and one of
          them  has  a  nearby  close  companion  galaxy,  supporting the
          merger/interaction  scenario  rather  than  the dusty starburst
          hypothesis.

          Title: Low State, Phase-Resolved IR Spectroscopy of VV Puppis
          Authors: Steve B. Howell, Thomas E. Harrison, Ryan K. Campbell,
          France A. Cordova, Paula Szkody
          Comments: Accepted in Astronomical Journal 5 figures
          We  present  phase-resolved  low  resolution  $JHK$  and higher
          resolution  $K$-band  spectroscopy  of  the  polar  VV Pup. All
          observations  were  obtained when VV Pup was in a low accretion
          state  having  a  K  magnitude  near  15.  The  low  resolution
          observations  reveal  cyclotron emission in the $J$ band during
          some  phases, consistent with an origin near the active 30.5 MG
          pole  on the white dwarf. The secondary in VV Pup appears to be
          a  normal M7V star and we find that the $H$ and $K$ band fluxes
          are  entirely due to this star at all orbital phases during the
          low   accretion  state.  We  use  our  higher  resolution  Keck
          spectroscopy  to  produce  the  first  $K$-band radial velocity
          curve  for VV Pup. Our orbital solution yields $K_2$=414$\pm27$
          km    sec$^{-1}$    and    leads    to    mass   estimates   of
          M$_1$=0.73$\pm$0.05    M$_{\odot}$    and   M$_2$=0.10$\pm$0.02
          M$_{\odot}$.  We  find that the mass accretion rates during the
          normal  low states of the polars VV Pup, EF Eri, and EQ Cet are
          near 10$^{-13}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The fact that \.M is not
          zero  in  low  state polars indicates active secondary stars in
          these  binary  systems,  including  the  sub-stellar donor star
          present in EF Eri.

          Title: The electromagnetic model of Gamma Ray Bursts
          Authors: Maxim Lyutikov (UBC, University of Rochester)
          Comments:  solicited contribution to Focus Issue of New Journal
          of Physics, 27 pages, 4 figures
          I  describe  electromagnetic  model  of  gamma  ray  bursts and
          contrast  its main properties and predictions with hydrodynamic
          fireball  model  and  its  magnetohydrodynamical extension. The
          electromagnetic  model  assumes  that  rotational  energy  of a
          relativistic,         stellar-mass        central        source
          (black-hole--accretion  disk  system  or  fast rotating neutron
          star) is converted into magnetic energy through unipolar dynamo
          mechanism,   propagated   to  large  distances  in  a  form  of
          relativistic,  subsonic,  Poynting  flux-dominated  wind and is
          dissipated    directly    into   emitting   particles   through
          current-driven instabilities. Thus, there is no conversion back
          and  forth between internal and bulk energies as in the case of
          fireball  model.  Collimating effects of magnetic hoop stresses
          lead to strongly non-spherical expansion and formation of jets.
          Long and short GRBs may develop in a qualitatively similar way,
          except  that  in  case  of  long  bursts ejecta expansion has a
          relatively  short, non-relativistic, strongly dissipative stage
          inside  the  star. Electromagnetic and fireball models (as well
          as  strongly and weakly magnetized fireballs) lead to different
          early  afterglow dynamics, before deceleration time. Finally, I
          discuss  the models in view of latest observational data in the
          Swift era.

          The XBootes Survey is a 5-ks Chandra survey of the Bootes Field
          of  the  NOAO  Deep  Wide-Field  Survey (NDWFS). This survey is
          unique in that it is the largest (9.3 deg^2), contiguous region
          imaged  in  X-ray  with  complementary deep optical and near-IR
          observations.  We present a catalog of the optical counterparts
          to  the  3,213  X-ray  point  sources  detected  in the XBootes
          survey. Using a Bayesian identification scheme, we successfully
          identified  optical  counterparts  for  98%  of the X-ray point
          sources. The optical colors suggest that the optically detected
          galaxies  are  a combination of z<1 massive early-type galaxies
          and  bluer  star-forming galaxies whose optical AGN emission is
          faint  or  obscured,  whereas  the  majority  of  the optically
          detected point sources are likely quasars over a large redshift
          range.  Our  large  area,  X-ray  bright, optically deep survey
          enables  us  to select a large sub-sample of sources (773) with
          high  X-ray  to optical flux ratios (f_x/f_o>10). These objects
          are  likely  high  redshift  and/or  dust  obscured  AGN. These
          sources  have  generally harder X-ray spectra than sources with
          0.1<f_x/f_o<10.  Of  the  73  X-ray  sources  with  no  optical
          counterpart  in the NDWFS catalog, 47 are truly optically blank
          down to R~25.5 (the average 50% completeness limit of the NDWFS
          R-band  catalogs).  These  sources  are  also likely to be high
          redshift and/or dust obscured AGN.

          Christopher  Mihos, John J. Feldmeier, Robin Ciardullo, Cameron
          McBride
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 color figures. Submitted to ApJ Letters
          Hypervelocity  stars  have  been  recently  discovered  in  the
          outskirts  of  galaxies,  such as the unbound star in the Milky
          Way  halo, or the three anomalously fast intracluster planetary
          nebulae  (ICPNe)  in  the  Virgo  Cluster.  These may have been
          ejected by close 3-body interactions with a binary supermassive
          black  hole  (SMBBH),  where  a  star  which  passes within the
          semimajor  axis of the SMBBH can receive enough energy to eject
          it  from  the  system.  Stars  ejected  by  SMBBHs  may  form a
          significant  sub-population  with very different kinematics and
          mean  metallicity  than the bulk of the intracluster stars. The
          number,  kinematics,  and  orientation of the ejected stars may
          constrain  the mass ratio, semimajor axis, and even the orbital
          plane of the SMBBH. We investigate the evolution of the ejected
          debris  from a SMBBH within a clumpy and time-dependent cluster
          potential using a high resolution, self-consistent cosmological
          N-body  simulation  of  a  galaxy  cluster.  We  show  that the
          predicted  number  and  kinematic  signature  of the fast Virgo
          ICPNe  is  consistent  with 3-body scattering by a SMBBH with a
          mass ratio $10:1$ at the center of M87.

          Title:  Elemental  Abundance  Ratios  in  Stars  of  the  Outer
          Galactic Disk. III. Cepheids
          Authors:  David  Yong, Bruce W. Carney, Luisa de Almeida, Brian
          L. Pohl (University of North Carolina)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in AJ
          We  present  metallicities,  [Fe/H],  and  elemental  abundance
          ratios,  [X/Fe],  for  a  sample  of  24  Cepheids in the outer
          Galactic   disk.   The  sample  have  Galactocentric  distances
          covering  12  <  R_GC (kpc) < 17.2 making them the most distant
          Galactic  Cepheids  upon which detailed abundance analyses have
          been   performed.  We  find  sub-solar  ratios  of  [Fe/H]  and
          overabundances   of   [alpha/Fe],  [La/Fe],  and  [Eu/Fe].  All
          abundance   ratios   exhibit  a  dispersion  that  exceeds  the
          measurement  uncertainties.  As seen in our previous studies of
          old   open  clusters  and  field  giants,  enhanced  ratios  of
          [alpha/Fe]  and  [Eu/Fe]  reveal that recent star formation has
          taken place in the outer disk.
          The   outer   disk   Cepheids   appear  to  exhibit  a  bimodal
          distribution  for  [Fe/H]  and [alpha/Fe]. Most of the Cepheids
          continue  the  trends with Galactocentric distance exhibited by
          Andrievsky's  larger Cepheid sample and we refer to these stars
          as  the  "Galactic  Cepheids".  A minority of the Cepheids show
          considerably lower [Fe/H] and higher [alpha/Fe] and we refer to
          these stars as the "Merger Cepheids". One signature of a merger
          event  would  be composition differences between the "Galactic"
          and  "Merger"  Cepheids.  The Cepheids satisfy this requirement
          and  we  speculate  that the distinct compositions suggest that
          the  "Merger  Cepheids"  may have formed under the influence of
          significant  merger or accretion events. The short lifetimes of
          the  Cepheids reveal that the merger event may be on-going with
          the Monoceros ring and Canis Major galaxy being possible merger
          candidates. [Abridged]

          The  L1551 molecular cloud contains two small clusters of Class
          0  and I protostars, as well as a halo of more evolved Class II
          and  III YSOs, indicating a current and at least one past burst
          of  star  formation. We present here new, sensitive maps of 850
          and  450 um dust emission covering most of the L1551 cloud, new
          CO  J=2-1 data of the molecular cloud, and a new, deep, optical
          image  of  [SII] emission. No new Class 0/I YSOs were detected.
          Compact   sub-millimetre   emitters  are  concentrated  in  two
          sub-clusters:  IRS5  and  L1551NE, and the HL~Tauri group. Both
          stellar   groups   show   significant   extended  emission  and
          outflow/jet  activity.  A jet, terminating at HH 265 and with a
          very weak associated molecular outflow, may originate from LkHa
          358,  or  from  a  binary companion to another member of the HL
          Tauri  group.  Several  Herbig  Haro  objects  associated  with
          IRS5/NE  were  clearly  detected  in  the sub-mm, as were faint
          ridges  of  emission tracing outflow cavity walls. We confirm a
          large-scale  molecular  outflow originating from NE parallel to
          that  from IRS5, and suggest that the "hollow shell" morphology
          is  more likely due to two interacting outflows. We confirm the

          north-west  of IRS5. The next generation cluster may be forming
          in  this  core. The L1551 cloud appears cometary in morphology,

          Title: Boundary layer emission in luminous LMXBs
          Authors: M.Gilfanov, M.Revnivtsev (MPA, IKI)
          Comments: Astronomische Nachrichten, 326, No.9, p.812 (2005)
          Journal-ref: AN, 326, No.9, p.812 (2005)
          We  show that aperiodic and quasiperiodic variability of bright
          LMXBs  -  atoll  and  Z- sources, on ~sec - msec time scales is
          caused   primarily   by   variations   of  the  boundary  layer
          luminosity.  The  accretion  disk  emission is less variable on
          these  time  scales  and  its  power  density  follows 1/f law,
          contributing  to observed flux variation at low frequencies and
          low  energies  only.  The  kHz  QPOs  have  the  same origin as
          variability at lower frequencies - independent of the nature of
          the  "clock",  the  actual luminosity modulation takes place on
          the  NS  surface.  The  boundary  layer spectrum remains nearly
          constant during luminosity variations and can be represented by
          the  Fourier  frequency  resolved  spectrum.  In  the  range of
          Mdot~(0.1-1)*Mdot_Edd  it  depends  weakly  on  the global mass
          accretion  rate and in the limit Mdot~Mdot_Edd is close to Wien
          spectrum  with  kT~2.4  keV. Its independence on the Mdot lends
          support to the suggestion by Inogamov & Sunyaev (1999) that the
          boundary layer is radiation pressure supported.
          Based  on  the  knowledge  of  the  boundary  layer spectrum we
          attempt  to  relate  the motion along the Z-track to changes of
          physically  meaningful parameters. Our results suggest that the
          contribution  of  the  boundary  layer to the observed emission
          decreases  along  the  Z-track  from  conventional  ~50% on the
          horizontal  branch  to  a  rather  small  number  on the normal
          branch.   This   decrease   can  be  caused,  for  example,  by
          obscuration   of   the  boundary  layer  by  the  geometrically
          thickened  accretion disk at Mdot~Mdot_Edd. Alternatively, this
          can  indicate  significant  change  of  the  structure  of  the
          accretion  flow  at  Mdot~Mdot_Edd  and  disappearance  of  the
          boundary  layer  as a distinct region of the significant energy
          release associated with the NS surface.

          Title:  Turbulent Origin of the Galactic-Center Magnetic Field:
          Nonthermal Radio Filaments
          Authors: Stanislav Boldyrev, Farhad Yusef-Zadeh
          Comments: 11 pages, accepted to ApJ Letters
          A great deal of study has been carried out over the last twenty
          years  on  the  origin of the magnetic activity in the Galactic
          center.  One of the most popular hypotheses assumes milli-Gauss
          magnetic  field with poloidal geometry, pervading the inner few
          hundred  parsecs  of the Galactic-center region. However, there
          is   a  growing  observational  evidence  for  the  large-scale
          distribution of a much weaker field of B \lesssim 10 micro G in
          this region. Here, we propose that the Galactic-center magnetic
          field  originates  from  turbulent activity that is known to be
          extreme  in  the  central  hundred parsecs. In this picture the
          spatial  distribution  of  the  magnetic field energy is highly
          intermittent,  and the regions of strong field have filamentary
          structures.  We  propose  that  the  observed  nonthermal radio
          filaments appear in (or, possibly, may be identified with) such
          strongly  magnetized regions. At the same time, the large-scale
          diffuse  magnetic  field is weak. Both results of our model can
          explain   the   magnetic   field   measurements   of   the  the
          Galactic-center  region.  In  addition,  we discuss the role of
          ionized  outflow  from  stellar  clusters in producing the long
          magnetized filaments perpendicular to the Galactic plane.

          Title: Stability of Self-Similar Spherical Accretion
          Authors: Jose Gaite
          Comments:  Contribution  to  Spanish  Relativity  Meeting (ERE)
          2005,  held  in  Oviedo,  AIP  Conference Proceedings, based on
          
astro-ph/0511624, 4 pages
          Spherical  accretion  flows  are  simple  enough for analytical
          study,   by   solution   of  the  corresponding  fluid  dynamic
          equations.  The  solutions of stationary spherical flow are due
          to  Bondi.  The  questions of the choice of a physical solution
          and  of  stability  have  been  widely discussed. The answer to
          these  questions  is  very dependent on the problem of boundary
          conditions,  which  vary according to whether the accretor is a
          compact  object  or  a  black  hole. We introduce a particular,
          simple  form of stationary spherical flow, namely, self-similar
          Bondi  flow, as a case with physical interest in which analytic
          solutions  for  perturbations  can  be  found. With suitable no
          matter-flux-perturbation boundary conditions, we will show that
          acoustic   modes  are  stable  in  time  and  have  no  spatial
          instability  at  r=0.  Furthermore,  their evolution eventually
          becomes  ergodic-like  and  shows no trace of instability or of
          acquiring any remarkable pattern.

          Title:  Lyman-alpha forest-CMB cross-correlation and the search
          for the ionized baryons at high redshift
          Authors:  Rupert  A.C. Croft (CMU/MPA), A.J. Banday (MPA), Lars
          Hernquist (CfA)
          Comments: 14 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          The intergalactic neutral hydrogen which is responsible for the
          Lyman  alpha  forest  of  quasar absorption is a tracer of much
          larger  amounts  of ionised hydrogen. The ionised component has
          yet  to  be  detected  directly, but is expected to scatter CMB
          photons   via   the  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich  (SZ)  effect.  We  use
          hydrodynamic simulations of a LambdaCDM universe to create mock
          quasar  spectra  and  CMB sky maps. We find that the high-z Lya
          forest  gas  causes  temperature fluctuations of the order of 1
          muK rms in the CMB on arcmin scales. The kinetic and thermal SZ
          effects  have  a  similar  magnitude  at  z=3, with the thermal
          effect  becoming relatively weaker as expected at higher z. The
          CMB  signal  associated  with  lines  of sight having HI column
          densities  >  10^18 cm^-2 is only marginally stronger than that
          for  lower  column  densities.  The  strong  dependence  of rms
          temperature  fluctuation  on  mean  Lya absorbed flux, however,
          suggests  that  the  CMB  signal  effectively  arises  in lower
          density    material.    We   investigate   the   use   of   the
          cross-correlation   of   the   Lya  forest  and  the  microwave
          background  to  detect  the  SZ  effect at redshifts 2-4. In so
          doing  we  are  able  to  set  direct  limits on the density of
          diffuse   ionised   intergalactic   baryons.  We  carry  out  a
          preliminary  comparison  at  a mean redshift z=3 of 3488 quasar
          spectra  from SDSS Data Release 3 and the WMAP first year data.
          Assuming  that  the  baryons  are  clustered  as in a LambdaCDM
          cosmology,   and   have   the   same   mean   temperature,  the
          cross-correlation  yields a weak limit on the cosmic density of
          ionised  baryons Omega_(b,I), which is Omega_(b,I) < 0.8 at 95%
          confidence.   With   data  from  upcoming  CMB  telescopes,  we
          anticipate that a direct detection of the high redshift ionised
          IGM  will  soon be possible, providing an important consistency
          check on cosmological models.

          Title:  Dynamical  flows  through  Dark  Matter  Haloes:  Inner
          perturbative dynamics, secular evolution, and applications

          We  investigate  statistically  the  dynamical  consequences of
          cosmological   fluxes   of   matter   and  related  moments  on
          progenitors  of  today's  dark matter haloes. Their dynamics is
          described  via canonical perturbation theory which accounts for
          two  types  of  perturbations: the tidal field corresponding to
          fly-bys  and  accretion of dark matter through the halo's outer
          boundary.  he dynamical equations are solved linearly, order by
          order,  projecting  on  a  biorthogonal  basis  to consistently
          satisfy the field equation. Since our solution of the Boltzmann
          Poisson   equations   is   explicit,   it   allows  statistical
          predictions   for   the  ensemble  distribution  of  the  inner
          dynamical  features  of  haloes.  The secular evolution of open
          galactic haloes is investigated: we derive the kinetic equation
          which governs the quasi-linear evolution of dark matter profile
          induced   by   infall   and   its  corresponding  gravitational
          correlations. This yields a Fokker Planck-like equation for the
          angle-averaged  underlying  distribution  function. We show how
          these  extensions  to the classical theory could be used to (i)
          observationally  constrain the statistical nature of the infall
          (ii)  predict  the  observed  distribution  and correlations of
          substructures  in  upcoming  surveys,  (iii)  predict  the past
          evolution  of  the observed distribution of clumps, and finally
          (iv)  weight  the relative importance of the intrinsic (via the
          unperturbed  distribution function) and external (tidal and/ or
          infall) influence of the environment in determining the fate of
          galaxies.

          ApJ
          We  present  new  optical  observations  of  young massive star
          clusters in Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy,
          taken  in  UBVI with the Hubble Space Telescope ACS/HRC camera.
          We  find  a  total  of  206  probable  clusters  whose  spatial
          distribution  is  centrally  concentrated toward the nucleus of
          Arp  220.  We  use model star cluster tracks to determine ages,
          luminosities,  and  masses  for  14 clusters with complete UBVI
          indices or previously published near-infrared data. We estimate
          rough  masses  for  24 additional clusters with I < 24 mag from
          BVI  indices alone. The clusters with useful ages fall into two
          distinct  groups:  a  ``young''  population  (<  10 Myr) and an
          intermediate-age population (~300 Myr). There are many clusters
          with  masses  clearly  above  10^6 Msun and possibly even above
          10^7  Msun in the most extreme instances. These masses are high
          enough  that the clusters being formed in the Arp 220 starburst
          can  be  considered  as  genuine  young  globular  clusters. In
          addition,   this   study  allows  us  to  extend  the  observed
          correlation  between  global  star  formation  rate and maximum
          cluster  luminosity  by more than an order of magnitude in star
          formation rate.

          publication in ApJ
          Multi-wavelength observations of Galactic black hole transients
          during outburst decay are instrumental for our understanding of
          the  accretion  geometry  and  the formation of outflows around
          black  hole systems. H1743-322, a black hole transient observed
          intensely  in  X-rays and also covered in the radio band during
          its  2003  decay, provides clues about the changes in accretion
          geometry   during   state  transitions  and  also  the  general
          properties  of  X-ray  emission during the intermediate and the
          low-hard  states.  In  this work, we report on the evolution of
          spectral  and temporal properties in X-rays and the flux in the
          radio  band  with the goal of understanding the nature of state
          transitions  observed  in  this  source.  We concentrate on the
          transition  from the thermal dominant state to the intermediate
          state  that  occurs on a timescale of one day. We show that the
          state  transition  is  associated  with  a  sudden  increase in
          power-law  flux.  We  determine that the ratio of the power-law
          flux  to the overall flux in the 3--25 keV band must exceed 0.6
          to   observe   strong   timing  noise.  Even  after  the  state
          transition, once this ratio was below 0.6, the system transited
          back  to the thermal dominant state for a day. We show that the
          emission  from  the  compact radio core does not turn on during
          the   transition   from  the  thermal  dominant  state  to  the
          intermediate state but does turn on when the source reaches the
          low-hard  state,  as  seen  in 4U 1543-47 and GX 339-4. We find
          that   the  photon  index  correlates  strongly  with  the  QPO
          frequency   and  anti-correlates  with  the  rms  amplitude  of
          variability.  We  also show that the variability is more likely
          to  be  associated  with  the  power-law emission than the disk
          emission.

          The  ``central  engine''  of  AGN  is  thought to be powered by
          accretion  on  a central nucleus believed to be a super-massive
          black  hole. The localization and exact mechanism of the energy
          release  in  AGN  are  still  not  well  understood. We present
          observational  evidence for the link between variability of the
          radio  emission  of the compact jet, optical and X-ray continua
          emission  and  ejections  of  new  jet  components in the radio
          galaxy  3C  390.3.  The time delays between the light curves of
          the  individual  jet  components  and  the  light  curve of the
          optical  continuum  are estimated by using minimization methods
          and   the  discret  correlation  function.  We  find  that  the
          variations  of  the optical continuum are correlated with radio
          emission from a stationary feature in the jet. This correlation
          indicates  that  the  source  of variable non-thermal continuum
          radiation  is located in the innermost part of the relativistic
          jet.  We  suggest  that the continuum emission from the jet and
          counterjet   ionizes  material  in  a  subrelativistic  outflow
          surrounding  the  jet,  which  results  in  a  formation of two
          conical  regions  with broad emission lines (in addition to the
          conventional broad line region around the central nucleus) at a
          distance  more or equal to 0.4 parsecs from the central engine.
          Implications   for  modeling  of  the  broad-line  regions  are
          discussed.

          Title:  Investigating  a  Fluctuating-accretion  Model  for the
          Spectral-timing Properties of Accreting Black Hole Systems
          Authors: P. Arevalo, P. Uttley
          Comments: 15 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          The  fluctuating  accretion  model of Lyubarskii (1997) and its
          extension  by  Kotov  et  al.  (2001),  seeks  to  explain  the
          spectral-timing   properties   of   the  X-ray  variability  of
          accreting  black  holes  in  terms  of  inward-propagating mass
          accretion  fluctuations produced at a broad range of radii. The
          fluctuations  modulate  the  X-ray emitting region as they move
          inwards   and  can  produce  temporal-frequency-dependent  lags
          between  energy  bands,  and  energy-dependent  power  spectral
          densities  (PSDs)  as  a  result  of  the  different emissivity
          profiles,  which  may  be expected at different X-ray energies.
          Here we use a simple numerical implementation to investigate in
          detail  the  X-ray  spectral-timing properties of the model and
          their  relation  to  several physically interesting parameters,
          namely  the  emissivity  profile in different energy bands, the
          geometrical  thickness and viscosity parameter of the accretion
          flow,  the  strength  of  damping  on  the fluctuations and the
          temporal coherence (measured by the `quality-factor', Q) of the
          fluctuations   introduced  at  each  radius.  We  find  that  a
          geometrically  thick  flow  with  large  viscosity parameter is
          favoured,  and confirm that the predicted lags are quite robust
          to  changes  in the emissivity profile, and physical parameters
          of the accretion flow, which may help to explain the similarity
          of  the lag spectra in the low/hard and high/soft states of Cyg
          X-1.  We  also  demonstrate  the  model  regime where the light
          curves   in   different  energy  bands  are  highly  spectrally
          coherent.  We  compare model predictions directly to X-ray data
          from  the  Narrow  Line Seyfert~1 galaxy NGC 4051 and the BHXRB
          Cyg  X-1  in  its  high/soft  state  and show that this general
          scheme   can   reproduce   simultaneously  the  time  lags  and
          energy-dependence of the PSD.

          We  report  on the discovery of a z = 3.16 Lyman-alpha emitting
          blob  in  the  GOODS South field. The blob has a total Ly-alpha
          luminosity  of  ~ 10^(43) erg s^(-1) and a diameter larger than
          60  kpc. The available multi-wavelength data in the GOODS field
          consists   of  13  bands  from  X-rays  (Chandra)  to  infrared
          (Spitzer).  Unlike  other  discovered Ly-alpha blobs, this blob
          shows   no   obvious  continuum  counter-part  in  any  of  the
          broad-bands.  In particular, no optical counter-parts are found
          in the deep HST/ACS imaging available. For previously published
          blobs,  AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) or 'superwind' models have
          been  found  to  provide  the best match with the data. We here
          argue  that  the  most probable origin of the extended Ly-alpha
          emission  from  the  blob  in  the  GOODS  South  field is cold
          accretion onto a dark matter halo.

          In  our  continuing  optical spectroscopic campaign to identify
          the  longer-wavelength  counterparts  of  newly-discovered hard
          X-ray  sources  detected  by INTEGRAL, we observed the putative
          optical  counterparts  of  seven  southern sources at the South
          African  Astronomical  Observatory and at the European Southern
          Observatory.  For  two of these objects, optical photometry was
          also acquired. These observations firmly established the nature
          of  four  of them: we found that IGR J10404-4625 (=LEDA 93974),
          4U  1344-60  and  IGR  J16482-3036  are  Active Galactic Nuclei
          (AGNs) at redshifts z = 0.0237, 0.013 and 0.0313, respectively,
          and  that  2RXP  J130159.6-635806 is a Galactic High-Mass X-ray
          Binary  (HMXB).  We  also give possible optical identifications
          for   three   further  objects,  namely  IGR  J11215-5952,  IGR
          J11305-6256  and  IGR  J16207-5129,  which  are consistent with
          being Galactic HMXBs. Physical parameters for these objects are
          also  evaluated  by  collecting  and  discussing  the available
          multiwavelength  information. The detection of four definite or
          likely  HMXBs  out  of  seven  objects  in  our  sample further
          stresses  INTEGRAL's crucial contribution in hunting this class
          of  object. Also, the determination of the extragalactic nature
          of  a  substantial  fraction  of  the  INTEGRAL  survey sources
          underlines  the  importance  of hard X-ray observations for the
          study of background AGNs located beyond the `Zone of Avoidance'
          of the Galactic Plane.

          Title: Two-dimensional models of layered protoplanetary discs -
          II. The effect of a residual viscosity in the dead zone
          Authors: R. Wunsch, A. Gawryszczak, H. Klahr, M. Rozyczka
          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  study  axisymmetric  models of layered protoplanetary discs
          taking  radiative  transfer  effects into account, and allowing
          for  a residual viscosity in the dead zone. We also explore the
          effect of different viscosity prescriptions. In addition to the
          ring  instability  reported in the first paper of the series we
          find  an  oscillatory instability of the dead zone, accompanied
          by  variations  of the accretion rate onto the central star. We
          provide  a  simplified  analytical  description  explaining the
          mechanism  of  the  oscillations.  Finally,  we  find  that the
          residual   viscosity  enables  stationary  accretion  in  large
          regions  of  layered  discs. Based on results obtained with the
          help  of  a simple 1-D hydrocode we identify these regions, and
          discuss  conditions  in  which  layered  discs can give rise to
          FU~Orionis phenomena.

          Title: The PAH Emission Deficit In Low-Metallicity Galaxies - A
          Spitzer View
          Authors: B. O'Halloran, S. Satyapal, R. P. Dudik
          Comments: 19 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          Archival observations of 18 starburst galaxies that span a wide
          range  in  metallicity  reveal for the first time a correlation
          between  the  ratio  of  emission  line  fluxes of [FeII] at 26
          microns  and  [NeII]  at  12.8  microns  and the 7.7 micron PAH
          strength,  with  the  [FeII]/[NeII]  flux ratio decreasing with
          increasing  PAH  strength.  We  also  find a strong correlation
          between  the  [FeII]/[NeII]  flux  ratio  and  the  host galaxy
          metallicity,  with  the  flux  ratio decreasing with increasing
          metallicity.
          Since  [FeII]  emission  has been linked primarily to supernova
          shocks,   we   attribute   the  high  [FeII]/[NeII]  ratios  in
          low-metallicity  galaxies  to  enhanced  supernova activity. We
          consider  this  to be a dominant mechanism for PAH destruction,
          rather   than   grain   destruction   in  photoionized  regions
          surrounding  young  massive stars. We also consider whether the
          extreme  youth  of  the low-metallicity galaxies is responsible
          for the lack of PAH emission.

          Comments: 40 pages, ApJ, in press
          We  present  the  results  of  time-resolved spectroscopy of 13
          O-type stars in the Cas OB6 stellar association. We conducted a
          survey  for  radial  velocity  variability  in search of binary
          systems,  which  are  expected  to  be  plentiful  in  young OB
          associations.   Here   we  report  the  discovery  of  two  new
          single-lined  binaries, and we present new orbital elements for
          three double-lined binaries (including one in the multiple star
          system  HD  17505).  One  of  the  double-lined  systems is the
          eclipsing  binary  system  DN Cas, and we present a preliminary
          light  curve  analysis  that  yields  the  system  inclination,
          masses,  and  radii. We compare the spectra of the single stars
          and  the  individual  components of the binary stars with model
          synthetic   spectra   to   estimate   the   stellar   effective
          temperatures,  gravities,  and projected rotational velocities.
          We  also  make  fits  of  the  spectral energy distributions to
          derive  E(B-V),  R=A_V/E(B-V), and angular diameter. A distance
          of  1.9  kpc yields radii that are consistent with evolutionary
          models.  We  find  that 7 of 14 systems with spectroscopic data
          are   probable   binaries,  consistent  with  the  high  binary
          frequency  found  for  other  massive  stars  in  clusters  and
          associations.

          Title:  Inner-shell  Absorption  Lines  of  Fe~VI--  Fe~XVI:  A
          Many-body Perturbation Theory Approach
          Authors:  Ming F. Gu (Stanford), Tomer Holczer (Technion), Ehud
          Behar (Technion), Steven M. Kahn (Stanford)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          We   provide   improved   atomic  calculation  of  wavelengths,
          oscillator  strengths, and autoionization rates relevant to the
          $2\to  3$  inner-shell transitions of Fe~VI--XVI, the so-called
          Fe~M-shell  unresolved  transition  array (UTA). A second order
          many-body  perturbation  theory  is employed to obtain accurate
          transition  wavelengths,  which  are systematically larger than
          previous  theoretical  results  by  15--45~m{\AA}.  For  a  few
          transitions  of  Fe~XVI and Fe~XV where laboratory measurements
          exist, our new wavelengths are accurate to within a few m{\AA}.
          Using  these  new calculations, the apparent discrepancy in the
          velocities  between the Fe~M-shell UTA and other highly ionized
          absorption  lines  in  the  outflow of NGC 3783 disappears. The
          oscillator strengths in our new calculation agree well with the
          previous  theoretical  data, while the new autoionization rates
          are  significantly  larger, especially for lower charge states.
          We  attribute  this  discrepancy  to the missing autoionization
          channels   in   the   previous   calculation.   The   increased
          autoionization  rates  may  slightly  affect the column density
          analysis  of  the  Fe~M-shell  UTA for sources with high column
          density  and very low turbulent broadening. The complete set of
          atomic data is provided as an electronic table.

          Title: Accretion disc onto boson stars: a way to supplant black
          holes candidates
          Authors: F. Siddhartha Guzman
          Comments:  5  pages,  7  figures.  Accepted  for publication in
          Physical Review D
          The emission spectrum from a simple accretion disc model around
          a compact object is compared for the cases of a black hole (BH)
          and  a  boson star (BS) playing the role of the central object.
          It  was  found  in  the  past  that  such  spectrum  presents a
          hardening  at  high frequencies, however, here it is shown that
          the  self-interaction and compactness of the BS have the effect
          of  softening  the  spectrum,  the less compact the star is the
          softer  the  emission spectrum at high frequencies. Because the
          mass  of  the  boson  fixes  the  mass  of  the  star  and  the
          self-interaction  the  compactness of the star we find that for
          certain  values of the BSs parameters it is possible to produce
          similar spectra to those generated when the central object is a
          BH.  This  result presents two important implications: i) using
          this  simple accretion model a BS can supplant a BH in the role
          of   compact   object  accreting  matter  and  ii)  within  the
          assumptions  of the present accretion disc model we do not find
          a  prediction  that could help at distinguishing a BH from a BS
          with appropriate parameters of mass and self-interaction.

          Title: Effects of Gravitational Lensing and Companion Motion on
          the Binary Pulsar Timing
          Authors: Roman R. Rafikov (CITA), Dong Lai (Cornell)
          Comments: 10 pages, 1 figure, submitted to Phys. Rev. D
          The  measurement  of  the  Shapiro  time delay in binary pulsar
          systems  with highly inclined orbit can be affected both by the
          motion  of the pulsar's companion because of the finite time it
          takes  a  photon  to cross the binary, and by the gravitational
          light  bending if the orbit is sufficiently edge-on relative to
          the  line of sight. Here we calculate the effect of retardation
          due  to the companion's motion on various time delays in pulsar
          binaries,  including  the  Shaipro delay, the geometric lensing
          delay,  and  the lens-induced delays associated with the pulsar
          rotation.  Our  results  can  be  applied  to systems so highly
          inclined  that  near  conjunction  gravitational lensing of the
          pulsar  radiation  by  the  companion  becomes  important  (the
          recently   discovered   double  pulsar  system  J0737-3039  may
          exemplify  such  a system). To the leading order, the effect of
          retardation  is  to shift all the delay curves backward in time
          around  the  orbit conjunction, without affecting the shape and
          amplitude  of the curves. The time shift is of order the photon
          orbit  crossing time, and ranges from a second to a few minutes
          for  the  observed  binary pulsar systems. In the double pulsar
          system  J0737-3039, the motion of the companion may also affect
          the   interpretation  of  the  recent  correlated  interstellar
          scintillation  measurements. Finally, we show that lensing sets
          an  upper  limit  on  the  magnitude of the frame-dragging time
          delay  caused  by  the  companion's  spin, and makes this delay
          unobservable in stellar-mass binary pulsar systems.

          We  examine  the black hole mass - galaxy bulge relationship in
          high-redshift  QSOs.  Black  hole  masses  are derived from the
          broad  emission  lines,  and  the  host galaxy stellar velocity
          dispersion  sigma  is estimated from the widths of the radio CO
          emission  lines.  At  redshifts  z  > 3, the CO line widths are
          narrower than expected for the black hole mass, indicating that
          these giant black holes reside in undersized bulges by an order
          of magnitude or more. The largest black holes (above 10^9 solar
          masses)  evidently  grow  rapidly in the early universe without
          commensurate  growth  of  their  host  galaxies. CO line widths
          offer a unique opportunity to study AGN host galaxy dynamics at
          high redshift.

          demonstrate  that,  even  for  a  broad and asymmetric spectral
          line,  the  stellar  radius-to-mass  ratio  can  be inferred to
          better than 5%. We also fit our theoretical models to the burst
          oscillation  data  of  the low mass X-ray binary XTE J1814-338,
          and  find  that  the  90% confidence lower limit of the neutron

          is located at this http URL
          Conservative   numerical   schemes   for  general  relativistic
          magnetohydrodynamics  (GRMHD) require a method for transforming
          between  ``conserved''  variables  such  as momentum and energy
          density  and ``primitive'' variables such as rest-mass density,
          internal  energy,  and  components  of  the  four-velocity. The
          forward   transformation   (primitive   to   conserved)  has  a
          closed-form solution, but the inverse transformation (conserved
          to  primitive) requires the solution of a set of five nonlinear
          equations.  Here  we discuss the mathematical properties of the
          inverse  transformation  and  present six numerical methods for
          performing  the inversion. The first method solves the full set
          of  five  nonlinear  equations  directly using a Newton-Raphson
          scheme  and  a  guess  from  the  previous  timestep. The other
          methods  reduce  the  five nonlinear equations to either one or
          two   nonlinear   equations   that   are   solved  numerically.
          Comparisons  between  the  methods are made using a survey over
          phase space, a two-dimensional explosion problem, and a general
          relativistic MHD accretion disk simulation. The run-time of the
          methods  is  also  examined.  Code  implementing the schemes is
          available for download on the web.

          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, to appear in MNRAS
          Corrections  to  the magnitudes of high redshift objects due to
          intergalactic  attenuation are computed using current estimates
          of  the  properties of the intergalactic medium. The results of
          numerical simulations are used to estimate the contributions to
          resonant  scattering  from  the higher order Lyman transitions.
          Differences  of  0.5-1  magnitude from the previous estimate of
          Madau  (1995)  are  found.  Intergalactic k_IGM-corrections and
          colours  are  provided for high redshift starburst galaxies and
          Type  I  and  Type  II  QSOs for several filter systems used in

          Title: The formation of brown dwarfs
          Authors: A. P. Whitworth (Cardiff), S. P. Goodwin (Sheffield)
          Comments:  7  pages, 1 figure. To appear in Astron.Nachrichten.
          Includes an.cls file
          We  review  four  mechanisms  for  forming  brown  dwarfs:  (i)
          turbulent  fragmentation  (producing  very  low-mass prestellar
          cores);   (ii)  gravitational  instabilities  in  discs;  (iii)
          dynamical  ejection  of  stellar  embryos  from their placental
          cores;  and  (iv)  photo-erosion  of  pre-existing cores in HII
          regions.  We  argue (a) that these are simply the mechanisms of
          low-mass  star  formation,  and  (b) that they are not mutually
          exclusive.  If,  as seems possible, all four mechanisms operate
          in   nature,   their  relative  importance  may  eventually  be
          constrained by their ability to reproduce the binary statistics

          Title:  The possible detection of high redshift Type II QSOs in
          deep fields
          Authors: Avery Meiksin (SUPA; IfA University of Edinburgh)
          Comments: 11 pages, 10 figures; to be published in MNRAS
          The  colours of high redshift Type II QSOs are synthesized from
          observations  of  moderate  redshift  systems. It is shown that
          Type  II  QSOs are comparable to starbursts in their success at
          matching  the  colours of z_850-dropouts and i_775-drops in the
          Hubble  Ultra  Deep  Field,  and more naturally account for the
          bluest objects detected. Type II QSOs may also account for some
          of  the  i_775-drops  detected in the GOODS fields. It is shown
          that  by combining imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope
          and  the  James  Webb  Space  Telescope, it will be possible to
          clearly  separate  Type II QSOs from Type I QSOs and starbursts
          based  on their colours. Similarly, it is shown that the UKIDSS
          ZYJ  filters  may be used to discriminate high redshift Type II
          QSOs  from other objects. If Type II QSOs are prevalent at high
          redshifts,   then   AGN   may  be  major  contributors  to  the
          re-ionization of the Intergalactic Medium.

          Cosmic Rays: A Quantitative Analysis

          Scattering  processes  in the cosmic microwave background limit
          the  propagation  of ultra high energy charged particles in our
          Universe.  For  extragalactic proton sources resonant photopion
          production  results in the famous Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK)
          cutoff  at  about 4x10^10 GeV expected in the spectrum observed
          on  Earth.  The  faint flux of ultra high energy cosmic rays of
          less  than one event per year and cubic kilometer and the large
          systematic  uncertainties  in  the energy calibration of cosmic
          ray  showers is a challenge for cosmic ray observatories and so
          far  the  GZK  cutoff  has not been unambiguously confirmed. We
          have   investigated  the  possibility  that  the  primaries  of
          super-GZK  events  are strongly interacting neutrinos which are
          not  subject  to  the  GZK  cutoff. For the flux of protons and
          neutrinos  from  extragalactic  optically  thin  sources  and a
          flexible parameterization of the neutrino-nucleon cross section
          we  have  analyzed the cosmic ray spectra observed at AGASA and
          HiRes  taking  also into account results from horizontal events
          at  AGASA  and contained events at RICE. We find that scenarios
          of strongly interacting neutrinos are still compatible with the
          data    requiring   a   steep   increase   of   the   inelastic
          neutrino-nucleon  cross  section  by  four  order  of magnitude
          within  one  energy  decade  compared  to  the  Standard  Model
          predictions.  We  also  discuss  the  impact of the preliminary
          cosmic ray spectrum observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory.

          Title:   Origin   of   [OII]   Emission  in  Red  Sequence  and
          Post-starburst Galaxies
          Authors:  Renbin  Yan,  Jeffrey A. Newman, S.M. Faber, Nicholas
          Konidaris, David Koo, Marc Davis
          Comments: 16 pages, 11 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  investigate  the  emission-line properties of galaxies with
          red  rest-frame  colors  using  spectra from SDSS DR2. Emission
          lines  are  detected  in more than half of the red galaxies. We
          focus  on  the relationship between two emission lines commonly
          used as star formation rate indicators: Ha 6563 and [OII] 3727.
          There is a strong bimodality in [OII]/Ha ratio in the full SDSS
          sample   which   closely   corresponds  to  the  bimodality  in
          rest-frame  color. Nearly all of the line-emitting red galaxies
          have  line  ratios  typical  of  various  types  of AGN -- most
          commonly  LINERs,  a  small fraction of transition objects and,
          more  rarely,  Seyferts.  The  [OII]-Ha  EW diagram reveals the
          continuity   between  quiescent  galaxies  with  no  detectable
          emission  and  galaxies  with  LINER-like  line  ratios,  which
          altogether  form a LINER/Quiescent sequence. A straight line in
          the   [OII]-Ha   EW  plane  divides  these  galaxies  from  the
          remainder.  [OII]  equivalent  widths  in  LINER-  and AGN-like
          galaxies  can  be  as  large as in star-forming galaxies. Thus,
          unless  objects  with  AGN/LINER-like line ratios are excluded,
          [OII]  emission  cannot  be  used  directly as a proxy for star
          formation  rate.  Lack  of  [OII] emission is generally used to
          indicate  lack  of  star formation when post-starburst galaxies
          are selected at high redshift. Our results imply, however, that
          these  samples  have been cut on AGN properties as well as star
          formation,  and therefore may provide seriously incomplete sets
          of   post-starburst   galaxies.   Furthermore,   post-starburst
          galaxies  identifed  in SDSS by requiring minimal Ha equivalent
          width  generally  exhibit  weak  but nonzero line emission with
          ratios  typical  of  AGNs;  few  of  them  show  residual  star
          formation.  This  suggests  that  most  post-starbursts  harbor
          AGNs/LINERs.

          Title: The Supercritical Pile Model for GRBs
          Authors: A. Mastichiadis, D. Kazanas
          Comments: 39 pages, 12 eps figures, accepted for publication in
          the Astrophysical Journal
          We  present  the  spectral  and  temporal  radiative signatures
          expected  within  the  "Supercritical  Pile" model of Gamma Ray
          Bursts (GRB). This model is motivated by the need for a process
          that  provides  the dissipation necessary in GRB and presents a
          well  defined  scheme  for  converting the energy stored in the
          relativistic  protons  of  the  Relativistic  Blast Waves (RBW)
          associated  with  GRB into radiation; at the same time it leads
          to  spectra  which  exhibit  a  peak in the burst $\nu F_{\nu}$
          distribution  at an energy $E_p \simeq 1$ MeV in the observer's
          frame, in agreement with observation and largely independent of
          the  Lorentz  factor  $\Gamma$  of  the associated relativistic
          outflow. Futhermore, this scheme does not require (but does not
          preclude)  acceleration  of  particles  at the shock other than
          that  provided  by  the isotropization of the flow bulk kinetic
          energy  on  the  RBW  frame.  In  the present paper we model in
          detail  the  evolution of protons, electrons and photons from a
          RBW  to  produce  detailed spectra of the prompt GRB phase as a
          function  of  time  from  across  a  very  broad range spanning
          roughly  $4  log_{10}  \Gamma$  decades in frequency. The model
          spectra  are in general agreement with observations and provide
          a  means  for  the  delineating of the model parameters through
          direct comparison with trends observed in GRB properties.

          Title: Spectral Methods for Time-Dependent Studies of Accretion
          Flows. II. Two-Dimensional Hydrodynamic Disks with Self-Gravity
          Authors: Chi-kwan Chan, Dimitrios Psaltis, Feryal Ozel
          Comments:  13  pages,  9  figures.  To  appear in the ApJ. High
          resolution   plots   and  animations  of  the  simulations  are
          available at this http URL
          Spectral  methods  are  well  suited  for  solving hydrodynamic
          problems  in  which  the  self-gravity  of the flow needs to be
          considered. Because Poisson's equation is linear, the numerical
          solution  for  the  gravitational potential for each individual
          mode   of  the  density  can  be  pre-computed,  thus  reducing
          substantially  the  computational  cost  of the method. In this
          second paper, we describe two different approaches to computing
          the   gravitational   field  of  a  two-dimensional  flow  with
          pseudo-spectral  methods.  For  situations in which the density
          profile  is  independent  of  the  third  coordinate  (i.e., an
          infinite  cylinder),  we  use  a  standard  Poisson  solver  in
          spectral  space. On the other hand, for situations in which the
          density  profile is a delta function along the third coordinate
          (i.e.,  an  infinitesimally  thin  disk), or any other function
          known  a  priori,  we perform a direct integration of Poisson's
          equation using a Green's functions approach. We devise a number
          of  test  problems  to  verify the implementations of these two
          methods.  Finally,  we use our method to study the stability of
          polytropic,  self-gravitating  disks.  We  find  that, when the
          polytropic  index Gamma is <= 4/3, Toomre's criterion correctly
          describes  the stability of the disk. However, when Gamma > 4/3
          and  for  large  values  of  the  polytropic  constant  K,  the
          numerical  solutions  are  always  stable, even when the linear
          criterion  predicts  the  contrary. We show that, in the latter
          case,  the  minimum  wavelength of the unstable modes is larger
          than  the  extent  of  the  unstable region and hence the local
          linear analysis is inapplicable.

          Title: Discovery of Five Very Low Mass Close Binaries, Resolved
          in the Visible with Lucky Imaging
          Authors: N.M. Law, S.T. Hodgkin, C.D. Mackay (IOA, Cambridge)
          Comments: 9 pages, 11 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  survey  a sample of 32 M5-M8 stars with distance < 40pc for
          companions  with  separations between 0.1 arcsec and 1.5 arcsec
          and  with  Delta  m_i  <5.  We  find five new VLM binaries with
          separations  between  0.15  arcsec  and 1.1 arcsec, including a
          candidate brown dwarf companion. The raw binary fraction is 16%
          +8/-4%  and  the distance bias corrected fraction is 7% +7/-3%,
          for  companions  within  the  surveyed  range.  No systems with
          contrast  ratio  Delta m_i>1 were found, even though our survey
          is  sensitive  to  up  to  Delta m=5 (well into the brown dwarf
          regime).   The  distribution  of  orbital  radii  is  in  broad
          agreement  with  previous  results, with most systems at 1-5AU,
          but  one  detected binary is very wide at 46.8+/-5.0AU. We also
          serendipitously  imaged  for the first time a companion to Ross
          530,  a  metal-poor  single-lined spectroscopic binary. We used
          the  new  Lucky  Imaging  system  LuckyCam  on  the 2.5m Nordic
          Optical  Telescope to complete the 32 very low mass star i' and
          z' survey in only 5 hours of telescope time.

          Title: The Origins of the Substellar Companion to GQ Lup
          Authors: J.H. Debes, S. Sigurdsson
          Comments: 6 pages, submitted to A&A
          The recently discovered substellar companion to GQ Lup possibly
          represents a direct test of current planet formation theories.
          We  examine  the possible formation scenarios for the companion
          to  GQ  Lup  assuming  it  is  a  $\sim$2  M$_{Jup}$ object. We
          determine that GQ Lup B most likely was scattered into a large,
          eccentric  orbit  by  an interaction with another planet in the
          inner system.
          If  this  is  the case, several directly observable predictions
          can  be  made,  including  the  presence  of  a  more  massive,
          secondary  companion that could be detected through astrometry,
          radial   velocity   measurements,  or  scuplting  in  GQ  Lup's
          circumstellar  disk.  This scenario requires a highly eccentric
          orbit for the companion already detected. These predictions can
          be  tested  within the next decade or so. Additionally, we look
          at  scenarios  of  formation if the companion is a brown dwarf.
          One  possible  formation  scenario  may  involve an interaction
          between  a  brown dwarf binary and GQ Lup. We look for evidence
          of  any  brown  dwarfs  that  have been ejected from the GQ Lup
          system by searching the 2MASS all-sky survey.

          publication by The Astrophysical Journal
          INTEGRAL  and RXTE performed three simultaneous observations of
          the  nearby radio galaxy Cen A in 2003 March, 2004 January, and
          2004  February with the goals of investigating the geometry and
          emission processes via the spectral/temporal variability of the
          X-ray/low  energy  gamma  ray flux, and intercalibration of the
          INTEGRAL  instruments  with  respect  to  those  on  RXTE. When
          combined  with earlier archival RXTE results, we find the power
          law  continuum  flux  and the line-of-sight column depth varied
          independently,   and   the   iron  line  flux  was  essentially
          unchanging.  Taking  X-ray spectral measurements from satellite
          missions  since 1970 into account, we discover a variability in
          the  column  depth between 1.0x10^23 cm^-2 and 1.5x10^23 cm^-2,
          and  suggest  that variations in the edge of a warped accretion
          disk viewed nearly edge-on might be the cause.

          Title: Dark matter from encapsulated atoms
          Authors: C.D. Froggatt, H.B. Nielsen
          Comments:  11 pages, paper based on talks by CDF and HBN at the
          8th Workshop on What comes beyond the Standard Models, Bled and
          by CDF at Coslab 2005, Smolenice
          We  propose  that  dark matter consists of collections of atoms
          encapsulated  inside  pieces of an alternative vacuum, in which
          the Higgs field vacuum expectation value is appreciably smaller
          than in the usual vacuum. The alternative vacuum is supposed to
          have  the  same  energy  density  as  our  own. Apart from this
          degeneracy  of  vacuum  phases,  we  do  not  introduce any new
          physics  beyond  the  Standard Model. The dark matter balls are
          estimated  to  have a radius of order 20 cm and a mass of order
          $10^{11}$  kg.  However  they  are  very  difficult  to observe
          directly,  but inside dense stars may expand eating up the star
          and cause huge explosions (gamma ray bursts). The ratio of dark
          matter  to  ordinary  baryonic matter is estimated to be of the
          order  of the ratio of the binding energy per nucleon in helium
          to  the  difference between the binding energies per nucleon in
          heavy  nuclei and in helium. Thus we predict approximately five
          times as much dark matter as ordinary baryonic matter!

          Title: Feedback Limits Rapid Growth of Seed Black Holes at High
          Redshift
          Authors:  J.-M.  Wang (1), Y.-M. Chen (1), C. Hu (2,1) (1 IHEP,

          in The Astrophysical Journal Letters
          Seed black holes formed in the collapse of population III stars
          have been invoked to explain the presence of supermassive black
          holes at high redshift. It has been suggested that a seed black
          hole   can  grow  up  to  $10^{5\sim  6}\sunm$  through  highly
          super-Eddington  accretion  for a period of $\sim 10^{6\sim 7}$
          yr  between  redshift $z=20\sim 24$. We studied the feedback of
          radiation pressure, Compton heating and outflow during the seed
          black  hole  growth.  It  is  found that its surrounding medium
          fueled  to  the seed hole is greatly heated by Compton heating.
          For  a super-critical accretion onto a $10^3\sunm$ seed hole, a
          Compton  sphere  (with  a  temperature $\sim 10^6$K) forms in a
          timescale  of  $1.6\times  10^3$yr  so  that  the  hole is only
          supplied  by  a  rate  of  $10^{-3}$  Eddington  limit from the
          Compton sphere. Beyond the Compton sphere, the kinetic feedback
          of  the strong outflow heats the medium at large distance, this
          leads  to  a  dramatical  decrease of the outer Bondi accretion
          onto  the  black hole and avoid the accumulation of the matter.
          The  highly  super-critical accretion will be rapidly halted by
          the strong feedback. The seed black holes hardly grow up at the
          very early universe unless the strong feedback can be avoided.

          emulateapj5.sty
          (ABRIDGED)  We  present  stellar  velocity  dispersion (sigma*)
          measurements for a significant sample of 40 broad-line (Type 1)
          active  galaxies  for  use  in  testing the well-known relation
          between  black  hole  mass and stellar velocity dispersion. The
          objects are selected to contain Ca II triplet, Mgb triplet, and
          Ca  H+K stellar absorption features in their optical spectra so
          that  we  may  use  them  to  perform  extensive  tests  of the
          systematic  biases  introduced  by  both  template mismatch and
          contamination  from  the  active galactic nucleus (AGN). We use
          the Ca II triplet as a benchmark to evaluate the utility of the
          other  spectral  regions  in the presence of AGN contamination.
          Broad   Fe   II  emission,  extending  from  ~5050-5520  A,  in
          combination  with  narrow coronal emission lines, can seriously
          bias  sigma* measurements from the Mgb region, highlighting the
          need  for extreme caution in its use. However, we argue that at
          luminosities  constituting a moderate fraction of the Eddington
          limit,  when  the Fe II lines are both weak and smooth relative
          to  the  stellar  lines,  it  is  possible to derive meaningful
          measurements  with  careful selection of the fitting region. In
          particular,  to  avoid  the  contamination of coronal lines, we
          advocate  the  use of the region 5250--5820 A, which is rich in
          Fe  absorption features. We lay the groundwork for an extensive
          comparison   between   black   hole  mass  and  bulge  velocity
          dispersion  in  active  galaxies,  as  described in a companion
          paper by Greene & Ho.

          1.5  mJy.  These millimeter fluxes imply vigorous activity with
          star-formation rates (SFRs) approx. 500-1500 Msun/yr, confirmed
          also  by detections at 24 microns with the MIPS camera on board
          of  the  Spitzer  satellite.  The two detected galaxies are the
          ones  in  the  sample  with the highest SFRs estimated from the
          rest-frame  UV,  and  their  far-IR-  and UV-derived SFRs agree
          reasonably well. This is different from local ULIRGs and high-z
          submm/mm  selected  galaxies  for  which  the UV is reported to
          underestimate  SFRs  by  factors  of 10-100, but similar to the
          average  BzK-ULIRG  galaxy at z~2. The two galaxies detected at
          1.2  mm  are brighter in K than the typical NIR-counterparts of
          MAMBO   and   SCUBA  sources,  implying  also  a  significantly
          different  K-band  to  submm/mm  flux  ratio.  This  suggests a
          scenario  in  which  z~2  galaxies,  after  their rapid (sub)mm
          brightest  phase  opaque  to  optical/UV  light,  evolve into a
          longer  lasting  phase  of  K-band  bright and massive objects.
          Targeting  the  most  UV  active  BzKs  could yield substantial
          detection rates at submm/mm wavelengths.

          Title:  Development  of twist in an emerging magnetic flux tube
          by poloidal field accretion
          Authors: P. Chatterjee, A. R. Choudhuri, K. Petrovay
          Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures. A&A, in press
          Following  an  earlier  proposal  by  Choudhuri  (2003) for the
          origin of twist in the magnetic fields of solar active regions,
          we  model  the  penetration of a wrapped up background poloidal
          field  into  a  toroidal  magnetic flux tube rising through the
          solar  convective  zone.  The rise of the straight, cylindrical
          flux  tube  is  followed  by  numerically solving the induction
          equation  in  a  comoving  Lagrangian  frame, while an external
          poloidal magnetic field is assumed to be radially advected onto
          the  tube  with a speed corresponding to the rise velocity. One
          prediction  of  our model is the existence of a ring of reverse
          current  helicity  on  the  periphery of active regions. On the
          other  hand,  the  amplitude  of  the  resulting  twist depends
          sensitively    on    the   assumed   structure   (diffuse   vs.
          concentrated/intermittent)  of the active region magnetic field
          right before its emergence, and on the assumed vertical profile
          of the poloidal field. Nevertheless, in the model with the most
          plausible  choice of assumptions a mean twist comparable to the
          observations  can result rather naturally. Our results indicate
          that  the  contribution  of  this mechanism to the twist can be
          quite  significant,  and  under favourable circumstances it can
          potentially  account  for most of the current helicity observed
          in active regions.

          Title:  Gas  Giant  Protoplanets  Formed by Disk Instability in
          Binary Star Systems
          Authors: A. P. Boss
          Comments: 52 pages, 28 figures
          Journal-ref:  Astrophysical  Journal,  vol.  641, 20 April 2006
          issue
          We present a suite of three dimensional radiative gravitational
          hydrodynamics  models suggesting that binary stars may be quite
          capable  of  forming  planetary systems similar to our own. The
          new  models  with  binary companions do not employ any explicit
          artificial  viscosity,  and  also  include the third (vertical)
          dimension   in  the  hydrodynamic  calculations,  allowing  for
          transient phases of convective cooling. The calculations of the
          evolution  of initially marginally gravitationally stable disks
          show  that the presence of a binary star companion may actually
          help to trigger the formation of dense clumps that could become
          giant  planets.  We  also  show  that  in models without binary
          companions,  which  begin  their  evolution  as gravitationally
          stable  disks, the disks evolve to form dense rings, which then
          break-up  into  self-gravitating  clumps.  These  latter models
          suggest  that  the  evolution of any self-gravitating disk with
          sufficient  mass to form gas giant planets is likely to lead to
          a  period of disk instability, even in the absence of a trigger
          such as a binary star companion.

          Title: Detection of orbital and superhump periods in Nova V2574
          Ophiuchi (2004)
          Authors: Tae W. Kang, Alon Retter, Alex Liu, Mercedes Richards
          Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures, 2 .sty files, AJ accepted
          We   present  the  results  of  37  nights  of  CCD  unfiltered
          photometry of nova V2574 Oph (2004) from 2004 and 2005. We find
          two  periods  of 0.14164 d (~3.40 h) and 0.14773 d (~3.55 h) in
          the  2005  data.  The  2004  data show variability on a similar
          timescale,  but  no  coherent periodicity was found. We suggest
          that  the  longer  periodicity  is  the  orbital  period of the
          underlying binary system and that the shorter period represents
          a  negative  superhump.  The  3.40 h period is about 4% shorter
          than   the  orbital  period  and  obeys  the  relation  between
          superhump  period  deficit  and binary period. The detection of
          superhumps  in the light curve is evidence of the presence of a
          precessing  accretion  disk in this binary system shortly after
          the nova outburst. From the maximum magnitude - rate of decline
          relation,  we  estimate  the  decay  rate  t_2 = 17+/-4 d and a
          maximum absolute visual magnitude of M_Vmax = -7.7+/-1.7 mag.

          (Springer: Dordrecht)
          Extended,  soft  X-ray  emission  from the halo of a very large
          disk   galaxy  has  been  detected  out  to  r~20-40  kpc.  The
          luminosity  and surface brightness distribution is in very good
          agreement  with  predictions  by  recent,  cosmological  galaxy
          formation  models. Predictions of Ly-alpha emission, associated
          with  ``cold''  accretion of filamentary gas onto galaxies, are
          presented.  In particular these predictions are compared to the
          properties  of  a  recently  detected  Ly-alpha ``blob'', which
          shows   no   obvious   continuum  counter-part  in  any  of  12
          broad-bands,  from  X-rays  (Chandra)  to  infrared  (Spitzer).
          Finally,  the predicted evolution of the Tully-Fisher relation,
          going  from  z=0  to  1,  is  discussed  in  relation to recent
          observations.

          Combination   of  high-precision  photometry  and  spectroscopy
          allows  the  detailed  study of the upper main sequence in open
          clusters. We are carrying out a comprehensive study of a number
          of  clusters  containing  Be  stars  in  order  to evaluate the
          likelihood  that  a significant number of Be stars form through
          mass  exchange  in  a  binary. Our first results show that most
          young  open  clusters  contain blue stragglers. In spite of the
          small  number  of  clusters  so  far  analysed, some trends are
          beginning  to emerge. In younger open clusters, such as NGC 869
          and  NGC 663, there are many blue stragglers, most of which are
          not  Be stars. In older clusters, such as IC 4725, the fraction
          of  Be  stars  among  blue stragglers is very high. Two Be blue
          stragglers  are  moderately  strong  X-ray sources, one of them
          being  a  confirmed X-ray binary. Such objects must have formed
          through  binary  evolution. We discuss the contribution of mass
          transfer  in  a  close  binary  to  the  formation of both blue
          stragglers and Be stars

          The Role of Interactions
          Authors: Andrew J. Cunningham, Adam Frank, Eric G. Blackman
          Comments: 21 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  present a series of numerical studies of the interaction of
          colliding  radiative,  hydrodynamic  young stellar outflows. We
          study  the  effect  of  the  collision  impact parameter on the
          acceleration  of  ambient  material and the degree to which the
          flow is isotropized by the collision as a mechanism for driving
          turbulence  in the parent molecular cloud. Our results indicate
          that  the  high  degrees  of  compression  of outflow material,
          achieved  through  radiative  shocks  near  the  vertex  of the
          interaction, prevents the redirected outflow from spraying over
          a  large spatial region. Furthermore, the collision reduces the
          redirected  outflow's  ability  to  entrain and impart momentum
          into  the  ambient cloud. Consideration of the probabilities of
          outflow  collisions  leads  us  to conclude that individual low
          velocity  fossil  outflows  are  the principle coupling between
          outflows and the cloud.

          Relativistic  neutron-loaded  outflows  in gamma-ray bursts are
          studied  at  their  early  stages,  before  deceleration  by  a
          surrounding medium. The outflow has four components: radiation,
          electrons,  protons  and neutrons. The components interact with
          each  other  and  exchange  energy  as the outflow expands. The
          presence   of   neutrons   significantly  changes  the  outflow
          evolution.  Before  neutrons  decouple  from  protons, friction
          between the two components increases their temperatures by many
          orders  of magnitude. After the decoupling, the gradual neutron
          decay  inside  the outflow has a drag effect on the protons and
          reduces their final Lorentz factor.

          We present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of the parent
          star  of  the  transiting  extrasolar  planet  TrES-1. Based on
          high-resolution   Keck/HIRES   and  HET/HRS  spectra,  we  have
          determined  abundances relative to the Sun for 16 elements (Na,
          Mg,  Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba).
          The   resulting   average   abundance   of   $<[$$X$/H$]>$   $=
          -0.02\pm0.06$  is  in  good agreement with initial estimates of
          solar  metallicity  based  on  iron.  We  compare the elemental
          abundances  of  TrES-1  with  those of the sample of stars with
          planets,  searching  for possible chemical abundance anomalies.
          TrES-1  appears not to be chemically peculiar in any measurable
          way.  We  investigate  possible signs of selective accretion of
          refractory elements in TrES-1 and other stars with planets, and
          find no statistically significant trends of metallicity [$X$/H]
          with   condensation   temperature   $T_c$.   We  use  published
          abundances   and   kinematic  information  for  the  sample  of
          planet-hosting stars (including TrES-1) and several statistical
          indicators  to  provide  an  updated classification in terms of
          their likelihood to belong to either the thin disk or the thick
          disk  of  the  Milky  Way  Galaxy. TrES-1 is found to be a very
          likely  member  of  the  thin  disk  population.  By  comparing
          $\alpha$-element abundances of planet hosts and a large control
          sample   of   field   stars,   we  also  find  that  metal-rich
          ([Fe/H]$\gtrsim   0.0$)   stars   with  planets  appear  to  be
          systematically  underabundant in [$\alpha$/Fe] by $\approx 0.1$
          dex with respect to comparison field stars. The reason for this
          signature   is  unclear,  but  systematic  differences  in  the
          analysis procedures adopted by different groups cannot be ruled
          out.

          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Using  recent  spectroscopic  observations,  we  show  that the
          triple  system AO Vel with an eclipsing BpSi primary is in fact
          a  remarkable  quadruple  system  formed  by  two  double-lined
          spectroscopic  binaries  with components close to the ZAMS. All
          available  data  have  been reanalyzed to derive proper orbital
          parameters  for  both  binary systems and to calculate absolute
          parameters  of the eclipsing system. For the first time, direct
          determination of the radius and the mass have been obtained for
          a  BpSi  star.  The  study  of  the physical parameters of this
          unique system is especially important since it can be used as a
          test   of   evolutionary   models   for  very  young  stars  of
          intermediate mass.

          Comments: 18 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables. ApJ in press
          Two   explanations  exist  for  the  short-lived  radionuclides
          present  in  the  solar system when the CAIs first formed. They
          originated  either  from the ejecta of a supernova or by the in
          situ irradiation of nebular dust by energetic particles. With a
          half-life  of  only  53  days,  Beryllium-7  is  then  the  key
          discriminant,  since  it  can  be  made only by irradiation. We
          calculate   the  yield  of  Be-7.  Within  model  uncertainties
          associated  mainly  with  nuclear  cross  sections,  we  obtain
          agreement  with  the  experimental value. Moreover, if Be-7 and
          Be-10 have the same origin, the irradiation time must be short.
          The  x-wind model provides a natural astrophysical setting that
          gives the requisite conditions. The decoupling of the Al-26 and
          Be-10  observed  in  some  rare  CAIs  receives  a quantitative
          explanation  when  rare gradual events are considered. Finally,
          we  show  that  the presence of supernova-produced Fe-60 in the
          solar  accretion  disk  does  not  necessarily  mean that other
          short-lived radionuclides have a stellar origin.

          pulsars/soft  gamma-ray  repeaters, compact center objects, and
          dim  thermal neutron stars. Though one may conventionally think
          that  these stars are normal neutron stars, it is still an open
          issue  whether  they are actually neutron stars or quark stars,
          as no convincing work, either theoretical from first principles
          or  observational,  has  confirmed Baade-Zwicky's original idea
          that   supernovae  produce  neutron  stars.  After  introducing
          briefly  the  history  of  pulsars  and quark stars, the author
          summarizes   the  recent  achievements  in  his  pulsar  group,
          including   quark  matter  phenomenology  at  low  temperature,
          starquakes  of  solid  pulsars,  low-mass  quark stars, and the
          pulsar magnetospheric activities.

          In  this  paper,  we  present  a  first comparison of different
          Adaptive  Optics  (AO)  concepts  to  reach  a given scientific
          specification  for 3D spectroscopy on Extremely Large Telescope
          (ELT). We consider that a range of 30%-50% of Ensquarred Energy
          (EE)  in  H  band  (1.65um)  and in an aperture size from 25 to
          100mas  is  representative of the scientific requirements. From
          these  preliminary  choices, different kinds of AO concepts are
          investigated   :   Ground   Layer   Adaptive   Optics   (GLAO),
          Multi-Object  AO  (MOAO)  and Laser Guide Stars AO (LGS). Using
          Fourier  based simulations we study the performance of these AO
          systems depending on the telescope diameter.

          Title: Spherical Accretion in Nearby Weakly Active Galaxies
          Authors: M.A. Moscibrodzka
          Comments: 19 pages, 11 figures, accepted to A&A
          We  consider  the  sample of weakly active galaxies situated in
          'Local  Universe'  collected  in the paper of Pellegrini (2005)
          with   inferred   accretion   efficiencies  from  $10^{-2}$  to
          $10^{-7}$.
          We apply a model of spherically symmetrical Bondi accretion for
          given parameters ($M_{BH}$,$T_{\infty}$,$\rho_{\infty}$,) taken
          from  observation.  We  calculate  spectra  emitted  by the gas
          accreting  onto  its  central  objects using Monte Carlo method
          including   synchrotron  and  bremsstrahlung  photons  as  seed
          photons.  We  compare  our  results with observed nuclear X-ray
          luminosities  $L_{X,nuc}$  (0.3-10 keV) of the sample. Model is
          also   tested   for   different   external   medium  parameters
          ($\rho_{\infty}$   and   $T_{\infty}$)   and   different   free
          parameters  of  the model. Our model is able to explain most of
          the  observed  nuclear  luminosities  $L_X$ under an assumption
          that  half  of  the compresion energy is transfered directly to
          the electrons.

          Comments:  10  pages,  8figures.  Accepted  for  publication in
          Astronomy & Astrophysics Main Journal
          We  present  the  first time resolved medium resolution optical
          spectroscopy  of  the recently identified peculiar Intermediate
          Polar  (IP)  1RXSJ154814.5-452845, which allows us to precisely
          determine  the  binary  orbital period (Porb=9.87+/-0.03hr) and
          the  white dwarf spin period Pspin=693.01+/-0.06s). This system
          is  then the third just outside the purported 6-10hr IP orbital
          period gap and the fifth of the small group of long period IPs,
          which  has  a  relatively high degree of asynchronism. From the
          presence  of  weak  red  absorption  features,  we identify the
          secondary  star  with a spectral type K2+/-2V, which appears to
          have  evolved on the nuclear timescale. From the orbital radial
          velocities  of  emission  and  the  red absorption lines a mass
          ratio  q=0.65+/-0.12 is found. The masses of the components are
          estimated  to  be  Mwd >= 0.5Msun and Msec=0.4-0.79Msun and the
          binary  inclination  25deg  <  i  <=58deg  . A distance between
          540-840pc  is  estimated.  At  this  distance,  the presence of
          peculiar   absorption  features  surrounding  Balmer  emissions
          cannot   be   due  to  the  contribution  of  the  white  dwarf
          photosphere and their spin modulation suggests an origin in the
          magnetically  confined  accretion flow. The white dwarf is also
          not  accreting  at a particularly high rate (Mdot<5x10**16g/s),
          for   its   orbital  period.  The  spin-to-orbit  period  ratio
          Pspin/Porb=0.02  and  the  low mass accretion rate suggest that
          this  system  is far from spin equilibrium. The magnetic moment
          of  the  accreting  white  dwarf  is  found  to be < 4.1x10**32
          Gcm**3, indicating a low magnetic field system.

          Title: On the binarity of Herbig Ae/Be stars

          (Leeds),   John  Porter  (Liverpool),  Monica  Pozzo  (Imperial
          College)
          Comments: MNRAS accepted, 18 pages
          We present high resolution spectro-astrometry of a sample of 28
          Herbig   Ae/Be  and  3  F-type  pre-main  sequence  stars.  The
          spectro-astrometry  is  shown from both empirical and simulated
          data  to  be  capable  of  detecting binary companions that are
          fainter  by  up  to 6 magnitudes at separations larger than 0.1
          arcsec.  The  nine  targets  that were previously known to be a
          binary  are  all detected. In addition, we report the discovery
          of  6 new binaries and present 5 further possible binaries. The
          resulting  binary  fraction  of 68+/-11 per cent is the largest
          reported  for  any  observed  sample  of  Herbig  Ae/Be  stars,
          presumably    because   of   the   exquisite   sensitivity   of
          spectro-astrometry  for detecting binary systems. The data hint
          that the binary frequency of the Herbig Be stars is larger than
          for   the   Herbig   Ae  stars.  The  appendix  presents  model
          simulations  to  assess  the capabilities of spectro-astrometry
          and  reinforces  the  empirical findings. Two objects, HD 87643
          and  Z  CMa, display evidence for asymmetric outflows. Finally,
          the  position  angles  of the binary systems have been compared
          with available orientations of the circumprimary disc and these
          appear to be co-planar. The alignment between the circumprimary
          discs  and  the  binary  systems  strongly  suggests  that  the
          formation  of  binaries with intermediate mass primaries is due
          to  fragmentation as the alternative, stellar capture, does not
          naturally  predict  aligned  discs. The aligment extends to the
          most  massive  B-type  stars  in  our  sample. This leads us to
          conclude  that  formation  mechanisms that do result in massive
          stars,  but  predict  random angles beween the binaries and the
          circumprimary disks, such as stellar collisions, are also ruled
          out for the same reason.

          We  present  3-5  micron spectroscopy of the interacting system
          NGC  6240,  showing the presence of two active galactic nuclei.
          The brightest (southern) nucleus shows up with a starburst-like
          emission,   with  a  prominent  3.3  micron  emission  feature.
          However, the presence of an AGN is revealed by the detection of
          a  broad  Br  alpha emission line, with a width of ~1,800 km/s.
          The  spectrum  of the faintest (northern) nucleus shows typical
          AGN  features,  such  as a steep continuum and broad absorption
          features  in  the M-band. We discuss the physical properties of
          the  dusty absorbers/emitters, and show that in both nuclei the
          AGN is dominant in the 3-5 micron band, but its contribution to
          the  total  luminosity is small (a few percent of the starburst
          emission).

          We  performed  a  spectroscopic  search  for binaries among hot
          Horizontal  Branch stars in globular clusters. We present final
          results  for  a  sample of 51 stars in NGC6752, and preliminary
          results  for  the  first 15 stars analyzed in M80. The observed
          stars  are  distributed  along  all the HBs in the range 8000 <
          Teff  <  32000  K,  and  have been observed during four nights.
          Radial   velocity   variations  have  been  measured  with  the
          cross-correlation   technique.   We   carefully   analyzed  the
          statistical   and   systematic   errors   associated  with  the
          measurements  in order to evaluate the statistical significance
          of  the  observed  variations.  No close binary system has been
          detected,  neither  among  cooler stars nor among the sample of
          hot  EHB  stars  (18 stars with Teff > 22000 K in NGC6752). The
          data  corrected  for  instrumental  effects  indicate  that the
          radial velocity variations are always below the 3sigma level of
          ~15  km/s. These results are in sharp contrast with those found
          for  field  hot  subdwarfs,  and  open  new questions about the
          formation  of  EHB  stars in globular clusters, and possibly of
          the field subdwarfs.

          Comments:  10  pages  and  6 figures formatted with emulateapj,
          accepted for publication in ApJ
          We   present   a  model  for  the  accretion  flow  around  the
          supermassive  black hole in the LINER nucleus of NGC 1097 which
          fits  the  optical to X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED).
          The  X-ray segment of the SED is based on observations with the
          Chandra  X-Ray  Observatory,  which  are  reported here for the
          first  time.  The  inner  part  of  the  flow  is  modeled as a
          radiatively  inefficient  accretion  flow  (RIAF) and the outer
          part  as  a  standard  thin  disk.  The value of the transition
          radius  (~225  Schwarzschild  radii) between the RIAF and outer
          thin  disk  was  obtained  from  our  previous  fitting  of the
          double-peaked Balmer emission line profile, which originates in
          the   thin   disk.  The  black  hole  mass  was  inferred  from
          measurements  of  the  stellar  velocity dispersion in the host
          galaxy.  When  these  parameters are used in the accretion flow
          model, the SED can be successfully reproduced, which shows that
          the  line  profile  model  and  the  accretion  flow  model are
          consistent  with  each  other.  A small remaining excess in the
          near-UV  is  accounted  by  the  contribution  of  an  obscured
          starburst  located within 9 pc from the nucleus, as we reported
          in  an  earlier  paper.  The  radio  flux  is  consistent  with
          synchrotron  emission of a relativistic jet modeled by means of
          the internal shock scenario. In an appendix we also analyze the
          Chandra   X-ray   observations  of  the  ~1  kpc  circumnuclear
          star-forming  ring and of an ultraluminous compact X-ray source
          located outside the ring.

          Title: On the Robustness of Cool Disc Components in Bright ULXs
          Authors:  J.  M. Miller (1), A. C. Fabian (2), M. C. Miller (3)
          ((1)  University  of Michigan, (2) University of Cambridge, (3)

          Comments: 5 pages, 1 color figure, uses mn2e.cls
          In  this  letter, we comment on the robustness of putative cool
          (kT  ~  0.2 keV) accretion disc components in the X-ray spectra
          of  the  most  luminous  (L ~ 10^40 erg/s) ultra-luminous X-ray
          sources  (ULXs)  in  nearby  normal  galaxies. When compared to
          stellar-mass black holes, the low disc temperatures observed in
          some  ULXs  may  imply  intermediate-mass black hole primaries.
          Recent work has claimed that such soft excesses are unlikely to
          be  actual disc components, based on the lack of variability in
          these  components,  and  in the overall source flux. Other work
          has  proposed  that  alternative  phenomenological  models, and
          complex Comptonisation models, rule-out cool disc components in
          ULX  spectra.  An  inspection  of  the  literature  on Galactic
          stellar-mass black holes and black hole candidates demonstrates
          that  the  flux behaviours seen in specific ULXs are consistent
          with  phenomena observed in well-known Galactic X-ray binaries.
          Applying Comptonisation models to simulated disc blackbody plus
          power-law  spectra  shows  that  at the sensitivity achieved in
          even  the  best  ULX  spectra,  Comptonisation  fits are highly
          model-dependent, and do not yield meaningful constraints on the
          accretion  flow.  In  contrast,  the  need  for a soft, thermal
          component  does  not  appear  to be model-dependent. As we have
          previously  noted,  soft  thermal components in ULX spectra may
          not represent accretion discs, but present alternatives to this
          interpretation are not robust.

          A  growing number of early Be stars discovered in X-ray surveys
          exhibit X-ray luminosities intermediate between those of normal
          stars  and those of most Be/X-ray binaries in quiescence. Their
          X-ray  spectra  are also much harder than those of shocked wind
          OB stars and can be best fitted by a thin thermal plasma with T
          ~ 10^8 K, added to a cooler and much fainter thermal component.
          An  iron  line  complex  including  a fluorescence component is
          detected  in  many  cases.  There  is  no evidence for coherent
          pulsations  in  any  of these systems but strong variability on
          time  scales  as  short  as  100  s  is usually observed. Large
          oscillations  with  quasi-periods  of  the order of one hour or
          more are detected in the X-ray light curves of several sources,
          but  have  so  far failed to prove to be strictly periodic. The
          optical  and  X-ray  properties of these new objects strikingly
          resemble  those  of  the  so  far  unique and enigmatic Be star
          Gamma-Cas  and define a new class of X-ray emitters. We discuss
          the  possible  origin of the X-ray emission in the light of the
          models  proposed  for Gamma-Cas, magnetic disc-star interaction
          or accretion onto a compact companion object -- neutron star or
          white dwarf.

          Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ
          We  have  calculated  the  evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries
          that  leads  to  the formation of the binary radio pulsars like
          PSR  J1713+0747.  We show that the mass transfer is most likely
          to  be  nonconservative,  due  to  unstable  disk accretion, to
          account  for  the mass of PSR J1713+0747, which is close to its
          initial  value.  We  assume that part of the lost material from
          the  binary  may form a circumbinary disk, and find that it can
          significantly influence the mass transfer processes. We briefly
          discuss  the  implications  of  the  circumbinary  disks on the
          evolution  of  low-mass  X-ray  binaries  and  the formation of
          low-mass binary pulsars.

          Title: Two-phase X-ray burst from GX 3+1 observed by INTEGRAL

          Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics
          We  present an analysis of an anomalously long X-ray burst from
          the low-mass X-ray binary system GX~3+1 observed by INTEGRAL on
          August  31,  2004.  The  burst is characterized by two distinct
          phases:  an  initial short spike of 6 s followed by an extended
          decay  phase  lasting  more  than  2000  s. Due to its uncommon
          duration  this burst appears as intermediate between the normal
          type  I  X-ray bursts and the long superbursts. We see emission
          up  to 30 keV energy during the first 5 s of the outburst where
          the  bolometric  burst peak luminosity approaches the Eddington
          limit.  Indications  of  a  radius expansion episode during the
          peak   phase   are   thus   not   overruled.   A  time-resolved
          two-component  spectral  analysis of the total emission reveals
          similar  results  as  a  black-body  modeling  of the net burst
          emission.  From  the  burst  light  curve and the derived burst
          parameters we conclude that we observed a type I X-ray burst of
          an  unusual  character. We discuss three alternative schemes to
          explain  this  peculiar  X-ray  burst: 1) unstable burning of a
          hydrogen/helium  layer  involving  an unusually large amount of
          hydrogen,  2) pure helium ignition at an unusually large depth,
          but  this  seems  unlikely  in the present case, and 3) limited
          carbon  burning  at  an  unusually  shallow  depth triggered by
          unstable helium ignition.

          Title:  A  new  analysis  of  the nucleus of NGC 1068 with MIDI
          observations
          Authors: A. Poncelet, G. Perrin, H. Sol
          Comments: 14 pages, 16 figures
          We present a new analysis of the very first mid-infrared N-band
          long-baseline  interferometric observations of an extragalactic
          source:  the nucleus of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068, obtained
          with   MIDI  (Mid-InfrareD  Interferometer),  the  mid-infrared
          beamcombiner  at  the  European Southern Observatory (ESO) Very
          Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The resolution of 10 mas
          allows  to study the compact central core of the galaxy between
          8  and  13  microns.  Both  visibility  measurements  and  MIDI
          spectrum  are  well reproduced with a simple radiative transfer
          model  with  two  concentric  spherical components. The derived
          angular sizes and temperatures are about 35 and 83 mas, and 361
          K  and  226 K for these two components respectively. Some other
          evidences strongly support such low temperatures. This modeling
          also  provides  the variation of optical depth as a function of
          wavelength   for  the  extended  component  across  the  N-band
          pointing  towards  the  presence  of amorphous silicate grains.
          This  shows  that  MIDI  actually  carried out the first direct
          observations  of  the  distribution  of dust around the central
          engine.  Together  with other observational pieces, we are able
          to  move  a  step  forward in the reconstruction of the picture
          drawn for AGNs.

          Title:  Irradiated  atmospheres  of  accreting  magnetic  white
          dwarfs with an application to the polar AM Herculis
          Authors: M. Koenig, K. Beuermann, B.T. Gaensicke
          Comments:  Astronomy  &  Astrophysics,  in  press,  9  pages, 7
          figures
          We  present  a pilot study of atmospheres of accreting magnetic
          white  dwarfs  irradiated  by  intense fluxes at ultraviolet to
          infrared  wavelengths.  The  model  uses a standard LTE stellar
          atmosphere   code   which   is   expanded   by  introducing  an
          angle-dependent  external radiation source. The present results
          are  obtained for an external source with the spectral shape of
          a  10000K  blackbody and a freely adjustable spectral flux. The
          model   provides   an  explanation  for  the  observed  largely
          filled-up Lyman lines in the prototype polar AM Herculis during
          its  high  states.  It  also  confirms  the hypotheses (i) that
          irradiation  by cyclotron radiation and other radiation sources
          is  the  principle  cause  for  the  large  heated  polar  caps
          surrounding  the  accretion spots on white dwarfs in polars and
          (ii)  that  much  of  the  reprocessed light appears in the far
          ultraviolet  and  not  in the soft X-ray regime as suggested in
          the  original simple theories. We also briefly discuss the role
          played by hard X-rays in heating the polar cap.

          Title:  Alignment  of  Outflows  with  Magnetic Fields in Cloud
          Cores
          Authors: Tomoaki Matsumoto, Takeshi Nakazato, Kohji Tomisaka
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, Accepted by ApJ Letters
          We  estimate  the  polarized  thermal  dust  emission  from MHD
          simulations  of  protostellar collapse and outflow formation in
          order  to  investigate  alignment  of  outflows  with  magnetic
          fields.  The  polarization  maps  indicate that alignment of an
          outflow  with  the magnetic field depends on the field strength
          inside  the cloud core; the direction of the outflow, projected
          on  the  plane  of  the sky, is aligned preferentially with the
          mean polarization vector for a cloud core with a magnetic field
          strength of 80 microgauss, while it does not tend to be aligned
          for  50  microgauss as long as the 1000 AU scale is considered.
          The  direction  of  the  magnetic  field at the cloud center is
          probed  by  the  direction  of  the  outflow.  In addition, the
          magnetic field at the cloud center can be revealed by ALMA even
          when  the  source  is  embedded  deeply  in  the  envelope. The
          Chandrasekhar-Fermi  formula is examined using the polarization
          maps,  indicating  that  the  field  strength  predicted by the
          formula  should  be  corrected  by a factor of 0.24 - 0.44. The
          correction  factor  has a tendency to be lower for a cloud core
          with a weaker magnetic field.

          Comments: 12 pages, 3 figures, accepted by ApJ Letters
          We  present  Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the z=2.38
          lya-emitter   over-density   associated   with  galaxy  cluster
          J2143-4423, the largest known structure (110 Mpc) above z=2. We
          imaged 22 of the 37 known lya-emitters within the filament-like
          structure,  using  the  MIPS  24um  band.  We detected 6 of the
          lya-emitters, including 3 of the 4 clouds of extended (>50 kpc)
          lyman  alpha emission, also known as Lya Blobs. Conversion from
          rest-wavelength  7um  to  total  far-infrared  luminosity using
          locally  derived correlations suggests all the detected sources
          are  in  the  class  of  ULIRGs,  with some reaching Hyper-LIRG
          energies.  Lya  blobs frequently show evidence for interaction,
          either  in  HST  imaging,  or  the  proximity  of multiple MIPS
          sources  within  the  Lya  cloud. This connection suggests that
          interaction or even mergers may be related to the production of
          Lya  blobs.  A  connection  to  mergers does not in itself help
          explain  the  origin of the Lya blobs, as most of the suggested
          mechanisms  for  creating  Lya  blobs (starbursts, AGN, cooling
          flows) could also be associated with galaxy interactions.

          Title:   Local  virial  relation  and  velocity  anisotropy  in
          self-gravitating system
          Authors: Y. Sota, O. Iguchi, M. Morikawa, A. Nakamichi
          Comments:   Proceedings   of   The   Third  21COE  Symposium  :
          Astrophysics as Interdisciplinary Science
          We  investigate  the merging process in N-body self-gravitating
          system  from  the viewpoints of the local virial relation which
          is  the relation between the local kinetic energy and the local
          potential.  We  compare  both the density profile and the phase
          space  density  profile  in  cosmological  simulations with the
          critical solutions of collisionless static state satisfying the
          local  virial  (LV)  relation.  We  got  the  results  that the
          critical   solution  can  explain  the  characteristic  density
          profile  with  the  appropriate  value  of anisotropy parameter
          $\beta  \sim  0.5$.  It  can  also explain the power law of the
          phase space density profile in the outer part of a bound state.
          However,  it  fails  in  explaining the central low temperature
          part  which  is  connected  to  the scale invariant phase space
          density.  It  can  be well fitted to the critical solution with
          the  higher  value  of$\beta \sim 0.75$. These results indicate
          that the LV relation is not compatible with the scale invariant
          phase space density in cosmological simulation.

          Title:  3D  spectroscopy as a tool for investigation of the BLR
          of lensed QSOs
          Authors: L. C. Popovic (AOB)
          Comments:  ESO  Astrophysics Symposia "Science Perspectives for
          3D  Spectroscopy"  (eds,  M.  Kissler-Patig, M.M. Roth and J.R.

          Selective  amplification  of  the  line and continuum source by
          microlensing  in  a  lensed  quasar  can  lead  to  changes  of
          continuum spectral slopes and line shapes in the spectra of the
          quasar   components.   Comparing   the   spectra  of  different
          components  of  the  lensed  quasar and the spectra of an image
          observed  in  different  epochs  one  can infer the presence of
          millilensing,    microlensing    and   intrinsic   variability.
          Especially,  microlensing  can be used for investigation of the
          unresolved  broad  line  (BLR)  and  continuum  emitting region
          structure  in  active  galactic  nuclei  (AGN).  Therefore  the
          spectroscopic  monitoring  of  selected  lensed quasars with 3D
          spectroscopy  open new possibility for investigation of the BLR
          structure  in  AGN.  Here we discuss observational effects that
          may  be  present  during the BLR microlensing in the spectra of
          lensed QSOs.

          Title: A Precessing Ring Model for Low-Frequency Quasi-periodic
          Oscillations
          Authors: Jeremy D. Schnittman (U Maryland), Jeroen Homan (MIT),
          Jon M. Miller (U Michigan)
          Comments: Accepted to ApJ, 22 pages, 7 figures
          We  develop a simple physical model to describe the most common
          type  of  low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen
          in  a  number  of  accreting black hole systems, as well as the
          shape  of  the  relativistically  broadened iron emission lines
          that  often appear simultaneously in such sources. The model is
          based on an inclined ring of hot gas that orbits the black hole
          along  geodesic  trajectories.  For  spinning black holes, this
          ring will precess around the spin axis of the black hole at the
          Lense-Thirring    (``frame-dragging'')   frequency.   Using   a
          relativistic  ray-tracing code, we calculate X-ray light curves
          and  observed  energy  spectra  as a function of the radius and
          tilt angle of the ring, the spin magnitude, and the inclination
          of the black hole. The model predicts higher-amplitude QPOs for
          systems  with high inclinations, as seen in a growing number of
          black  hole binary systems. We find that the Rossi X-ray Timing
          Explorer observations of low-frequency QPOs in GRS 1915+105 are
          consistent  with a ring of radius R ~ 10M orbiting a black hole
          with  spin  a/M  ~0.5  and  inclination  angle  of  i ~ 70 deg.
          Finally,  we  describe how future X-ray missions may be able to
          use  simultaneous  timing  and  spectroscopic  observations  to
          measure the black hole spin and probe the inner-most regions of
          the accretion disk.

          We  present  spectral  results,  from  Chandra  and  XMM-Newton
          observations,  of  a  sample of 22 low-redshift (z < 0.1) radio
          galaxies,  and  consider  whether  the core emission originates
          from  the  base  of  a  relativistic jet, an accretion flow, or
          contains  contributions from both. We find correlations between
          the   unabsorbed   X-ray,   radio,   and   optical  fluxes  and
          luminosities  of FRI-type radio-galaxy cores, implying a common
          origin  in  the  form of a jet. On the other hand, we find that
          the  X-ray spectra of FRII-type radio-galaxy cores is dominated
          by   absorbed  emission,  with  $N_{\rm  H}  >  10^{23}$  atoms
          cm$^{-2}$, that is likely to originate in an accretion flow. We
          discuss  several  models  which  may  account for the different
          nuclear  properties  of  FRI-  and  FRII-type  cores,  and also
          demonstrate  that both heavily obscured, accretion-related, and
          unobscured,  jet-related  components  may  be  present  in  all
          radio-galaxy    nuclei.    Any   absorbed,   accretion-related,
          components    in   FRI-type   galaxies   have   low   radiative
          efficiencies.

          Title:  Monte  Carlo  simulations  of  star  clusters -- III. A
          million body star cluster
          Authors: Mirek Giersz
          Comments: 12 pages, 11 figures
          A  revision  of  Stodolkiewicz's  Monte  Carlo  code is used to
          simulate  the  evolution of million body star clusters. The new
          method  treats  each superstar as a single star and follows the
          evolution  and  motion  of  all  individual  stellar objects. A
          survey  of  the  evolution  of N-body systems influenced by the
          tidal  field  of  a  parent  galaxy and by stellar evolution is
          presented.  The  process  of  energy  generation is realized by
          means  of  appropriately  modified  versions  of  Spitzer's and
          Mikkola's  formulae  for  the interaction cross section between
          binaries  and  field stars and binaries themselves. The results
          presented  are  in good agreement with theoretical expectations
          and  the  results  of  other methods. During the evolution, the
          initial  mass  function  (IMF) changes significantly. The local
          mass  function  (LMF)  around  the  half--mass  radius  closely
          resembles  the  actual  global mass function (GMF). At the late
          stages  of  evolution  the mass of the evolved stars inside the
          core  can  be  as high as 97% of the total mass in this region.
          For  the  whole system, the evolved stars can compose up to 67%
          of the total mass. The evolution of cluster anisotropy strongly
          depends  on initial cluster concentration, IMF and the strength
          of the tidal field. The results presented are the first step in
          the  direction  of  simulating  the  evolution of real globular
          clusters by means of the Monte Carlo method.

          Title:  Estimate  black  hole  masses of AGNs using ultraviolet
          emission line properties
          Authors: Min-Zhi Kong, Xue-Bing Wu, Ran Wang, Jin-Lin Han
          Comments: 19 pages, 10 figures
          Based  on  the  measured  sizes  of  broad  line  region of the
          reverberation-mapping  AGN  sample, two new empirical relations
          are  introduced  to  estimate  the central black hole masses of
          radio-loud  high-redshift  ($z  >  0.5$) AGNs. First, using the
          archival  $IUE/HST$  spectroscopy  data  at  UV  band  for  the
          reverberation-mapping  objects,  we  obtained two new empirical
          relations  between  the  BLR  size  and  \Mg/\C  emission  line
          luminosity.  Secondly,  using  the  newly determined black hole
          masses of the reverberation-mapping sample for calibration, two
          new relationships for determination of black hole mass with the
          full  width  of  half maximum and the luminosity of \Mg/\C line
          are  also  found.  We  then apply the relations to estimate the
          black  hole masses of AGNs in Large Bright Quasar Surveyq and a
          sample  of  radio-loud  quasars.  For  the  objects  with small
          radio-loudness, the black hole mass estimated using the $R_{\rm
          BLR}  - L_{\eMg/\eC}$ relation is consistent with that from the
          $R_{BLR}  -  L_{3000\AA/1350 \AA}$ relation. But for radio-loud
          AGNs,  the  mass  estimated  from  the $R_{BLR} - L_{\eMg/\eC}$
          relation  is  systematically lower than that from the continuum
          luminosity   $L_{3000\AA/1350\AA}$.  Because  jets  could  have
          significant   contributions   to   the   UV/optical   continuum
          luminosity  of  radio-loud  AGNs,  we emphasized again that for
          radio-loud  AGNs,  the emission line luminosity may be a better
          tracer   of   the   ionizing   luminosity  than  the  continuum
          luminosity,  so  that the relations between the BLR size and UV
          emission  line  luminosity should be used to estimate the black
          hole masses of high redshift radio-loud AGNs.

          [Fe/H] = -1.3 to -0.9, with the most metal poor halos resulting
          from  accretion  histories  that  lack destructive mergers with
          massive (metal rich) satellites. Our stellar halo metallicities
          increase   with   stellar   halo   mass.   The   slope  of  the
          [Fe/H]-stellar mass trend mimics that of the satellite galaxies
          that  were  destroyed  to  build  the  halos, implying that the
          relation propagates hierarchically. All simulated halos contain
          a significant fraction of old stellar populations accreted more
          than  10  Gyr  ago  and  in  a few cases, some intermediate age
          populations  exist. In contrast with the Milky Way, many of our
          simulated  stellar  halos contain old stellar populations which
          are  metal  rich, originating in the early accretion of massive
          satellites.  We  suggest  that the (metal rich) stellar halo of
          M31 falls into this category, while the more metal poor halo of
          the  Milky  Way  is  lacking in early massive accretion events.
          Interestingly,  our  hierarchically-formed  stellar halos often
          have  non-negligible  metallicity  gradients in both [Fe/H] and
          [alpha/Fe].  These  gradients extend a few tens of kpc, and can
          be  as  large  as  0.5 dex in [Fe/H] and 0.2 dex in [alpha/Fe].
          Finally,  we  find  that chemical abundances can act as a rough
          substitute  for  time  of  accretion  of satellite galaxies. We
          propose  a criterion for identifying tidal streams spatially by
          selecting stars with [alpha/Fe] ratios below solar.

          Title:  Monte  Carlo  simulations  of  star  clusters -- III. A
          million body star cluster
          Authors: Mirek Giersz
          Comments: 12 pages, 11 figures
          A  revision  of  Stodolkiewicz's  Monte  Carlo  code is used to
          simulate  the  evolution of million body star clusters. The new
          method  treats  each superstar as a single star and follows the
          evolution  and  motion  of  all  individual  stellar objects. A
          survey  of  the  evolution  of N-body systems influenced by the
          tidal  field  of  a  parent  galaxy and by stellar evolution is
          presented.  The  process  of  energy  generation is realized by
          means  of  appropriately  modified  versions  of  Spitzer's and
          Mikkola's  formulae  for  the interaction cross section between
          binaries  and  field stars and binaries themselves. The results
          presented  are  in good agreement with theoretical expectations
          and  the  results  of  other methods. During the evolution, the
          initial  mass  function  (IMF) changes significantly. The local
          mass  function  (LMF)  around  the  half--mass  radius  closely
          resembles  the  actual  global mass function (GMF). At the late
          stages  of  evolution  the mass of the evolved stars inside the
          core  can  be  as high as 97% of the total mass in this region.
          For  the  whole system, the evolved stars can compose up to 67%
          of the total mass. The evolution of cluster anisotropy strongly
          depends  on initial cluster concentration, IMF and the strength
          of the tidal field. The results presented are the first step in
          the  direction  of  simulating  the  evolution of real globular
          clusters by means of the Monte Carlo method.

          Title:  Estimate  black  hole  masses of AGNs using ultraviolet
          emission line properties
          Authors: Min-Zhi Kong, Xue-Bing Wu, Ran Wang, Jin-Lin Han
          Comments: 19 pages, 10 figures
          Based  on  the  measured  sizes  of  broad  line  region of the
          reverberation-mapping  AGN  sample, two new empirical relations
          are  introduced  to  estimate  the central black hole masses of
          radio-loud  high-redshift  ($z  >  0.5$) AGNs. First, using the
          archival  $IUE/HST$  spectroscopy  data  at  UV  band  for  the
          reverberation-mapping  objects,  we  obtained two new empirical
          relations  between  the  BLR  size  and  \Mg/\C  emission  line
          luminosity.  Secondly,  using  the  newly determined black hole
          masses of the reverberation-mapping sample for calibration, two
          new relationships for determination of black hole mass with the
          full  width  of  half maximum and the luminosity of \Mg/\C line
          are  also  found.  We  then apply the relations to estimate the
          black  hole masses of AGNs in Large Bright Quasar Surveyq and a
          sample  of  radio-loud  quasars.  For  the  objects  with small
          radio-loudness, the black hole mass estimated using the $R_{\rm
          BLR}  - L_{\eMg/\eC}$ relation is consistent with that from the
          $R_{BLR}  -  L_{3000\AA/1350 \AA}$ relation. But for radio-loud
          AGNs,  the  mass  estimated  from  the $R_{BLR} - L_{\eMg/\eC}$
          relation  is  systematically lower than that from the continuum
          luminosity   $L_{3000\AA/1350\AA}$.  Because  jets  could  have
          significant   contributions   to   the   UV/optical   continuum
          luminosity  of  radio-loud  AGNs,  we emphasized again that for
          radio-loud  AGNs,  the emission line luminosity may be a better
          tracer   of   the   ionizing   luminosity  than  the  continuum
          luminosity,  so  that the relations between the BLR size and UV
          emission  line  luminosity should be used to estimate the black
          hole masses of high redshift radio-loud AGNs.

          [Abridged]  Motivated  by  upcoming  data  from astrometric and
          spectroscopic  surveys  of  the Galaxy, we explore the chemical
          abundance   properties   and   phase-space   distributions   in

          We  use  radio,  near-IR,  optical,  and  X-ray observations to
          examine  dynamic processes in the central region of Abell 2125.
          In  addition  to  the central triple, including members of both
          major  dynamical  subsystems identified from a redshift survey,
          this  region  features  a  galaxy  showing  strong evidence for
          ongoing  gas  stripping  during a high-velocity passage through
          the  gas  in  the cluster core. The disk galaxy C153 exhibits a
          plume  stretching toward the cluster center seen in soft X-rays
          by Chandra, parts of which are also seen in [O II] emission and
          near-UV  continuum  light.  HST imaging shows a distorted disk,
          with  star-forming knots asymmetrically distributed and remnant
          spiral  structure possibly defined by dust lanes. The stars and
          ionized   gas   in   its   disk  are  kinematically  decoupled,
          demonstrating  that  pressure  stripping must be important, and
          that  tidal  disruption  is  not  the  only  mechanism at work.
          Comparison  of the gas properties seen in the X-ray and optical
          data on the plume highlight significant features of the history
          of stripped gas in the intracluster medium. The nucleus of C153
          also  hosts  an  AGN,  shown by the weak and distorted extended
          radio  emission  and a radio compact core. The unusual strength
          of  the stripping signatures in this instance is likely related
          to the high relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to the
          intracluster  medium,  during a cluster/cluster merger, and its
          passage  very  near  the  core  of the cluster. Another sign of
          recent  dynamical  events  is  diffuse starlight asymmetrically
          placed about the central triple in a cD envelope. Transient and
          extreme dynamical events as seen in Abell 2125 may be important
          drivers of galaxy evolution in the cores of rich clusters.

          Title:  CCS  and  NH3  emission  associated with low-mass young

          Comments:  28  pages, 1 figure, 3 tables, to appear in the 2006
          May 1 issue of the Astrophysical Journal
          In  this work we present a sensitive and systematic single-dish
          survey of CCS emission (complemented with ammonia observations)
          at  1  cm,  toward a sample of low- and intermediate-mass young
          star forming regions known to harbor water maser emission, made
          with NASA's 70 m antenna at Robledo de Chavela, Spain.
          Out   of   the   40   star  forming  regions  surveyed  in  the
          CCS(2_{1}-1_{0})   line,  only  6  low-mass  sources  show  CCS
          emission:  one  transitional  object  between  pre-stellar  and
          protostellar  Class  0  phase (GF9-2), three Class 0 protostars
          (L1448-IRS3,  L1448C,  and  B1-IRS), a Class I source (L1251A),
          and  a  young  T  Tauri  star  (NGC2071-North).  Since  CCS  is
          considered  an  ``early-time'' (<10E+5 yr) molecule, we explain
          these   results   by   either   proposing  a  revision  of  the
          classification  of  the  age  of  NGC2071-North  and L1251A, or
          suggesting   the   possibility  that  the  particular  physical
          conditions   and   processes   of   each   source   affect  the
          destruction/production of the CCS. No statistically significant
          relationship   was  found  between  the  presence  of  CCS  and
          parameters of the molecular outflows and their driving sources.
          Nevertheless,  we  found a significant relationship between the
          detectability  of CCS and the ammonia peak intensity (higher in
          regions  with CCS), but not with its integrated intensity. This
          tendency  found  may  suggest  that  the  narrower ammonia line
          widths  in  the  less  turbulent medium associated with younger
          cores  may  compensate  for  the  differences  in  ammonia peak
          intensity,   rendering   differences  in  integrated  intensity
          negligible. From the CCS detection rate we derive a lifetime of
          this  molecule  of ~(0.7-3) x 10E+4 yr in low-mass star forming
          regions.

          HH  110  and  HH  262  are  two  Herbig-Haro  jets  with rather
          peculiar,  chaotic  morphology.  In  the  two  cases, no source
          suitable  to power the jet has been detected along the outflow,
          at  optical  or  radio  wavelengths.  Both,  previous  data and
          theoretical  models,  suggest that these objects are tracing an
          early  stage  of  an HH jet/dense cloud interaction. We present
          the   first   results   of   the  integral  field  spectroscopy
          observations  made  with  the  PMAS spectrophotometer (with the
          PPAK  configuration)  of  these two turbulent jets. New data of
          the  kinematics in several characteristic HH emission lines are
          shown. In addition, line-ratio maps have been made, suitable to
          explore  the  spatial  excitation  an density conditions of the

          Comments: ApJ, in press; 40 pages, 12 figures
          Mid-infrared  observations  of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are
          important  for  understanding of the physical conditions around
          the  central  accretion  engines.  Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray
          observations  of  a  300  arcmin^2 region in the Extended Groth
          Strip  are  used  to  select  a  sample of~150 AGN. The Spitzer
          instruments IRAC and MIPS detect 68-80% of these sources, which
          show  a wide range of mid-infrared properties. About 40% of the
          sources  have red power-law spectral energy distributions (f_nu
          ~  nu^alpha,  alpha<0)  in  the  3.6-8  um IRAC bands. In these
          sources the central engine dominates the emission at both X-ray
          and IR wavelengths. Another 40% of the sources have blue mid-IR
          spectral  energy  distributions  (alpha>0)  with their infrared
          emission  dominated  by  the host galaxy; the remaining 20% are
          not  well-fit by a power law. Published IRAC color criteria for
          AGN  select  most of the red sources, but only some of the blue
          sources.  As  with  all other known methods, selecting AGN with
          mid-IR  colors will not produce a sample that is simultaneously
          complete  and  reliable.  The  IRAC  SED type does not directly
          correspond  to  X-ray  spectral  type  (hard/soft).  The mid-IR
          properties of X-ray-detected Lyman-break, radio, submillimeter,
          and optically-faint sources vary widely and, for the most part,
          are  not  distinct  from  those  of  the general X-ray/infrared
          source  population.  X-ray sources emit 6-11% of the integrated
          mid--IR  light,  making  them  significant  contributors to the
          cosmic infrared background.

          Title: Assisted stellar suicide in V617 Sgr

          Telescope), D. Cieslinski (INPE), T. V. Ricci (IAG-USP)
          Comments: 4 pages, accepted for publication in A&A Letters
          V617  Sgr is a V Sagittae star - a group of binaries thought to
          be  the  galactic  counterparts of the Compact Binary Supersoft
          X-ray Sources - CBSS. To check this hypothesis, we measured the
          time  derivative  of  its  orbital  period. Observed timings of
          eclipse   minima   spanning  over  30,000  orbital  cycles  are
          presented.  We  found  that  the  orbital  period evolves quite
          rapidly:  P/Pdot  = 1.1 x 10^{6} years. This is consistent with
          the  idea  that  V617  Sgr is a wind driven accretion supersoft
          source. As the binary system evolves with a time-scale of about
          one  million  years,  which  is  extremely short for a low mass
          evolved  binary,  it  is  likely  that the system will soon end
          either  by having its secondary completely evaporated or by the
          primary exploding as a supernova of type Ia.

          We  report  the detection of hard X-ray emission from the field
          of  the star-forming region NGC 6334 with the the International
          Gamma-Ray  Astrophysics  Laboratory INTEGRAL. The JEM-X monitor
          and  ISGRI  imager aboard INTEGRAL and Chandra ACIS imager were
          used  to construct 3-80 keV images and spectra of NGC 6334. The
          3-10  keV  and  10-35 keV images made with JEM-X show a complex
          structure  of extended emission from NGC 6334. The ISGRI source
          detected in the energy ranges 20-40 keV and 40-80 keV coincides
          with  the NGC 6334 ridge. The 20-60 keV flux from the source is
          (1.8+-0.37)*10(-11)  erg cm(-2) s(-1). Spectral analysis of the
          source  revealed a hard power-law component with a photon index
          about  1.  The  observed  X-ray  fluxes  are  in agreement with
          extrapolations  of  X-ray  imaging  observations of NGC 6334 by
          Chandra  ACIS  and ASCA GIS. The X-ray data are consistent with
          two  very  different  physical  models.  A probable scenario is
          emission  from  a  heavily  absorbed,  compact and hard Chandra
          source  that  is associated with the AGN candidate radio source
          NGC  6334B.  Another  possible  model  is  the extended Chandra
          source  of  nonthermal  emission  from  NGC  6334 that can also
          account  for  the hard X-ray emission observed by INTEGRAL. The
          origin  of  the  emission  in  this scenario is due to electron
          acceleration  in  energetic  outflows  from  massive early type
          stars.  The  possibility  of  emission  from  a young supernova
          remnant,  as  suggested by earlier infrared observations of NGC
          6334, is constrained by the non-detection of 44Ti lines.

          Title:  A Deep Radio Survey of Abell 2125 III: The Cluster Core
          - Merging and Stripping

          We  use  radio,  near-IR,  optical,  and  X-ray observations to
          examine  dynamic processes in the central region of Abell 2125.
          In  addition  to  the central triple, including members of both
          major  dynamical  subsystems identified from a redshift survey,
          this  region  features  a  galaxy  showing  strong evidence for
          ongoing  gas  stripping  during a high-velocity passage through
          the  gas  in  the cluster core. The disk galaxy C153 exhibits a
          plume  stretching toward the cluster center seen in soft X-rays
          by Chandra, parts of which are also seen in [O II] emission and
          near-UV  continuum  light.  HST imaging shows a distorted disk,
          with  star-forming knots asymmetrically distributed and remnant
          spiral  structure possibly defined by dust lanes. The stars and
          ionized   gas   in   its   disk  are  kinematically  decoupled,
          demonstrating  that  pressure  stripping must be important, and
          that  tidal  disruption  is  not  the  only  mechanism at work.
          Comparison  of the gas properties seen in the X-ray and optical
          data on the plume highlight significant features of the history
          of stripped gas in the intracluster medium. The nucleus of C153
          also  hosts  an  AGN,  shown by the weak and distorted extended
          radio  emission  and a radio compact core. The unusual strength
          of  the stripping signatures in this instance is likely related
          to the high relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to the
          intracluster  medium,  during a cluster/cluster merger, and its
          passage  very  near  the  core  of the cluster. Another sign of
          recent  dynamical  events  is  diffuse starlight asymmetrically
          placed about the central triple in a cD envelope. Transient and
          extreme dynamical events as seen in Abell 2125 may be important
          drivers of galaxy evolution in the cores of rich clusters.

          Title:  CCS  and  NH3  emission  associated with low-mass young
          stellar objects
          Authors: I. de Gregorio-Monsalvo, J.F. Gomez, O. Suarez, T.B.H.

          Comments:  28  pages, 1 figure, 3 tables, to appear in the 2006
          May 1 issue of the Astrophysical Journal
          In  this work we present a sensitive and systematic single-dish
          survey of CCS emission (complemented with ammonia observations)
          at  1  cm,  toward a sample of low- and intermediate-mass young
          star forming regions known to harbor water maser emission, made
          with NASA's 70 m antenna at Robledo de Chavela, Spain.
          Out   of   the   40   star  forming  regions  surveyed  in  the
          CCS(2_{1}-1_{0})   line,  only  6  low-mass  sources  show  CCS
          emission:  one  transitional  object  between  pre-stellar  and
          protostellar  Class  0  phase (GF9-2), three Class 0 protostars
          (L1448-IRS3,  L1448C,  and  B1-IRS), a Class I source (L1251A),
          and  a  young  T  Tauri  star  (NGC2071-North).  Since  CCS  is
          considered  an  ``early-time'' (<10E+5 yr) molecule, we explain
          these   results   by   either   proposing  a  revision  of  the
          classification  of  the  age  of  NGC2071-North  and L1251A, or
          suggesting   the   possibility  that  the  particular  physical
          conditions   and   processes   of   each   source   affect  the
          destruction/production of the CCS. No statistically significant
          relationship   was  found  between  the  presence  of  CCS  and
          parameters of the molecular outflows and their driving sources.
          Nevertheless,  we  found a significant relationship between the
          detectability  of CCS and the ammonia peak intensity (higher in
          regions  with CCS), but not with its integrated intensity. This
          tendency  found  may  suggest  that  the  narrower ammonia line
          widths  in  the  less  turbulent medium associated with younger
          cores  may  compensate  for  the  differences  in  ammonia peak
          intensity,   rendering   differences  in  integrated  intensity
          negligible. From the CCS detection rate we derive a lifetime of
          this  molecule  of ~(0.7-3) x 10E+4 yr in low-mass star forming
          regions.

          HH  110  and  HH  262  are  two  Herbig-Haro  jets  with rather
          peculiar,  chaotic  morphology.  In  the  two  cases, no source
          suitable  to power the jet has been detected along the outflow,
          at  optical  or  radio  wavelengths.  Both,  previous  data and
          theoretical  models,  suggest that these objects are tracing an
          early  stage  of  an HH jet/dense cloud interaction. We present
          the   first   results   of   the  integral  field  spectroscopy
          observations  made  with  the  PMAS spectrophotometer (with the
          PPAK  configuration)  of  these two turbulent jets. New data of
          the  kinematics in several characteristic HH emission lines are
          shown. In addition, line-ratio maps have been made, suitable to
          explore  the  spatial  excitation  an density conditions of the
          jets as a function of their kinematics.

          Comments: ApJ, in press; 40 pages, 12 figures
          Mid-infrared  observations  of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are
          important  for  understanding of the physical conditions around
          the  central  accretion  engines.  Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray
          observations  of  a  300  arcmin^2 region in the Extended Groth
          Strip  are  used  to  select  a  sample of~150 AGN. The Spitzer
          instruments IRAC and MIPS detect 68-80% of these sources, which
          show  a wide range of mid-infrared properties. About 40% of the
          sources  have red power-law spectral energy distributions (f_nu
          ~  nu^alpha,  alpha<0)  in  the  3.6-8  um IRAC bands. In these
          sources the central engine dominates the emission at both X-ray
          and IR wavelengths. Another 40% of the sources have blue mid-IR
          spectral  energy  distributions  (alpha>0)  with their infrared
          emission  dominated  by  the host galaxy; the remaining 20% are
          not  well-fit by a power law. Published IRAC color criteria for
          AGN  select  most of the red sources, but only some of the blue
          sources.  As  with  all other known methods, selecting AGN with
          mid-IR  colors will not produce a sample that is simultaneously
          complete  and  reliable.  The  IRAC  SED type does not directly
          correspond  to  X-ray  spectral  type  (hard/soft).  The mid-IR
          properties of X-ray-detected Lyman-break, radio, submillimeter,
          and optically-faint sources vary widely and, for the most part,
          are  not  distinct  from  those  of  the general X-ray/infrared
          source  population.  X-ray sources emit 6-11% of the integrated
          mid--IR  light,  making  them  significant  contributors to the
          cosmic infrared background.

          Title: Assisted stellar suicide in V617 Sgr

          Telescope), D. Cieslinski (INPE), T. V. Ricci (IAG-USP)
          Comments: 4 pages, accepted for publication in A&A Letters
          V617  Sgr is a V Sagittae star - a group of binaries thought to
          be  the  galactic  counterparts of the Compact Binary Supersoft
          X-ray Sources - CBSS. To check this hypothesis, we measured the
          time  derivative  of  its  orbital  period. Observed timings of
          eclipse   minima   spanning  over  30,000  orbital  cycles  are
          presented.  We  found  that  the  orbital  period evolves quite
          rapidly:  P/Pdot  = 1.1 x 10^{6} years. This is consistent with
          the  idea  that  V617  Sgr is a wind driven accretion supersoft
          source. As the binary system evolves with a time-scale of about
          one  million  years,  which  is  extremely short for a low mass
          evolved  binary,  it  is  likely  that the system will soon end
          either  by having its secondary completely evaporated or by the
          primary exploding as a supernova of type Ia.

          We  report  the detection of hard X-ray emission from the field
          of  the star-forming region NGC 6334 with the the International
          Gamma-Ray  Astrophysics  Laboratory INTEGRAL. The JEM-X monitor
          and  ISGRI  imager aboard INTEGRAL and Chandra ACIS imager were
          used  to construct 3-80 keV images and spectra of NGC 6334. The
          3-10  keV  and  10-35 keV images made with JEM-X show a complex
          structure  of extended emission from NGC 6334. The ISGRI source
          detected in the energy ranges 20-40 keV and 40-80 keV coincides
          with  the NGC 6334 ridge. The 20-60 keV flux from the source is
          (1.8+-0.37)*10(-11)  erg cm(-2) s(-1). Spectral analysis of the
          source  revealed a hard power-law component with a photon index
          about  1.  The  observed  X-ray  fluxes  are  in agreement with
          extrapolations  of  X-ray  imaging  observations of NGC 6334 by
          Chandra  ACIS  and ASCA GIS. The X-ray data are consistent with
          two  very  different  physical  models.  A probable scenario is
          emission  from  a  heavily  absorbed,  compact and hard Chandra
          source  that  is associated with the AGN candidate radio source
          NGC  6334B.  Another  possible  model  is  the extended Chandra
          source  of  nonthermal  emission  from  NGC  6334 that can also
          account  for  the hard X-ray emission observed by INTEGRAL. The
          origin  of  the  emission  in  this scenario is due to electron
          acceleration  in  energetic  outflows  from  massive early type
          stars.  The  possibility  of  emission  from  a young supernova
          remnant,  as  suggested by earlier infrared observations of NGC
          6334, is constrained by the non-detection of 44Ti lines.

          Title: Massive Black Hole Binaries from Collisional Runaways
          Authors:  M.  Atakan Grkan, John M. Fregeau, Frederic A. Rasio
          (Northwestern University)
          Comments: 4 pages with emulateapj. Submitted to ApJ Letters
          Recent  theoretical  work  has  solidified the viability of the
          collisional  runaway  scenario in young dense star clusters for
          the  formation  of  very  massive  stars  (VMSs),  which may be
          precursors to intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We present
          first results from a numerical study of the collisional runaway
          process  in dense star clusters containing primordial binaries.
          Stellar collisions during binary scattering encounters offer an
          alternate  channel  for runaway growth, somewhat independent of
          direct  collisions  between single stars. We find that clusters
          with  binary  fractions  >~10%  yield  two VMSs via collisional
          runaways,   presenting   the   exotic  possibility  of  forming
          IMBH--IMBH   binaries   in   star   clusters.  We  discuss  the
          implications  for  gravitational  wave  observations,  and  the
          impact on cluster structure.

          Comments: 16 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables, MNRAS submitted
          We  use the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) to study the soft X-ray
          properties  of  a homogeneous sample of 46,420 quasars selected
          from  the  third  data  release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
          (SDSS).   Optical  luminosities,  both  at  rest-frame  2500\AA
          ($L_{2500}$)  and  in [OIII] ($L_{[\rm{OIII}]}$) span more than
          three   orders   of   magnitude,  while  redshifts  range  over
          $0.1<z<5.4$.  We  detect  3366 quasars directly in the observed
          0.1--2.4  keV  band.  Sub-samples of radio-loud and radio-quiet
          objects (RLQs and RQQs) are obtained by cross-matching with the
          FIRST  catalogue. We study the distribution of X-ray luminosity
          as  a  function of optical luminosity, redshift and radio power
          using both individual detections and stacks of complete sets of
          similar quasars. At every optical luminosity and redshift $\log
          L_{2\kev}$  is,  to  a good approximation, normally distributed
          with dispersion $\sim 0.40$, at least brightwards of the median
          X-ray  luminosity. This median X-ray luminosity of quasars is a
          power  law  of  optical  luminosity  with index $\sim 0.53$ for
          $L_{2500}$  and  $\sim  0.30$  for  $L_{[\rm{OIII}]}$. RLQs are
          systematically  brighter  than  RQQs  by about a factor of 2 at
          given  optical  luminosity.  The zero-points of these relations
          increase  systematically  with  redshift, possibly in different
          ways for RLQs and RQQs. Evolution is particularly strong at low
          redshift  and  if  the  optical  luminosity is characterised by
          $L_{[\rm{OIII}]}$.    At    low    redshift    and   at   given
          $L_{[\rm{OIII}]}$  the  soft X-ray emission from type II AGN is
          more than 100 times weaker than that from type I AGN.

          Title:  Magnetized  Supramassive  Neutron  Star Collapse: A New
          Model For X-Ray Flares In Early GRB Afterglows
          Authors: W. H. Gao
          Comments: 6 pages
          Energetic  X-ray  flares  have  been  well  detected  in a good
          fraction  of  {\em Swift} Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) afterglows tens
          to  hundreds  of  seconds  after  the  trigger  of  the  prompt
          $\gamma-$ray   emission   phase.   These   flares  are  usually
          attributed  to the late time activity of the central engine. We
          suggest  a  new central engine model to account for these X-ray
          flares.  In  this  model,  the GRB central engine is a rotating
          magnetized  supramassive neutron star (SMNS). When the SMNS has
          lost  its significant part of angular momentum, it collapses to
          a  black  hole  and  produces a Poynting-flux dominated outflow
          which give rise to the observed X-ray flares.

          Nature Physics (Feb. 2006)
          The  first  locations  of  short  gamma-ray  bursts  (GRBs)  in
          elliptical galaxies suggest they are produced by the mergers of
          double  neutron star (DNS) binaries in old stellar populations.
          Globular  clusters,  where  the  extreme  densities of very old
          stars  in  cluster  cores  create and exchange compact binaries
          efficiently,  are a natural environment to produce merging NSs.
          They  also  allow  some short GRBs to be offset from their host
          galaxies,  as opposed to DNS systems formed from massive binary
          stars which appear to remain in galactic disks. Starting with a
          simple  scaling  from  the  first  DNS  observed  in a galactic
          globular,  which will produce a short GRB in ~300My, we present
          numerical simulations which show that ~10-30% of short GRBs may
          be produced in globular clusters vs. the much more numerous DNS
          mergers   and   short   GRBs   predicted  for  galactic  disks.
          Reconciling  the  rates  suggests  the disk short GRBs are more
          beamed,  perhaps  by both the increased merger angular momentum
          from  the  DNS spin-orbit alignment (random for the DNS systems
          in globulars) and a larger magnetic field on the secondary NS.

          updated  since  the  conference, I summarize recent and ongoing
          analysis  of  the  millisecond  pulsars,  the  compact binaries
          containing   white   dwarfs   and   neutron   stars,   and  the
          chromospherically  active  binaries  in both globular clusters.
          Spectral  variability analysis enables new insights into source
          properties  and evolutionary history. These binary populations,
          now   so  ``easily''  visible,  are  large  enough  that  their
          properties  and  spatial  distributions  reveal  new  hints  of
          compact  object  formation  and  binary interactions with their
          parent  cluster. Neutron stars appear overabundant, relative to
          white  dwarfs,  in  47Tuc  vs.  NGC  6397.  The IXBs containing
          neutron  stars (i.e., MSPs and qLMXBs), as the most massive and
          ancient  compact binary sample, may trace the protocluster disk
          in  47Tuc,  whereas  compact  binaries  may  have  been ejected
          preferentially  along  the  cluster rotation equator during the
          recent core collapse in NGC 6397.

          Survey for Black Holes

          The  Energetic  X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) is under
          study  for  the  proposed  Black  Hole Finder Probe, one of the
          three   Einstein  Probe  missions  in  NASA's  proposed  Beyond
          Einstein  Program.  EXIST  would  have  unique capabilities: it
          would  survey  the  full sky at 5-600 keV each 95min orbit with
          0.9-5  arcmin, 10microsec - 45min, and ~0.5-5 keV resolution to
          locate  sources  to  10arcsec  and  enable  black  holes  to be
          surveyed   and  studied  on  all  scales.  With  5sigma  survey
          sensitivity   (0.5-1y)  Fx(40-80  keV)  ~5  x  10^-13  cgs,  or
          comparable  to the ROSAT soft X-ray (0.3-2.5 keV) sky survey, a
          large  sample  (~2-4 x 10^4) of obscured AGN will be identified
          and  a  complete  sample  of  accreting stellar mass BHs in the
          Galaxy  will be found. The all-sky/all-time coverage will allow
          rare events to be measured, such as possible stellar disruption
          flares  from  dormant  AGN  out  to  ~200  Mpc.  A large sample
          (~2-3/day)   of   GRBs   will   be   located   (<~10arcsec)  at
          sensitivities  and  bandwidths much greater than previously and
          likely yield the highest redshift events and constraints on Pop
          III  BHs.  An  outline  of  the mission design from the ongoing
          concept study is presented.

          Title: QPOs during magnetar flares are not driven by mechanical
          normal modes of the crust
          Authors: Yuri Levin (Leiden Observatory and Lorentz Institute)
          Comments: 3 pages, submitted to MNRAS letters
          Quasi-Periodic  Oscillations  (QPOs)  have been observed during
          three powerful magnetar flares, from SGR0526-66, SGR1806-20 and
          SGR1900+14.  These QPOs have been commonly interpreted as being
          driven  by  the  mechanical modes of the magnetar's solid crust
          which  are  excited  during  the  flare. Here we show that this
          interpretation  is in sharp contradiction with the conventional
          magnetar  model.  Firstly, we show that a magnetar crustal mode
          decays on the timescale of at most a second due to the emission
          of  Alfven  waves  into  the  neutron-star interior. A possible
          modification  is  then  to  assume that the QPOs are associated
          with the magnetars' global modes. However, we argue that at the
          frequencies  of  the  observed  QPOs,  the neutron-star core is
          likely  to  support  a  continuum of Magneto-Hydrodynamic (MHD)
          normal  modes. We demonstrate this on a completely solvable toy
          model  which  captures  the essential physics of the system. We
          then  show  that  the frequency of the global mode of the whole
          star  must  have  a  significant  imaginary  component, and its
          amplitude  must  decay  on  a  short  timescale.  This  is  not
          observed.  Thus  we  conclude that either (i) the origin of the
          QPO  is  in  the magnetar's magnetosphere, or (ii) the magnetic
          field  must  be  expelled from the magnetar's core prior to the
          flares.

          Title:  Understanding  the Nuclear Gas Dispersion in Early-Type
          Galaxies in the Context of Black Hole Demographics
          Authors:  Gijs  Verdoes  Kleijn,  Roeland  van der Marel, Jacob
          Noel-Storr
          Comments: accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal
          (abridged)  We  analyze  and  model HST /STIS observations of a
          sample  of  27  galaxies;  16  Fanaroff  &  Riley  Type I radio
          galaxies  and  11  (more)  normal early-type galaxies. We focus
          here   on  what  can  be  learned  from  the  nuclear  velocity
          dispersion  (line width) of the gas as a complement to the many
          studies  dealing with gas rotation velocities. We find that the
          dispersion in a STIS aperture of ~0.1''-0.2'' generally exceeds
          the large-scale stellar velocity dispersion of the galaxy. This
          is  qualitatively  consistent with the presence of central BHs,
          but raises the question whether the excess gas dispersion is of
          gravitational  or  non-gravitational  origin  and  whether  the
          implied BH masses are consistent with our current understanding
          of  BH  demography(as predicted by the M-sigma relation between
          BH  mass  and  stellar velocity dispersion). To address this we
          construct  dynamical  models for the gas, both thin disk models
          and   models   with  more  general  axis  ratios  and  velocity
          anisotropies.   For   the   normal  galaxies  the  nuclear  gas
          dispersions are adequately reproduced assuming disks around BHs
          with  masses that follow the M-sigma relation. In contrast, the
          gas  dispersions  observed  for  the  radio  galaxies generally
          exceed  those predicted by any of the models. We attribute this
          to  the  presence  of non-gravitational motions in the gas that
          are  similar  to  or larger than the gravitational motions. The
          non-  gravitational motions are presumably driven by the active
          galactic  nucleus  (AGN), but we do not find a relation between
          the  radiative  output  of  the  AGN  and the non-gravitational
          dispersion.  It  is  not  possible to uniquely determine the BH
          mass  for each galaxy from its nuclear gas dispersion. However,
          for  the  sample  as  a  whole  the observed dispersions do not
          provide  evidence  for  significant deviations from the M-sigma
          relation.

          Title: Eclipsing binaries in ASAS catalog
          Authors: B. Paczynski, D. Szczygiel, B. Pilecki, G. Pojmanski
          Comments: 8 pages, 12 figures, latex, submitted to MNRAS
          ASAS  is  a  long term project to monitor bright variable stars
          over the whole sky. It has discovered 50,122 variables brighter
          than  V  <  14  mag south of declination +28 degrees, and among
          them  11,099  eclipsing  binaries.  We  present  a  preliminary
          analysis  of  5,384  contact,  2,957  semi-detached,  and 2,758
          detached systems. The statistics of the distribution provides a
          qualitative  confirmation  of  decades old idea of Flannery and
          Lucy  that  W  UMa  type  binaries  evolve  through a series of
          relaxation   oscillations:  ASAS  finds  comparable  number  of
          contact and semidetached systems. The most surprising result is
          a very small number of detached eclipsing binaries with periods
          P  < 1 day, the systems believed to be the progenitors of W UMa
          stars.  As many (perhaps all) contact binaries have companions,
          there  is a possibility that some were formed in a Kozai cycle,
          as suggested by Eggleton and his associates.

          On  2004  August 15, we observed a fast (shorter than 10 hours)
          state  transition  in  the bright black-hole transient GX 339-4
          simultaneously  with RossiXTE and INTEGRAL. This transition was
          evident  both  in timing and spectral properties. Combining the
          data  from  PCA,  HEXTE  and  IBIS,  we  obtained  good quality
          broad-band  (3-200  keV)  energy  spectra  before and after the
          transition.  These  spectra  indicate  that  the hard component
          steepened. Also, the high-energy cutoff that was present at ~70
          keV   before   the   transition  was  not  detected  after  the
          transition.   This   is   the   first  time  that  an  accurate
          determination   of   the  broad-band  spectrum  across  such  a
          transition  has  been  measured on a short time scale. It shows
          that,  although some spectral parameters do not change abruptly
          through     the     transition,    the    high-energy    cutoff
          increases/disappears  rather  fast.  These results constitute a
          benchmark   on   which  to  test  theoretical  models  for  the
          production of the hard component in these systems.

          We  study  the  bending  of  jets  in binary stellar systems. A
          compact  companion  accretes  mass  from  the  slow wind of the
          mass-losing  primary  star,  forms an accretion disk, and blows
          two  opposite  jets. These fast jets are bent by the slow wind.
          Disregarding  the orbital motion, we find the dependence of the
          bending  angle on the properties of the slow wind and the jets.
          Bending  of  jets  is  observed  in planetary nebulae which are
          thought  to be the descendants of interacting binary stars. For
          example,  in  some  of  these planetary nebulae the two bubbles
          (lobes)  which  are  inflated  by  the  two  opposite jets, are
          displaced  to the same side of the symmetry axis of the nebula.
          Similar  displacements  are  observed  in  bubble  pairs in the
          center  of some clusters and groups of galaxies. We compare the
          bending of jets in binary stellar systems with that in clusters
          of galaxies.

          Propagation   of   light   in   the   gravitational   field  of
          self-gravitating   spinning   bodies   moving   with  arbitrary
          velocities  is discussed. The gravitational field is assumed to
          be  "weak"  everywhere.  Equations of motion of a light ray are
          solved  in  the  first  post-Minkowskian  approximation that is
          linear  with  respect  to  the universal gravitational constant
          $G$.  We  do  not  restrict ourselves with the approximation of
          gravitational  lens  so that the solution of light geodesics is
          applicable  for  arbitrary  locations  of  source  of light and
          observer. This formalism is applied for studying corrections to
          the Shapiro time delay in binary pulsars caused by the rotation
          of  pulsar  and its companion. We also derive the correction to
          the  light  deflection  angle caused by rotation of gravitating
          bodies  in  the  solar system (Sun, planets) or a gravitational
          lens.  The gravitational shift of frequency due to the combined
          translational  and  rotational  motions of light-ray-deflecting
          bodies is analyzed as well. We give a general derivation of the
          formula  describing  the  relativistic rotation of the plane of
          polarization  of electromagnetic waves (Skrotskii effect). This
          formula  is  valid  for  arbitrary translational and rotational
          motion of gravitating bodies and greatly extends the results of
          previous  researchers. Finally, we discuss the Skrotskii effect
          for  gravitational waves emitted by localized sources such as a
          binary  system.  The  theoretical  results of this paper can be
          applied   for   studying   various   relativistic   effects  in
          microarcsecond  space  astrometry  and developing corresponding
          algorithms  for  data  processing in space astrometric missions
          such as FAME, SIM, and GAIA.

          We   use   GALEX  (Galaxy  Evolution  Explorer)  near-UV  (NUV)
          photometry  of  a sample of earlytype galaxies selected in SDSS
          (Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey)  to  study the UV color-magnitude
          relation  (CMR).  NUV-r  color  is  an excellent tracer of even
          small  amounts  (>  1%  mass  fraction) of recent (<1 Gyr) star
          formation and so the NUV-r CMR allows us to study the effect of
          environment  on the recent star formation history. We analyze a
          volume-limited  sample  of  839  visually-inspected  early-type
          galaxies in the redshift range 0.05 < z < 0.10 brighter than Mr
          of  -21.5 with any possible emission-line or radio-selected AGN
          removed  to  avoid contamination. We find that contamination by
          AGN  candidates and late-type interlopers highly bias any study
          of recent star formation in early-type galaxies and that, after
          removing  those,  our  lower  limit  to the fraction of massive
          early-type  galaxies  showing signs of recent star formation is
          roughly 23 +/- 2% This suggests that residual star formation is
          common   even   amongst   the  present  day  early-type  galaxy
          population.  We  find that the fraction of UV-bright early-type
          galaxies  is  50%  higher in low-density environments. However,
          the density effect is clear only in the lowest density bin. The
          blue  galaxy  fraction  for  the  subsample  of  the  brightest
          early-type   galaxies  however  shows  a  very  strong  density
          dependence, in the sense that the blue galaxy fraction is lower
          in a higher density region.

          We  present  the  identification of the optical counterparts to
          the  low-mass  X-ray  binaries  1A  1246-588 and 4U 1812-12. We
          determine  the  X-ray  position  of 1A 1246-588 from ROSAT/PSPC
          observations  and find within the error circle a blue star with
          V=19.45,  B-V=0.22  and  R-I=0.22  which  we  identify  as  the
          counterpart.  Within  the Chandra error circle of 4U 1812-12, a
          single  star  is present which appears blue with respect to the
          stars  in  the  vicinity.  It  has  R=22.15, R-I=1.53. Distance
          estimates   for   both   systems   indicate  that  the  optical
          counterparts  are intrinsically faint, suggesting that they are
          ultra-compact   X-ray  binaries.  These  identifications  would
          increase  the  number of candidate ultra-compact X-ray binaries
          from  2  to  4, whereas orbital periods are measured for only 7
          systems in the Galactic disk.

          of  X-ray  lightcurves  of  several  black-hole  candidates. We
          further explore the idea that a non-linear resonance mechanism,
          operating  in  strong-gravity  regime, is responsible for these
          quasi-periodic    oscillations   (QPOs).   By   extending   the
          multiple-scales    analysis    of    Rebusco,    we   construct
          two-dimensional   phase-space  sections,  which  enable  us  to
          identify  different  topologies  governing  the  system  and to
          follow  evolutionary  tracks  of  the twin peaks. This suggests
          that     the     original     (Abramowicz     and     Kluzniak)
          parametric-resonance  scheme  can  be  viewed  as  an ingenuous
          account  of  the QPOs model with an internal resonance. We show
          an  example  of  internal  resonance in a system with up to two
          critical  points,  and  we  describe  a  general technique that
          permits  to  treat  other  cases  in  a  systematical manner. A
          separatrix  divides  the  phase-space  sections into regions of
          different   topology:   inside   the   libration   region   the
          evolutionary tracks bring the observed twin-peak frequencies to
          an  exact rational ratio, whereas in the circulation region the
          observed  frequencies remain off resonance. Our scheme predicts
          the  power  should  cyclically  be  exchanged  between  the two
          oscillations.  Likewise the high-frequency QPOs in neutron-star
          binaries,  also in black-hole sources one expects, as a general
          property  of  the non-linear model, that slight detuning pushes
          the twin-peak frequencies out of sharp resonance.

          Title:  Implications  of the Early X-Ray Afterglow Light Curves
          of Swift GRBs
          Authors: Jonathan Granot, Arieh Konigl, Tsvi Piran
          Comments: 31 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables; submitted to MNRAS
          According  to  current  models,  gamma-ray  bursts  (GRBs)  are
          produced  when  the energy carried by a relativistic outflow is
          dissipated and converted into radiation. The efficiency of this
          process,  $\epsilon_\gamma$,  is one of the critical factors in
          any  GRB  model. The X-ray afterglow light curves of Swift GRBs
          show an early stage of flat decay. This has been interpreted as
          reflecting   energy  injection.  When  combined  with  previous
          estimates,  which have concluded that the kinetic energy of the
          late  ($\gtrsim  10$  hr) afterglow is comparable to the energy
          emitted  in  gamma-rays,  this interpretation implies very high
          values of $\epsilon_\gamma \gtrsim 0.9$. Such a high efficiency
          is  hard to reconcile with most models, including in particular
          the popular internal-shocks model. We re-analyze the derivation
          of  the  kinetic  energy  from  the  afterglow  X-ray  flux and
          re-examine  the  resulting  estimates  of  the  efficiency.  We
          confirm  that,  if the flatt decay arises from energy injection
          and  the  pre-Swift  broad-band estimates of the kinetic energy
          are  correct, then $\epsilon_\gamma \gtrsim 0.9$. We point out,
          however,  that another interpretation of the flattish decay - a
          variable  X-ray  afterglow  efficiency  (e.g.,  due  to  a time
          dependence  of  afterglow  shock microphysical parameters) - is
          possible.  We  also  show  that direct estimates of the kinetic
          energy  from the late X-ray afterglow flux are sensitive to the
          assumed  values  of  the  shock  microphysical  parameters  and
          suggest    that    broad-band   afterglow   fits   might   have
          underestimated  the kinetic energy (e.g., by overestimating the
          fraction  of  electrons  that  are  accelerated to relativistic
          energies).  Either  one  of these possibilities implies a lower
          gamma-ray  efficiency, and their joint effect could conceivably
          reduce  the  estimate of the typical $\epsilon_\gamma$ to $\sim
          0.1-0.5$.

          We   present   the   first   MIR   spectrum   of  the  z=2.2856
          ultraluminous,  infrared  galaxy  FSC 10214+4724, obtained with
          the  Infrared Spectrograph onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope.
          The spectrum spans a rest wavelength range of 2.3-11.5 microns,
          covering  a  number  of  key diagnostic emission and absorption
          features. The most prominent feature in the IRS spectrum is the
          silicate  emission  at rest-frame 10 microns. We also detect an
          unresolved  emission  line at a rest wavelength of 7.65 microns
          which  we identify with [NeVI], and a slightly resolved feature
          at  5.6  microns  identified as a blend of [Mg VII] and [Mg V].
          There are no strong PAH emission features in the FSC 10214+4724
          spectrum.  We  place  a  limit  of 0.1 micron on the equivalent
          width  of  6.2  micron  PAH  emission  but see no evidence of a
          corresponding  7.7  micron  feature. Semi-empirical fits to the
          spectral   energy   distribution   suggest  about  45%  of  the
          bolometric  luminosity  arises from cold 50 K dust, half arises
          from  warm (190 K) dust, and the remainder, 5%, originates from
          hot  (640 K) dust. The hot dust is required to fit the blue end
          of  the steep MIR spectrum. The combination of a red continuum,
          strong  silicate  emission,  little  or no PAH emission, and no
          silicate  absorption,  makes  FSC  10214+4724 unlike most other
          ULIRGs  or  AGN  observed  thus  far with IRS. These apparently
          contradictory  properties  may  be explained by an AGN which is
          highly  magnified  by  the lens, masking a (dominant) overlying
          starburst with unusually weak PAH emission.

          We  discuss  the preliminary results of a survey of young (<300
          Myr),  close  (<50 pc) stars with the Simultaneous Differential
          Extrasolar  Planet  Imager (SDI) implemented at the VLT and the
          MMT.  SDI  uses  a  double Wollaston prism and a quad filter to
          take   4  identical  images  simultaneously  at  3  wavelengths
          surrounding  the 1.62 um methane bandhead found in the spectrum
          of cool brown dwarfs and gas giants. By performing a difference
          of  images in these filters, speckle noise from the primary can
          be  significantly attenuated, resulting in photon noise limited
          data.  In  our survey data, we achieved H band contrasts >25000
          (5  sigma Delta F1(1.575 um) > 10 mag, Delta H > 11.5 mag for a
          T6  spectral  type)  at  a  separation of 0.5" from the primary
          star.  With  this  degree  of attenuation, we should be able to
          image  (5  sigma  detection)  a 2-4 Jupiter mass planet at 5 AU
          around  a 30 Myr star at 10 pc. We are currently completing our
          survey  of  young,  nearby  stars.  We  have  obtained complete
          datasets  for 35 stars in the southern sky (VLT) and 7 stars in
          the  northern sky (MMT). We believe that our SDI images are the
          highest  contrast  astronomical images ever made from ground or
          space for methane rich companions.

          Sanders, to be published in the special issue of Pub. of PMO
          We  present  results  from two mid-infrared imaging programs of
          ultraluminous  infrared  galaxies  (ULIRGs)  and fine-structure
          elliptical  galaxies.  The  former  are  known to nearly all be
          recent  mergers between two gas-rich spiral galaxies, while the
          latter  are also believed to be even more aged merger remnants.
          An  examination  of  these  two  classes  of objects, which may
          represent   different   stages  of  the  same  putative  merger
          sequence,  should  reveal  similarities  in the distribution of
          their stellar populations and dust content consistent with that
          expected  for time-evolution of the merger. The data reveal for
          the  first  time  extended  dust  emission  in the ULIRG galaxy
          bodies  and  along  their  tidal features. However, contrary to
          expectation,   we   find   that   the   vast  majority  of  the
          fine-structure   elliptical   galaxies   lack  such  structured
          emission. This likely results from the optical selection of the
          elliptical  sample, resulting in a population that reflects the
          IR-activity (or lack thereof) of optically selected interacting
          galaxies. Alternately, this may reflect an evolutionary process
          in the distribution of the dust content of the galaxy bodies.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  report  on  two  ASCA  observations  of the high-mass X-ray
          binary   pulsar   OAO   1657-415.   A  short  observation  near
          mid-eclipse  caught the source in a low-intensity state, with a
          weak  continuum  and  iron  emission  dominated  by the 6.4-keV
          fluorescent  line. A later, longer observation found the source
          in  a  high-intensity  state and covered the uneclipsed through
          mid-eclipse   phases.   In   the   high-intensity   state,  the
          non-eclipse spectrum has an absorbed continuum component due to
          scattering  by  material near the pulsar and 80 per cent of the
          fluorescent  iron  emission comes from less than 19 lt-sec away
          from  the  pulsar.  We  find  a dust-scattered X-ray halo whose
          intensity  decays  through  the  eclipse.  We  use this halo to
          estimate the distance to the source as 7.1 +/- 1.3 kpc.

          In   order   to   determine   the   incidence   of  black  hole
          accretion-driven   nuclear  activity  in  nearby  galaxies,  as
          manifested  by  their  radio  emission,  we  have carried out a
          high-resolution   Multi-Element   Radio-Linked   Interferometer
          Network (MERLIN) survey of LINERs and composite LINER/H{\sc ii}
          galaxies  from  a  complete  magnitude-limited sample of bright
          nearby  galaxies  (Palomar sample) with unknown arcsecond-scale
          radio  properties. There are fifteen radio detections, of which
          three  are  new  subarcsecond-scale  radio core detections, all
          being  candidate  AGN.  The  detected  galaxies  supplement the
          already  known  low-luminosity  AGN -- low-luminosity Seyferts,
          LINERs and composite LINER/H{\sc ii} galaxies -- in the Palomar
          sample.  Combining  all  radio-detected  Seyferts,  LINERs  and
          composite  LINER/H{\sc ii} galaxies (LTS sources), we obtain an
          overall  radio  detection rate of 54% (22% of all bright nearby
          galaxies) and we estimate that at least $\sim$50% ($\sim$20% of
          all  bright  nearby galaxies) are true AGN. The radio powers of
          the  LTS  galaxies  allow  the  construction  of  a local radio
          luminosity  function. By comparing the luminosity function with
          those  of  selected  moderate-redshift  AGN,  selected from the
          2dF/NVSS  survey, we find that LTS sources naturally extend the
          RLF  of  powerful  AGN down to powers of about 10 times that of
          Sgr A*.

          Pulsars   steadily   dissipate   their  rotational  energy  via
          relativistic  winds.  Confinement  of  these outflows generates
          luminous  pulsar  wind nebulae, seen across the electromagnetic
          spectrum  in  synchrotron  and inverse Compton emission, and in
          optical  emission lines when they shock the surrounding medium.
          These  sources  act as important probes of relativistic shocks,
          particle  acceleration  and  of interstellar gas. We review the
          many  recent advances in the study of pulsar wind nebulae, with
          particular focus on the evolutionary stages through which these
          objects progress as they expand into their surroundings, and on
          morphological  structures  within  these nebulae which directly
          trace  the  physical  processes  of  particle  acceleration and
          outflow. We conclude by considering some exciting new probes of
          pulsar  wind  nebulae,  including  the  study  of TeV gamma-ray
          emission  from  these sources, and observations of pulsar winds
          in close binary systems.

          various  large  mm/submm telescopes/arrays such as the IRAM 30m

          constituents  of  the  intragroup  medium  (IGM), which in turn
          trigger  some  spectacular  activities  such  as a 40 kpc large

          The  central  question addressed is: do UV and infrared surveys

          star  formation of 2 different populations? We first review the
          literature  on  the  UV  and IR selected galaxy samples, try to
          quantify   the   difference  and  overlaps  between  these  two
          populations  of  star  forming  galaxies.  We then present some
          preliminary  results  of  a GALEX/SWIRE comparison study for IR
          and  UV  selected galaxies at z=0.6, in an attempt to constrain
          the  evolution  of  the dust attenuation and of stellar mass of

          Title: Heating Rate Profiles in Galaxy Clusters
          Authors:  Edward  C.D.  Pope,  Georgi  Pavlovski,  Christian R.
          Kaiser, Hans Fangohr
          Comments:  13  pages,  3  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          In  recent  years  evidence has accumulated suggesting that the
          gas   in   galaxy   clusters  is  heated  by  non-gravitational
          processes.  Here  we  calculate  the  heating rates required to
          maintain  a  physically  motived mass flow rate, in a sample of
          seven   galaxy  clusters.  We  employ  the  spectroscopic  mass
          deposition   rates   as   an  observational  input  along  with
          temperature  and  density  data  for each cluster. On energetic
          grounds  we  find  that  thermal  conduction  could provide the
          necessary  heating for A2199, Perseus, A1795 and A478. However,
          the  suppression  factor,  of  the clasical Spitzer value, is a
          different  function  of  radius  for each cluster. Based on the
          observations  of  plasma  bubbles  we  also  calculate the duty
          cycles  for  each  AGN,  in  the absence of thermal conduction,
          which can provide the required energy input. With the exception
          of Hydra-A it appears that each of the other AGNs in our sample
          require  duty  cycles of roughly $10^{6}-10^{7}$ yrs to provide
          their  steady-state  heating requirements. If these duty cycles
          are  unrealistic, this may imply that many galaxy clusters must
          be  heated  by  very  powerful Hydra-A type events interspersed
          between  more frequent smaller-scale outbursts. The suppression
          factors  for  the  thermal  conductivity  required for combined
          heating by AGN and thermal conduction are generally acceptable.
          However,  these suppression factors still require `fine-tuning`
          of  the  thermal  conductivity  as  a  function of radius. As a
          consequence  of  this  work  we present the AGN duty cycle as a
          cooling flow diagnostic.

          We find the primary component of this binary, FO 15, to have an
          approximate spectral type O5.5Vz, i.e. a Zero-Age-Main-Sequence
          star.  The  secondary  appears to be of spectral type O9.5V. We
          have  performed  a  numerical  model  fit  to  the  public ASAS
          photometry, which shows that FO 15 is also an eclipsing binary.
          We find an orbital inclination of ~ 80 deg. From a simultaneous
          light-curve and radial velocity solution we find the masses and
          radii  of  the two components to be 30 +/- 1 and 16 +/- 1 solar
          masses  and  7.5  +/-  0.5  and  5.3 +/- 0.5 solar radii. These
          radii,  and hence also the luminosities, are smaller than those
          of  normal  O-type  stars,  but  similar  to recently born ZAMS
          O-type stars. The absolute magnitudes derived from our analysis
          locate  FO 15 at the same distance as Eta Carinae. From Chandra
          and  XMM  X-ray  images  we  also find that there are two close
          X-ray  sources,  one  coincident  with  FO  15  and another one
          without  optical  counterpart. This latter seems to be a highly
          variable  source, presumably due to a pre-main-sequence stellar
          neighbour of FO 15.

          Title:  The flat synchrotron spectra of partially self-absorbed
          jets revisited
          Authors: Christian R. Kaiser (University of Southampton)
          Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          Flat  radio  spectra  with large brightness temperatures at the
          core  of  AGN and X-ray binaries are usually interpreted as the
          partially self-absorbed bases of jet flows emitting synchrotron
          radiation.  Here  we extend previous models of jets propagating
          at  large  angles  to  our  line  of sight to self-consistently
          include  the  effects  of  energy  losses  of  the relativistic
          electrons  due  to  the  synchrotron  process  itself  and  the
          adiabatic  expansion of the jet flow. We also take into account
          energy  gains  through  self-absorption.  Two model classes are
          presented.  The  ballistic  jet  flows,  with  the jet material
          travelling  along  straight  trajectories,  and adiabatic jets.
          Despite  the  energy  losses, both scenarios can result in flat
          emission   spectra,  however,  the  adiabatic  jets  require  a
          specific  geometry. No re-acceleration process along the jet is
          needed  for the electrons. We apply the models to observational
          data  of  the  X-ray binary Cygnus X-1. Both models can be made
          consistent  with  the observations. The resulting ballistic jet
          is  extremely  narrow  with a jet opening angle of only 5". Its
          energy  transport  rate  is small compared to the time-averaged
          jet  power and therefore suggests the presence of non-radiating
          protons  in  the  jet flow. The adiabatic jets require a strong
          departure  from energy equipartition between the magnetic field
          and  the  relativistic electrons. These models also imply a jet
          power  two  orders  of  magnitude  higher  than  the  Eddington
          limiting  luminosity  of a 10 solar mass black hole. The models
          put  strong  constraints  on the physical conditions in the jet
          flows on scales well below achievable resolution limits.

          Title: XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the ultra-compact
          binary RX J1914+24
          Authors:  Gavin Ramsay (1), Mark Cropper (1), Pasi Hakala (2,3)
          ((1) MSSL/UCL, (2) Univ Helsinki, (3) Tuorla Observatory)
          Comments: Accepted MNRAS Letters
          The nature of the X-ray source RX J1914+24 has been the subject
          of  much  debate.  It  shows  a  prominent period of 569 sec in
          X-rays  and the optical/infra-red: in most models this has been
          interpreted  as  the  binary  orbital  period.  We  present our
          analysis  of  new XMM-Newton and Chandra data. We find a longer
          term  trend in the XMM-Newton data and power at 556 and 585 sec
          in  5  sets  of data. It is not clear if they are produced as a
          result  of a beat between a longer intrinsic period and the 569
          sec  modulation  or  if  they are due to secular variations. We
          obtain  a  good  fit  to  the  XMM-Newton  spectrum  with a low
          temperature  thermal plasma model with an edge at 0.83keV. This
          model  implies  an  unabsorbed  bolometric  X-ray luminosity of
          1x10^{33} ergs/s (for a distance of 1kpc) - this is 2 orders of
          magnitude  lower  than  our  previous estimate (derived using a
          different  model).  If  the  distance  is  much  less,  as  the
          absorption derived from the X-ray fits suggest, then it is even
          lower at \~3x10^{31} ergs/s.

          Title:  From Canonical to Enhanced Extra Mixing in Low-Mass Red
          Giants: Tidally Locked Binaries
          Authors: Pavel Denissenkov (1, 2 and 3), Brian Chaboyer (1), Ke
          Li  (1)  ((1) Dartmouth College, (2) The Ohio State University,
          (3) St. Petersburg State University)
          Comments: 47 pages, 19 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          Stellar  models  which  incorporate  simple  diffusion or shear
          induced  mixing  are used to describe canonical extra mixing in
          low  mass red giants of low and solar metallicity. These models
          are  able  to  simultaneously  explain  the  observed Li and CN
          abundance  changes  along upper red giant branch (RGB) in field
          low-metallicity stars and match photometry, rotation and carbon
          isotopic  ratios  for  stars  in  the old open cluster M67. The
          shear mixing model requires that main sequence (MS) progenitors
          of  upper  RGB stars possessed rapidly rotating radiative cores
          and  that  specific  angular  momentum was conserved in each of
          their  mass  shells  during  their  evolution.  We surmise that
          solar-type  stars will not experience canonical extra mixing on
          the  RGB  because their more efficient MS spin-down resulted in
          solid-body rotation, as revealed by helioseismological data for
          the  Sun.  Thus, RGB stars in the old, high metallicity cluster
          NGC  6791  should  show  no evidence for mixing in their carbon
          isotopic ratios.
          We  develop  the  idea  that  canonical extra mixing in a giant
          component  of  a  binary system may be switched to its enhanced
          mode with much faster and somewhat deeper mixing as a result of
          the   giant's   tidal   spin-up.   This  scenario  can  explain
          photometric  and  composition peculiarities of RS CVn binaries.
          The  tidally enforced enhanced extra mixing might contribute to
          the  star-to-star  abundance  variations  of  O,  Na  and Al in
          globular clusters. This idea may be tested with observations of
          carbon isotopic ratios and CN abundances in RS CVn binaries.

          Title:  Explosive  Nucleosynthesis  in  GRB Jets Accompanied by
          Hypernovae
          Authors: Shigehiro Nagataki, Akira Mizuta, Katsuhiko Sato
          Comments: 28 pages with 14 figures. Submitted to ApJ
          Two-dimensional   hydrodynamic  simulations  are  performed  to
          investigate  explosive nucleosynthesis in a collapsar using the
          model of MacFadyen and Woosley (1999). It is shown that 56Ni is
          not  produced  in  the  jet  of  the  collapsar sufficiently to
          explain the observed amount of a hypernova when the duration of
          the  explosion  is  \sim  10 sec, which is considered to be the
          typical  timescale  of  explosion  in the collapsar model. Even
          though  considerable  amount  of  56Ni  is  synthesized  if all
          explosion  energy is deposited initially, the opening angles of
          the  jets  become  too  wide  to  realize  highly  relativistic
          outflows  and  gamma-ray  bursts  in  such  a  case. From these
          results,  it is concluded that the origin of 56Ni in hypernovae
          associated  with  GRBs  is not the explosive nucleosynthesis in
          the  jet.  We  consider  that  the  idea that the origin is the
          explosive   nucleosynthesis  in  the  accretion  disk  is  more
          promising.  We  also  show  that the explosion becomes bi-polar
          naturally  due  to  the effect of the deformed progenitor. This
          fact  suggests  that the 56Ni synthesized in the accretion disk
          and  conveyed as outflows are blown along to the rotation axis,
          which  will  explain  the line features of SN 1998bw and double
          peaked  line  features  of  SN  2003jd.  Some  fraction  of the
          gamma-ray lines from 56Ni decays in the jet will appear without
          losing  their  energies  because the jet becomes optically thin
          before considerable amount of 56Ni decays as long as the jet is
          a  relativistic flow, which may be observed as relativistically
          Lorentz  boosted  line  profiles  in  the  future. We show that
          abundance  of  nuclei  whose  mass number \sim 40 in the ejecta
          depends  sensitively  on the energy deposition rate, which is a
          result  of  active  incomplete  silicon  burning and alpha-rich
          freezeout.

          Title: Speed of Sound in the Mass Varying Neutrinos Scenario
          Authors: Ryo Takahashi, Morimitsu Tanimoto
          Comments: 17 pages, no figure
          We discuss about the speed of sound squared in the Mass Varying
          Neutrinos  scenario  (MaVaNs). Recently, it was argued that the
          MaVaNs has a catastrophic instability which is the emergence of
          an  imaginary  speed  of sound at the non-relativistic limit of
          neutrinos.   As   the   result   of   this   instability,   the
          neutrino-acceleron   fluid  cannot  act  as  the  dark  energy.
          However,  it  is  found  that the speed of sound squared in the
          neutrino-acceleron  fluid  could  be  positive in our model. We
          examine  the  speed  of  sound  in  two  cases  of  the  scalar
          potential.  One is the small fractional power-law potential and
          another  is  the logarithmic one. The power-law potential model
          with the right-handed neutrinos gives a stable one.

          warped accretion discs
          Authors: Stephen B. Foulkes, Carole A. Haswell, James R. Murray
          Comments:  12 pages, 12 figures, paper accepted for publication
          by MNRAS
          We  present  three  dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics
          (SPH)  calculations  of  warped accretion discs in X-ray binary
          systems.  Geometrically  thin,  optically thick accretion discs
          are   illuminated   by   a   central   radiation  source.  This
          illumination  exerts  a  non-axisymmetric radiation pressure on
          the  surface of the disc resulting in a torque that acts on the
          disc  to  induce  a  twist  or warp. Initially planar discs are
          unstable  to  warping  driven  by  the  radiation torque and in
          general  the  warps  also  precess  in  a  retrograde direction
          relative  to  the  orbital  flow. We simulate a number of X-ray
          binary  systems which have different mass ratios using a number
          of  different  luminosities  for each. Radiation-driven warping
          occurs  for  all  systems  simulated. For mass ratios q ~ 0.1 a
          moderate  warp  occurs  in  the inner disc while the outer disc
          remains  in  the  orbital  plane  (c.f.  X  1916-053). For less
          extreme  mass  ratios  the entire disc tilts out of the orbital
          plane  (c.f.  Her  X-1).  For  discs that are tilted out of the
          orbital  plane  in which the outer edge material of the disc is
          precessing  in a prograde direction we obtain both positive and
          negative  superhumps  simultaneously  in  the dissipation light
          curve (c.f. V603 Aql).

          Title: Eclipsing binaries in extrasolar planet transit surveys:
          the case of SuperWASP
          Authors: B. Willems, U. Kolb, S. Justham
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Using  a  comprehensive  binary population synthesis scheme, we
          investigate the statistical properties of a sample of eclipsing
          binaries  that  is detectable by an idealised extrasolar planet
          transit  survey with specifications broadly similar to those of
          the  SuperWASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets) project. In this
          idealised survey the total number of detectable single stars in
          the  Galactic  disc  is of the order of 10^6-10^7, while, for a
          flat  initial  mass  ratio  distribution,  the  total number of
          detectable eclipsing binaries is of the order of 10^4-10^5. The
          majority  of  the population of detectable single stars is made
          up of main-sequence stars (60%), horizontal-branch stars (20%),
          and  giant-branch stars (10%). The largest contributions to the
          population  of detectable eclipsing binaries stem from detached
          double main-sequence star binaries (60%), detached giant-branch
          main-sequence     star    binaries    (20%),    and    detached
          horizontal-branch  main-sequence star binaries (10%). The ratio
          of  the  number  of  eclipsing binaries to the number of single
          stars  detectable  by  the idealised SuperWASP survey varies by
          less  than  a  factor of 2.5 across the sky, and decreases with
          increasing  Galactic latitude. It is found to be largest in the
          direction  of the Galactic longitude l=-7.5deg and the Galactic
          latitude b=-22.5deg. We also show that the fractions of systems
          in  different  subgroups of eclipsing binaries are sensitive to
          the  adopted  initial  mass ratio distribution, which is one of
          the  poorest constrained input parameters in present-day binary
          population  synthesis  calculations.  This  suggests  that once
          statistically  meaningful  results  from  transit  surveys  are
          available,  they  will  be  able  to  significantly improve the
          predictive power of population synthesis studies of interacting
          binaries and related objects. (abridged)

          Title: SZE Signals in Cluster Models
          Authors: Beth A. Reid, David N. Spergel
          Comments: 34 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ
          The  upcoming  generation  of SZE surveys will shed fresh light
          onto  the  study  of clusters. What will this new observational
          window  reveal about cluster properties? What can we learn from
          combining   X-ray,   SZE,  and  optical  observations?  How  do
          variations   in   the   gas   entropy   profile,   dark  matter
          concentration,  accretion  pressure,  and bound baryon fraction
          affect  SZE  observables? We investigate the signature of these
          important  cluster  parameters  with  an  analytic model of the
          intracluster  medium  (ICM). Given the current uncertainties in
          ICM  physics,  our  approach  is to span the range of plausible
          models   motivated   by   observations   and  a  small  set  of
          assumptions.  We  find  a  tight  relation  between the central
          Compton  parameter and the X-ray luminosity outside the cluster
          core,   suggesting   that  these  observables  carry  the  same
          information   about  the  ICM.  The  total  SZE  luminosity  is
          proportional  to  the  thermal  energy  of  the  gas,  and is a
          surprisingly  robust indicator of cluster mass: $L_{SZ} \propto
          f_{b}  M^{5/3}$. We show that a combination of $L_{SZ}$ and the
          half-luminosity  radius  $r_{SZ}$  provides  a  measure  of the
          potential energy of the cluster gas, and thus we can deduce the
          total  energy  content  of  the  bound ICM. We caution that any
          systematic  variation  of  the baryon fraction will distort the
          expected  $L_{SZ}  -  M$  calibration  to  be used to study the
          evolution of cluster number density.

          We present XMM-Newton observations of a complete sample of five
          archetypal  young  radio-loud  AGN, also known Gigahertz Peaked
          Spectrum  (GPS)  sources. They are among the brightest and best
          studied  GPS/CSO  sources  in the sky, with radio powers in the
          range  L_{5GHz}=10^{43-44}  erg/s  and  with  4  sources having
          measured  kinematic  ages  of  570 to 3000 yrs. All sources are
          detected,   and   have   2-10  keV  luminosities  from  0.5  to
          4.8x10^{44} erg/s. In comparison with the general population of
          radio galaxies, we find that: 1) GPS galaxies show a a range in
          absorption column densities similar to other radio galaxies. We
          therefore   find  no  evidence  that  GPS  galaxies  reside  in
          significantly  more  dense circumnuclear environment, such that
          they  could  be  hampered  in  their expansion. 2) The ratio of
          radio  to  X-ray  luminosity  is  significantly higher than for
          classical  radio  sources. This is consistent with an evolution
          scenario  in which young radio sources are more efficient radio
          emitters  than  large  extended objects at a constant accretion
          power.  3)  Taking  the  X-ray luminosity of radio sources as a
          measure  of  ionisation  power,  we  find that GPS galaxies are
          significantly  underluminous  in  their [OIII]_{5007 Angstrom},
          including  a  weak  trend with age. This is consistent with the
          fact  that  the  Stroemgren sphere should still be expanding in
          these   young  objects.  This  would  mean  that  here  we  are
          witnessing  the  birth  of the narrow line region of radio-loud
          AGN.

          Journal
          The  accretion  of ~ 0.1 -- 1 M_o of material by a neutron star
          through  Roche  lobe  overflow  of  its  companion  or  through
          white-dwarf/neutron-star  coalescence  in  a  low  mass  binary
          system could be enough to exceed the critical mass of a neutron
          star  and  trigger its collapse to a black hole, leading to the
          production  of  a  short gamma-ray burst (SGRB). In this model,
          SGRBs  would  often  be  found  in  early-type  galaxies  or in
          globular cluster environments, though they could also be formed
          through  stellar-wind  accretion in high-mass binary systems of
          star-forming galaxies. Although the collapse event is likely to
          be  of  short  (<< 1 s) duration, afterglow complexity could be
          produced  by  neutron decoupling in the fireball and subsequent
          accretion  of the companion remnant, for example, the disrupted
          white-dwarf core.

          Title: Radiative Flow in a Luminous Disk II
          Authors: Jun Fukue
          Comments:  6 pages, 4 figures; to be appeared in PASJ 58 (2006)
          No 1
          Radiatively-driven  transfer  flow  perpendicular to a luminous
          disk  is  examined  in the subrelativistic regime of $(v/c)^1$,
          taking into account the gravity of the central object. The flow
          is  assumed  to  be  vertical, and the gas pressure is ignored,
          while internal heating is assumed to be proportional to the gas
          density.  The  basic  equations  were  numerically  solved as a
          function  of  the  optical  depth,  and  the flow velocity, the
          height,  the  radiative  flux,  and the radiation pressure were
          obtained  for  a  given  radius,  an initial optical depth, and
          initial  conditions at the flow base (disk ``inside''), whereas
          the  mass-loss  rate  was  determined  as  an eigenvalue of the
          boundary  condition  at  the  flow  top (disk ``surface''). For
          sufficiently  luminous  cases,  the  flow  resembles  the  case
          without  gravity.  For  less-luminous  cases, however, the flow
          velocity decreases, and the flow would be impossible due to the
          existence  of  gravity  in  the case that the radiative flux is
          sufficiently  small.  Application  to a supercritical accretion
          disk with mass loss is briefly discussed.

          Title: Quantifying the Luminosity Evolution in Gamma-ray Bursts
          Authors: Daniel Kocevski, Edison Liang
          We  estimate  the  luminosity  evolution and formation rate for
          over  900 GRBs by using redshift and luminosity data calculated
          by  Band,  Norris,  $&$  Bonnell  (2004) via the lag-luminosity
          correlation.  By applying maximum likelihood techniques, we are
          able   to  infer  the  true  distribution  of  the  parent  GRB
          population's luminosity function and density distributions in a
          way  that accounts for detector selection effects. We find that
          after  accounting  for  data  truncation,  there still exists a
          significant  correlation  between  the  average  luminosity and
          redshift,  indicating  that  distant  GRBs  are on average more
          luminous  than  nearby  counterparts.  This  is consistent with
          previous  studies  showing  strong  source  evolution  and also
          recent  observations  of under luminous nearby GRBs. We find no
          evidence  for  beaming angle evolution in the current sample of
          GRBs  with  known  redshift,  suggesting  that this increase in
          luminosity can not be due to an evolution of the collimation of
          gamma-ray  emission.  The resulting luminosity function is well
          fit  with  a  single  power  law of index $L'^{-1.5}$, which is
          intermediate  between the values predicted by the power-law and
          Gaussian  structured  jet  models.  We  also  find that the GRB
          comoving  rate  density rises steeply with a broad peak between
          $1<z<2$  followed  by  a steady decline above $z> 3$. This rate
          density  qualitatively  matches  the  current  estimates of the
          cosmic star formation rate, favoring a short lived massive star
          progenitor  model, or a binary model with a short delay between
          the formation of the compact object and the eventual merger.

          Title:  Inflation  and accelerated expansion TeVeS cosmological
          solutions
          Authors: Luz Maria Diaz-Rivera, Lado Samushia, Bharat Ratra
          We find exact exponentially expanding and contracting de Sitter
          solutions  of  the  spatially  homogeneous  TeVeS  cosmological
          equations  of motion, in both the vacuum TeVeS model and in the
          presence  of  an  additional ideal fluid with equation of state
          parameter $\omega < -1$. A preliminary stability analysis shows
          that  the  expanding  vacuum  solution  is stable, while in the
          ideal  fluid  case stability depends on model parameter values.
          These   solutions  might  provide  a  basis  for  incorporating
          early-time  inflation  or  late-time  accelerated  expansion in
          TeVeS cosmology.

          Holes
          Authors:   Wen-xin   Chen,   Andrei  M.  Beloborodov  (Columbia

          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures; to be published in AIP Conference
          Proceedings "Gamma Ray Bursts in the Swift Era," Nov. 29 - Dec.
          2, 2005, Washington, DC
          We  calculate the structure of accretion disk around a spinning
          black  hole for accretion rates 0.01 - 10 M_sun/s. The model is
          fully  relativistic and treats accurately the disk microphysics
          including  neutrino  emissivity,  opacity, electron degeneracy,
          and nuclear composition. We find that the accretion flow always
          regulates   itself  to  a  mildly  degenerate  state  with  the
          proton-to-nucleon   ratio   Y_e   ~   0.1   and   becomes  very
          neutron-rich.  The  disk  has  a well defined "ignition" radius
          where   neutrino  flux  raises  dramatically,  cooling  becomes
          efficient,  and  Y_e  suddenly  drops.  We also calculate other
          characteristic radii of the disk, including the neutrino-opaque
          and  neutrino-trapping  radii, and show their dependence on the
          accretion  rate.  Accretion  disks  around  fast-rotating black
          holes  produce intense neutrino fluxes which may deposit enough
          energy above the disk to generate a GRB jet.

          We  present results from the analysis of the optical spectra of
          47 radio-selected narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). These
          objects  are  a subset of the First Bright Quasar Survey (FBQS)
          and  were  initially  detected  at 20 cm (flux density limit ~1
          mJy)  in the VLA FIRST Survey. We run Spearman rank correlation
          tests  on  several sets of parameters and conclude that, except
          for their radio properties, radio-selected NLS1 galaxies do not
          exhibit significant differences from traditional NLS1 galaxies.
          Our  results  are  also  in  agreement  with  previous  studies
          suggesting that NLS1 galaxies have small black hole masses that
          are  accreting  very close to the Eddington rate. We have found
          16  new radio-loud NLS1 galaxies, which increases the number of
          known radio-loud NLS1 galaxies by a factor of ~5.

          We  present  the  first  mid-IR  long  baseline interferometric
          observations of the circumstellar matter around binary post-AGB
          stars.  Two  objects,  SX Cen and HD 52961, were observed using
          the  VLTI/MIDI  instrument  during  Science Demonstration Time.
          Both objects are known binaries for which a stable circumbinary
          disc  is  proposed  to explain the SED characteristics. This is
          corroborated  by  our  N-band  spectrum showing a crystallinity
          fraction  of  more  than  50  % for both objects, pointing to a
          stable   environment   where   dust   processing   can   occur.
          Surprisingly,  the  dust  surrounding SX Cen is not resolved in
          the interferometric observations providing an upper limit of 11
          mas  (or  18 AU at the distance of this object) on the diameter
          of  the dust emission. This confirms the very compact nature of
          its  circumstellar  environment.  The  dust  emission around HD
          52961  originates  from  a  very  small  but  resolved  region,
          estimated to be ~ 35 mas at 8 micron and ~ 55 mas at 13 micron.
          These  results  confirm  the  disc interpretation of the SED of
          both  stars.  In  HD  52961, the dust is not homogeneous in its
          chemical composition: the crystallinity is clearly concentrated
          in  the  hotter  inner  region. Whether this is a result of the
          formation  process  of the disc, or due to annealing during the
          long storage time in the disc is not clear.

          jets

          Institute for Astrophysics)
          Comments: 13 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          The  role  of  kink  instability in magnetically driven jets is
          explored  through numerical one-dimensional steady relativistic
          MHD  calculations. The instability is shown to have enough time
          to  grow  and influence the dynamics of Poynting-flux dominated
          jets.  In  the  case of AGN jets, the flow becomes kinetic flux
          dominated  at  distances  larger  than ~1000 r_g because of the
          rapid  dissipation  of  Poynting  flux.  When  applied  to  GRB
          outflows,  the model predicts more gradual Poynting dissipation
          and  moderately  magnetized  flow  at  distances of ~10^{16} cm
          where  the  deceleration  of  the ejecta due to its interaction
          with  the  external  medium is expected. The energy released by
          the  instability can power the compact ``blazar zone'' emission
          and  the  prompt  emission  of GRB outflows with high radiative
          efficiencies.

          Comments: Accepted in A&A
          We  present  results  from  Chandra  observations of the 3C/FRI
          sample   of   low  luminosity  radio-galaxies.  We  detected  a
          power-law  nuclear  component  in 12 objects out of the 18 with
          available  data.  In  4  galaxies  we  detected  nuclear  X-ray
          absorption  at  a  level  of  about N_H= (0.2-6)e22 cm-2. X-ray
          absorbed  sources  are  associated  with the presence of highly
          inclined  dusty  disks  (or  dust  filaments projected onto the
          nuclei)  seen in the HST images. This suggests the existence of
          a  flattened  X-ray  absorber,  but of much lower optical depth
          than in classical obscuring tori. We thus have an un-obstructed
          view  toward  most  FR~I  nuclei  while absorption plays only a
          marginal  role  in  the  remaining  objects.  Three  pieces  of
          evidence  support  an  interpretation  for a jet origin for the
          X-ray cores: i) the presence of strong correlations between the
          nuclear  luminosities  in  the  radio, optical and X-ray bands,
          extending  over  4  orders of magnitude and with a much smaller
          dispersion  (about  0.3  dex)  when  compared to similar trends
          found  for  other  classes of AGNs, pointing to a common origin
          for  the  emission in the three bands; ii) the close similarity
          of the broad-band spectral indices with the sub-class of BL Lac
          objects sharing the same range of extended radio-luminosity, in
          accord with the FRI/BL Lacs unified model; iii) the presence of
          a  common  luminosity evolution of spectral indices in both FRI
          and  BL  Lacs.  The  low  luminosities  of  the  X-ray  nuclei,
          regardless  of  their origin, strengthens the interpretation of
          low efficiency accretion in low luminosity radio-galaxies.

          As  part of our radial velocity survey of low Galactic latitude
          structures  that  surround  the  Galactic  disc,  we report the
          detection  of the so called Monoceros Ring in the foreground of
          the Carina dwarf galaxy at Galactic coordinates (l,b)=(260,-22)
          based  on  VLT/FLAMES observations of the dwarf galaxy. At this
          location,   20  degrees  in  longitude  greater  than  previous
          detections, the Ring has a mean radial velocity of 145+/-5 km/s
          and  a  velocity  dispersion  of  only  17+/-5  km/s.  Based on
          Keck/DEIMOS observations, we also determine that the Ring has a
          mean  radial  velocity of -75+/-4 km/s in the foreground of the
          Andromeda  galaxy  at (l,b)\sim(122,-22), along with a velocity
          dispersion  of  26+/-3 km/s. These two kinematic detections are
          both  highly  compatible  with  known  characteristics  of  the
          structure  and,  along  with previous detections provide radial
          velocity  values  of  the  Ring  over the 120<l<260 range. This
          should  add  strong  constraints  on  numerical  models  of the
          accretion  of  the  dwarf  galaxy  that  is  believed to be the
          progenitor of the Ring.

          Comments: 30 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in AJ
          We  have used a proper combination of multiband high-resolution
          {\it  HST-WFPC2}  and  wide-field  ground based observations to
          image  the  galactic  globular  cluster  NGC  6266  (M62).  The
          extensive  photometric  data  set  allows  us  to determine the
          center  of  gravity  and  to construct the most extended radial
          profile  ever  published  for  this  cluster including, for the
          first  time, detailed star counts in the very inner region. The
          star  density  profile  is  well  reproduced by a standard King
          model with an extended core ($\sim 19''$) and a modest value of
          the  concentration  parameter  ($c=1.5$),  indicating  that the
          cluster has not-yet experienced core collapse.
          The  millisecond  pulsar  population  (whose members are all in
          binary systems) and the X-ray emitting population (more than 50
          sources  within  the cluster half mass radius) suggest that NGC
          6266  is in a dynamical phase particularly active in generating
          binaries  through  dynamical encounters. UV observations of the
          central  region  have been used to probe the population of blue
          straggler  stars,  whose  origin  might  be  also  affected  by
          dynamical  interactions.  The  comparison  with  other globular
          clusters  observed  with a similar strategy shows that the blue
          straggler  content  in  NGC  6266 is relatively low, suggesting
          that the formation channel that produces binary systems hosting
          neutron stars or white dwarfs is not effective in significantly
          increasing   the   blue   straggler  population.  Moreover,  an
          anticorrelation  between  millisecond  pulsar  content and blue
          straggler specific frequency in globular cluster seems emerging
          with increasing evidence.

          waveforms  of  the  dominant l=2,3 modes. The power spectrum of
          these  modes  yields  insight on how the mass ratio in a binary
          impacts  the  degree of complexity of the emitted waveforms. In

          angular  momentum  radiated  as  well  as  kick velocities from

          MNRAS
          We present XMM-Newton observations of a complete sample of five
          archetypal  young  radio-loud  AGN, also known Gigahertz Peaked
          Spectrum  (GPS)  sources. They are among the brightest and best
          studied  GPS/CSO  sources  in the sky, with radio powers in the
          range  L_{5GHz}=10^{43-44}  erg/s  and  with  4  sources having
          measured  kinematic  ages  of  570 to 3000 yrs. All sources are
          detected,   and   have   2-10  keV  luminosities  from  0.5  to
          4.8x10^{44} erg/s. In comparison with the general population of
          radio galaxies, we find that: 1) GPS galaxies show a a range in
          absorption column densities similar to other radio galaxies. We
          therefore   find  no  evidence  that  GPS  galaxies  reside  in
          significantly  more  dense circumnuclear environment, such that
          they  could  be  hampered  in  their expansion. 2) The ratio of
          radio  to  X-ray  luminosity  is  significantly higher than for
          classical  radio  sources. This is consistent with an evolution
          scenario  in which young radio sources are more efficient radio
          emitters  than  large  extended objects at a constant accretion
          power.  3)  Taking  the  X-ray luminosity of radio sources as a
          measure  of  ionisation  power,  we  find that GPS galaxies are
          significantly  underluminous  in  their [OIII]_{5007 Angstrom},
          including  a  weak  trend with age. This is consistent with the
          fact  that  the  Stroemgren sphere should still be expanding in
          these   young  objects.  This  would  mean  that  here  we  are
          witnessing  the  birth  of the narrow line region of radio-loud
          AGN.

          Title:  Collapse  of  Neutron  Stars  to  Black Holes in Binary
          Systems: A Model for Short Gamma Ray Bursts
          Authors:  Charles D. Dermer (1), Armen Atoyan (2) ((1) NRL, (2)

          Comments:  9  pages, submitted as a letter to the Astrophysical
          Journal
          The  accretion  of ~ 0.1 -- 1 M_o of material by a neutron star
          through  Roche  lobe  overflow  of  its  companion  or  through
          white-dwarf/neutron-star  coalescence  in  a  low  mass  binary
          system could be enough to exceed the critical mass of a neutron
          star  and  trigger its collapse to a black hole, leading to the
          production  of  a  short gamma-ray burst (SGRB). In this model,
          SGRBs  would  often  be  found  in  early-type  galaxies  or in
          globular cluster environments, though they could also be formed
          through  stellar-wind  accretion in high-mass binary systems of
          star-forming galaxies. Although the collapse event is likely to
          be  of  short  (<< 1 s) duration, afterglow complexity could be
          produced  by  neutron decoupling in the fireball and subsequent
          accretion  of the companion remnant, for example, the disrupted
          white-dwarf core.

          Title: Radiative Flow in a Luminous Disk II
          Authors: Jun Fukue
          Comments:  6 pages, 4 figures; to be appeared in PASJ 58 (2006)
          No 1
          Radiatively-driven  transfer  flow  perpendicular to a luminous
          disk  is  examined  in the subrelativistic regime of $(v/c)^1$,
          taking into account the gravity of the central object. The flow
          is  assumed  to  be  vertical, and the gas pressure is ignored,
          while internal heating is assumed to be proportional to the gas
          density.  The  basic  equations  were  numerically  solved as a
          function  of  the  optical  depth,  and  the flow velocity, the
          height,  the  radiative  flux,  and the radiation pressure were
          obtained  for  a  given  radius,  an initial optical depth, and
          initial  conditions at the flow base (disk ``inside''), whereas
          the  mass-loss  rate  was  determined  as  an eigenvalue of the
          boundary  condition  at  the  flow  top (disk ``surface''). For
          sufficiently  luminous  cases,  the  flow  resembles  the  case
          without  gravity.  For  less-luminous  cases, however, the flow
          velocity decreases, and the flow would be impossible due to the
          existence  of  gravity  in  the case that the radiative flux is
          sufficiently  small.  Application  to a supercritical accretion
          disk with mass loss is briefly discussed.

          Title: Quantifying the Luminosity Evolution in Gamma-ray Bursts
          Authors: Daniel Kocevski, Edison Liang
          We  estimate  the  luminosity  evolution and formation rate for
          over  900 GRBs by using redshift and luminosity data calculated
          by  Band,  Norris,  $&$  Bonnell  (2004) via the lag-luminosity
          correlation.  By applying maximum likelihood techniques, we are
          able   to  infer  the  true  distribution  of  the  parent  GRB
          population's luminosity function and density distributions in a
          way  that accounts for detector selection effects. We find that
          after  accounting  for  data  truncation,  there still exists a
          significant  correlation  between  the  average  luminosity and
          redshift,  indicating  that  distant  GRBs  are on average more
          luminous  than  nearby  counterparts.  This  is consistent with
          previous  studies  showing  strong  source  evolution  and also
          recent  observations  of under luminous nearby GRBs. We find no
          evidence  for  beaming angle evolution in the current sample of
          GRBs  with  known  redshift,  suggesting  that this increase in
          luminosity can not be due to an evolution of the collimation of
          gamma-ray  emission.  The resulting luminosity function is well
          fit  with  a  single  power  law of index $L'^{-1.5}$, which is
          intermediate  between the values predicted by the power-law and
          Gaussian  structured  jet  models.  We  also  find that the GRB
          comoving  rate  density rises steeply with a broad peak between
          $1<z<2$  followed  by  a steady decline above $z> 3$. This rate
          density  qualitatively  matches  the  current  estimates of the
          cosmic star formation rate, favoring a short lived massive star
          progenitor  model, or a binary model with a short delay between
          the formation of the compact object and the eventual merger.

          Title:  Inflation  and accelerated expansion TeVeS cosmological
          solutions
          Authors: Luz Maria Diaz-Rivera, Lado Samushia, Bharat Ratra
          We find exact exponentially expanding and contracting de Sitter
          solutions  of  the  spatially  homogeneous  TeVeS  cosmological
          equations  of motion, in both the vacuum TeVeS model and in the
          presence  of  an  additional ideal fluid with equation of state
          parameter $\omega < -1$. A preliminary stability analysis shows
          that  the  expanding  vacuum  solution  is stable, while in the
          ideal  fluid  case stability depends on model parameter values.
          These   solutions  might  provide  a  basis  for  incorporating
          early-time  inflation  or  late-time  accelerated  expansion in
          TeVeS cosmology.

          Proceedings "Gamma Ray Bursts in the Swift Era," Nov. 29 - Dec.
          2, 2005, Washington, DC
          We  calculate the structure of accretion disk around a spinning
          black  hole for accretion rates 0.01 - 10 M_sun/s. The model is
          fully  relativistic and treats accurately the disk microphysics
          including  neutrino  emissivity,  opacity, electron degeneracy,
          and nuclear composition. We find that the accretion flow always
          regulates   itself  to  a  mildly  degenerate  state  with  the
          proton-to-nucleon   ratio   Y_e   ~   0.1   and   becomes  very
          neutron-rich.  The  disk  has  a well defined "ignition" radius
          where   neutrino  flux  raises  dramatically,  cooling  becomes
          efficient,  and  Y_e  suddenly  drops.  We also calculate other
          characteristic radii of the disk, including the neutrino-opaque
          and  neutrino-trapping  radii, and show their dependence on the
          accretion  rate.  Accretion  disks  around  fast-rotating black
          holes  produce intense neutrino fluxes which may deposit enough
          energy above the disk to generate a GRB jet.

          We  present results from the analysis of the optical spectra of
          47 radio-selected narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). These
          objects  are  a subset of the First Bright Quasar Survey (FBQS)
          and  were  initially  detected  at 20 cm (flux density limit ~1
          mJy)  in the VLA FIRST Survey. We run Spearman rank correlation
          tests  on  several sets of parameters and conclude that, except
          for their radio properties, radio-selected NLS1 galaxies do not
          exhibit significant differences from traditional NLS1 galaxies.
          Our  results  are  also  in  agreement  with  previous  studies
          suggesting that NLS1 galaxies have small black hole masses that
          are  accreting  very close to the Eddington rate. We have found
          16  new radio-loud NLS1 galaxies, which increases the number of
          known radio-loud NLS1 galaxies by a factor of ~5.

          We  present  the  first  mid-IR  long  baseline interferometric
          observations of the circumstellar matter around binary post-AGB
          stars.  Two  objects,  SX Cen and HD 52961, were observed using
          the  VLTI/MIDI  instrument  during  Science Demonstration Time.
          Both objects are known binaries for which a stable circumbinary
          disc  is  proposed  to explain the SED characteristics. This is
          corroborated  by  our  N-band  spectrum showing a crystallinity
          fraction  of  more  than  50  % for both objects, pointing to a
          stable   environment   where   dust   processing   can   occur.
          Surprisingly,  the  dust  surrounding SX Cen is not resolved in
          the interferometric observations providing an upper limit of 11
          mas  (or  18 AU at the distance of this object) on the diameter
          of  the dust emission. This confirms the very compact nature of
          its  circumstellar  environment.  The  dust  emission around HD
          52961  originates  from  a  very  small  but  resolved  region,
          estimated to be ~ 35 mas at 8 micron and ~ 55 mas at 13 micron.
          These  results  confirm  the  disc interpretation of the SED of
          both  stars.  In  HD  52961, the dust is not homogeneous in its
          chemical composition: the crystallinity is clearly concentrated
          in  the  hotter  inner  region. Whether this is a result of the
          formation  process  of the disc, or due to annealing during the
          long storage time in the disc is not clear.

          Institute for Astrophysics)
          Comments: 13 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          The  role  of  kink  instability in magnetically driven jets is
          explored  through numerical one-dimensional steady relativistic
          MHD  calculations. The instability is shown to have enough time
          to  grow  and influence the dynamics of Poynting-flux dominated
          jets.  In  the  case of AGN jets, the flow becomes kinetic flux
          dominated  at  distances  larger  than ~1000 r_g because of the
          rapid  dissipation  of  Poynting  flux.  When  applied  to  GRB
          outflows,  the model predicts more gradual Poynting dissipation
          and  moderately  magnetized  flow  at  distances of ~10^{16} cm
          where  the  deceleration  of  the ejecta due to its interaction
          with  the  external  medium is expected. The energy released by
          the  instability can power the compact ``blazar zone'' emission
          and  the  prompt  emission  of GRB outflows with high radiative
          efficiencies.

          Comments: Accepted in A&A
          We  present  results  from  Chandra  observations of the 3C/FRI
          sample   of   low  luminosity  radio-galaxies.  We  detected  a
          power-law  nuclear  component  in 12 objects out of the 18 with
          available  data.  In  4  galaxies  we  detected  nuclear  X-ray
          absorption  at  a  level  of  about N_H= (0.2-6)e22 cm-2. X-ray
          absorbed  sources  are  associated  with the presence of highly
          inclined  dusty  disks  (or  dust  filaments projected onto the
          nuclei)  seen in the HST images. This suggests the existence of
          a  flattened  X-ray  absorber,  but of much lower optical depth
          than in classical obscuring tori. We thus have an un-obstructed
          view  toward  most  FR~I  nuclei  while absorption plays only a
          marginal  role  in  the  remaining  objects.  Three  pieces  of
          evidence  support  an  interpretation  for a jet origin for the
          X-ray cores: i) the presence of strong correlations between the
          nuclear  luminosities  in  the  radio, optical and X-ray bands,
          extending  over  4  orders of magnitude and with a much smaller
          dispersion  (about  0.3  dex)  when  compared to similar trends
          found  for  other  classes of AGNs, pointing to a common origin
          for  the  emission in the three bands; ii) the close similarity
          of the broad-band spectral indices with the sub-class of BL Lac
          objects sharing the same range of extended radio-luminosity, in
          accord with the FRI/BL Lacs unified model; iii) the presence of
          a  common  luminosity evolution of spectral indices in both FRI
          and  BL  Lacs.  The  low  luminosities  of  the  X-ray  nuclei,
          regardless  of  their origin, strengthens the interpretation of
          low efficiency accretion in low luminosity radio-galaxies.

          As  part of our radial velocity survey of low Galactic latitude
          structures  that  surround  the  Galactic  disc,  we report the
          detection  of the so called Monoceros Ring in the foreground of
          the Carina dwarf galaxy at Galactic coordinates (l,b)=(260,-22)
          based  on  VLT/FLAMES observations of the dwarf galaxy. At this
          location,   20  degrees  in  longitude  greater  than  previous
          detections, the Ring has a mean radial velocity of 145+/-5 km/s
          and  a  velocity  dispersion  of  only  17+/-5  km/s.  Based on
          Keck/DEIMOS observations, we also determine that the Ring has a
          mean  radial  velocity of -75+/-4 km/s in the foreground of the
          Andromeda  galaxy  at (l,b)\sim(122,-22), along with a velocity
          dispersion  of  26+/-3 km/s. These two kinematic detections are
          both  highly  compatible  with  known  characteristics  of  the
          structure  and,  along  with previous detections provide radial
          velocity  values  of  the  Ring  over the 120<l<260 range. This
          should  add  strong  constraints  on  numerical  models  of the
          accretion  of  the  dwarf  galaxy  that  is  believed to be the
          progenitor of the Ring.

          Comments: 30 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in AJ
          We  have used a proper combination of multiband high-resolution
          {\it  HST-WFPC2}  and  wide-field  ground based observations to
          image  the  galactic  globular  cluster  NGC  6266  (M62).  The
          extensive  photometric  data  set  allows  us  to determine the
          center  of  gravity  and  to construct the most extended radial
          profile  ever  published  for  this  cluster including, for the
          first  time, detailed star counts in the very inner region. The
          star  density  profile  is  well  reproduced by a standard King
          model with an extended core ($\sim 19''$) and a modest value of
          the  concentration  parameter  ($c=1.5$),  indicating  that the
          cluster has not-yet experienced core collapse.
          The  millisecond  pulsar  population  (whose members are all in
          binary systems) and the X-ray emitting population (more than 50
          sources  within  the cluster half mass radius) suggest that NGC
          6266  is in a dynamical phase particularly active in generating
          binaries  through  dynamical encounters. UV observations of the
          central  region  have been used to probe the population of blue
          straggler  stars,  whose  origin  might  be  also  affected  by
          dynamical  interactions.  The  comparison  with  other globular
          clusters  observed  with a similar strategy shows that the blue
          straggler  content  in  NGC  6266 is relatively low, suggesting
          that the formation channel that produces binary systems hosting
          neutron stars or white dwarfs is not effective in significantly
          increasing   the   blue   straggler  population.  Moreover,  an
          anticorrelation  between  millisecond  pulsar  content and blue
          straggler specific frequency in globular cluster seems emerging
          with increasing evidence.

          We   present   results  from  fully  nonlinear  simulations  of
          inspiralling, unequal mass binary black holes, concentrating on
          four  cases  with mass ratios q = M_2/M_1 = (1,0.96,0.85,0.54),
          or   equivalently   with   reduced   mass   parameters   eta  =
          M_1M_2/(M_1+M_2)^2  =  (0.25,  0.249,  0.248,  0.227).  We show
          waveforms  of  the  dominant l=2,3 modes. The power spectrum of
          these  modes  yields  insight on how the mass ratio in a binary
          impacts  the  degree of complexity of the emitted waveforms. In
          addition,  we  provide  approximate  estimates  of  energy  and
          angular  momentum  radiated  as  well  as  kick velocities from
          gravitational radiation recoil.

          We  present  HST/ACS  griz  and  VLT K observations towards the
          radio galaxy TN J1338-1942 and 12 Lya emitters (LAEs) at z=4.1.
          The LAEs are young (a few 10^7 yr), dust-free galaxies based on
          small  sizes,  steep  UV slopes and blue UV-optical colors with
          SFRs  of  <14  M/yr.  When stacking the K-band fluxes, the LAEs
          seem  to  be less massive (masses of a few 10^8 Msun) than LBGs
          while  having  comparable  UV  SFRs.  The  LAE  AGN fraction is
          minimal. We selected 66 z~4.1 g-dropouts with z<27. Their SFRs,
          sizes, morphological parameters, and UV/optical color-magnitude
          relations  are  all  similar  to  those  found  for LBGs in the
          `field'.  We quantify the number density and cosmic variance of
          g-dropouts  using  the GOODS survey, and show that our field is
          significantly  richer  than  random  fields.  About half of the
          objects are clustered in a filamentary region that includes the
          radio galaxy and the brightest LBGs. The generally fainter LAEs
          appear  to  favour  regions that are devoid of LBGs, while LBGs
          detected  in  K tend to lie in the richest region, suggesting a
          forming  age-  or mass-density relation. We compare the angular
          correlation  function to that of mock samples with built-in z~4
          LBG  clustering.  We  find  an  excess signal at separations of
          <10",  corresponding  to  the  typical size of DM halos hosting
          bright  LBGs.  This  may be the first time that the non-linear,
          one-halo  clustering recently shown to be statistically present
          in  field  samples,  has  been measured within a single massive
          structure  at such high redshift. The large galaxy overdensity,
          its  corresponding  mass  overdensity and the sub-clustering at
          the approximate redshift of TN J1338-1942 suggest the formation
          of a >10^14 Msun structure, possibly a `protocluster'.

          Title:  Dense  Stellar  Systems as Laboratories for Fundamental
          Physics
          Authors: Piet Hut (Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton)
          Comments:   review  paper,  presented  at  A  Life  With  Stars
          (Conference  in Honor of Ed van den Heuvel), Amsterdam, August,
          2005
          Galactic  nuclei  and  globular clusters act as laboratories in
          which  nature  experiments with normal stars, neutron stars and
          black  holes,  through  collisions and through the formation of
          bound states, in the form of binaries. The main difference with
          the  usual  Earth-based  laboratories is that we cannot control
          the  experiments.  Instead,  we  have  no  choice but to create
          virtual  laboratories  on  Earth,  in order to simulate all the
          relevant physics in large-scale computational experiments. This
          implies  a  realistic  treatment  of  stellar dynamics, stellar
          evolution, and stellar hydrodynamics.
          Each of these three fields has its own legacy codes, workhorses
          that  are  routinely used to simulate star clusters, stars, and
          stellar collisions, respectively. I outline the main steps that
          need  to  be taken in order to embed and where needed transform
          these  legacy  codes in order to produce a far more modular and
          robust environment for modeling dense stellar systems.
          The  time  is right to do so: within a few years computers will
          reach  the  required speed, in the Petaflops range, to follow a
          star  cluster with a million stars for ten billion years, while
          resolving  the  internal  binary  and multiple star motions. By
          that  time  simulation  software will be the main bottleneck in
          our  ability  to  analyze  dense  stellar systems. Only through
          full-scale  simulations  will we be able to critically test our
          understanding  of  the `microphysics' of stellar collisions and
          their aftermath, in a direct comparison with observations.

          Title: XMM-Newton X-ray spectroscopy of classical T Tauri stars
          Authors:  J.  Robrade,  J.H.M.M. Schmitt (Hamburger Sternwarte,
          Universitaet Hamburg)
          Comments: 11 pages, 12 figures, accepted by A&A
          We  present  results  from  a  comparative  study of XMM-Newton
          observations  of four classical T Tauri stars (CTTS), namely BP
          Tau,  CR Cha, SU Aur and TW Hya. In these objects coronal, i.e.
          magnetic, activity and as recently shown, magnetically funneled
          accretion  are  the  processes likely to be responsible for the
          generation  of  X-ray  emission.  Variable  X-ray emission with
          luminosities  in  the  order of $10^{30}$ erg/s is observed for
          all  targets. We investigate light curves as well as medium and
          high-resolution   X-ray   spectra   to   determine  the  plasma
          properties  of the sample CTTS and to study the origin of their
          X-ray  emission  and  its  variability.  The  emission  measure
          distributions  and  observed  temperatures differ significantly
          and  the  targets  are  dominated  either  by  plasma  at  high
          densities  as  produced by accretion shocks or by predominantly
          hotter  plasma  of  coronal origin. Likewise the variability of
          the   X-ray  luminosity  is  found  to  be  generated  by  both
          mechanisms. Cool plasma at high densities is found in all stars
          with detected \ion{O}{vii} triplet emission, prevented only for
          SU~Aur  due to strong absorption. A general trend is present in
          the  abundance  pattern,  with  neon  being  at  solar value or
          enhanced while oxygen, iron and most other metals are depleted,
          pointing  to  the  presence of the inverse FIP effect in active
          coronae  and possibly grain formation in evolved disks. We find
          that  both  accretion shocks and coronal activity contribute to
          the  observed  X-ray  emission  of  the  targets. While coronal
          activity  is  the  dominant  source  of  X-ray  activity in the
          majority  of  the  CTTS,  the fraction for each process differs
          significantly between the individual objects.

          This  work  presents the main ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared
          (FIR)  properties  of  two  samples of nearby galaxies selected
          from  the  GALEX  ($\lambda = 2315$\AA, hereafter NUV) and IRAS
          ($\lambda  =  60\mu$m)  surveys respectively. They are built in
          order  to  get  detection  at  both wavelengths for most of the
          galaxies.  Star formation rate (SFR) estimators based on the UV
          and  FIR  emissions  are  compared.  Systematic differences are
          found  between the SFR estimators for individual galaxies based
          on  the  NUV  fluxes  corrected for dust attenuation and on the
          total  IR  luminosity. A combined estimator based on NUV and IR
          luminosities seems to be the best proxy over the whole range of
          values  of  SFR.  Although both samples present similar average
          values     of     the     birthrate    parameter    b,    their
          star-formation-related  properties are substantially different:
          NUV-selected  galaxies  tend  to  show larger values of $b$ for
          lower  masses,  SFRs and dust attenuations, supporting previous
          scenarios  for  the  star  formation history (SFH). Conversely,
          about 20% of the FIR-selected galaxies show high values of $b$,
          SFR  and  NUV  attenuation.  These galaxies, most of them being
          LIRGs  and  ULIRGs,  break  down the downsizing picture for the
          SFH,  however  their  relative  contribution per unit volume is
          small in the local Universe. Finally, the cosmic SFR density of
          the  local  Universe  is estimated in a consistent way from the
          NUV and IR luminosities.

          Title:  XMM-Newton  observations  of PSr B1259-63 near the 2004
          periastron passage
          Authors: M.Chernyakova, A. Neronov, A. Lutovinov, J. Rodriguez,

          Comments: 9 pages, accepted to MNRAS
          PSR  B1259-63 is in a highly eccentric 3.4 year orbit with a Be
          star  and  crosses the Be star disc twice per orbit, just prior
          to  and  just  after  periastron.  Unpulsed  radio,  X-ray  and
          gamma-ray  emission  observed from the binary system is thought
          to  be  due to the collision of pulsar wind with the wind of Be
          star.   We   present   here   the  results  of  new  XMM-Newton
          observations of the PSR B1259-63 system during the beginning of
          2004  as  the  pulsar approached the disc of Be star.We combine
          these results with earlier unpublished X-ray data from BeppoSAX
          and  XMM-Newton  as  well as with ASCA data. The detailed X-ray
          lightcurve  of  the  system shows that the pulsar passes (twice
          per  orbit)  through  a well-defined gaussian-profile disk with
          the  half-opening  angle  (projected on the pulsar orbit plane)
          ~18.5  deg.  The intersection of the disk middle plane with the
          pulsar  orbital  plane is inclined at ~70 deg to the major axis
          of  the pulsar orbit. Comparing the X-ray lightcurve to the TeV
          lightcurve  of  the system we find that the increase of the TeV
          flux   some  10--100  days  after  the  periastron  passage  is
          unambiguously  related  to  the  disk passage. At the moment of
          entrance to the disk the X-ray photon index hardens from 1.8 up
          to  1.2  before  returning  to  the  steeper  value  1.5.  Such
          behaviour is not easily accounted for by the model in which the
          X-ray  emission is synchrotron emission from the shocked pulsar
          wind.  We  argue  that  the  observed  hardening  of  the X-ray
          spectrum  is  due  to  the  inverse  Compton  or bremsstrahlung
          emission  from  10-100  MeV electrons responsible for the radio
          synchrotron emission.

          We  present  Chandra  and XMM observations of 12 bright (f(2-10
          keV)
          >  10^-13 cgs) sources from the ASCA SHEEP (Search for the High
          Energy
          Extragalactic  Population)  survey.  Most  of  these  have been
          either  not  observed or not detected previously with the ROSAT
          mission  and  therefore they constitute a sample biased towards
          hard   sources.  The  Chandra  observations  are  important  in
          locating  with  accuracy  the  optical counterpart of the X-ray
          sources.  Optical  spectroscopic  observations  show  that  our
          sample  is associated with both narrow-line (NL) (six objects),
          and
          Broad-Line  (BL)  AGN  (five objects) with one source remaining
          unidentified.
          Our  sources  cover  the  redshift  range 0.04 to 1.29 spanning
          luminosities from 10^42 to 10^45 cgs (2-10 keV). The NL sources
          have  preferentially  lower  redshift (and luminosity) compared
          with  the BL ones. This can be most easily explained in a model
          where  the  NL  AGN are intrinsically less luminous than the BL
          ones in line with the results of Steffen et al.
          The  X-ray  spectral  fittings  show  a roughly equal number of
          obscured   (N_H>10^22   cgs)  and  unobscured  (N_H<10^22  cgs)
          sources.
          There is a clear tendency for obscured sources to be associated
          with
          NL AGN and unobscured sources with BL ones. However, there is a
          marked  exception with the highest obscuring column observed at
          a BL AGN at a redshift of z=0.5.

          topology
          Authors: M.C. Bento, O. Bertolami, M.J. Rebouas, P.T. Silva
          Comments: Revtex 4, 8 pages, 10 figures, 1 table
          Physicists  describe  the  Universe  as  a  manifold,  which is
          characterized  by  its  geometry  and  its  topology. Thus, two
          fundamental  questions  regarding  the  nature  of the Universe
          concern  the geometry and topology of the 3--dimensional space.
          Geometry   is  a  local  feature  related  with  the  intrinsic
          curvature  of  the  3--space, which be tested by studies of the
          cosmic  microwave  background  radiation  (CMBR)  such  as  the
          Wilkinson  Microwave  Anisotropy  Probe  (WMAP).  Topology is a
          global property that characterizes its shape and size. Geometry
          constrains  but  does  not  fix  the  topology  of  the spatial
          sections.  In  a  locally  spatially  homogeneous and isotropic
          universe  the  topology  of  its  spatial  section dictates its
          geometry.  In  this  work we show that, besides determining the
          spatial  geometry, the knowledge of the spatial topology places
          a   constraint  on  the  $A_s$  parameter  of  the  generalized
          Chaplygin  gas  (GCG)  model for unification of dark energy and
          dark  matter.  By  using both the Poincar\'e dodecahedral space
          and   binary   octahedral   space  as  the  observable  spatial
          topologies, we reanalyze the current type Ia supenovae (SNe Ia)
          constraints  on  the GCG parameters. We show that the knowledge
          of  spatial topologies does provide some additional constraints
          on  the  GCG  $A_s$  parameter even though it does not lift the
          degeneracy of the $\alpha$ parameter.

          We  report  on  IRAC-4.5mic,  IRAC-8.0mic  and  MIPS-24mic deep
          observations   of  16  Gamma-Ray  Burst  (GRBs)  host  galaxies
          performed  with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and we investigate
          in  the  thermal  infrared  the  presence  of  evolved  stellar
          populations    and    dust-enshrouded   star-forming   activity
          associated  with these objects. Our sample is derived from GRBs
          that  were identified with sub-arcsec localization between 1997
          and 2001, and only a very small fraction (~20%) of the targeted
          sources  is  detected  down to f_4.5mic ~3.5microJy and f_24mic
          ~85microJy  (3sigma).  This  likely argues against a population
          dominated  by  massive  and  strongly-starbursting (i.e., SFR >
          ~100  Msol/yr)  galaxies as it has been recently suggested from
          submillimeter/radio  and  optical studies of similarly-selected
          GRB  hosts.  Furthermore we find evidence that some GRBs do not
          occur  in  the most infrared-luminous regions -- hence the most
          actively  star-forming  environments -- of their host galaxies.
          Should  the  GRB  hosts  be  representative of all star-forming
          galaxies  at high redshift, models of infrared galaxy evolution
          indicate  that  >  ~50%  of  GRB  hosts  should  have f_24mic >
          ~100microJy.  Unless  the  identification of GRBs prior to 2001
          was  prone  to  strong  selection  effects  biasing  our sample
          against  dusty galaxies, we infer in this context that the GRBs
          identified with the current techniques can not be directly used
          as  unbiased probes of the global and integrated star formation
          history of the Universe.

          We report on the first mid-infrared observations of 16 GRB host
          galaxies  performed  with  the  Spitzer  Space  Telescope,  and
          investigate  the  presence  of  evolved stellar populations and
          dust-enshrouded  star-forming  activity  associated  with GRBs.
          Only  a  very  small  fraction  of  our  sample  is detected by
          Spitzer,  which  is not consistent with recent works suggesting
          the  presence of a GRB host population dominated by massive and
          strongly-starbursting galaxies (SFR > ~100 Msol/yr). Should the
          GRB  hosts  be  representative of star-forming galaxies at high
          redshift, models of galaxy evolution indicate that >~50% of GRB
          hosts would be easily detected at the depth of our mid-infrared
          observations.   Unless   our   sample  suffers  from  a  strong
          observational  bias which remains to be understood, we infer in
          this   context  that  the  GRBs  identified  with  the  current
          techniques  can  not be directly used as unbiased probes of the
          global and integrated star formation history of the Universe.

          years  that a large fraction of these objects were carbon-rich,
          analogous  to  the  more  metal-rich  CH-stars.  The  abundance
          peculiarities   of   CH-stars   are   commonly   explained   by
          mass-transfer  from  a  more evolved companion. In an effort to
          better  understand  the  origin  and  importance  for  Galactic
          evolution  of  Fe-poor,  C-rich  stars,  we  present abundances
          determined   from   high-resolution  and  high  signal-to-noise
          spectra  obtained  with  the  UVES  instrument  attached to the
          ESO/VLT.  Our analysis of carbon-enhanced objects includes both
          CH  stars  and more metal-poor objects, and we explore the link
          between the two classes. We also present preliminary results of
          our ongoing radial velocity monitoring.

          Title:   Stacking  weak  lensing  signals  of  SZ  clusters  to
          constrain cluster physics
          Authors:  Carolyn  Sealfon  (UPenn),  Licia Verde (UPenn), Raul
          Jimenez (UPenn)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          We show how to place constraints on cluster physics by stacking
          the  weak  lensing signals from multiple clusters found through
          the  Sunyaev-Zeldovich  (SZ)  effect.  For a survey that covers
          about  200  sq.  deg. both in SZ and weak lensing observations,
          the  slope and amplitude of the mass vs. SZ luminosity relation
          can  be  measured with few percent error for clusters at z~0.5.
          This  can  be  used  to  constrain cluster physics, such as the
          nature   of   feedback.  For  example,  we  can  distinguish  a
          pre-heated  model  from a model with a decreased accretion rate
          at  more than 5sigma. The power to discriminate among different
          non-gravitational processes in the ICM becomes even stronger if
          we use the central Compton parameter y_0, which could allow one
          to distinguish between models with pre-heating, SN feedback and
          AGN  feedback, for example, at more than 5sigma. Measurement of
          these  scaling  relations  as  a  function of redshift makes it
          possible to directly observe e.g., the evolution of the hot gas
          in  clusters.  With this approach the mass-L_SZ relation can be
          calibrated  and its uncertainties can be quantified, leading to
          a  more  robust  determination  of cosmological parameters from
          clusters surveys. The mass-L_SZ relation calibrated in this way
          from a small area of the sky can be used to determine masses of
          SZ  clusters  from  very  large  SZ-only  surveys and is nicely
          complementary to other techniques proposed in the literature.

          Title: Quasars and their host galaxies
          Authors: Mark Lacy (Spitzer Science Center)
          Comments: Review article, to appear in Astrophysics Update 2
          This  review attempts to describe developments in the fields of
          quasar  and quasar host galaxies in the past five. In this time
          period,  the  Sloan  and  2dF quasar surveys have added several
          tens of thousands of quasars, with Sloan quasars being found to
          z>6.  Obscured,  or partially obscured quasars have begun to be
          found  in  significant  numbers.  Black hole mass estimates for
          quasars,   and   our   confidence   in   them,   have  improved
          significantly,  allowing  a start on relating quasar properties
          such as radio jet power to fundamental parameters of the quasar
          such  as black hole mass and accretion rate. Quasar host galaxy
          studies  have  allowed  us  to  find  and characterize the host
          galaxies  of  quasars  to z>2. Despite these developments, many
          questions  remain  unresolved,  in particular the origin of the
          close  relationship  between  black  hole mass and galaxy bulge
          mass/velocity dispersion seen in local galaxies.

          Methanol  masers  which  are  traditionally  divided  into  two
          classes  provide  possibility  to  study important parts of the
          star  forming  regions: Class~II masers trace vicinities of the
          massive  YSOs  while  class~I  masers  are likely to trace more
          distant parts of the outflows where newer stars can form. There
          are  many  methanol  transitions which produce observed masers.
          This  allows  to  use  pumping  analysis  for estimation of the
          physical  parameters  in  the  maser  formation regions and its
          environment,  for  the  study  of  their  evolution.  Extensive
          surveys  in  different  masing transitions allow to conclude on
          the  values  of  the  temperatures, densities, dust properties,
          etc.  in  the  bulk  of  masing  regions.  Variability  of  the
          brightest  masers  is  monitored  during several years. In some
          cases  it  is  probably  caused  by  the  changes  of  the dust
          temperature  which  follow  variations in the brightness of the
          central  YSO reflecting the character of the accretion process.
          A  unified catalogue of the class II methanol masers consisting
          of  more  than  500  objects  is compiled. Analysis of the data
          shows  that:  physical conditions within the usual maser source
          vary considerably; maser brightness is determined by parameters
          of  some  distinguished  part  of  the object - maser formation
          region;  class  II  methanol  masers  are formed not within the
          outflows  but  in the regions affected by their propagation. It
          is  shown that the "near" solutions for the kinematic distances
          to  the  sources  can  be  used  for  statistical analysis. The
          luminosity   function   of  the  6.7  GHz  methanol  masers  is
          constructed. It is shown that improvement of the sensitivity of
          surveys   can   increase   number  of  detected  maser  sources
          considerably.

          Title: The distribution of ejected brown dwarfs in clusters

          We examine the spatial distribution of brown dwarfs produced by
          the  decay  of  small-N  stellar  systems  as expected from the
          embryo ejection scenario. We model a cluster of several hundred
          stars  grouped  into 'cores' of a few stars/brown dwarfs. These
          cores decay, preferentially ejecting their lowest-mass members.
          Brown  dwarfs  are  found  to have a wider spatial distribution
          than  stars,  however  once the effects of limited survey areas
          and  unresolved  binaries  are  taken  into  account  it can be
          difficult  to  distinguish  between  clusters  with  many or no
          ejections.   A   large  difference  between  the  distributions
          probably   indicates  that  ejections  have  occurred,  however
          similar distributions sometimes arise even with ejections. Thus
          the  spatial  distribution of brown dwarfs is not necessarily a
          good discriminator between ejection and non-ejection scenarios.

          Title: [O III] emission line in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies
          Authors: Bian Weihao, Yuan Qirong, Zhao Yongheng
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figurs, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Three sets of two-component profiles are used to simultaneously
          model  the [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 and H$\beta$ lines
          for  the  Fe II-subtracted spectra of 149 narrow line Seyfert 1
          galaxies  (NLSls)  from  the  Sloan  Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
          Using   the  linewidth  of  the  narrow/core  component  of  [O
          III]$\lambda$5007  to  trace  the  stellar  velocity dispersion
          instead  of  using the total linewidth of [O III]$\lambda$5007,
          we  found  that  the  SDSS  NLSls  are  still deviated from the
          $M_{bh}-\sigma$ relation found in the nearby inactive galaxies,
          suggesting  that  the  linewidth  of  the  [O  III] narrow/core
          component  is  likely  not  a  good  tracer  of  bulge velocity
          dispersion  in  NLSls,  since  some other studies indicate that
          NLS1s,  like  other  AGN,  should  follow  the  $M_{bh}-\sigma$
          relation.  If  we assume that the [O III]5007/H$\beta_{n}$ line
          ratio  emitted in narrow line region ranges from one to ten, 63
          objects  are  found  to satisfied with this criterion and their
          H$\beta$  broad  components  should  be used to calculate their
          virial  black  hole  masses.  These  63  objects are statically
          consistent  with  the  $M_{bh}-\sigma_{[O III]}$ relation. With
          the  Chandra  observation of some SDSS NLSls, for one object in
          these  63  objects, J143030.22-001115.1, we found that it can't
          be  classified  as  a  genuine  NLS1.  Its  narrow component of
          H$\beta$  is  coming  from  narrow line regions (NLRs). This is
          consistent  with  its  very  flat  hard X-ray spectrum found by
          williams et al. (2004).

          Comments:  35  pages,  14  figures,  submitted to the ApJ. Most
          figures converted to low resolution
          We  report  the  definite spectroscopic identification of 41 OB
          supergiants,  giants  and  main  sequence  stars in the central
          parsec  of the Galaxy. Detection of their absorption lines have
          become  possible  with the high spatial and spectral resolution
          and   sensitivity   of   the  adaptive  optics  integral  field
          spectrometer SPIFFI/SINFONI on the ESO VLT. Several of these OB
          stars  appear to be helium and nitrogen rich. Almost all of the
          ~80  massive  stars  now  known  in the central parsec (central
          arcsecond  excluded)  reside  in  one  of  two  somewhat  thick
          (<|h|/R>~0.14)  rotating disks. These stellar disks have fairly
          sharp  inner  edges  (R~1")  and  surface density profiles that
          scale  as  R^{-2}.  We  do  not detect any OB stars outside the
          central  0.5  pc.  The  majority  of the stars in the clockwise
          system  appear to be on almost circular orbits, whereas most of
          those in the `counter-clockwise' disk appear to be on eccentric
          orbits.  Based  on its stellar surface density distribution and
          dynamics  we propose that IRS 13E is an extremely dense cluster
          (core  density  > 3x10^8 sunmass/pc^3), which has formed in the
          counter-clockwise  disk.  The  stellar contents of both systems
          are  remarkably similar, indicating a common age of ~6+/-2 Myr.
          The  K-band luminosity function of the massive stars suggests a
          top-heavy  mass  function  and  limits  the  total stellar mass
          contained in both disks to ~1.5x10^4 sunmass. Our data strongly
          favor in situ star formation from dense gas accretion disks for
          the  two  stellar  disks. This conclusion is very clear for the
          clockwise  disk  and highly plausible for the counter-clockwise
          system.

          Title:  The  late  time  evolution  of Gamma-Ray Bursts: ending
          hyperaccretion and producing flares
          Authors: Daniel Proga (UNLV), Bing Zhang (UNLV)
          Comments: submitted to ApJ Letters on Dec. 15, 2005
          We  consider  the  properties  of  a  hyperaccretion  model for
          gamma-ray  bursts  (GRBs) at the late time when the mass supply
          rate  is  expected to decrease with time. We point out that the
          region  in the vicinity of the accretor and the accretor itself
          can  play  an  important  role in determining the rate and time
          behavior  of  the  accretion  and ultimately the energy output.
          Motivated  by numerical simulations and theoretical results, we
          conjecture  that  the  energy release can be repeatedly stopped
          and  then restarted by the magnetic flux accumulated around the
          accretor.  We  propose  that  the  episode or episodes when the
          accretion   resumes   correspond  to  X-ray  flares  discovered
          recently in a number of GRBs.

          particle  species  with different densities. The surface energy
          is  obtained  by  the integration of the free energy density in
          the  interface  between  the two phases. We show that the mixed
          phase  remains  as  the  favored  ground state over the gapless
          phase, even upon the consideration of the surface energy.

          Comments: To appear in ApJ [16 pages, 13 figures]
          The  unusual  flux  variations  of the pre-main-sequence binary
          star   KH  15D  have  been  attributed  to  occultations  by  a
          circumbinary  disk.  We  test  whether  or  not  this theory is
          compatible  with  newly available data, including recent radial
          velocity measurements, CCD photometry over the past decade, and
          photographic  photometry  over  the  past 50 years. We find the
          model to be successful, after two refinements: a more realistic
          motion  of  the  occulting feature, and a halo around each star
          that  probably represents scattering by the disk. The occulting
          feature  is  exceptionally sharp-edged, raising the possibility
          that  the  dust  in the disk has settled into a thin layer, and
          providing  a  tool  for  fine-scale  mapping  of  the immediate
          environment   of  a  T  Tauri  star.  However,  the  window  of
          opportunity  is  closing,  as the currently visible star may be
          hidden at all orbital phases by as early as 2008.

          Supermassive  black  holes  inhabit  galactic nuclei, and their
          presence  influences  in  crucial  ways  the  evolution  of the
          stellar  distribution. The low-density cores observed in bright
          galaxies  are  probably  a  result  of black hole infall, while
          steep  density  cusps  like  those at the Galactic center are a
          result   of   energy  exchange  between  stars  moving  in  the
          gravitational   field  of  the  single  black  hole.  Loss-cone
          dynamics are substantially more complex in galactic nuclei than
          in  globular clusters due to the longer relaxation times, which
          permit  a  wider variety of geometries and orbital populations.
          The  rate  of  star-black  hole  interactions  has  begun to be
          constrained through observations of energetic events associated
          with stellar tidal disruptions.

          The  optical  counterpart  of  the transient, millisecond X-ray
          pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 was observed in four colours (BVRI) for
          five  weeks  during  the  2005  June-July outburst. The optical
          fluxes  declined  by ~2 magnitudes during the first 16 days and
          then   commenced   quasi-periodic   secondary  outbursts,  with
          time-scales  of several days, similar to those seen in 2000 and
          2002.  The  broadband  spectra  derived from these measurements
          were  generally  consistent  with emission from an X-ray heated
          accretion  disc.  During the first 16 days decline in intensity
          the  spectrum  became  redder.  We  suggest  that  the  primary
          outburst was initiated by a viscosity change driven instability
          in  the inner disc and note the contrast with another accreting
          millisecond  pulsar,  XTE  J0929-314,  for  which  the spectrum
          becomes   bluer  during  outburst.  Several  significant  short
          duration  changes  in  V-I were detected. One occurred at about
          HJD  2453546 in the early phase of the first secondary outburst
          and  may be due to a mass transfer instability. On the night of
          2005  June 5 (HJD 2453527) the I band flux was ~0.45 magnitudes
          brighter  than on the preceding or following nights whereas the
          BVR  bands  showed no obvious enhancement. A Type I X-ray burst
          was  detected  by  the  RXTE  spacecraft  during  this  I  band
          integration.  It seems unlikely that reprocessed radiation from
          the  burst  was sufficient to explain the observed increase. We
          suggest  that  a  major  part  of  the I band excess was due to
          synchrotron emission triggered by the X-ray burst.

          Title:  Influences of magnetic coupling process on the spectrum
          of a disk covered by the corona
          Authors: R.Y. Ma, D.X. Wang, X.Q. Zuo
          Comments: 15 pages, 5 figures, accepted by A&A
          Recently, much attention has been paid to the magnetic coupling
          (MC)  process,  which  is  supported  by  very  high emissivity
          indexes  observed  in Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG-6-30-15 and GBHC XTE
          J1650-500.  But  the rotational energy transferred from a black
          hole is simply assumed to be radiated away from the surrounding
          accretion  disk  in black-body spectrum, which is obviously not
          consistent  with  the observed hard power-law X-ray spectra. We
          intend  to  introduce  corona into the MC model to make it more
          compatible with the observations. We describe the model and the
          procedure  of  a simplified Monte Carlo simulation, compare the
          output  spectra  in  the cases with and without the MC effects,
          and  discuss the influences of three parameters involved in the
          MC  process  on  the  output  spectra.  It is shown that the MC
          process  augments radiation fluxes in the UV or X-ray band. The
          emergent spectrum is affected by the BH spin and magnetic field
          strength  at  the  BH horizon, while it is almost unaffected by
          the   radial  profile  of  the  magnetic  field  at  the  disk.
          Introducing  corona  into the MC model will improve the fitting
          of the output spectra from AGNs and GBHCs.

          Title:  General  Relativistic,  Neutrino-Assisted  MHD  winds -
          Theory and Application to GRBs. I. Schwarzschild Geometry
          Authors: Amir Levinson
          Comments: 25 pages, 7 figures, ApJ submitted
          (short  version)  -  A  model  for  GRMHD  disk  outflows  with
          neutrino-driven  mass  ejection  is  developed,and  employed to
          calculate   the  structure  of  the  outflow  in  the  sub-slow
          magnetosonic  region and the mass loading of the outflow, under
          conditions  anticipated  in  the  central  engines of gamma-ray
          bursts.  The  dependence  of the mass flux on the conditions in
          the  disk,  on magnetic field geometry, and on other factors is
          carefully   examined  for  a  range  of  neutrino  luminosities
          expected   in  hyperaccreting  black  holes.  The  fraction  of
          neutrino  luminosity  that is being converted to kinetic energy
          flux  is  shown  to  be  a  sensitive function of the effective
          neutrino temperature at the flow injection point, and the shape
          of  magnetic  field  lines  in  the  sub-slow  region,  but  is
          practically   independent  of  the  strength  of  poloidal  and
          toroidal  magnetic  fields. We conclude that magnetic launching
          of  ultra-relativistic  polar outflows from the innermost parts
          of  the  disk  is  in  principle possible provided the neutrino
          luminosity   is   sufficiently  low,  $L_\nu\simlt10^{52}$  erg
          s$^{-1}$  or  so.  The  conditions  found to be optimal for the
          launching  of an ultra-relativistic jet are also the conditions
          favorable for large neutron-to-proton ratio in the disk.

          Title:  A 2 mm spectral line survey of the starburst galaxy NGC
          253
          Authors:  S.Martn, R.Mauersberger, J.Martn-Pintado, C.Henkel,

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJS
          We  present the first unbiased molecular line survey towards an
          extragalactic   source,   namely  the  nuclear  region  of  the
          starburst  galaxy  NGC  253. The scan covers the frequency band
          from  129.1  to  175.2  GHz,  i.e.  most of the 2mm atmospheric
          window.  We  identify 111 spectral features as transitions from
          25   different   molecular   species.  Eight  of  which  (three
          tentatively)   are   detected   for   the  first  time  in  the
          extragalactic  interstellar  medium. Among these newly detected
          species,  we  detected  the  rare  isotopomers 34SO and HC18O+.
          Tentative  detections  of two deuterated species, DNC and N2D+,
          are  reported  for  the  first  time  from  a target beyond the
          Magellanic  Clouds.  Additionally, three hydrogen recombination
          lines  are  identified,  while no organic molecules larger than
          methanol   are   detected.   Column   densities   and  rotation
          temperatures  are  calculated for all the species, including an
          upper  limit  to  the  ethanol  abundance.  A comparison of the
          chemical composition of the nuclear environment of NGC 253 with
          those  of  selected  nearby  galaxies demonstrates the chemical
          resemblance  of  IC 342 and NGC 4945 to that of NGC 253. On the
          other hand, the chemistries characterizing NGC 253 and M 82 are
          clearly different. We also present a comparison of the chemical
          composition   of  NGC  253  with  those  observed  in  Galactic
          prototypical sources. The chemistry of NGC 253 shows a striking
          similarity  with  the  chemistry  observed  toward the Galactic
          center  molecular  clouds, which are thought to be dominated by
          low-velocity  shocks.  This  resemblance strongly suggests that
          the  heating in the nuclear environment of NGC 253 is dominated
          by  the  same  mechanism  as  that in the central region of the
          Milky Way.

          Title:  Modeling  the  QSO luminosity and spatial clustering at
          low redshifts
          Authors:  F.  Marulli, D. Crociani, M. Volonteri, E. Branchini,

          Comments: 13 pages, 9 figures. Accepted by MNRAS
          We  investigate  the  ability  of  hierarchical  models  of QSO
          formation  and  evolution  to  match  the  observed luminosity,
          number  counts  and  spatial  clustering of quasars at redshift
          z<2.  These models assume that the QSO emission is triggered by
          galaxy  mergers,  that  the  mass  of  the  central  black hole
          correlates with halo properties and that quasars shine at their
          Eddington  luminosity  except,  perhaps,  during the very early
          stages  of  evolution.  We  find  that  models  based on simple
          analytic  approximations  successfully  reproduce  the observed
          B-band  QSO luminosity function at all redshifts, provided that
          some  mechanisms  is  advocated to quench mass accretion within
          haloes  larger  than  about 1e13 Msun that host bright quasars.
          These models also match the observed strength of QSO clustering
          at  z~0.8.  At larger redshifts, however, they underpredict the
          QSO   biasing   which,  instead,  is  correctly  reproduced  by
          semi-analytic  models  in  which  the  halo  merger history and
          associated  BHs are followed by Monte Carlo realizations of the
          merger  hierarchy.  We  show  that the disagreement between the
          luminosity  function  predicted  by  semi-analytic  models  and
          observations  can  be ascribed to the use of B-band data, which
          are   a   biased  tracer  of  the  quasar  population,  due  to
          obscuration.

          Title: Formation of Supermassive Black Holes by Direct Collapse
          in Pregalactic Halos
          Authors: Mitchell C. Begelman, Marta Volonteri, Martin J. Rees
          Comments:  10 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Monthly Notices of
          the Royal Astronomical Society
          We  describe  a mechanism by which supermassive black holes can
          form  directly in the nuclei of protogalaxies, without the need
          for  seed  black  holes  left  over  from early star formation.
          Self-gravitating  gas  in  dark  matter  halos can lose angular
          momentum  rapidly  via runaway, global dynamical instabilities,
          the  so-called  "bars within bars" mechanism. This leads to the
          rapid  buildup  of  a dense, self-gravitating core supported by
          gas  pressure  -  surrounded  by a radiation pressure-dominated
          envelope  - which gradually contracts and is compressed further
          by  subsequent  infall.  These  conditions  lead  to  such high
          temperatures   in   the  central  region  that  the  gas  cools
          catastrophically  by  thermal neutrino emission, leading to the
          formation and rapid growth of a central black hole.
          We  estimate the initial mass and growth rate of the black hole
          for typical conditions in metal-free halos with T_vir ~ 10^4 K,
          which  are  the  first to be susceptible to runaway infall. The
          initial  black  hole  should have a mass of <~ 20 solar masses,
          but  in principle could grow at a super-Eddington rate until it
          reaches  ~  10^4-10^6 solar masses. Rapid growth may be limited
          by feedback from the accretion process and/or disruption of the
          mass  supply  by  star  formation  or  halo  mergers.  Even  if
          super-Eddington  growth  stops at ~10^3-10^4 solar masses, this
          process would give black holes ample time to attain quasar-size
          masses by a redshift of 6, and could also provide the seeds for
          all supermassive black holes seen in the present universe.

          The   ultraluminous  X-ray  sources  (ULXs)  were  isolated  in
          external   galaxies   for   the   last  5  years.  Their  X-ray
          luminosities  exceed  100-10000  times those of brightest Milky
          Way  black hole binaries and they are extremely variable. There
          are two models for the ULXs, the best black hole candidates. 1.
          They  are  supercritical  accretion disks around a stellar mass
          black hole like that in SS433, observed close to the disk axes.
          2.  They  are Intermediate Mass Black Holes (of 100-10000 solar
          masses).  Critical  observations which may throw light upon the
          ULXs  nature come from observations of nebulae around the ULXs.
          We present results of 3D-spectroscopy of nebulae around several
          ULXs  located  in  galaxies at 3-6 Mpc distances. We found that
          the  nebulae  to  be  powered by their central black holes. The
          nebulae are shocked and dynamically perturbed probably by jets.
          The nebulae are compared with SS433 nebula (W50).

          Title:  Clumpy  winds  and  the  obscuration of Active Galactic
          Nuclei
          Authors:  Sergei Nayakshin (U of Leicester), Jorge Cuadra (MPA,
          Garching)
          Comments: 5 pages, 5 colour figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          The  role  of star-formation driven outflows in the obscuration
          of  the  central  source in the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is
          discussed.  The  outflow from a sub-parsec scale accretion disc
          is  numerically  modelled  for  parameters  appropriate  to the
          Galactic  Centre.  The  resulting  obscuration  pattern is very
          patchy,  with  some  lines of sight becoming optically thick to
          Thomson  scattering.  A  fixed  observer would see column depth
          changing by factors of many over time scales of order months to
          hundreds  of  years,  depending  on  the  physical  size of the
          outflow  region.  Such winds may be relevant for obscuration of
          some  AGN and especially "changing look AGN". However, averaged
          over  the  sky as seen from the central source, these winds are
          always   optically   thin   unless   wind   outflow  rates  are
          super-Eddington.  A  simple scaling argument shows that this is
          true  not  only for stellar-driven winds but for any AGN winds.
          We  therefore conclude that AGN winds are unable to account for
          the   vast   majority   of  optically  thick  obscured  AGN  (a
          significant  fraction  of  all  AGN).  We suggest that the most
          likely source of optically thick obscuration in AGN is a warped
          parsec scale accretion disc.

          Authors:  Anthony Whitworth, Matthew R. Bate, Aake Nordlund, Bo
          Reipurth, Hans Zinnecker
          Comments: 18 pages,3 figures, chapter in Protostars and Planets
          V
          We  review  five  mechanisms  for  forming  brown  dwarfs:  (i)
          turbulent  fragmentation  of  molecular  clouds, producing very
          low-mass  prestellar  cores by shock compression; (ii) collapse
          and  fragmentation of more massive prestellar cores; (iii) disc
          fragmentation;  (iv) premature ejection of protostellar embryos
          from  their  natal cores; and (v) photo-erosion of pre-existing
          cores overrun by HII regions. These mechanisms are not mutually
          exclusive.   Their  relative  importance  probably  depends  on
          environment, and should be judged by their ability to reproduce
          the  brown-dwarf  IMF, the distribution and kinematics of newly
          formed brown dwarfs, the binary statistics of brown dwarfs, the
          ability  of  brown  dwarfs  to  retain  discs,  and hence their
          ability  to  sustain  accretion and outflows. This will require
          more   sophisticated  numerical  modelling  than  is  presently
          possible,  in  particular more realistic initial conditions and
          more  realistic  treatments  of  radiation  transport,  angular
          momentum  transport and magnetic fields. We discuss the minimum
          mass   for  brown  dwarfs,  and  how  brown  dwarfs  should  be
          distinguished from planets.

          We   have  used  deprojected  radial  density  and  temperature
          profiles  of  a  sample  of 16 nearby CF clusters observed with
          XMM-Newton  to  test  whether  the  effervescent  heating model
          (Ruszkowski   &   Begelman  (2002))  can  give  a  satisfactory
          explanation to the dynamics of CF clusters. For each cluster we
          have  derived,  for  various  values  of the unknown parameters
          $\dot   M$   (mass   deposition  rate)  and  $f_c$  (conduction
          efficiency),  the  required  extra  heating  as  a  function of
          cluster-centric  distance.  We  have  fitted  the extra heating
          curve  using  the AGN effervescent heating function and derived
          the  AGN parameters L (time-averaged luminosity) and $r_0$ (the
          scale  radius  where  the  bubbles start rising in the ICM). We
          show  that the effervescent heating model fails in providing an
          appropriate   description  of  the  observed  structure  of  CF
          clusters  for  half  of  the  objects  in  our  sample. For the
          remaining  objects we find that, when a comparison is possible,
          the  derived  AGN  scale  radius $r_0$ and the observed AGN jet
          extension  are of the same order of magnitude. We show that the
          AGN  luminosities  required  to  balance  radiative  losses are
          substantially  lowered if the fact that the AGN deposits energy
          within  a  finite  volume  is taken into account. For the Virgo
          cluster,   we   find  that  the  AGN  power  derived  from  the
          effervescent  heating  model  is  in  good  agreement  with the
          observed jets power.

          We   present  partial-correlation  analyses  that  examine  the
          strengths of the relationships between L_UV, L_X, Alpha_OX, and
          redshift  for  optically-selected  AGNs.  We extend the work of
          Strateva  et  al. (2005), that analyzed optically-selected AGNs
          from  the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS), by including 52
          moderate-luminosity,  optically-selected AGNs from the COMBO-17
          survey  with  corresponding  deep  (~250  ks  to  1  Ms)  X-ray
          observations  from  the  Extended Chandra Deep Field-South. The
          COMBO-17  survey extends ~3 magnitudes deeper than the SDSS and
          probes  the  moderate-luminosity AGNs that numerically dominate
          the  AGN  population  in the Universe. We also include recently
          published  observations of 19 high-redshift, optically-selected
          AGNs, and 46 luminous, low-redshift AGNs from the Bright Quasar
          Survey.  The  full  sample used in our analysis consists of 333
          AGNs,  extending  out  to  z~6,  with  293  (88%)  having X-ray
          detections.  The sample spans five decades in UV luminosity and
          four  decades  in X-ray luminosity. We confirm that Alpha_OX is
          strongly  anti-correlated  with  L_UV (13.6 sigma), the highest
          significance found for this relation to date, and find evidence
          suggesting  that the slope of this relation may be dependent on
          L_UV.  We  find  that no significant correlation exists between
          Alpha_OX  and  redshift  (1.3 sigma), and constrain the maximum
          evolution of AGN UV-to-X-ray flux ratios to be less than 30% (1
          sigma)  out  to  z=5.  Using  our sample's high X-ray detection
          fraction,  we  also  find  a  significant anti-correlation (3.0
          sigma)  between  Alpha_OX  and  L_X  .  We  make comparisons to
          earlier  studies  on  this  topic  and discuss implications for
          X-ray vs. optical luminosity functions.

          In  order  to  interpret  the results of complex realistic star
          cluster   simulations,   which   rely   on   many   simplifying
          approximations  and  assumptions,  it is essential to study the
          behavior of even more idealized models, which can highlight the
          essential  physical  effects  and  are  amenable  to more exact
          methods.  With  this  aim,  we  present  the  results of N-body
          calculations  of  the  evolution of equal-mass models, starting
          with primordial binary fractions of 0 - 100 %, with values of N
          ranging  from  256  to 16384. This allows us to extrapolate the
          main  features  of  the  evolution  to  systems  comparable  in
          particle  number with globular clusters. In this range, we find
          that    the   steady-state   `deuterium   main   sequence'   is
          characterized by a ratio of the core radius to half-mass radius
          that follows qualitatively the analytical estimate by Vesperini
          &  Chernoff  (1994),  although the N dependence is steeper than
          expected.  Interestingly,  for  an  initial  binary  fraction f
          greater  than  10%,  the  binary heating in the core during the
          post   collapse   phase   almost   saturates  (becoming  nearly
          independent  of  f),  and so little variation in the structural
          properties   is   observed.   Thus,   although   we  observe  a
          significantly  lower  binary abundance in the core with respect
          to  the Fokker-Planck simulations by Gao et al. (1991), this is
          of  little dynamical consequence. At variance with the study of
          Gao  et al. (1991), we see no sign of gravothermal oscillations
          before  150 halfmass relaxation times. At later times, however,
          oscillations  become prominent. We demonstrate the gravothermal
          nature of these oscillations.

          Title:  Star  Clusters  with Primordial Binaries: II. Dynamical
          Evolution of Models in a Tidal Field
          Authors: M. Trenti, D.C. Heggie, P. Hut
          Comments: 13 pages, 17 figures, MNRAS submitted
          [abridged] We extend our analysis of the dynamical evolution of
          simple  star  cluster  models,  in  order to provide comparison
          standards  that  will  aid  in interpreting the results of more
          complex   realistic   simulations.   We  augment  our  previous
          primordial-binary simulations by introducing a tidal field, and
          starting  with King models of different central concentrations.
          We  present the results of N-body calculations of the evolution
          of equal-mass models, starting with primordial binary fractions
          of  0  - 100 %, and N values from 512 to 16384. We also attempt
          to  extrapolate  some  of  our  results to the larger number of
          particles  that  are  necessary  to model globular clusters. We
          characterize  the  steady-state `deuterium main sequence' phase
          in  which  primordial  binaries are depleted in the core in the
          process  of  `gravitationally  burning'.  In this phase we find
          that  the  ratio  of  the core to half-mass radius, r_c/r_h, is
          similar  to  that measured for isolated systems. In addition to
          the  generation of energy due to hardening and depletion of the
          primordial binary population, the overall evolution of the star
          clusters is driven by a competing process: the tidal disruption
          of  the  system.  We  find  that  the  depletion  of primordial
          binaries  before  tidal  dissolution  of the system is possible
          only  if  the  initial number is below 0.05 N, in the case of a
          King  model  with W_0=7 and N=4096 (which is one of our longest
          living  models).  We compare our findings, obtained by means of
          direct N-body simulations but scaled, where possible, to larger
          N,  with  similar  studies  carried out by means of Monte Carlo
          methods.

          resolution figures available at this http URL
          We  have obtained high resolution images of the central regions
          of  14  reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (AGN) using
          the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  Advanced Camera for Surveys High
          Resolution   Camera   to   account  for  host-galaxy  starlight
          contamination  of  measured  AGN  luminosities.  We measure the
          host-galaxy  starlight contribution to the continuum luminosity
          at  5100  A  through the typical ground-based slit position and
          geometry  used  in the reverberation-mapping campaigns. We find
          that   removing   the   starlight  contribution  results  in  a
          significant  correction to the luminosity of each AGN, both for
          lower  luminosity sources, as expected, but also for the higher
          luminosity sources such as the PG quasars. After accounting for
          the host galaxy starlight, we revisit the well-known broad-line
          region  radius--luminosity relationship for nearby AGN. We find
          the  power-law slope of the relationship for the H beta line to
          be  0.518  +/-  0.039,  shallower  than previously reported and
          consistent  with  the  slope  of  0.5  expected  from the naive
          theoretical  assumption that all AGN have, on average, the same
          ionizing  spectrum  and  the  same ionization parameter and gas
          density in the H beta line-emitting region.

          Title: Stellar Explosions by Magnetic Towers
          Authors: Dmitri A. Uzdensky, Andrew I. MacFadyen
          Comments: 18 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We propose a magnetic mechanism for the collimated explosion of
          a   massive   star  relevant  for  GRBs,  XRFs  and  asymmetric
          supernovae.  We  apply Lynden-Bell's magnetic tower scenario to
          the  interior  of  a  massive  rotating star after the core has
          collapsed  to  form  a  black  hole with an accretion disk or a
          millisecond  magnetar  acting as a central engine. We solve the
          force-free  Grad-Shafranov  equation  to calculate the magnetic
          structure   and  growth  of  a  tower  embedded  in  a  stellar
          environment.  The  pressure  of  the  toroidal  magnetic field,
          continuously  generated by differential rotation of the central
          engine,  drives  a  rapid  expansion  which  becomes vertically
          collimated after lateral force balance with the surrounding gas
          pressure  is  reached. The collimation naturally occurs because
          hoop  stress  concentrates  magnetic  field toward the rotation
          axis  and  inhibits lateral expansion. This leads to the growth
          of a self-collimated magnetic tower. When embedded in a massive
          star, the supersonic expansion of the tower drives a strong bow
          shock  behind  which an over-pressured cocoon forms. The cocoon
          confines  the  tower  by  supplying  collimating  pressure  and
          provides   stabilization   against   disruption   due   to  MHD
          instabilities. Because the tower consists of closed field lines
          starting  and  ending  on the central engine, mixing of baryons
          from  the  cocoon  into  the  tower  is suppressed. The channel
          cleared  by the growing tower is thus plausibly free of baryons
          and  allows  the  escape  of  magnetic  energy from the central
          engine  through  the  star.  While propagating down the stellar
          density   gradient,   the   tower   accelerates   and   becomes
          relativistic.   During   the   expansion,   fast  collisionless
          reconnection  becomes  possible  resulting  in  dissipation  of
          magnetic  energy  which  may  be  responsible  for  GRB  prompt
          emission.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJL
          We  present  the  results  of  an  intermediate  resolution (~2
          angstrom)  spectroscopy of a sample of 37 candidate Lyman alpha
          blobs   and   emitters  at  redshift  z=3.1  using  the  DEIMOS
          spectrograph on the 10 m Keck telescope. The emission lines are
          detected  for all the 37 objects and have variety in their line
          profiles.  The  Lyman  alpha  velocity  widths (FWHM) of the 28
          objects  with  higher  quality  spectra,  measured by fitting a
          single  Gaussian  profile,  are in the range of 150 - 1700 km/s
          and  correlate with the Lyman alpha spatial extents. All the 12
          Lyman  alpha blobs (>16 arcsec^2) have large velocity widths of
          >   500   km/s.  While  there  are  several  possible  physical
          interpretations  of  the Lyman alpha velocity widths (motion of
          gravitationally-bound  gas  clouds, inflows, merging of clumps,
          or  outflows from superwinds), the large velocity widths of the
          Lyman  alpha  blobs  suggest that they are the sites of massive
          galaxy   formation.  If  we  assume  gravitationally-bound  gas
          clouds,  the  dynamical  masses  of  the  Lyman alpha blobs are
          estimated  to  be  ~10^12  -  10^13  Msun. Even for the case of
          outflows,  the  outflow  velocities  are  likely to be the same
          order   of   the  rotation  velocities  as  inferred  from  the
          observational evidence for local starburst galaxies.

          3--2,  4--3,  6--5, HCN J=1--0, 3--2, 4--3, and CI J=1--0 lines
          of  a sample of 30 Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) are
          presented.  These  reveal a tandalizing picture of the physical
          conditions of the molecular gas in these extraordinary galaxies
          ($\rm   L_{FIR}>10^{12}   L_{\odot}$),  with  a  diffuse  phase
          dominating  the  low-J  CO  lines  and a much denser and warmer
          phase  dominating the CO 4-3 and 6-5 and all the HCN lines. The
          CI  J=1--0  emission  was  found to be a robust tracer of their
          total  molecular  gas  mass  under  a  large  range of physical
          conditions,  a  potent  alternative to the much weaker emission
          from  the  $ ^{13}$CO isotopologue, and especially promising as
          an H$_2$ tracer for similar objects at high redshifts.

          The understanding of acceleration mechanisms in active galactic
          nuclei    (AGN)    jets    and    the    measurement   of   the
          extragalactic-background-light (EBL) density are closely linked
          and require the detection of a large sample of very-high-energy
          (VHE)  emitting  extragalactic objects at varying redshifts. We
          report  here  on  the  discovery with the H.E.S.S. (High Energy
          Stereoscopic  System)  atmospheric-Cherenkov  telescopes of the
          VHE  Gamma-ray  emission  from  H2356  - 309, an extreme BL Lac
          object located at a redshift of 0.165. The observations of this
          object,  which was previously proposed as a southern-hemisphere
          VHE  candidate source, were performed between June and December
          2004.  The  total  exposure is 38.9 hours live time, after data
          quality  selection,  which  yields the detection of a signal at
          the level of 9.0$\sigma$ (standard deviations) .

          Velocities   close   to   the  speed  of  light  are  a  robust
          observational property of the jets observed in microquasars and
          AGNs,  and  are expected to be behind much of the phenomenology
          of  GRBs. Yet, the mechanism boosting relativistic jets to such
          large Lorentz factors is still essentially unknown. Building on
          recent  general-relativistic,  multidimensional  simulations of
          progenitors   of  short  GRBs,  we  discuss  a  new  effect  in
          relativistic  hydrodynamics  which  can  act  as  an  efficient
          booster  in  jets.  This  effect  is  purely hydrodynamical and
          occurs  when large velocities tangential to a discontinuity are
          present  in  the  flow,  yielding  Lorentz factors $\Gamma \sim
          10^2-10^3$  or  larger  in  flows with moderate initial Lorentz
          factors.  Although without a Newtonian counterpart, this effect
          can   be   explained   easily   through   the  most  elementary
          hydrodynamical flow: i.e., a relativistic Riemann problem.

          constant

          Comments:  4  pages;  this is a preprint of an article accepted
          for publication in Physical Review D
          Some  tests  of  gravity  theories - periastron shift, geodetic
          precession,  change in mean motion and gravitational redshift -
          are  applied  in  solar  and  stellar  systems to constrain the
          cosmological  constant.  We  thus consider a length scale range
          from 10^8 to 10^{15} km. Best bounds from the solar system come
          from  perihelion advance and change in mean motion of Earth and
          Mars,  Lambda < 10^{-36} km^{-2}. Such a limit falls very short
          to estimates from observational cosmology analyses but a future
          experiment  performing  radio  ranging  observations  of  outer
          planets  could  improve  it by four orders of magnitude. Beyond
          the   solar   system,  together  with  future  measurements  of
          periastron   advance  in  wide  binary  pulsars,  gravitational
          redshift  of  white  dwarfs can provide bounds competitive with
          Mars data.

          Jet  models  for  the  high-energy  emission  of Galactic X-ray
          binary sources have regained significant interest with detailed
          spectral   and  timing  studies  of  the  X-ray  emission  from
          microquasars, the recent detection by the HESS collaboration of
          very-high-energy  gamma-rays  from the microquasar LS~5039, and
          the  earlier  suggestion  of jet models for ultraluminous X-ray
          sources  observed  in  many  nearby galaxies. Here we study the
          synchrotron  and  Compton signatures of time-dependent electron
          injection  and  acceleration,  adiabatic and radiative cooling,
          and   different   jet   geometries  in  the  jets  of  Galactic
          microquasars.    Synchrotron,   synchrotron-self-Compton,   and
          external-Compton radiation processes with soft photons provided
          by  the  companion  star and the accretion disk are treated. An
          analytical  solution  is  presented  to  the  electron  kinetic
          equation  for  general  power-law  geometries  of  the jets for
          Compton  scattering  in  the  Thomson regime. We pay particular
          attention to predictions concerning the rapid flux and spectral
          variability  signatures  expected  in  a  variety of scenarios,
          making   specific   predictions  concerning  possible  spectral
          hysteresis,  similar  to  what has been observed in several TeV
          blazars.  Such  predictions  should  be testable with dedicated
          monitoring    observations   of   Galactic   microquasars   and
          ultraluminous X-ray sources using Chandra and/or XMM-Newton.

          We   present  partial-correlation  analyses  that  examine  the
          strengths of the relationships between L_UV, L_X, Alpha_OX, and
          redshift  for  optically-selected  AGNs.  We extend the work of
          Strateva  et  al. (2005), that analyzed optically-selected AGNs
          from  the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS), by including 52
          moderate-luminosity,  optically-selected AGNs from the COMBO-17
          survey  with  corresponding  deep  (~250  ks  to  1  Ms)  X-ray
          observations  from  the  Extended Chandra Deep Field-South. The
          COMBO-17  survey extends ~3 magnitudes deeper than the SDSS and
          probes  the  moderate-luminosity AGNs that numerically dominate
          the  AGN  population  in the Universe. We also include recently
          published  observations of 19 high-redshift, optically-selected
          AGNs, and 46 luminous, low-redshift AGNs from the Bright Quasar
          Survey.  The  full  sample used in our analysis consists of 333
          AGNs,  extending  out  to  z~6,  with  293  (88%)  having X-ray
          detections.  The sample spans five decades in UV luminosity and
          four  decades  in X-ray luminosity. We confirm that Alpha_OX is
          strongly  anti-correlated  with  L_UV (13.6 sigma), the highest
          significance found for this relation to date, and find evidence
          suggesting  that the slope of this relation may be dependent on
          L_UV.  We  find  that no significant correlation exists between
          Alpha_OX  and  redshift  (1.3 sigma), and constrain the maximum
          evolution of AGN UV-to-X-ray flux ratios to be less than 30% (1
          sigma)  out  to  z=5.  Using  our sample's high X-ray detection
          fraction,  we  also  find  a  significant anti-correlation (3.0
          sigma)  between  Alpha_OX  and  L_X  .  We  make comparisons to
          earlier  studies  on  this  topic  and discuss implications for
          X-ray vs. optical luminosity functions.

          Title:  Star  Clusters  with  Primordial Binaries: I. Dynamical
          Evolution of Isolated Models
          Authors: D.C. Heggie, M. Trenti, P. Hut
          Comments: 14 pages, 22 figures, MNRAS accepted
          In  order  to  interpret  the results of complex realistic star
          cluster   simulations,   which   rely   on   many   simplifying
          approximations  and  assumptions,  it is essential to study the
          behavior of even more idealized models, which can highlight the
          essential  physical  effects  and  are  amenable  to more exact
          methods.  With  this  aim,  we  present  the  results of N-body
          calculations  of  the  evolution of equal-mass models, starting
          with primordial binary fractions of 0 - 100 %, with values of N
          ranging  from  256  to 16384. This allows us to extrapolate the
          main  features  of  the  evolution  to  systems  comparable  in
          particle  number with globular clusters. In this range, we find
          that    the   steady-state   `deuterium   main   sequence'   is
          characterized by a ratio of the core radius to half-mass radius
          that follows qualitatively the analytical estimate by Vesperini
          &  Chernoff  (1994),  although the N dependence is steeper than
          expected.  Interestingly,  for  an  initial  binary  fraction f
          greater  than  10%,  the  binary heating in the core during the
          post   collapse   phase   almost   saturates  (becoming  nearly
          independent  of  f),  and so little variation in the structural
          properties   is   observed.   Thus,   although   we  observe  a
          significantly  lower  binary abundance in the core with respect
          to  the Fokker-Planck simulations by Gao et al. (1991), this is
          of  little dynamical consequence. At variance with the study of
          Gao  et al. (1991), we see no sign of gravothermal oscillations
          before  150 halfmass relaxation times. At later times, however,
          oscillations  become prominent. We demonstrate the gravothermal
          nature of these oscillations.

          Title:  Star  Clusters  with Primordial Binaries: II. Dynamical
          Evolution of Models in a Tidal Field
          Authors: M. Trenti, D.C. Heggie, P. Hut
          Comments: 13 pages, 17 figures, MNRAS submitted
          [abridged] We extend our analysis of the dynamical evolution of
          simple  star  cluster  models,  in  order to provide comparison
          standards  that  will  aid  in interpreting the results of more
          complex   realistic   simulations.   We  augment  our  previous
          primordial-binary simulations by introducing a tidal field, and
          starting  with King models of different central concentrations.
          We  present the results of N-body calculations of the evolution
          of equal-mass models, starting with primordial binary fractions
          of  0  - 100 %, and N values from 512 to 16384. We also attempt
          to  extrapolate  some  of  our  results to the larger number of
          particles  that  are  necessary  to model globular clusters. We
          characterize  the  steady-state `deuterium main sequence' phase
          in  which  primordial  binaries are depleted in the core in the
          process  of  `gravitationally  burning'.  In this phase we find
          that  the  ratio  of  the core to half-mass radius, r_c/r_h, is
          similar  to  that measured for isolated systems. In addition to
          the  generation of energy due to hardening and depletion of the
          primordial binary population, the overall evolution of the star
          clusters is driven by a competing process: the tidal disruption
          of  the  system.  We  find  that  the  depletion  of primordial
          binaries  before  tidal  dissolution  of the system is possible
          only  if  the  initial number is below 0.05 N, in the case of a
          King  model  with W_0=7 and N=4096 (which is one of our longest
          living  models).  We compare our findings, obtained by means of
          direct N-body simulations but scaled, where possible, to larger
          N,  with  similar  studies  carried out by means of Monte Carlo
          methods.

          We  have obtained high resolution images of the central regions
          of  14  reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (AGN) using
          the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  Advanced Camera for Surveys High
          Resolution   Camera   to   account  for  host-galaxy  starlight
          contamination  of  measured  AGN  luminosities.  We measure the
          host-galaxy  starlight contribution to the continuum luminosity
          at  5100  A  through the typical ground-based slit position and
          geometry  used  in the reverberation-mapping campaigns. We find
          that   removing   the   starlight  contribution  results  in  a
          significant  correction to the luminosity of each AGN, both for
          lower  luminosity sources, as expected, but also for the higher
          luminosity sources such as the PG quasars. After accounting for
          the host galaxy starlight, we revisit the well-known broad-line
          region  radius--luminosity relationship for nearby AGN. We find
          the  power-law slope of the relationship for the H beta line to
          be  0.518  +/-  0.039,  shallower  than previously reported and
          consistent  with  the  slope  of  0.5  expected  from the naive
          theoretical  assumption that all AGN have, on average, the same
          ionizing  spectrum  and  the  same ionization parameter and gas
          density in the H beta line-emitting region.

          Title: Stellar Explosions by Magnetic Towers
          Authors: Dmitri A. Uzdensky, Andrew I. MacFadyen
          Comments: 18 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We propose a magnetic mechanism for the collimated explosion of
          a   massive   star  relevant  for  GRBs,  XRFs  and  asymmetric
          supernovae.  We  apply Lynden-Bell's magnetic tower scenario to
          the  interior  of  a  massive  rotating star after the core has
          collapsed  to  form  a  black  hole with an accretion disk or a
          millisecond  magnetar  acting as a central engine. We solve the
          force-free  Grad-Shafranov  equation  to calculate the magnetic
          structure   and  growth  of  a  tower  embedded  in  a  stellar
          environment.  The  pressure  of  the  toroidal  magnetic field,
          continuously  generated by differential rotation of the central
          engine,  drives  a  rapid  expansion  which  becomes vertically
          collimated after lateral force balance with the surrounding gas
          pressure  is  reached. The collimation naturally occurs because
          hoop  stress  concentrates  magnetic  field toward the rotation
          axis  and  inhibits lateral expansion. This leads to the growth
          of a self-collimated magnetic tower. When embedded in a massive
          star, the supersonic expansion of the tower drives a strong bow
          shock  behind  which an over-pressured cocoon forms. The cocoon
          confines  the  tower  by  supplying  collimating  pressure  and
          provides   stabilization   against   disruption   due   to  MHD
          instabilities. Because the tower consists of closed field lines
          starting  and  ending  on the central engine, mixing of baryons
          from  the  cocoon  into  the  tower  is suppressed. The channel
          cleared  by the growing tower is thus plausibly free of baryons
          and  allows  the  escape  of  magnetic  energy from the central
          engine  through  the  star.  While propagating down the stellar
          density   gradient,   the   tower   accelerates   and   becomes
          relativistic.   During   the   expansion,   fast  collisionless
          reconnection  becomes  possible  resulting  in  dissipation  of
          magnetic  energy  which  may  be  responsible  for  GRB  prompt
          emission.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJL
          We  present  the  results  of  an  intermediate  resolution (~2
          angstrom)  spectroscopy of a sample of 37 candidate Lyman alpha
          blobs   and   emitters  at  redshift  z=3.1  using  the  DEIMOS
          spectrograph on the 10 m Keck telescope. The emission lines are
          detected  for all the 37 objects and have variety in their line
          profiles.  The  Lyman  alpha  velocity  widths (FWHM) of the 28
          objects  with  higher  quality  spectra,  measured by fitting a
          single  Gaussian  profile,  are in the range of 150 - 1700 km/s
          and  correlate with the Lyman alpha spatial extents. All the 12
          Lyman  alpha blobs (>16 arcsec^2) have large velocity widths of
          >   500   km/s.  While  there  are  several  possible  physical
          interpretations  of  the Lyman alpha velocity widths (motion of
          gravitationally-bound  gas  clouds, inflows, merging of clumps,
          or  outflows from superwinds), the large velocity widths of the
          Lyman  alpha  blobs  suggest that they are the sites of massive
          galaxy   formation.  If  we  assume  gravitationally-bound  gas
          clouds,  the  dynamical  masses  of  the  Lyman alpha blobs are
          estimated  to  be  ~10^12  -  10^13  Msun. Even for the case of
          outflows,  the  outflow  velocities  are  likely to be the same
          order   of   the  rotation  velocities  as  inferred  from  the
          observational evidence for local starburst galaxies.

          3--2,  4--3,  6--5, HCN J=1--0, 3--2, 4--3, and CI J=1--0 lines
          of  a sample of 30 Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) are
          presented.  These  reveal a tandalizing picture of the physical
          conditions of the molecular gas in these extraordinary galaxies
          ($\rm   L_{FIR}>10^{12}   L_{\odot}$),  with  a  diffuse  phase
          dominating  the  low-J  CO  lines  and a much denser and warmer
          phase  dominating the CO 4-3 and 6-5 and all the HCN lines. The
          CI  J=1--0  emission  was  found to be a robust tracer of their
          total  molecular  gas  mass  under  a  large  range of physical
          conditions,  a  potent  alternative to the much weaker emission
          from  the  $ ^{13}$CO isotopologue, and especially promising as
          an H$_2$ tracer for similar objects at high redshifts.

          The understanding of acceleration mechanisms in active galactic
          nuclei    (AGN)    jets    and    the    measurement   of   the
          extragalactic-background-light (EBL) density are closely linked

          (VHE)  emitting  extragalactic objects at varying redshifts. We
          report  here  on  the  discovery with the H.E.S.S. (High Energy
          Stereoscopic  System)  atmospheric-Cherenkov  telescopes of the
          VHE  Gamma-ray  emission  from  H2356  - 309, an extreme BL Lac

          object,  which was previously proposed as a southern-hemisphere
          VHE  candidate source, were performed between June and December
          2004.  The  total  exposure is 38.9 hours live time, after data
          quality  selection,  which  yields the detection of a signal at
          the level of 9.0$\sigma$ (standard deviations) .

          Velocities   close   to   the  speed  of  light  are  a  robust
          observational property of the jets observed in microquasars and
          AGNs,  and  are expected to be behind much of the phenomenology
          of  GRBs. Yet, the mechanism boosting relativistic jets to such
          large Lorentz factors is still essentially unknown. Building on
          recent  general-relativistic,  multidimensional  simulations of
          progenitors   of  short  GRBs,  we  discuss  a  new  effect  in
          relativistic  hydrodynamics  which  can  act  as  an  efficient
          booster  in  jets.  This  effect  is  purely hydrodynamical and
          occurs  when large velocities tangential to a discontinuity are
          present  in  the  flow,  yielding  Lorentz factors $\Gamma \sim
          10^2-10^3$  or  larger  in  flows with moderate initial Lorentz
          factors.  Although without a Newtonian counterpart, this effect
          can   be   explained   easily   through   the  most  elementary
          hydrodynamical flow: i.e., a relativistic Riemann problem.

          Comments:  4  pages;  this is a preprint of an article accepted
          for publication in Physical Review D
          Some  tests  of  gravity  theories - periastron shift, geodetic
          precession,  change in mean motion and gravitational redshift -
          are  applied  in  solar  and  stellar  systems to constrain the
          cosmological  constant.  We  thus consider a length scale range
          from 10^8 to 10^{15} km. Best bounds from the solar system come
          from  perihelion advance and change in mean motion of Earth and
          Mars,  Lambda < 10^{-36} km^{-2}. Such a limit falls very short
          to estimates from observational cosmology analyses but a future
          experiment  performing  radio  ranging  observations  of  outer
          planets  could  improve  it by four orders of magnitude. Beyond
          the   solar   system,  together  with  future  measurements  of
          periastron   advance  in  wide  binary  pulsars,  gravitational
          redshift  of  white  dwarfs can provide bounds competitive with
          Mars data.

          Jet  models  for  the  high-energy  emission  of Galactic X-ray
          binary sources have regained significant interest with detailed
          spectral   and  timing  studies  of  the  X-ray  emission  from
          microquasars, the recent detection by the HESS collaboration of
          very-high-energy  gamma-rays  from the microquasar LS~5039, and
          the  earlier  suggestion  of jet models for ultraluminous X-ray
          sources  observed  in  many  nearby galaxies. Here we study the
          synchrotron  and  Compton signatures of time-dependent electron
          injection  and  acceleration,  adiabatic and radiative cooling,
          and   different   jet   geometries  in  the  jets  of  Galactic
          microquasars.    Synchrotron,   synchrotron-self-Compton,   and
          external-Compton radiation processes with soft photons provided
          by  the  companion  star and the accretion disk are treated. An
          analytical  solution  is  presented  to  the  electron  kinetic
          equation  for  general  power-law  geometries  of  the jets for
          Compton  scattering  in  the  Thomson regime. We pay particular
          attention to predictions concerning the rapid flux and spectral
          variability  signatures  expected  in  a  variety of scenarios,
          making   specific   predictions  concerning  possible  spectral
          hysteresis,  similar  to  what has been observed in several TeV
          blazars.  Such  predictions  should  be testable with dedicated
          monitoring    observations   of   Galactic   microquasars   and
          ultraluminous X-ray sources using Chandra and/or XMM-Newton.

          We  present  the results of a high-resolution imaging survey of
          22 brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the nearby (~145 pc)
          young (~1-2 Myr) low-density star-forming region Taurus-Auriga.

          and  F850LP (z') filters. This survey confirmed the binarity of

          V410-Xray3,  resulting  in  a  binary  fraction  of  9+/-5%  at
          separations  >4  AU. Both binary systems are tight (<10 AU) and
          they  possess  mass  ratios of 0.75 and 0.46, respectively. The
          binary  frequency  and separations are consistent with low-mass
          binary   properties  in  the  field,  but  the  mass  ratio  of
          V410-Xray3  is  among the lowest known. We find that the binary
          frequency is higher for very low mass stars and high-mass brown
          dwarfs  than  for  lower-mass  brown  dwarfs, implying either a
          decline  in frequency or a shift to smaller separations for the
          lowest mass binaries. Combining these results with multiplicity
          statistics  for  higher-mass  Taurus members suggests a gradual
          decline  in  binary frequency and separation toward low masses.
          The  implication is that the distinct binary properties of very
          low-mass   systems  are  set  during  formation  and  that  the
          formation  process  is  similar  to  the  process which creates
          higher-mass stellar binaries, but occurs on a smaller scale. We
          show  that  there  are no planets or very low-mass brown dwarfs
          with mass >3 M_J at projected separation >40 AU orbiting any of
          the  Taurus members in our sample. We identify several BDs with
          significant (>1 mag) V-band excesses. The excesses appear to be
          correlated  with  signatures of accretion, and if attributed to
          accretion  luminosity,  may  imply mass accretion rates several
          orders  of  magnitude  above  those  inferred from line-profile
          analyses. (abridged)

          Title: ZZ Ceti Stars: Fractal Analogues of Excited Helium Ions?
          Authors: R. L. Oldershaw
          Comments: 17 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables, comments welcome
          Multi-periodic  pulsation  phenomena  of ZZ Ceti variable stars
          are  analyzed  within  the  context  of  a fractal cosmological
          paradigm  that emphasizes discrete self-similarity in nature. A
          quantitative test comparing relevant stellar and atomic periods
          provides  preliminary  support  for  the  analysis.  This paper
          completes  a  3-part  series  that  explores the possibility of
          discrete  cosmological  self-similarity  in variable stars; the
          first  and  second  papers  discussed  RR Lyrae and delta Scuti
          stars, respectively.

          The  spectral,  timing, and jet formation properties of neutron
          stars  in  low  mass x-ray binary systems are influenced by the
          presence of central magnetic moments. Similar features shown by
          the galactic black hole candidates (GBHC) strongly suggest that
          their compact cores might be intrinsically magnetic as well. We
          show  that  the  existence  of  intrinsically  magnetic GBHC is
          consistent  with a new class of solutions of the Einstein field
          equations of General Relativity. These solutions are based on a
          strict  adherence to the Strong Principle of Equivalence (SPOE)
          requirement that the world lines of physical matter must remain
          timelike  in all regions of spacetime. The new solutions emerge
          when  the  structure  and  radiation transfer properties of the
          energy  momentum  tensor on the right hand side of the Einstein
          field equations are appropriately chosen to dynamically enforce
          this  SPOE  requirement of timelike world line completeness. In
          this  context,  we find that the Einstein field equations allow
          the  existence of highly red shifted, Magnetospheric, Eternally
          Collapsing  Objects  (MECO). MECO necessarily possess intrinsic
          magnetic  moments  and  they  do not have trapped surfaces that
          lead  to event horizons and curvature singularities. Their most
          striking  features  are  equipartition  magnetic  fields,  pair
          plasma  atmospheres  and extreme gravitational redshifts. Since
          MECO  lifetimes  are  orders of magnitude greater than a Hubble
          time,  they  provide  an  elegant  and  unified  framework  for
          understanding  a broad range of observations of GBHC and active
          galactic  nuclei.  We  examine  their  spectral, timing and jet
          formation  properties  and  discuss  characteristics that might
          lead to their confirmation.

          Title:  Re-Identification  of the `Enigmatic' X-ray Source 1RXS
          J114003.0+124112
          Authors: J. Wu, T. Movsessian, Y. Chen, X. He, X. Zhou, J. Ma
          Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures, to be published in ChJAA
          The  ROSAT X-ray source 1RXS J114003.0+124112 was identified as
          a  starburst  galaxy  at  redshift  0.177  by He et al. (2001).
          Meanwhile, the authors also noted that the source is almost two
          orders  of magnitude brighter in X-ray than the X-ray-brightest
          starburst galaxy and it seems to be in a merging system, making
          this  source an enigmatic system for further observations. This
          paper  reports  the  re-identification of 1RXS J114003.0+124112
          with  the  observations  on  the  2.6  m  telescope at Byurakan
          Astrophysical  Observatory, Armenia and with the SDSS data. The
          results indicate that the starburst activity is associated with
          the  brighter object in the system, while the fainter object is
          a  typical  Seyfert  1 galaxy at redshift 0.282. Therefore, the
          two  objects  are  not  in  a merging system, and the Seyfert 1
          galaxy  naturally  accounts for the high X-ray flux. Three more
          objects  reside  in the vicinity, but they are all too faint to
          be responsible for the high X-ray flux.

          Star Collapsing to A Black Hole

          Comments:   42   pages,   accepted   for   publication  in  the
          Astrophysical  Journal.  A paper with higher-resolution figures
          available at this http URL
          We  perform  two-dimensional, axisymmetric, magnetohydrodynamic
          simulations  of  the collapse of a rotating star of 40 Msun and
          in  the  light  of  the  collapsar  model  of  gamma-ray burst.
          Considering  two  distributions of angular momentum, up to \sim
          10^{17}  cm^2/s,  and  the  uniform vertical magnetic field, we
          investigate  the  formation of an accretion disk around a black
          hole  and  the  jet  production  near  the hole. After material
          reaches  to  the black hole with the high angular momentum, the
          disk is formed inside a surface of weak shock. The disk becomes
          in  a quasi-steady state for stars whose magnetic field is less
          than 10^{10} G before the collapse. We find that the jet can be
          driven by the magnetic fields even if the central core does not
          rotate as rapidly as previously assumed and outer layers of the
          star  has  sufficiently  high  angular  momentum.  The magnetic
          fields  are  chiefly  amplified  inside  the  disk  due  to the
          compression  and  the  wrapping of the field. The fields inside
          the disk propagate to the polar region along the inner boundary
          near the black hole through the Alfv{\'e}n wave, and eventually
          drive    the   jet.   The   quasi-steady   disk   is   not   an
          advection-dominated  disk but a neutrino cooling-dominated one.
          Mass  accretion  rates  in  the  disks  are  greater  than 0.01
          Msun/sec  with  large fluctuations. The disk is transparent for
          neutrinos.  The  dense part of the disk, which locates near the
          hole,  emits  neutrino  efficiently  at  a constant rate of < 8
          \times  10^{51}  erg/s. The neutrino luminosity is much smaller
          than those from supernovae after the neutrino burst.

          Title:  Evolutionary  Paths for Galaxies and AGNs: New Insights
          by the Spitzer Space Telescope
          Authors: A. Franceschini, G. Rodighiero, S. Berta, P. Cassata
          Comments:  invited  review  at  the Workshop on "AGN and galaxy
          evolution",  Specola  Vaticana,  Castel  Gandolfo,  Italy,  3-6
          October 2005
          We compare the history of the galaxy mass build-up, as inferred
          from  near-IR  observations,  and  the  Star  Formation Rate of
          massive  stars  in the comoving volume traced by deep extensive
          far-IR  surveys,  both  possible  now  with  the  Spitzer Space
          Telescope.  These  two independent and complementary approaches
          to the history of galaxy formation consistently indicate that a
          wide  interval  of  cosmic epochs between z~0.7 to z~2 brackets
          the main evolutionary phases. The rate of the integrated galaxy
          mass  growth  indicated  by  the  IR-based comoving SFR appears
          consistent  with  the  observed  decrease  of  the stellar mass
          densities  with  redshift.  There are also indications that the
          evolution  with  z  of  the  total population depends on galaxy
          mass, being stronger for moderate-mass, but almost absent up to
          z=1.4 for high-mass galaxies, thus confirming previous evidence
          for a "downsizing" effect in galaxy formation. The most massive
          galaxies  appear  already  mostly  in  place by z~1. Although a
          precise  matching  of  this  galaxy build-up with the growth of
          nuclear  super-massive  black-holes  is  not  possible with the
          present data (due to difficulties for an accurate census of the
          obscured AGN phenomenon), some preliminary indications reveal a
          similar mass/luminosity dependence for AGN evolution as for the
          hosting galaxies.

          Title:  The  Structure of the Homunculus: I. Shape and Latitude
          Dependence from H2 and [Fe II] Velocity Maps of Eta Carinae
          Authors: Nathan Smith
          Comments: 25 pages, figs 2 and 3 in color. Accepted by ApJ
          High  resolution  long-slit  spectra  obtained with the Phoenix
          spectrograph on Gemini South provide our most accurate probe of
          the  three  dimensional  structure of the Homunculus around eta
          Car.  The  new  near-infrared  spectra dramatically confirm the
          double-shell  structure  inferred  previously from thermal dust
          emission,  resolving  the  nebula  into a very thin outer shell
          seen in H2 21218, and a warmer, thicker inner layer seen in [Fe
          II]  16435. The thin H2 skin hints that the most important mass
          loss during the 19th century eruption had a very short duration
          of  less than 5 yr. H2 emission traces the majority of the mass
          in the nebula, and has an average density of order 10^6.5 cm-3.
          This  emission, in turn, yields our first definitive picture of
          the  exact  shape of the nebula, plus a distance of 2350pm50 pc
          and  an  inclination  angle  of 41deg (the polar axis is tilted
          49deg  from  the  plane of the sky). The distribution of the H2
          emission  provides the first measure of the latitude dependence
          of the speed, mass loss, and kinetic energy associated with eta
          Car's  19th  century  explosion. Almost 75 percent of the total
          mass  and  more  than  90  percent of the kinetic energy in the
          ejecta  were released at high latitudes. This rules out a model
          for  the bipolar shape wherein an otherwise spherical explosion
          was  pinched  at  the waist by a circumstellar torus. Also, the
          ejecta  could not have been deflected toward polar trajectories
          by  a  companion  star,  since  the kinetic energy of the polar
          ejecta  is  greater  than  the  binding  energy of the putative
          binary  system.  Instead, most of the mass appears to have been
          directed poleward by the explosion itself. [abridged]

          Title: Understanding the Stellar Initial Mass Function
          Authors: Richard B. Larson
          Comments:  5  pages,  text  only. Invited talk presented at the
          11th   Latin  American  Regional  IAU  Meeting,  Pucon,  Chile,
          December   2005.   To  be  published  by  Revista  Mexicana  de
          Astronomia y Astrofisica
          The  essential  features  of stellar Initial Mass Function are,
          rather generally, (1) a peak at mass of a few tenths of a solar
          mass,  and  (2)  a  power-law tail toward higher masses that is
          similar to the original Salpeter function. Recent work suggests
          that  the  IMF peak reflects a preferred scale of fragmentation
          associated with the transition from a cooling phase of collapse
          at  low  densities  to  a  nearly  isothermal  phase  at higher
          densities, where the gas becomes thermally coupled to the dust.
          The Salpeter power law is plausibly produced, at least in part,
          by  scale-free  accretion processes that build up massive stars
          in  dense  environments. The young stars at the Galactic Center
          appear  to  have  unusually  high masses, possibly because of a
          high  minimum mass resulting from the high opacity of the dense
          star-forming gas.

          The  observability of gravitational waves from supermassive and
          intermediate-mass   black   holes   by   the  forecoming  Laser
          Interferometer  Space  Antenna  (LISA),  and the physics we can
          learn  from the observations, will depend on two basic factors:
          the event rates for massive black hole mergers occurring in the
          LISA  best sensitivity window, and our theoretical knowledge of
          the  gravitational waveforms. We first provide a concise review
          of  the  literature  on LISA event rates for massive black hole
          mergers, as predicted by different formation scenarios. Then we
          discuss  what  (in  our  view)  are  the  most urgent issues to
          address  in terms of waveform modelling. For massive black hole
          binary  inspiral  these  include spin precession, eccentricity,
          the  effect of high-order Post-Newtonian terms in the amplitude
          and  phase,  and  an accurate prediction of the transition from
          inspiral   to   plunge.  For  black  hole  ringdown,  numerical
          relativity   will  ultimately  be  required  to  determine  the
          relative   quasinormal  mode  excitation,  and  to  reduce  the
          dimensionality of the template space in matched filtering.

          We  use  a  sample  of  87  rest-frame UV-selected star-forming
          galaxies  with  mean spectroscopic redshift z=2.26 to study the
          correlation  between  metallicity  and  stellar  mass  at  high
          redshift.  Using  stellar masses determined from SED fitting to
          0.3-8  micron photometry, we divide the sample into six bins in
          stellar mass, and construct six composite H-alpha+[NII] spectra
          from  all  of  the  objects  in  each bin. We estimate the mean
          oxygen  abundance in each bin from the [NII]/H-alpha ratio, and
          find  a  monotonic  increase  in  metallicity  with  increasing
          stellar mass, from 12+log(O/H) < 8.2 for galaxies with <M_star>
          =  2.7e9 Msun to 12+log(O/H) = 8.6 for galaxies with <M_star> =
          1e11 Msun. We use the empirical relation between star formation
          rate  density  and gas density to estimate the gas fractions of
          the   galaxies,  finding  an  increase  in  gas  fraction  with
          decreasing  stellar mass. These gas fractions combined with the
          observed  metallicities  allow  the estimation of the effective
          yield  y_eff  as  a  function  of stellar mass; in constrast to
          observations  in  the  local  universe which show a decrease in
          y_eff with decreasing baryonic mass, we find a slight increase.
          Such  a  variation of metallicity with gas fraction is best fit
          by  a  model with supersolar yield and an outflow rate ~4 times
          higher  than  the  star  formation  rate.  We conclude that the
          mass-metallicity  relation  at  high  redshift is driven by the
          increase  in  metallicity as the gas fraction decreases through
          star  formation,  and  is  likely  modulated by metal loss from
          strong outflows in galaxies of all masses. There is no evidence
          for  preferential  loss of metals from low mass galaxies as has
          been suggested in the local universe. [Abridged]

          We  solve  for  the  time-dependent  dynamics  of axisymmetric,
          general  relativistic  magnetohydrodynamic  winds from rotating
          neutron stars. The mass loss rate is obtained self-consistently
          as a solution to the MHD equations, subject to a finite thermal
          pressure  at the stellar surface. We consider both monopole and
          dipole  magnetic  field geometries and we explore the parameter
          regime  extending  from low magnetization (low-sigma_o), almost
          thermally-driven  winds  to  high magnetization (high-sigma_o),
          relativistic  Poynting-flux  dominated outflows. We compute the
          angular momentum and rotational energy loss rates as a function
          of  sigma_o  and  compare  with  analytic expectations from the
          classical  theory  of  pulsars and magnetized stellar winds. In
          the   case  of  the  monopole,  our  high-sigma_o  calculations
          asymptotically  approach  the  analytic force-free limit. If we
          define the spindown rate in terms of the open magnetic flux, we
          similarly  reproduce  the  spindown rate from recent force-free
          calculations  of  the aligned dipole. However, even for sigma_o
          as  high  as ~20, we find that the location of the Y-type point
          (r_Y), which specifies the radius of the last closed field line
          in  the  equatorial  plane,  is  not  the  radius  of the light
          cylinder  R_L  =  c/omega  (R  =  cylindrical  radius),  as has
          previously  been  assumed  in  most  estimates  and  force-free
          calculations.   Instead,   although   the   Alfven   radius  at
          intermediate   latitudes  quickly  approaches  R_L  as  sigma_o
          exceeds unity, r_Y remains significantly less than R_L. Because
          r_Y  <  R_L,  our  calculated  spindown  rates  thus exceed the
          classic  ``vacuum  dipole'' rate. We discussthe implications of
          our   results   for  models  of  rotation-powered  pulsars  and

          Title:  A  New Search Paradigm for Correlated Neutrino Emission
          from  Discrete GRBs using Antarctic Cherenkov Telescopes in the

          Proceedings  of  The  16th  Annual  Astrophysics  Conference in
          Maryland:  Gamma Ray Bursts in the Swift Era. Edited by Stephen
          S. Holt, Neil Gehrels and John A. Nousek (2006)
          We  describe  the  theoretical modeling and analysis techniques
          associated  with  a  preliminary search for correlated neutrino
          emission   from  GRB980703a,  which  triggered  the  Burst  and
          Transient  Source  Experiment  (BATSE  GRB trigger 6891), using
          archived  data  from  the  Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector
          Array (AMANDA-B10). Under the assumption of associated hadronic
          acceleration,  the  expected  observed  neutrino energy flux is
          directly   derived,   based   upon   confronting  the  fireball
          phenomenology with the discrete set of observed electromagnetic
          parameters   of   GRB980703a,  gleaned  from  ground-based  and
          satellite   observations,   for   four  models,  corrected  for
          oscillations.  Models  1  and  2,  based upon spectral analysis
          featuring  a  prompt  photon  energy  fit to the Band function,
          utilize  an  observed spectroscopic redshift, for isotropic and
          anisotropic  emission  geometry, respectively. Model 3 is based
          upon  averaged  burst  parameters, assuming isotropic emission.
          Model  4, based upon a Band fit, features an estimated redshift
          from  the  lag-luminosity  relation  with  isotropic  emission.
          Consistent  with  our  AMANDA-II  analysis  of GRB030329, which
          resulted  in  a flux upper limit of ~0.150 GeV/cm^2/s for model
          1,  we  find  differences in excess of an order of magnitude in
          the  response  of  AMANDA-B10,  among  the  various  models for
          GRB980703a.  Implications  for  future  searches  in the era of
          Swift and IceCube are discussed.

          Title:  Strongly  induced collapse in the Class 0 protostar NGC
          1333 IRAS 4A
          Authors: A. Belloche, P. Hennebelle, P. Andre
          Comments: Accepted by A&A. 12 pages, 10 figures
          The  onset  of gravitational collapse in cluster-forming clouds
          is still poorly known. Our goal is to use the Class 0 protostar
          IRAS  4A,  which is undergoing collapse in the active molecular
          cloud  NGC  1333,  to  set  constraints  on  this  process.  In
          particular  we  want  to  measure  the  mass  infall  rate  and
          investigate whether the collapse could have been triggered by a
          strong  external  perturbation.  We  analyze existing continuum
          observations  to  derive the density structure of the envelope,
          and  use our new molecular line observations done with the IRAM
          30m  telescope  to  probe  its velocity structure. We perform a
          detailed  comparison of this set of data with a numerical model
          of  collapse triggered by a fast external compression. Both the
          density  and  velocity  structures  of the envelope can be well
          fitted  by  this  model  of collapse induced by a fast external
          compression  for  a  time elapsed since point mass formation of
          1-2  x  10**4 yr. We deduce a large mass infall rate of 0.7-2 x
          10**-4  Msun/yr.  The momentum required for the perturbation to
          produce this large mass infall rate is of the same order as the
          momenta  measured  for  the  NGC  1333  numerous  outflows. Our
          analysis  shows  also that the turbulence is highly non uniform
          in  the  envelope,  dropping from supersonic to subsonic values
          toward the center. The inner subsonic turbulence is most likely
          a  relic  of the conditions prevailing in the dense core before
          the  onset of collapse. The vigorous collapse undergone by IRAS
          4A  was  triggered  by  a  fast  external compression, probably
          related  to  the expansion of a nearby cavity, which could have
          triggered  the collapse of the nearby Class 0 protostar IRAS 4B
          simultaneously.  This  cavity  could  have been generated by an
          outflow  but  we  have  not found a good protostellar candidate
          yet.

          Title:  The  dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump
          systems
          Authors:  Simon  Goodchild  (1), Gordon Ogilvie (1,2) ((1) IoA,
          Cambridge, (2) DAMTP, Cambridge)
          Comments:  10  pages,  11  figures. Accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We   have   applied  an  eccentric  accretion  disc  theory  in
          simplified  form  to  the case of an accretion disc in a binary
          system,  where  the  disc  contains the 3:1 Lindblad resonance.
          This  is relevant to the case of superhumps in SU Ursae Majoris
          cataclysmic  variables  and  other systems, where it is thought
          that  this  resonance  leads  to  growth  of eccentricity and a
          modulation  in  the  light  curve  due  to the interaction of a
          precessing   eccentric  disc  with  tidal  stresses.  A  single
          differential   equation   is  formulated  which  describes  the
          propagation,   resonant   excitation  and  viscous  damping  of
          eccentricity. The theory is first worked out in the simple case
          of  a  narrow  ring  and  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  the
          eccentricity distribution is locally suppressed by the presence
          of  the  resonance,  creating  a dip in the eccentricity at the
          resonant  radius.  Application  of this theory to the superhump
          case  confirms  this  conclusion  and  produces a more accurate
          expression  for  the  precession rate of the disc than has been
          previously accomplished with simple dynamical estimates.

          With  the  discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Ibata
          et  al.  1994),  a galaxy caught in the process of merging with
          the  Milky  Way,  the  hunt for other such accretion events has
          become  a  very  active  field  of  astrophysical research. The
          identification  of  a stellar ring-like structure in Monoceros,
          spanning  more  than 100 degrees (Newberg et al. 2002), and the
          detection  of  an  overdensity of stars in the direction of the
          constellation  of  Canis  Major  (CMa,  Martin  et  al.  2004),
          apparently  associated  to  the ring, has led to the widespread
          belief that a second galaxy being cannibalised by the Milky Way
          had  been found. In this scenario, the overdensity would be the
          remaining  core  of  the disrupted galaxy and the ring would be
          the  tidal  debris left behind. However, unlike the Sagittarius
          dwarf,  which is well below the Galactic plane and whose orbit,
          and  thus  tidal  tail, is nearly perpendicular to the plane of
          the  Milky  Way,  the  putative  CMa galaxy and ring are nearly
          co-planar with the Galactic disk. This severely complicates the
          interpretation  of  observations.  In this letter, we show that
          our  new  description  of  the  Milky Way leads to a completely
          different  picture.  We  argue that the Norma-Cygnus spiral arm
          defines  a  distant  stellar  ring  crossing  Monoceros and the
          overdensity  is simply a projection effect of looking along the
          nearby  local  arm.  Our  perspective sheds new light on a very
          poorly  known  region, the third Galactic quadrant (3GQ), where
          CMa is located.

          Title:  Radiative Transfer Modeling of Three-Dimensional Clumpy
          AGN Tori and its Application to NGC 1068
          Authors: S. F. Hoenig, T. Beckert, K. Ohnaka, G. Weigelt
          Comments:  16  pages, 16 figures, 6 tables (figures reduced due
          to 
astro-ph limitations); accepted by A&A
          Recent  observations of NGC 1068 and other AGN support the idea
          of  a  geometrically and optically thick dust torus surrounding
          the  central supermassive black hole and accretion disk of AGN.
          In  type  2  AGN, the torus is seen roughly edge-on, leading to
          obscuration  of  the  central  radiation  source and a silicate
          absorption  feature  near  10 micron. While most of the current
          torus  models  distribute  the  dust smoothly, there is growing
          evidence  that the dust must be arranged in clouds. We describe
          a  new  method  for modeling near- and mid-infrared emission of
          3-dimensional  clumpy  tori  using  Monte Carlo simulations. We
          calculate  the radiation fields of individual clouds at various
          distances  from  the AGN and distribute these clouds within the
          torus region. The properties of the individual clouds and their
          distribution within the torus are determined from a theoretical
          approach of self-gravitating clouds close to the shear limit in
          a  gravitational  potential.  We demonstrate that clumpiness in
          AGN  tori  can overcome the problem of over-pronounced silicate
          features.  Finally,  we  present  model  calculations  for  the
          prototypical  Seyfert  2  galaxy  NGC  1068 and compare them to
          recent  high-resolution  measurements.  Our  model  is  able to
          reproduce  both the SED and the interferometric observations of
          NGC 1068 in the near- and mid-infrared.

          Cosmological   hydrodynamic   simulations   have  significantly
          improved over the past several years, and we have already shown
          that  the observed properties of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at
          z=3  can  be  explained  well  by  the  massive galaxies in the
          simulations.  Here  we extend our study to z=6 and show that we
          obtain  good  agreement  for  the LBGs at the bright-end of the
          luminosity function (LF). Our simulations also suggest that the
          cosmic  star  formation  rate density has a peak at z= 5-6, and
          that  the  current LBG surveys at z=6 are missing a significant
          number  of  faint  galaxies  that  are  dimmer than the current
          magnitude   limit.  Together,  our  results  suggest  that  the
          universe  could  be  reionized  at  z=6  by the Pop II stars in
          ordinary  galaxies.  We  also  estimate  the  LF of Lyman-alpha
          emitters  (LAEs)  at z=6 by relating the star formation rate in
          the  simulation  to  the  Ly-alpha luminosity. We find that the
          simulated  LAE  LFs  agree with the observed data provided that
          the  net  escape fraction of Ly-alpha photon is f_{Ly-alpha} <=
          0.1. We investigate two possible scenarios for this effect: (1)
          all  sources in the simulation are uniformly dimmer by a factor
          of 10 through attenuation, and (2) one out of ten LAEs randomly
          lights  up  at  a  given  moment.  We show that the correlation
          strength   of   the   LAE  spatial  distribution  can  possibly
          distinguish the two scenarios.

          Journal-ref: Science, 311 (2006) 1127-1129
          Recent  observations support the suggestion that short-duration
          gamma-ray  bursts  are  produced  by  compact star mergers. The
          X-ray flares discovered in two short gamma-ray bursts last much
          longer  than  the previously proposed postmerger energy release
          time  scales.  Here  we  show  that  they  can  be  produced by
          differentially  rotating, millisecond pulsars after the mergers
          of  binary  neutron  stars.  The differential rotation leads to
          windup  of  interior poloidal magnetic fields and the resulting
          toroidal fields are strong enough to float up and break through
          the  stellar  surface.  Magnetic reconnection--driven explosive
          events  then  occur,  leading  to multiple X-ray flares minutes
          after the original gamma-ray burst.

          In  order  to probe the activity of the inner disk flow and its
          effect  on  the  neutron star surface emissions, we carried out
          the  timing  analysis of the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
          observations  of  the  millisecond X-ray pulsar XTE J1807--294,
          focusing  on  its  correlated  behaviors  in X-ray intensities,
          hardness  ratios, pulse profiles and power density spectra. The
          source  was observed to have a serial of broad "puny" flares on
          a  timescale of hours to days on the top of a decaying outburst
          in  March 2003. In the flares, the spectra are softened and the
          pulse   profiles  become  more  sinusoidal.  The  frequency  of
          kilohertz  quasi-periodic  oscillation (kHz QPO) is found to be
          positively related to the X-ray count rate in the flares. These
          features  observed  in the flares could be due to the accreting
          flow  inhomogeneities.  It is noticed that the fractional pulse
          amplitude  increases  with  the flare intensities in a range of
          $\sim   2%-14%$,   comparable   to   those   observed   in  the
          thermonuclear  bursts  of  the  millisecond  X-ray  pulsar  XTE
          J1814--338,  whereas  it  remains  at  about 6.5% in the normal
          state. Such a significant variation of the pulse profile in the
          "puny" flares may reflect the changes of physical parameters in
          the  inner  disk  accretion  region. Furthermore, we noticed an
          overall  positive correlation between the kHz QPO frequency and
          the  fractional  pulse  amplitude,  which  could  be  the first
          evidence  representing  that  the neutron-star surface emission
          properties are very sensitive to the disk flow inhomogeneities.
          This  effect  should  be  cautiously  considered  in  the burst
          oscillation studies.

          density  evolution  of supermassive black holes, estimated from
          the  hard  X-ray  selected  luminosity  function of quasars and
          active galactic nuclei. We find that on average black hole mass
          must  have  been  higher  at higher redshift for given spheroid
          stellar  mass. Moreover, we find negative redshift evolution of
          the disk/irregulars to spheroid mass ratio. The total accretion
          efficiency   is  constrained  to  be  between  0.06  and  0.12,
          depending  on  the  exact value of the local SMBH mass density,

          We  analyze  the  properties  of VIRGO detector with the aim of
          studying  its  ability  to  search  for  coalescing  black hole
          binaries. We focus on the remnants of the Population III stars,
          which  currently  should be massive black holes ($\sim 100-1000
          M_\odot$),   some   of   them  bound  in  binary  systems.  The
          coalescence  of  such binaries due to emission of gravitational
          waves  may  be currently observable. We use a binary population
          synthesis to model the evolution of Population III binaries. We
          calculate  the  signal  to  noise ratios of gravitational waves
          emitted  by  the  system  in  each  of  the  coalescence phase:
          inspiral,  merger and ringdown, and provide simple formulae for
          the  signal  to  noise  ratio  as  a  function of masses of the
          binaries.  We  estimate  the  detection  rates  for  the  VIRGO
          interferometer and also compare them with the estimates for the
          current LIGO. We show that these expected rates are similar to,
          or   larger  than  the  expected  rates  from  coalescences  of
          Population I and II compact object binaries.

          METHODS.  We  use  statistics based on known densities of X-ray
          sources  and  AGN/QSOs selected in the optical. The analysis is
          done   individually   for  each  parent  galaxy.  The  existing
          identifications  of  the optical counterparts are compiled from
          the literature.
          RESULTS.  More  than  a  half  of  the  ULXs,  within twice the
          distance  of  the  major axis of the 25 mag/arcsec$^2$ isophote
          from RC3 nearby galaxies and with X-ray luminosities $L_X$[2-10
          keV]  $\ge  10^{39}$  erg/s,  are  expected to be high redshift
          background  QSOs. A list of 25 objects (clean sample) confirmed
          to  be  real  ULXs  or  to  have  a  low  probability  of being
          contaminant foreground/background objects is provided.

          Title: Pluto's moon system: survey of the phase space I
          Authors: I. Nagy, A. Suli, B. Erdi
          Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures
          The  stability  of  the  space  around Pluto--Charon system was
          studied.  This  system  has  the  largest mass parameter in our
          solarsystem.  In  the  year 2005 two small satellite were found
          around  Pluto, which move so-called P-type orbit. In this paper
          the  stability  of the P-type orbits are investigated including
          the  two  new satellites, S/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2. We point out
          that   the  likelihood  of  the  two  satellite  were  captured
          gravitationally  is  very  small.  Additionally, the large mass
          parameter allow the satellites regard a model of a new class of
          exoplanets, which orbit around binary stellar.

          Title:  The  relation  between  accretion rate and jet power in
          X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies

          (IoA, Cambridge), G.B. Taylor (UNM), C.S. Reynolds (UMD)

          pages, 5 figures
          Using  Chandra  X-ray  observations of 9 nearby, X-ray luminous
          ellipticals with good optical velocity dispersion measurements,
          we  show  that  a  tight  correlation  exists between the Bondi
          accretion  rates  calculated  from the X-ray data and estimated
          black hole masses, and the power emerging from these systems in
          relativistic  jets.  The jet powers, inferred from the energies
          and timescales required to inflate the cavities observed in the
          surrounding X-ray emitting gas, can be related to the accretion
          rates   by   a   power   law   model.  A  significant  fraction
          (2.4^{+1.0}_{-0.7}  per  cent,  for P_jet=10^{43} erg/s) of the
          energy  associated  with the rest mass of material entering the
          accretion   radius  emerges  in  the  jets.  Our  results  have
          significant   implications   for   studies  of  accretion,  jet
          formation  and  galaxy formation. The tight correlation between
          P_Bondi  and  P_jet  suggests that the Bondi formulae provide a
          reasonable  description  of  the accretion process, despite the
          likely  presence  of  magnetic pressure and angular momentum in
          the   accreting   gas,   and   that  the  accretion  flows  are
          approximately  stable  over  timescales of a few million years.
          Our  results  show that the black hole engines at the hearts of
          large  elliptical  galaxies  and  groups  feed  back sufficient
          energy to stem cooling and star formation, leading naturally to
          the  observed  exponential  cut  off  at  the bright end of the
          galaxy luminosity function.

          accepted
          We  present  4-7 ks Chandra observations of 35 Broad Absorption
          Line  (BAL)  quasars  from  the Large Bright Quasar Survey, the
          largest  sample of sensitive, 0.5-8.0 keV X-ray observations of
          this  class  of  quasars  to  date.  The limited ranges in both
          redshift  (z=1.42-2.90)  and UV luminosity (a factor of ~12) of
          the  sample  also make it relatively uniform. Of 35 targets, 27
          are  detected  for  a detection fraction of 77%, and we confirm
          previous  studies  that  find BAL quasars to be generally X-ray
          weak. Five of the eight non-detections are known low-ionization
          BAL  quasars,  confirming  reports of extreme X-ray weakness in
          this subset (~10% of optically selected BAL quasars). Those BAL
          quasars  with  the  hardest  X-ray  spectra  are also the X-ray
          weakest,  consistent  with  the  interpretation  that intrinsic
          absorption is the primary cause of X-ray weakness in this class
          of  quasars  as a whole. Furthermore, the observed trend is not
          consistent  with simple neutral absorption, supporting findings
          from  spectroscopic observations of individual targets that BAL
          quasars  typically  exhibit  complex  X-ray  absorption  (e.g.,
          partially    covering    or   ionized   absorbers).   In   sum,
          high-ionization BAL quasars are typically neither intrinsically
          X-ray   weak  nor  suffer  from  Compton-thick  absorption.  In
          general,  we  find  no  evidence for correlations between X-ray
          weakness  and UV absorption-line properties, with the exception
          of a likely correlation between the maximum outflow velocity of
          CIV  absorption and the magnitude of X-ray weakness. We discuss
          the  implications  of  our  results for disk-wind models of BAL
          outflows in quasars. (abridged)

          Pulsar 4U~0114+65 with ASCA
          Authors: U. Mukherjee, B. Paul
          Comments: 14 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables. Accepted in Journal
          of Astrophysics and Astronomy
          Here we report the spectral characteristics of the high and low
          states  of  the pulsar 4U~0114+65 and examine the change in the
          parameters   of   the   spectral  model.  A  power  law  and  a
          photoelectric  absorption  by  material along the line of sight
          together  with  a  high  energy cut-off suffice to describe the
          continuum spectrum in both the states. A fluorescence iron line
          at  $\sim$6.4  keV is present in the high as well as in the low
          state,  though  it  is  less  intense in the latter. The photon
          index,  cut-off  energy and e-folding energy values hardly show
          any  discernible  change  over  the  states.  We  compare these
          spectral  characteristics  as  observed  with ASCA to that with
          other  satellites. We also compare the spectral characteristics
          of  4U~0114+650  with  other X-ray sources which show intensity
          variation at different time scales.

          We  have  investigated  the  Quasi  Periodic  Oscillation (QPO)
          properties   of   the  transient  accreting  X-ray  pulsar  XTE
          J1858+034   during  the  second  outburst  of  this  source  in
          April-May  2004.  We  have  used  observations  made  with  the
          Proportional  Counter  Array  (PCA)  of  the Rossi X-ray Timing
          Explorer  (RXTE)  during May 14-18 2004, in the declining phase
          of the outburst. We detected the presence of low frequency QPOs
          in  the  frequency  range  of  140--185 mHz in all the RXTE-PCA
          observations.  We  report  evolution of the QPO parameters with
          the  time,  X-ray  flux,  and  X-ray  photon  energy.  Though a
          correlation   between   the  QPO  centroid  frequency  and  the
          instantaneous  X-ray  flux  is not very clear from the data, we
          point out that the QPO frequency and the one day averaged X-ray
          flux  decreased  with  time  during these observations. We have
          obtained  a clear energy dependence of the RMS variation in the
          QPOs,  increasing  from  about 3% at 3 keV to 6% at 25 keV. The
          X-ray  pulse  profile is a single peaked sinusoidal, with pulse
          fraction  increasing  from  20%  at  3 keV to 45% at 30 keV. We
          found  that,  similar  to  the  previous  outburst,  the energy
          spectrum  is  well  fitted with a model consisting of a cut-off
          power law along with an iron emission line.

          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          We  present  surface  spot  maps of the K2V primary star in the
          pre-cataclysmic variable binary system, V471 Tau. The spot maps
          show  the  presence of large high latitude spots located at the
          sub-white  dwarf  longitude  region.  By  tracking the relative
          movement  of  spot groups over the course of four nights (eight
          rotation  cycles), we measure the surface differential rotation
          rate of the system.Our results reveal that the star is rotating
          rigidly  with  a surface shear rate, dOmega = 1.6 +/- 6 mrad/d.
          The  single  active  star  AB  Dor has a similar spectral type,
          rotation  period,  and activity level as the K star in V471 Tau
          but  displays  much  stronger  surface  shear (46 < dOmega < 58
          mrad/d).  Our  results  suggest  that tidal locking may inhibit
          differential  rotation;  this  reduced shear, however, does not
          affect the overall magnetic activity levels in active K dwarfs.

          Title:  Suppressing  cluster  cooling  flows  by  multiple  AGN
          activity
          Authors: Adi Nusser, Joseph Silk, Arif Babul
          We apply a spherically symmetric one-dimensional hydrodynamical
          code  to study the heating of the inter-cluster medium (ICM) by
          AGN  activity  in cluster galaxies. The AGNs drive bubbles into
          the   ICM   and   the   resulting  heating  is  assumed  to  be
          self-regulating. Bubbles affect the ICM in three distinct ways.
          Firstly,  immediately  after  injection, bubbles expand in situ
          until they reach pressure equilibrium with the ICM. During this
          expansion, they heat the ICM by means of weak shocks. Secondly,
          buoyancy  is  resisted  by  viscous or turbulent drag which can
          also heat the ICM. Thirdly and less importantly, as the bubbles
          rise  by  buoyancy,  they  expand  and  do adiabatic work which
          shortens  the  cooling  time in the ICM. The resulting feedback
          adds  considerably  to  previous estimates of mechanical energy
          input  based  only  on  the  observed thermal energy content of
          x-ray cavities, and suffices to suppress cluster cooling flows.
          Our  self-regulating  scenario  predicts  that  there should be
          enhanced  AGN  activity  of  galaxies  inside  cooling  regions
          compared  to  galaxies  in the outer parts of the cluster. This
          prediction remains to be confirmed or refuted by observations.

          Magnetosphere

          Comments: 35 pages, 18 b/w figures, submitted to ApJ, Corrected
          in v2: Incorrect Greek letters in figure labels fixed
          We  study  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) standing shocks in ingoing
          plasmas   in   a   black  hole  (BH)  magnetosphere.  Fast  and
          intermediate  shock  formation is explored in Kerr geometry. We
          find  that  low  or  high latitude standing MHD shocks are both
          possible,  creating  a  very  hot  plasma region near the event
          horizon. Shocked downstream plasmas become substantially hot or
          magnetized  depending  on model parameters. We also investigate
          the  effects  of the poloidal magnetic field and the BH spin on
          the  properties  of  shocks  and  show  that  both  effects can
          significantly  affect  the  characteristics  of  MHD  shocks. A
          speculation  for  a  possible  connection between the global BH
          magnetosphere  and  the  resulting  shocks  is presented in the
          framework  of  a  simple disk-corona model. MHD shock formation
          can  be  a  plausible mechanism for high energy radiation which
          illuminates  the  underlying  accretion  disk, relevant for the
          cause  of  the  observed iron fluorescence in accretion-powered
          active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

          In   this  paper  we  present  the  first  results  of  a  deep
          spectroscopic  survey of faint quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky
          Survey  (SDSS)  Southern  Survey,  a deep survey carried out by
          repeatedly  imaging  a  270  deg^2 area. Quasar candidates were
          selected  from the deep data with good completeness over 0<z<5,
          and  2  to  3  magnitudes  fainter  than  the SDSS main survey.
          Spectroscopic  follow-up  was  carried out on the 6.5m MMT with
          Hectospec.  The  preliminary  sample  of this SDSS faint quasar
          survey  (hereafter  SFQS)  covers  ~  3.9  deg^2,  contains 414
          quasars,  and  reaches g=22.5. The overall selection efficiency
          is  ~  66%  (~  80%  at  g<21.5);  the  efficiency  in the most
          difficult redshift range (2<z<3) is better than 40%. We use the
          1/V_{a}  method  to  derive  a  binned  estimate  of the quasar
          luminosity  function  (QLF)  and  model  the  QLF using maximum
          likelihood  analysis.  The  best  model  fits  confirm previous
          results showing that the QLF has steep slopes at the bright end
          and  much flatter slopes (-1.25 at z<2.0 and -1.55 at z>2.0) at
          the  faint  end,  indicating  a break in the QLF slope. Using a
          luminosity-dependent  density evolution model, we find that the
          quasar  density  at M_{g}<-22.5 peaks at z~2, which is later in
          cosmic  time  than the peak of z~2.5 found from surveys of more
          luminous  objects.  The SFQS QLF is consistent with the results
          of  the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey, the SDSS, and the 2dF-SDSS LRG
          and  QSO  Survey, but probes fainter quasars. We plan to obtain
          more  quasars from future observations and establish a complete
          faint quasar sample with more than 1000 objects over 10 deg^2.

          We   cross-correlated   the   Chandra  XASSIST  and  XMM-Newton
          Serendipitous  Source Catalogues with the 2 degree Field Galaxy
          Redshift  Survey (2dfGRS) database. Our aim was to identify the
          most X-ray luminous (L_X > 10^42 erg s^-1) examples of galaxies
          in  the  local  Universe  whose  X-ray emission is dominated by
          stellar  processes rather than AGN activity ('normal' galaxies)
          as  well  as  to test the empirical criterion log(f_X/f_O) < -2
          for  separating  AGN  from  NGs.  With  XMM-Newton (Chandra) we
          covered  an  area  of  ~8.2 (~5.8)deg^2 down to a flux limit of
          ~10^-15 (~1.6 x 10^-15) erg cm^-2 s^-1 and found 18 (20) 2dfGRS
          galaxies. Using emission-line intensity ratios, we classified 6
          2dfGRS  spectra  as star-forming, H II nuclei, and 2 spectra as
          possible   H   II   nuclei.   The   rest  of  the  objects  are
          absorption-line  galaxies and AGN, including 3 possible LINERs.
          No  luminous  'normal'  galaxies  have been found but out of 19
          'normal'  galaxies  in this sample 5 H II and 3 absorption-line
          galaxies  have log(f_X/f_O) > -2. We performed a similar search
          in  two  nearby-galaxy  samples  from  the  literature.  All 44
          galaxies  in the Zezas (2001) sample have log(f_X/f_O) < -2 and
          L_X < 10^42 erg s^-1. In the Fabbiano et al. (1992) sample, out
          of  a total of 170 'normal' galaxies, we found 16 galaxies with
          log(f_X/f_O)   >-2,   the   majority   of   which  are  massive
          ellipticals. Three of these have L_X > 10^42 erg s^-1 .

          Title: How extreme are the Wolf-Rayet clusters in NGC3125?
          Authors: L J Hadfield, P A Crowther (Sheffield)
          Comments: 12 pages, 8 figures, accepted for MNRAS
          We  reinvestigate the massive stellar content of NGC3125 (Tol3)
          using   VLT/FORS1   imaging   &   spectroscopy,  plus  archival
          VLT/ISAAC,  HST/FOC  and HST/STIS datasets. Narrow-band imaging
          confirms  that  A  and  B  knots represent the primary sites of
          Wolf-Rayet  (WR)  stars,  whilst  HST imaging reveals that both
          regions  host multiple clusters. Clusters A1 + A2 within region
          A  host  WR  stars.  altough  is not clear which cluster within
          region  B  hosts WR stars. Nebular properties infer an LMC-like
          metallicity.  LMC  template  WN5-6 & WC4 spectra are matched to
          the  observed  optical  WR  bumps  of  A1 and B, permitting the
          contribution  of WC stars to the blue bump to be quantified. We
          obtain N(WN5-6:WC4)=105:20, 55:0, 40:20 for clusters A1, A2 and
          B1+B2, a factor of 3 lower than optical studies, as a result of
          a  lower  E(B-V).  Using  Starburst99 models to estimate O star
          populations for individual clusters, we find N(WR)/N(O)=0.2 for
          A1  and  0.1  for A2 and B1+B2. From Halpha imaging, the O star
          content  of  the  Giant  HII  regions  A and B is found to be a
          factor of 5-10 times higher than that derived spectroscopically
          for  the  UV/optically bright clusters, suggesting that NGC3125
          hosts   optically  obscured  young  massive  clusters,  further
          supported  by  VLT/ISAAC  K  band imaging. Archival HST/STIS UV
          spectroscopy  confirms  the low E(B-V) towards A1, for which we
          have  determined an SMC extinction law, in preference to an LMC
          or  starburst  law.  We  obtain N(WN5-6)=110 from the slit-loss
          corrected  HeII  1640  line  flux,  in excellent agreement with
          optical  result.  However,  this  is a factor of 35 times lower
          than  that inferred from the same dataset by Chandar et al. due
          to  their  use of a starburst extinction law. Highly discrepant
          stellar  populations  may  result  in  spatially  resolved star
          forming  regions  from  UV  and  optical studies through use of
          different extinction laws.

          Title: Where are the ``Missing'' Galactic Baryons?
          Authors:  Jesper  Sommer-Larsen  (Dark  Cosmology  Centre, NBI,
          Univ. of Copenhagen)
          Comments:  4  Pages,  4 Figures, Submitted to ApJL, Printing in
          colour recommended
          Based   on   19   high-resolution  N-body/gas-dynamical  galaxy
          formation  simulations  in the LCDM cosmology it is shown, that
          for  a  galaxy  like the Milky Way, in addition to the baryonic
          mass of the galaxy itself, about 70% extra baryonic mass should
          reside around the galaxy (inside of the virial radius), chiefly
          in  the form of hot gas. Averaging over the entire field galaxy
          population,  this  ``external''  component amounts to 64-85% of
          the  baryonic  mass of the population itself. These results are
          supported  by the recent detection of very extended, soft X-ray
          emission  from  the  halo of the quiescent, massive disk galaxy
          NGC 5746.
          Some of the hot gas may, by thermal instability, have condensed
          into  mainly  pressure  supported,  warm clouds, similar to the
          Galactic  High  Velocity  Clouds (HVCs). Based on an ultra-high
          resolution  cosmological  test  simulation  of a Milky Way like
          galaxy  (with  a gas particle mass and gravity softening length
          of  only  7600  h^-1  Msun  and 83 h^-1 pc,respectively), it is
          argued,  that  the  hot  gas  phase dominates over the warm gas
          phase, in the halo. Finally, an origin of HVCs as ``leftovers''
          from  filamentary,  ``cold'' accretion events, mainly occurring
          early in the history of galaxies, is proposed.

          Although  the  environments  of  star  and planet formation are
          thermodynamically  cold, substantial X-ray emission from 10-100
          MK  plasmas  is  present.  In low mass pre-main sequence stars,
          X-rays are produced by violent magnetic reconnection flares. In
          high  mass  O  stars,  they are produced by wind shocks on both
          stellar  and  parsec scales. The recent Chandra Orion Ultradeep
          Project,  XMM-Newton  Extended  Survey  of  Taurus, and Chandra
          studies of more distant high-mass star forming regions reveal a
          wealth  of  X-ray  phenomenology and astrophysics. X-ray flares
          mostly  resemble  solar-like  magnetic activity from multipolar
          surface  fields,  although  extreme  flares  may arise in field
          lines  extending  to the protoplanetary disk. Accretion plays a
          secondary  role.  Fluorescent iron line emission and absorption
          in  inclined  disks  demonstrate  that  X-rays  can efficiently
          illuminate disk material. The consequent ionization of disk gas
          and irradiation of disk solids addresses a variety of important
          astrophysical  issues  of  disk dynamics, planet formation, and
          meteoritics.   New   observations   of   massive  star  forming
          environments  such  as  M  17, the Carina Nebula and 30 Doradus
          show   remarkably  complex  X-ray  morphologies  including  the
          low-mass  stellar  population, diffuse X-ray flows from blister
          HII regions, and inhomogeneous superbubbles. X-ray astronomy is
          thus  providing qualitatively new insights into star and planet
          formation.

          outskirts of M31

          Comments: 8 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  present  evidence for a metal-poor, [Fe/H] ~ -1.4pm0.2 dex,
          stellar component detectable at radii from 10 kpc to 70 kpc, in
          our  nearest  giant spiral neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. This
          metal-poor  sample  underlies  the recently-discovered extended
          rotating  component,  and has no detected metallicity gradient.
          This discovery uses a large sample of 9776 radial velocities of
          Red   Giant  Branch  (RGB)  stars  obtained  with  the  Keck-II
          telescope  and  DEIMOS  spectrograph,  with  827 stars isolated
          kinematically to lie in the spheroid component by windowing out
          the extended rotating component which dominates the photometric
          profile  of  Andromeda out to >50 kpc (de-projected). The stars
          lie  in  54 spectroscopic fields spread over an 8 square degree
          region,  and  are  expected  to  fairly sample the stellar halo
          region  to  a  radius  of >70 kpc. The spheroid sample shows no
          significant  evidence  for  rotation. Fitting a simple model in
          which  the  velocity dispersion of the component decreases with
          radius,  we  find  a  central  velocity  dispersion  of 152 kms
          decreasing    by    -0.90    km/s    kpc.    By    fitting    a
          cosmologically-motivated  NFW  halo model to the spheroid stars
          we  constrain  the  virial  mass  of M31 to be greater than 9.0
          x10^11 solar masses with 99% confidence. The properties of this
          halo component are very similar to that found in our Milky Way,
          revealing  that  these roughly equal mass galaxies may have led
          similar accretion and evolutionary paths in the early Universe.

          The  emission from individual X-ray sources in the Chandra Deep
          Fields  and  XMM-Newton  Lockman Hole shows that almost half of
          the hard X-ray background above 6 keV is unresolved and implies
          the  existence  of  a  missing  population  of heavily obscured
          active  galactic  nuclei  (AGN).  We have stacked the 0.5-8 keV
          X-ray  emission from optical sources in the Great Observatories
          Origins  Deep  Survey  (GOODS;  which  covers  the Chandra Deep
          Fields)   to   determine  whether  these  galaxies,  which  are
          individually undetected in X-rays, are hosting the hypothesised
          missing  AGN.  In the 0.5-6 keV energy range the stacked-source
          emission  corresponds  to  the  remaining 10-20 per cent of the
          total  background -- the fraction that has not been resolved by
          Chandra.  The  spectrum  of  the stacked emission is consistent
          with  starburst  activity  or weak AGN emission. In the 6-8 keV
          band,  we find that upper limits to the stacked X-ray intensity
          from the GOODS galaxies are consistent with the ~40 per cent of
          the  total  background  that  remains  unresolved,  but further
          selection  refinement is required to identify the X-ray sources
          and confirm their contribution.

          Authors: J. W. Moffat
          Comments: 23 pages, 1 figure, latex file
          A  modified  gravity  (MOG)  possesses  a light, neutral vector
          particle  called  a  ``phion''  associated  with a vector field
          $\phi^\mu$,   which   forms   a  cold  fluid  of  Bose-Einstein
          condensates  before  recombination  with zero pressure and zero
          shear  viscosity.  The  energy  density  associated  with  this
          Bose-Einstein  condensate  fluid  dominates  the energy density
          before   recombination   and   produces  a  density  parameter,
          $\Omega_\phi\sim 0.3$, that together with the fractional baryon
          density   $\Omega_b\sim  0.04$,  and  a  cosmological  constant
          parameter $\Omega_\Lambda\sim 0.7$ yields an approximate fit to
          the  data  for  the  acoustical  oscillations  in the CMB power
          spectrum.  The  quantum phion condensate fluid is abundant well
          before  recombination  and  can  clump  and form the primordial
          structure   for  galaxies.  At  late  times  in  the  expanding
          universe,  in  local  bound  systems  such as galaxies ordinary
          baryonic  matter  dominates  the  matter  density. For galactic
          systems   in   the   present   epoch,  the  modified  Newtonian
          acceleration  law  determined  by  MOG  describes  well  galaxy
          rotation curve data and X-ray cluster mass profile data.

          Title:  Pulsar  Wind Nebulae and the Non-thermal X-Ray Emission
          of Millisecond Pulsars
          Authors: K. S. Cheng, Ronald E. Taam, W. Wang
          Comments: To be appeared in ApJ April 2006
          The   non-thermal,   non-pulsed   X-ray  emission  of  MSPs  is
          investigated.  As  in  young  pulsars, MSPs emit a relativistic
          wind,  which  interacting with the interstellar medium and/or a
          binary companion can significantly contribute to the non-pulsed
          emission  of  these  pulsars. An application and extension of a
          simple  model developed for young pulsars is applied to the old
          recycled  MSP  B1957+20.  It is found that the pulsar wind can,
          indeed,  contribute  to  both the resolved and unresolved X-ray
          emission.  For  other  MSP  in  the  Galactic  field  where the
          spectral  index  of  the non-pulsed component has been measured
          (i.e., PSR B1937+21, J0218+4232) the contribution of the pulsar
          wind  to  the non-pulsed X-ray luminosity is estimated. For the
          MSPs  in the core regions of globular clusters, the pulsar wind
          nebula  is  likely  affected  by its interaction with the dense
          stellar   environment,   possibly   leading   to  a  diminished
          contribution  to  the  total  X-ray emission. In this case, the
          existence  of  non-thermal  non-pulsed  X-ray  emission is more
          likely  for  binary rather than isolated MSPs with the emission
          arising  from  the  interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind
          with   a   binary   companion.  Our  study  suggests  that  the
          magnetization  parameter  in the pulsar wind nebulae of MSPs is
          significantly  larger  than  that of the Crab nebula by about a
          factor  of 10. The emission from MSPs moving at high velocities
          may  appear  spatially  extended  with  a tail-like morphology,
          which  may  contribute  to  the  faint filamentary X-ray source
          subpopulation in the Galaxy.

          in Astrophysical Journal Letters
          We  analyze  26  Luminous  Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) in the
          HST/ACS  Ultra  Deep  Field  (UDF) at z ~ 0.2-1.3, to determine
          whether  these  are  truly  small  galaxies,  or  rather bright
          central  starbursts  within  existing  or  forming  large  disk
          galaxies.  Surface  brightness  profiles  from UDF images reach
          fainter  than  rest-frame  26.5 B mag/arcsec^2 even for compact
          objects  at  z~1. Most LCBGs show a smaller, brighter component
          that   is   likely   star-forming,  and  an  extended,  roughly
          exponential  component  with  colors suggesting stellar ages >~
          100  Myr  to  few Gyr. Scale lengths of the extended components
          are  mostly >~ 2 kpc, >1.5-2 times smaller than those of nearby
          large  disk  galaxies  like  the  Milky  Way.  Larger, very low
          surface   brightness  disks  can  be  excluded  down  to  faint
          rest-frame   surface   brightnesses  (>~  26  B  mag/arcsec^2).
          However, 1 or 2 of the LCBGs are large, disk-like galaxies that
          meet  LCBG  selection criteria due to a bright central nucleus,
          possibly a forming bulge. These results indicate that >~ 90% of
          high-z  LCBGs  are  small  galaxies that will evolve into small
          disk galaxies, and low mass spheroidal or irregular galaxies in
          the   local   Universe,   assuming  passive  evolution  and  no
          significant  disk  growth. The data do not reveal signs of disk
          formation  around  small,  HII-galaxy-like  LCBGs,  and  do not
          suggest  a  simple  inside-out growth scenario for larger LCBGs
          with a disk-like morphology. Irregular blue emission in distant
          LCBGs  is relatively extended, suggesting that nebular emission
          lines  from  star-forming regions sample a major fraction of an
          LCBG's velocity field.

          We  present  the  properties of Ly Alpha emitters (LAEs) at z =
          5.7  in  the  Subaru Deep Field. A photometric sample of 89 LAE
          candidates is constructed from narrow-band (NB816) data down to
          NB816 = 26.0 (AB) in a continuous 725 arcmin^2 area. Spectra of
          39  objects  satisfying  the photometric selection criteria for
          LAEs  were  obtained  with Subaru and Keck II Telescopes, among
          which  28  were  confirmed  LAEs,  one was a nearby galaxy, and
          eight were unclassified. We also obtained spectra of another 24
          NB816-excess  objects  in the field, identifying six additional
          LAEs.  We  find  that  the Ly Alpha luminosity function derived
          from  the  photometric sample is reproduced well by a Schechter
          function  with  L*  =  (7.9+3.0-2.2)  x  10^42 erg/s and phi* =
          (6.3+3.0-2.0)  x 10^-4 Mpc^-3 for alpha = -1.5 (fixed) over the
          whole luminosity range of L ~= 3x10^42 - 3x10^43 erg/s. We then
          measure  rest-frame  Ly  Alpha  equivalent widths (EWs) for the
          confirmed  LAEs,  to  find that the median among the 28 objects
          satisfying the photometric selection criteria is W_0^i = 233 A.
          We  infer that 30% - 40% of LAEs at z=5.7 exceed W_0^i = 240 A.
          These  large-EW  objects  probably  cannot  be accounted for by
          ordinary  star-forming populations with a Salpeter IMF. We also
          find  that  LAEs  with  fainter far-UV luminosities have larger
          EWs.  Finally, we derive the far-UV luminosity function of LAEs
          down to M_UV ~= -19.6 using the photometric sample, and compare
          it  with  that  of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). We find that as
          high  as  about  80%  of  LBGs at z ~ 6 have W_0^i >= 100 A, in
          sharp contrast to lower-z counterparts.

          Title: Accretion in the Rho-Oph pre-main sequence stars
          Authors: A. Natta, L. Testi, S. Randich (Arcetri)
          Comments: A&A in press, 16 pages including tables, 5 figures
          The  aim  of this paper is to provide a measurement of the mass
          accretion  rate  in  a large, complete sample of objects in the
          core  of  the  star forming region Rho-Oph. The sample includes
          most  of  the  objects  (104  out  of  111)  with evidence of a
          circumstellar  disk  from  mid-infrared photometry; it covers a
          stellar mass range from about 0.03 to 3 Msun and it is complete
          to  a limiting mass of ~0.05 Msun. We used J and K-band spectra
          to  derive  the  mass  accretion  rate  of each object from the
          intensity  of the hydrogen recombination lines, Pab or Brg. For
          comparison,  we  also  obtained  similar spectra of 35 diskless
          objects.  The results show that emission in these lines is only
          seen  in  stars  with disks, and can be used as an indicator of
          accretion. However, the converse does not hold, as about 50% of
          our  disk  objects  do  not  have detectable line emission. The
          measured  accretion  rates  show  a strong correlation with the
          mass  of the central object (Macc ~ Mstar^1.8+-0.2) and a large
          spread,  of  two orders of magnitude at least, for any interval
          of Mstar. A comparison with existing data for Taurus shows that
          the objects in the two regions have similar behaviour, at least
          for  objects  more  massive  than ~0.1Msun. The implications of
          these results are briefly discussed.

          Title:  Models of the Structure and Evolution of Protoplanetary
          Disks
          Authors: C.P. Dullemond, D. Hollenbach, I. Kamp, P. D'Alessio
          Comments: Review chapter in "Protostars and Planets V"
          We  review  advances  in  the modeling of protoplanetary disks.
          This  review  will  focus on the regions of the disk beyond the
          dust  sublimation  radius, i.e. beyond 0.1 - 1 AU, depending on
          the stellar luminosity. We will be mostly concerned with models
          that aim to fit spectra of the dust continuum or gas lines, and
          derive physical parameters from these fits. For optically thick
          disks,  these parameters include the accretion rate through the
          disk  onto  the  star,  the  geometry  of  the  disk,  the dust
          properties,  the  surface  chemistry and the thermal balance of
          the  gas. For the latter we are mostly concerned with the upper
          layers of the disk, where the gas and dust temperature decouple
          and  a  photoevaporative  flow  may  originate. We also briefly
          discuss  optically  thin disks, focusing mainly on the gas, not
          the  dust.  The  evolution  of  these  disks  is  dominated  by
          accretion,   viscous   spreading,  photoevaporation,  and  dust
          settling and coagulation. The density and temperature structure
          arising  from  the surface layer models provide input to models
          of photoevaporation, which occurs largely in the outer disk. We
          discuss  the consequences of photoevaporation on disk evolution
          and planet formation.

          high resolution images, contact mauron at graal.univ-montp2.fr
          We  report  the  results of an exploratory program to image the
          extended  circumstellar  envelopes  of  asymptotic giant branch
          (AGB)  stars  in  dust-scattered galactic light. The goal is to
          characterize  the morphology of the envelopes as a probe of the
          mass-loss  process. The observations consist of short exposures
          with  the  VLT  and  longer  exposures  with  1-2m  telescopes,
          augmented with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope.
          We  observed  12  AGB  stars  and  detected  the  circumstellar
          envelopes  in  7.  The  detected envelopes have mass loss rates
          more  than  about  5 10E-6 solar mass per year, and they can be
          seen  out to distances of about 1 kpc. The observations provide
          information on the mass loss history on time scales up to about
          10,000   years.  For  the  five  AGB  envelopes  in  which  the
          circumstellar  geometry  is  well determined by scattered light
          observations,  all  except  one  (OH348.2-19.7) show deviations
          from  spherical  symmetry.  Two  (IRC+10216 and IRC+10011) show
          roughly  spherical  envelopes  at  large radii but asymmetry or
          bipolarity  close  to  the  star;  one  (AFGL  2514)  shows  an
          extended,  elliptical  envelope,  and  one  (AFGL 3068) shows a
          spiral pattern. The non-spherical structures are all consistent
          with  the  effects of binary interactions. Our observations are
          in  accord  with  a  scenario in which binary companions play a
          role   in   shaping   planetary  nebulae,  and  show  that  the
          circumstellar  gas  is already partly shaped on the AGB, before
          evolution to the proto-planetary nebula phase.

          Title:  The  neutron  star  soft  X-ray transient 1H1905+000 in
          quiescence

          Comments:  10  pages,  5  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          In  this Paper we report on our analysis of a ~25 ksec. Chandra
          X-ray  observation  of  the  neutron  star soft X-ray transient
          (SXT)  1H1905+000  in  quiescence.  Furthermore, we discuss our
          findings  of  the  analysis of optical photometric observations
          which  we obtained using the Magellan telescope and photometric
          and spectroscopic observations which we obtained using the Very
          Large Telescope at Paranal. The X-ray counterpart of 1H1905+000
          was  not  detected  in  our  Chandra  data,  with a 95 per cent
          confidence  limit  to the source count rate of 1.2x10^-4 counts
          s^-1.  For different spectral models this yields an upper limit
          on  the luminosity of 1.8x10^31 erg s^-1 (for an upper limit on
          the distance of 10 kpc.) This luminosity limit makes 1H1905+000
          the  faintest  neutron star SXT in quiescence observed to date.
          The neutron star luminosity is so low that it is similar to the
          lowest  luminosities derived for black hole SXTs in quiescence.
          This  low  luminosity  for  a  neutron  star SXT challanges the
          hypothesis  presented in the literature that black hole SXTs in
          quiescence  have lower luminosities than neutron star SXTs as a
          result   of  the  presence  of  a  black  hole  event  horizon.
          Furthermore,  the limit on the neutron star luminosity obtained
          less  than  20  years after the outburst has ceased, constrains
          the  thermal  conductivity  of the neutron star crust. Finally,
          the  neutron  star  core  must  be so cold that unless the time
          averaged  mass  accretion  rate  is  lower  than 2x10^-12 M_sun
          yr^-1,  core  cooling  has  to  proceed  via  enhanced neutrino
          emission  processes.  We  derive a limit on the absolute I-band
          magnitude  of the quiescent counterpart of M_I>7.8 assuming the
          source  is  at 10 kpc. This is in line with 1H1905+000 being an
          ultra-compact  X-ray  binary, as has been proposed based on the
          low outburst V-band absolute magnitude.

          Title: Evolution of supermassive black holes
          Authors: Marta Volonteri
          Comments:  Extended  version  of the invited paper to appear in
          the  Proceedings  of  the Conference "Relativistic Astrophysics
          and Cosmology - Einstein's Legacy"
          Supermassive  black  holes  (SMBHs)  are  nowadays  believed to
          reside  in  most local galaxies, and the available data show an
          empirical  correlation  between  bulge  luminosity - or stellar
          velocity  dispersion - and black hole mass, suggesting a single
          mechanism  for  assembling black holes and forming spheroids in
          galaxy  halos.  The  evidence  is  therefore  in  favour  of  a
          co-evolution between galaxies, black holes and quasars. In cold
          dark  matter  cosmogonies,  small-mass subgalactic systems form
          first to merge later into larger and larger structures. In this
          paradigm  galaxy halos experience multiple mergers during their
          lifetime.  If  every  galaxy  with  a bulge hosts a SMBH in its
          center,  and  a  local  galaxy  has  been  made  up by multiple
          mergers,  then  a  black  hole binary is a natural evolutionary
          stage.  The evolution of the supermassive black hole population
          clearly  has  to  be  investigated taking into account both the
          cosmological framework and the dynamical evolution of SMBHs and
          their  hosts.  The  seeds of SMBHs have to be looked for in the
          early  Universe,  as  very  luminous quasars are detected up to
          redshift  higher  than  z=6. These black holes evolve then in a
          hierarchical  fashion,  following the merger hierarchy of their
          host  halos. Accretion of gas, traced by quasar activity, plays
          a fundamental role in determining the two parameters defining a
          black  hole:  mass and spin. A particularly intriguing epoch is
          the  initial  phase  of  SMBH growth. It is very challenging to
          meet the observational constraints at z=6 if BHs are not fed at
          very high rates in their infancy.

          We  present  the  first results of coordinated multi-wavelength
          observations of the Galactic black hole GX 339-4 in a canonical
          low-hard  state,  obtained during its 2004 outburst. XMM-Newton
          observed  the  source  for  2 revolutions, or approximately 280
          ksec; RXTE monitored the source throughout this long stare. The
          resulting  data  offer  the best view yet obtained of the inner
          accretion flow geometry in the low-hard state, which is thought
          to  be  analogous  to  the  geometry  in  low-luminosity active
          galactic  nuclei.  The  XMM-Newton  spectra  clearly reveal the
          presence of a cool accretion disk component, and a relativistic
          Fe K emission line. The results of fits made to both components
          strongly  suggest  that a standard thin disk remains at or near
          to  the  innermost  stable  circular  orbit, at least in bright
          phases of the low-hard state. These findings indicate that both
          potential  links between the inner disk radius and the onset of
          a  steady  compact jet, and the paradigm of a radially-recessed
          disk  in  the  low-hard  state,  do  not  hold universally. The
          results of our observations can best be explained if a standard
          thin accretion disk fuels a corona which is closely related to,
          or  consistent  with,  the  base  of  a compact jet. In a brief
          examination  of archival data, we show that Cygnus X-1 supports
          this  picture  of  the  low-hard  state. We discuss our results
          within  the  context  of  disk-jet  connections  and prevailing
          models for accretion onto black holes.

          Although  the  environments  of  star  and planet formation are
          thermodynamically  cold, substantial X-ray emission from 10-100
          MK  plasmas  is  present.  In low mass pre-main sequence stars,
          X-rays are produced by violent magnetic reconnection flares. In
          high  mass  O  stars,  they are produced by wind shocks on both
          stellar  and  parsec scales. The recent Chandra Orion Ultradeep
          Project,  XMM-Newton  Extended  Survey  of  Taurus, and Chandra
          studies of more distant high-mass star forming regions reveal a
          wealth  of  X-ray  phenomenology and astrophysics. X-ray flares
          mostly  resemble  solar-like  magnetic activity from multipolar
          surface  fields,  although  extreme  flares  may arise in field
          lines  extending  to the protoplanetary disk. Accretion plays a
          secondary  role.  Fluorescent iron line emission and absorption
          in  inclined  disks  demonstrate  that  X-rays  can efficiently
          illuminate disk material. The consequent ionization of disk gas
          and irradiation of disk solids addresses a variety of important
          astrophysical  issues  of  disk dynamics, planet formation, and
          meteoritics.   New   observations   of   massive  star  forming
          environments  such  as  M  17, the Carina Nebula and 30 Doradus
          show   remarkably  complex  X-ray  morphologies  including  the
          low-mass  stellar  population, diffuse X-ray flows from blister
          HII regions, and inhomogeneous superbubbles. X-ray astronomy is
          thus  providing qualitatively new insights into star and planet
          formation.

          Comments: 8 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  present  evidence for a metal-poor, [Fe/H] ~ -1.4pm0.2 dex,
          stellar component detectable at radii from 10 kpc to 70 kpc, in
          our  nearest  giant spiral neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. This
          metal-poor  sample  underlies  the recently-discovered extended
          rotating  component,  and has no detected metallicity gradient.
          This discovery uses a large sample of 9776 radial velocities of
          Red   Giant  Branch  (RGB)  stars  obtained  with  the  Keck-II
          telescope  and  DEIMOS  spectrograph,  with  827 stars isolated
          kinematically to lie in the spheroid component by windowing out
          the extended rotating component which dominates the photometric
          profile  of  Andromeda out to >50 kpc (de-projected). The stars
          lie  in  54 spectroscopic fields spread over an 8 square degree
          region,  and  are  expected  to  fairly sample the stellar halo
          region  to  a  radius  of >70 kpc. The spheroid sample shows no
          significant  evidence  for  rotation. Fitting a simple model in
          which  the  velocity dispersion of the component decreases with
          radius,  we  find  a  central  velocity  dispersion  of 152 kms
          decreasing    by    -0.90    km/s    kpc.    By    fitting    a
          cosmologically-motivated  NFW  halo model to the spheroid stars
          we  constrain  the  virial  mass  of M31 to be greater than 9.0
          x10^11 solar masses with 99% confidence. The properties of this
          halo component are very similar to that found in our Milky Way,
          revealing  that  these roughly equal mass galaxies may have led
          similar accretion and evolutionary paths in the early Universe.

          The  emission from individual X-ray sources in the Chandra Deep
          Fields  and  XMM-Newton  Lockman Hole shows that almost half of
          the hard X-ray background above 6 keV is unresolved and implies
          the  existence  of  a  missing  population  of heavily obscured
          active  galactic  nuclei  (AGN).  We have stacked the 0.5-8 keV
          X-ray  emission from optical sources in the Great Observatories
          Origins  Deep  Survey  (GOODS;  which  covers  the Chandra Deep
          Fields)   to   determine  whether  these  galaxies,  which  are
          individually undetected in X-rays, are hosting the hypothesised
          missing  AGN.  In the 0.5-6 keV energy range the stacked-source
          emission  corresponds  to  the  remaining 10-20 per cent of the
          total  background -- the fraction that has not been resolved by
          Chandra.  The  spectrum  of  the stacked emission is consistent
          with  starburst  activity  or weak AGN emission. In the 6-8 keV
          band,  we find that upper limits to the stacked X-ray intensity
          from the GOODS galaxies are consistent with the ~40 per cent of
          the  total  background  that  remains  unresolved,  but further
          selection  refinement is required to identify the X-ray sources
          and confirm their contribution.

          Authors: J. W. Moffat
          Comments: 23 pages, 1 figure, latex file
          A  modified  gravity  (MOG)  possesses  a light, neutral vector
          particle  called  a  ``phion''  associated  with a vector field
          $\phi^\mu$,   which   forms   a  cold  fluid  of  Bose-Einstein
          condensates  before  recombination  with zero pressure and zero
          shear  viscosity.  The  energy  density  associated  with  this
          Bose-Einstein  condensate  fluid  dominates  the energy density
          before   recombination   and   produces  a  density  parameter,
          $\Omega_\phi\sim 0.3$, that together with the fractional baryon
          density   $\Omega_b\sim  0.04$,  and  a  cosmological  constant
          parameter $\Omega_\Lambda\sim 0.7$ yields an approximate fit to
          the  data  for  the  acoustical  oscillations  in the CMB power
          spectrum.  The  quantum phion condensate fluid is abundant well
          before  recombination  and  can  clump  and form the primordial
          structure   for  galaxies.  At  late  times  in  the  expanding
          universe,  in  local  bound  systems  such as galaxies ordinary
          baryonic  matter  dominates  the  matter  density. For galactic
          systems   in   the   present   epoch,  the  modified  Newtonian
          acceleration  law  determined  by  MOG  describes  well  galaxy
          rotation curve data and X-ray cluster mass profile data.

          Title:  Pulsar  Wind Nebulae and the Non-thermal X-Ray Emission
          of Millisecond Pulsars
          Authors: K. S. Cheng, Ronald E. Taam, W. Wang
          Comments: To be appeared in ApJ April 2006
          The   non-thermal,   non-pulsed   X-ray  emission  of  MSPs  is
          investigated.  As  in  young  pulsars, MSPs emit a relativistic
          wind,  which  interacting with the interstellar medium and/or a
          binary companion can significantly contribute to the non-pulsed
          emission  of  these  pulsars. An application and extension of a
          simple  model developed for young pulsars is applied to the old
          recycled  MSP  B1957+20.  It is found that the pulsar wind can,
          indeed,  contribute  to  both the resolved and unresolved X-ray
          emission.  For  other  MSP  in  the  Galactic  field  where the
          spectral  index  of  the non-pulsed component has been measured
          (i.e., PSR B1937+21, J0218+4232) the contribution of the pulsar
          wind  to  the non-pulsed X-ray luminosity is estimated. For the
          MSPs  in the core regions of globular clusters, the pulsar wind
          nebula  is  likely  affected  by its interaction with the dense
          stellar   environment,   possibly   leading   to  a  diminished
          contribution  to  the  total  X-ray emission. In this case, the
          existence  of  non-thermal  non-pulsed  X-ray  emission is more
          likely  for  binary rather than isolated MSPs with the emission
          arising  from  the  interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind
          with   a   binary   companion.  Our  study  suggests  that  the
          magnetization  parameter  in the pulsar wind nebulae of MSPs is
          significantly  larger  than  that of the Crab nebula by about a
          factor  of 10. The emission from MSPs moving at high velocities
          may  appear  spatially  extended  with  a tail-like morphology,
          which  may  contribute  to  the  faint filamentary X-ray source
          subpopulation in the Galaxy.

          We  analyze  26  Luminous  Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) in the
          HST/ACS  Ultra  Deep  Field  (UDF) at z ~ 0.2-1.3, to determine
          whether  these  are  truly  small  galaxies,  or  rather bright
          central  starbursts  within  existing  or  forming  large  disk
          galaxies.  Surface  brightness  profiles  from UDF images reach
          fainter  than  rest-frame  26.5 B mag/arcsec^2 even for compact
          objects  at  z~1. Most LCBGs show a smaller, brighter component
          that   is   likely   star-forming,  and  an  extended,  roughly
          exponential  component  with  colors suggesting stellar ages >~
          100  Myr  to  few Gyr. Scale lengths of the extended components
          are  mostly >~ 2 kpc, >1.5-2 times smaller than those of nearby
          large  disk  galaxies  like  the  Milky  Way.  Larger, very low
          surface   brightness  disks  can  be  excluded  down  to  faint
          rest-frame   surface   brightnesses  (>~  26  B  mag/arcsec^2).
          However, 1 or 2 of the LCBGs are large, disk-like galaxies that
          meet  LCBG  selection criteria due to a bright central nucleus,
          possibly a forming bulge. These results indicate that >~ 90% of
          high-z  LCBGs  are  small  galaxies that will evolve into small
          disk galaxies, and low mass spheroidal or irregular galaxies in
          the   local   Universe,   assuming  passive  evolution  and  no
          significant  disk  growth. The data do not reveal signs of disk
          formation  around  small,  HII-galaxy-like  LCBGs,  and  do not
          suggest  a  simple  inside-out growth scenario for larger LCBGs
          with a disk-like morphology. Irregular blue emission in distant
          LCBGs  is relatively extended, suggesting that nebular emission
          lines  from  star-forming regions sample a major fraction of an
          LCBG's velocity field.

          We  present  the  properties of Ly Alpha emitters (LAEs) at z =
          5.7  in  the  Subaru Deep Field. A photometric sample of 89 LAE
          candidates is constructed from narrow-band (NB816) data down to
          NB816 = 26.0 (AB) in a continuous 725 arcmin^2 area. Spectra of
          39  objects  satisfying  the photometric selection criteria for
          LAEs  were  obtained  with Subaru and Keck II Telescopes, among
          which  28  were  confirmed  LAEs,  one was a nearby galaxy, and
          eight were unclassified. We also obtained spectra of another 24
          NB816-excess  objects  in the field, identifying six additional
          LAEs.  We  find  that  the Ly Alpha luminosity function derived
          from  the  photometric sample is reproduced well by a Schechter
          function  with  L*  =  (7.9+3.0-2.2)  x  10^42 erg/s and phi* =
          (6.3+3.0-2.0)  x 10^-4 Mpc^-3 for alpha = -1.5 (fixed) over the
          whole luminosity range of L ~= 3x10^42 - 3x10^43 erg/s. We then
          measure  rest-frame  Ly  Alpha  equivalent widths (EWs) for the
          confirmed  LAEs,  to  find that the median among the 28 objects
          satisfying the photometric selection criteria is W_0^i = 233 A.
          We  infer that 30% - 40% of LAEs at z=5.7 exceed W_0^i = 240 A.
          These  large-EW  objects  probably  cannot  be accounted for by
          ordinary  star-forming populations with a Salpeter IMF. We also
          find  that  LAEs  with  fainter far-UV luminosities have larger
          EWs.  Finally, we derive the far-UV luminosity function of LAEs
          down to M_UV ~= -19.6 using the photometric sample, and compare
          it  with  that  of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). We find that as
          high  as  about  80%  of  LBGs at z ~ 6 have W_0^i >= 100 A, in
          sharp contrast to lower-z counterparts.

          Title: Accretion in the Rho-Oph pre-main sequence stars
          Authors: A. Natta, L. Testi, S. Randich (Arcetri)
          Comments: A&A in press, 16 pages including tables, 5 figures
          The  aim  of this paper is to provide a measurement of the mass
          accretion  rate  in  a large, complete sample of objects in the
          core  of  the  star forming region Rho-Oph. The sample includes
          most  of  the  objects  (104  out  of  111)  with evidence of a
          circumstellar  disk  from  mid-infrared photometry; it covers a
          stellar mass range from about 0.03 to 3 Msun and it is complete
          to  a limiting mass of ~0.05 Msun. We used J and K-band spectra
          to  derive  the  mass  accretion  rate  of each object from the
          intensity  of the hydrogen recombination lines, Pab or Brg. For
          comparison,  we  also  obtained  similar spectra of 35 diskless
          objects.  The results show that emission in these lines is only
          seen  in  stars  with disks, and can be used as an indicator of
          accretion. However, the converse does not hold, as about 50% of
          our  disk  objects  do  not  have detectable line emission. The
          measured  accretion  rates  show  a strong correlation with the
          mass  of the central object (Macc ~ Mstar^1.8+-0.2) and a large
          spread,  of  two orders of magnitude at least, for any interval
          of Mstar. A comparison with existing data for Taurus shows that
          the objects in the two regions have similar behaviour, at least
          for  objects  more  massive  than ~0.1Msun. The implications of
          these results are briefly discussed.

          Disks
          Authors: C.P. Dullemond, D. Hollenbach, I. Kamp, P. D'Alessio
          Comments: Review chapter in "Protostars and Planets V"
          We  review  advances  in  the modeling of protoplanetary disks.
          This  review  will  focus on the regions of the disk beyond the
          dust  sublimation  radius, i.e. beyond 0.1 - 1 AU, depending on
          the stellar luminosity. We will be mostly concerned with models
          that aim to fit spectra of the dust continuum or gas lines, and
          derive physical parameters from these fits. For optically thick
          disks,  these parameters include the accretion rate through the
          disk  onto  the  star,  the  geometry  of  the  disk,  the dust
          properties,  the  surface  chemistry and the thermal balance of
          the  gas. For the latter we are mostly concerned with the upper
          layers of the disk, where the gas and dust temperature decouple
          and  a  photoevaporative  flow  may  originate. We also briefly
          discuss  optically  thin disks, focusing mainly on the gas, not
          the  dust.  The  evolution  of  these  disks  is  dominated  by
          accretion,   viscous   spreading,  photoevaporation,  and  dust
          settling and coagulation. The density and temperature structure
          arising  from  the surface layer models provide input to models
          of photoevaporation, which occurs largely in the outer disk. We
          discuss  the consequences of photoevaporation on disk evolution
          and planet formation.

          We  report  the  results of an exploratory program to image the
          extended  circumstellar  envelopes  of  asymptotic giant branch
          (AGB)  stars  in  dust-scattered galactic light. The goal is to
          characterize  the morphology of the envelopes as a probe of the
          mass-loss  process. The observations consist of short exposures
          with  the  VLT  and  longer  exposures  with  1-2m  telescopes,
          augmented with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope.
          We  observed  12  AGB  stars  and  detected  the  circumstellar
          envelopes  in  7.  The  detected envelopes have mass loss rates
          more  than  about  5 10E-6 solar mass per year, and they can be
          seen  out to distances of about 1 kpc. The observations provide
          information on the mass loss history on time scales up to about
          10,000   years.  For  the  five  AGB  envelopes  in  which  the
          circumstellar  geometry  is  well determined by scattered light
          observations,  all  except  one  (OH348.2-19.7) show deviations
          from  spherical  symmetry.  Two  (IRC+10216 and IRC+10011) show
          roughly  spherical  envelopes  at  large radii but asymmetry or
          bipolarity  close  to  the  star;  one  (AFGL  2514)  shows  an
          extended,  elliptical  envelope,  and  one  (AFGL 3068) shows a
          spiral pattern. The non-spherical structures are all consistent
          with  the  effects of binary interactions. Our observations are
          in  accord  with  a  scenario in which binary companions play a
          role   in   shaping   planetary  nebulae,  and  show  that  the
          circumstellar  gas  is already partly shaped on the AGB, before
          evolution to the proto-planetary nebula phase.

          Comments:  10  pages,  5  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          In  this Paper we report on our analysis of a ~25 ksec. Chandra
          X-ray  observation  of  the  neutron  star soft X-ray transient
          (SXT)  1H1905+000  in  quiescence.  Furthermore, we discuss our
          findings  of  the  analysis of optical photometric observations
          which  we obtained using the Magellan telescope and photometric
          and spectroscopic observations which we obtained using the Very
          Large Telescope at Paranal. The X-ray counterpart of 1H1905+000
          was  not  detected  in  our  Chandra  data,  with a 95 per cent
          confidence  limit  to the source count rate of 1.2x10^-4 counts
          s^-1.  For different spectral models this yields an upper limit
          on  the luminosity of 1.8x10^31 erg s^-1 (for an upper limit on
          the distance of 10 kpc.) This luminosity limit makes 1H1905+000
          the  faintest  neutron star SXT in quiescence observed to date.
          The neutron star luminosity is so low that it is similar to the
          lowest  luminosities derived for black hole SXTs in quiescence.
          This  low  luminosity  for  a  neutron  star SXT challanges the
          hypothesis  presented in the literature that black hole SXTs in
          quiescence  have lower luminosities than neutron star SXTs as a
          result   of  the  presence  of  a  black  hole  event  horizon.
          Furthermore,  the limit on the neutron star luminosity obtained
          less  than  20  years after the outburst has ceased, constrains
          the  thermal  conductivity  of the neutron star crust. Finally,
          the  neutron  star  core  must  be so cold that unless the time
          averaged  mass  accretion  rate  is  lower  than 2x10^-12 M_sun
          yr^-1,  core  cooling  has  to  proceed  via  enhanced neutrino
          emission  processes.  We  derive a limit on the absolute I-band
          magnitude  of the quiescent counterpart of M_I>7.8 assuming the
          source  is  at 10 kpc. This is in line with 1H1905+000 being an
          ultra-compact  X-ray  binary, as has been proposed based on the
          low outburst V-band absolute magnitude.

          Title: Evolution of supermassive black holes
          Authors: Marta Volonteri
          Comments:  Extended  version  of the invited paper to appear in
          the  Proceedings  of  the Conference "Relativistic Astrophysics
          and Cosmology - Einstein's Legacy"
          Supermassive  black  holes  (SMBHs)  are  nowadays  believed to
          reside  in  most local galaxies, and the available data show an
          empirical  correlation  between  bulge  luminosity - or stellar
          velocity  dispersion - and black hole mass, suggesting a single
          mechanism  for  assembling black holes and forming spheroids in
          galaxy  halos.  The  evidence  is  therefore  in  favour  of  a
          co-evolution between galaxies, black holes and quasars. In cold
          dark  matter  cosmogonies,  small-mass subgalactic systems form
          first to merge later into larger and larger structures. In this
          paradigm  galaxy halos experience multiple mergers during their
          lifetime.  If  every  galaxy  with  a bulge hosts a SMBH in its
          center,  and  a  local  galaxy  has  been  made  up by multiple
          mergers,  then  a  black  hole binary is a natural evolutionary
          stage.  The evolution of the supermassive black hole population
          clearly  has  to  be  investigated taking into account both the
          cosmological framework and the dynamical evolution of SMBHs and
          their  hosts.  The  seeds of SMBHs have to be looked for in the
          early  Universe,  as  very  luminous quasars are detected up to
          redshift  higher  than  z=6. These black holes evolve then in a
          hierarchical  fashion,  following the merger hierarchy of their
          host  halos. Accretion of gas, traced by quasar activity, plays
          a fundamental role in determining the two parameters defining a
          black  hole:  mass and spin. A particularly intriguing epoch is
          the  initial  phase  of  SMBH growth. It is very challenging to
          meet the observational constraints at z=6 if BHs are not fed at
          very high rates in their infancy.

          We  present  the  first results of coordinated multi-wavelength
          observations of the Galactic black hole GX 339-4 in a canonical
          low-hard  state,  obtained during its 2004 outburst. XMM-Newton
          observed  the  source  for  2 revolutions, or approximately 280
          ksec; RXTE monitored the source throughout this long stare. The
          resulting  data  offer  the best view yet obtained of the inner
          accretion flow geometry in the low-hard state, which is thought
          to  be  analogous  to  the  geometry  in  low-luminosity active
          galactic  nuclei.  The  XMM-Newton  spectra  clearly reveal the
          presence of a cool accretion disk component, and a relativistic
          Fe K emission line. The results of fits made to both components
          strongly  suggest  that a standard thin disk remains at or near
          to  the  innermost  stable  circular  orbit, at least in bright
          phases of the low-hard state. These findings indicate that both
          potential  links between the inner disk radius and the onset of
          a  steady  compact jet, and the paradigm of a radially-recessed
          disk  in  the  low-hard  state,  do  not  hold universally. The
          results of our observations can best be explained if a standard
          thin accretion disk fuels a corona which is closely related to,
          or  consistent  with,  the  base  of  a compact jet. In a brief
          examination  of archival data, we show that Cygnus X-1 supports
          this  picture  of  the  low-hard  state. We discuss our results
          within  the  context  of  disk-jet  connections  and prevailing
          models for accretion onto black holes.

          Ever   since  their  discovery  in  the  1970's,  UltraLuminous
          InfraRed  Galaxies  (ULIRGs;  classically  Lir>10^12Lsun)  have
          fascinated  astronomers  with  their  immense luminosities, and
          frustrated  them  due to their singularly opaque nature, almost
          in  equal measure. Over the last decade, however, comprehensive
          observations  from the X-ray through to the radio have produced
          a  consensus  picture  of  local  ULIRGs, showing that they are
          mergers  between  gas  rich  galaxies,  where  the  interaction
          triggers  some combination of dust-enshrouded starburst and AGN
          activity,  with  the  starburst usually dominating. Very recent
          results have thrown ULIRGs even further to the fore. Originally
          they  were  thought  of as little more than a local oddity, but
          the  latest  IR  surveys have shown that ULIRGs are vastly more
          numerous  at  high  redshift,  and  tantalizing  suggestions of
          physical  differences between high and low redshift ULIRGs hint
          at  differences in their formation modes and local environment.
          In  this review we look at recent progress on understanding the
          physics and evolution of local ULIRGs, the contribution of high
          redshift  ULIRGs  to  the  cosmic  infrared  background and the
          global  history  of  star  formation, and the role of ULIRGs as
          diagnostics   of   the   formation   of  massive  galaxies  and
          large-scale structures.

          Title:  Lens-Aided  Multi-Angle  Spectroscopy  (LAMAS)  Reveals
          Small-Scale Outflow Structure in Quasars
          Authors: Paul J. Green
          Comments: accepted to ApJ
          Spectral differences between lensed quasar image components are
          common.   Since  lensing  is  intrinsically  achromatic,  these
          differences  are  typically  explained  as the effect of either
          microlensing,  or  as light path time delays sampling intrinsic
          quasar  spectral  variability.  Here  we  advance a novel third
          hypothesis:   some   spectral  differences  are  due  to  small
          line-of-sight differences through quasar disk wind outflows. In
          particular,  we propose that variable spectral differences seen
          only   in   component   A   of   the   widest  separation  lens
          SDSSJ1004+4112  are  due  to  differential absorption along the
          sightlines. The absorber properties required by this hypothesis
          are akin to known broad absorption line (BAL) outflows but must
          have  a  broader,  smoother  velocity profile. We interpret the
          observed  CIV emission line variability as further evidence for
          spatial  fine  structure transverse to the line of sight. Since
          outflows   are  likely  to  be  rotating,  such  absorber  fine
          structure  can  consistently  explain  some of the UV and X-ray
          variability  seen  in  AGN.  The  implications  are  many:  (1)
          Spectroscopic differences in other lensed objects may be due to
          this   ``lens-aided  multi-angle  spectroscopy''  (LAMAS).  (2)
          Outflows  have  fine structure on size scales of arcsec as seen
          from  the  nucleus.  (3)  Assuming either broad absorption line
          region  sizes  proposed  in  recent  wind  models, or typically
          assumed   continuum   emission   region   sizes,  LAMAS  and/or
          variability   provide  broadly  consistent  absorber  sizescale
          estimates  of  about  10^15cm. (4) Very broad smooth absorption
          may  be  ubiquitous  in  quasar  spectra,  even when no obvious
          troughs are seen.

          Title: Dust Stratification in Young Circumstellar Disks
          Authors:  T. Rettig, S. Brittain, Theodore Simon, E. Gibb, D.S.
          Balsara, D.A. Tilley, C. Kulesa
          We present high-resolution infrared spectra of four YSOs (T Tau
          N,  T  Tau  S,  RNO 91, and HL Tau). The spectra exhibit narrow
          absorption  lines  of  12CO,  13CO,  and  C18O as well as broad
          emission lines of gas phase12CO. The narrow absorption lines of
          CO are shown to originate from the colder circumstellar gas. We
          find that the line of sight gas column densities resulting from
          the  CO  absorption lines are much higher than expected for the
          measured extinction for each source and suggest the gas to dust
          ratio  is  measuring the dust settling and/or grain coagulation
          in these extended disks. We provide a model of turbulence, dust
          settling   and   grain  growth  to  explain  the  results.  The
          techniques   presented   here   allow   us   to   provide  some
          observationally-motivated  bounds  on  accretion  disk alpha in
          protostellar systems.

          We  exploit  the  gravitational  potential  of  massive cluster
          lenses  to  probe  the  emission  line  properties  of  six z=1
          galaxies  which appear as highly magnified luminous arcs. Using
          the  GMOS  integral  field  spectrograph together with detailed
          cluster  lens  models we reconstruct the intrinsic morphologies
          and two-dimensional velocity fields in these galaxies on scales
          corresponds to \~0.5kpc (unlensed) at z=1. Four of the galaxies
          have stable disk-like kinematics, whilst the other two resemble
          interacting  or starburst galaxies. These galaxies lie close to
          the  mean  rest-frame  I-band  Tully-Fisher relation for nearby
          spirals  suggesting  a clear preference for hierarchical growth
          of  structure.  In  the  rest-frame  B-band,  the  observations
          suggest  0.5+/-0.3mag of brightening, consistent with increased
          star-formation  activity  at  z=1.  However,  the galaxies with
          stable  disk kinematics have more slowly rising rotation curves
          than  expected from galaxies with similar surface brightness in
          the  local Universe. We suggest that this may arise because the
          distant  galaxies  have  lower  bulge  masses  than their local
          counter-parts. Whilst this study is based on only six galaxies,
          the  gain  in  flux  and  in  spatial  resolution  achieved via
          gravitational  magnification provides a much more detailed view
          of  the  high redshift Universe than possible with conventional
          surveys.

          Title:  General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of
          Jet  Formation  and  Large-Scale  Propagation  from  Black Hole
          Accretion Systems
          Authors:   Jonathan  C.  McKinney  (Institute  for  Theory  and
          Computation, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)

          MNRAS  Main  Journal (
astro-ph/0506369 with pair creation under
          revision to focus on GRBs)
          The formation and large-scale propagation of Poynting-dominated
          jets produced by accreting, rapidly rotating black hole systems
          are studied by numerically integrating the general relativistic
          magnetohydrodynamic   equations   of   motion   to  follow  the
          self-consistent  interaction  between accretion disks and black
          holes.  This  study  extends  previous similar work by studying
          jets  till  $t\approx 10^4GM/c^3$ out to $r\approx 10^4GM/c^2$,
          by  which  the  jet  is super- fast magnetosonic and moves at a
          lab-frame bulk Lorentz factor of $\Gamma\sim 10$ with a maximum
          terminal  Lorentz  factor  of $\Gamma_\infty\lesssim 10^3$. The
          radial  structure  of  the Poynting-dominated jet is piece-wise
          self-similar,  and fits to flow quantities along the field line
          are    provided.    Beyond   the   \alf   surface   at   $r\sim
          10$--$100GM/c^2$,  the  jet  becomes marginally unstable to (at
          least)  current-driven  instabilities. Such instabilities drive
          shocks  in  the  jet  that  limit  the  efficiency  of magnetic
          acceleration  and  collimation. These instabilities also induce
          jet  substructure with $3\lesssim\Gamma\lesssim 15$. The jet is
          shown  to  only marginally satisfy the necessary and sufficient
          conditions  for  kink  instability,  so  this  may  explain how
          astrophysical  jets  can  extend  to  large  distances  without
          completely  disrupting.  At  large  distance,  the  jet angular
          structure  is  Gaussian-like  (or  uniform within the core with
          sharp  exponential wings) with a half-opening angle of $\approx
          5^\circ$  and  there  is  an extended component out to $\approx
          27^\circ$.   Unlike   in  some  hydrodynamic  simulations,  the
          environment   is  found  to  play  a  negligible  role  in  jet
          structure, acceleration, and collimation as long as the ambient
          pressure  of  the  surrounding  medium is small compared to the
          magnetic pressure in the jet.

          Title:       Interferometric      data      reduction      with
          AMBER/VLTI.Principle,estimators and illustration
          Authors: E. Tatulli, the AMBER consortium
          Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures. Accepted in A&A
          We  present  in  this paper an innovative data reduction method
          for   single-mode  interferometry.  It  has  been  specifically
          developed  for the AMBER instrument, the three-beam combiner of
          the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, but can be derived for
          any  single-mode  interferometer.  The  algorithm is based on a
          direct modelling of the fringes in the detector plane. As such,
          it  requires  a  preliminary  calibration  of the instrument in
          order  to obtain the calibration matrix which builds the linear
          relationship  between the interferogram and the interferometric
          observable,   that   is   the   complex  visibility.  Once  the
          calibration procedure has been performed, the signal processing
          appears  to  be  a  classical  least  square determination of a
          linear  inverse problem. From the estimated complex visibility,
          we  derive  the  squared  visibility, the closure phase and the
          spectral  differential phase. The data reduction procedures are
          gathered  into the so-called amdlib software, now available for
          the  community,  and presented in this paper. Furthermore, each
          step  of  this  original algorithm is illustrated and discussed
          from  various on-sky observations conducted with the VLTI, with
          a  focus  on  the control of the data quality and the effective
          execution  of  the  data reduction procedures. We point out the
          present  limited  performances  of  the  instrument due to VLTI
          instrumental vibrations, difficult to calibrate.

          We  present  measurements of the spatial clustering of galaxies
          with  evolved  stellar masses >10^11Msun, infrared luminosities
          >10^12Lsun,  and  star  formation  rates  >200Msun yr^-1 in two
          redshift  intervals;  1.5<z<2.0 and 2<z<3. Both samples cluster
          moderately   strongly,  with  spatial  correlation  lengths  of
          r0=6.14+/-0.84h^-1    Mpc    for    the   2<z<3   sample,   and
          r0=5.36+/-1.28h^-1   Mpc   for   the  1.5<z<2.0  sample.  These
          clustering  amplitudes  are  consistent  with  both populations
          residing  in  dark  matter  haloes with masses of ~7x10^12Msun,
          which  is  comparable to that seen for optical QSOs at the same
          epochs.  We  infer  that  a minimum dark matter halo mass is an
          important  factor  for all forms of luminous, obscured activity
          in galaxies at z>1, both starbursts and AGN. Adopting plausible
          models  for  the  growth  of  DM haloes with redshift, then the
          haloes  hosting  the 2<z<3 sample will likely host poor to rich
          clusters  of  galaxies  at  z=0, whereas the haloes hosting the
          1.5<z<2.0  sample  will  likely  host  >L*  ellipticals or poor
          clusters  at  z=0.  We  conclude  that  ULIRGs  at z~2.5 likely
          signpost  a  significant  period of stellar buildup in galaxies
          that  will  reside in clusters at z=0, and that ULIRGs at z~1.7
          likely  signpost  stellar  buildup  in sources that will either
          become >L* ellipticals, or reside in poor clusters, at z=0.

          We  use near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy obtained with GNIRS on
          Gemini,  NIRSPEC  on  KECK,  and  ISAAC on the VLT to study the
          rest-frame  optical  continua  of  three `Distant Red Galaxies'
          (having  Js  -  Ks > 2.3) at z>2. All three galaxy spectra show
          the  Balmer/4000  Angstrom break in the rest-frame optical. The
          spectra  allow us to determine spectroscopic redshifts from the
          continuum  with  an  estimated  accuracy dz/(1+z) ~ 0.001-0.04.
          These redshifts agree well with the emission line redshifts for
          the   2  galaxies  with  Halpha  emission.  This  technique  is
          particularly  important  for  galaxies  that  are  faint in the
          rest-frame  UV,  as  they are underrepresented in high redshift
          samples  selected  in  optical  surveys  and  are too faint for
          optical  spectroscopy. Furthermore, we use the break, continuum
          shape,   and   equivalent   width   of   Halpha  together  with
          evolutionary  synthesis  models  to  constrain  the  age,  star
          formation  timescale,  dust  content,  stellar  mass  and  star
          formation rate of the galaxies. Inclusion of the NIR spectra in
          the  stellar  population  fits  greatly  reduces  the  range of
          possible  solutions  for stellar population properties. We find
          that  the  stellar  populations  differ greatly among the three
          galaxies,  ranging  from  a  young dusty starburst with a small
          break  and  strong  emission  lines to an evolved galaxy with a
          strong break and no detected line emission. The dusty starburst
          galaxy  has  an  age  of  0.3 Gyr and a stellar mass of 1*10^11
          Msun.  The  spectra of the two most evolved galaxies imply ages
          of  1.3-1.4  Gyr  and stellar masses of 4*10^11 Msun. The large
          range  of  properties  seen  in  these galaxies strengthens our
          previous much more uncertain results from broadband photometry.
          Larger samples are required to determine the relative frequency
          of dusty starbursts and (nearly) passively evolving galaxies at
          z~2.5.

          Title: Giant Planet Accretion and Migration: Surviving the Type
          I Regime

          Comments:  To  appear in ApJ. 644. 12 pages, 9 figures. Figures
          degraded for size; see this http URL for originals
          In  the  standard  model of gas giant planet formation, a large
          solid  core  (~  10  times  the Earth's mass) forms first, then
          accretes  its  massive  envelope  (100 or more Earth masses) of
          gas.  However,  inward  planet  migration  due to gravitational
          interaction  with the proto-stellar gas disk poses a difficulty
          in  this  model.  Core-sized  bodies  undergo  rapid  "Type  I"
          migration;  for typical parameters their migration timescale is
          much  shorter  than  their  accretion  timescale. How, then, do
          growing cores avoid spiraling into the central star before they
          ever  get  the  chance to become gas giants? Here, we present a
          simple model of core formation in a gas disk which is viscously
          evolving.  As  the  disk  dissipates,  accretion  and migration
          timescales  eventually become comparable. If this happens while
          there  is  still enough gas left in the disk to supply a jovian
          atmosphere,   then  a  window  of  opportunity  for  gas  giant
          formation  opens.  We  examine  under  what  circumstances this
          happens,  and  thus, what predictions our model makes about the
          link  between  proto-stellar disk properties and the likelihood
          of forming giant planets.

          We present a total of 4784 unique broad absorption line quasars
          from  the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  Third  Data Release. An
          automated  algorithm  was  used  to  match  a continuum to each
          quasar  and  to identify regions of flux at least 10% below the
          continuum  over  a  velocity range of at least 1000 km/s in the
          CIV  and  MgII  absorption  regions.  The  model  continuum was
          selected  as  the  best-fit match from a set of template quasar
          spectra   binned   in  luminosity,  emission  line  width,  and
          redshift,  with the power-law spectral index and amount of dust
          reddening  as  additional  free parameters. We characterize our
          sample  through  the  traditional  ``balnicity''  index  and  a
          revised absorption index, as well as through parameters such as
          the  width,  outflow  velocity,  fractional depth and number of
          troughs.  From a sample of 16883 quasars at 1.7 \le z \le 4.38,
          we  identify 4386 (26.0%) quasars with broad CIV absorption, of
          which 1756 (10.4%) satisfy traditional selection criteria. From
          a  sample  of  34973 quasars at 0.5 \le z \le 2.15, we identify
          457  (1.31%) quasars with broad MgII absorption, 191 (0.55%) of
          which satisfy traditional selection criteria. We also provide a
          supplementary  list  of  39  visually identified z>4.38 quasars
          with  broad  CIV absorption. We find that broad absorption line
          quasars  may  have broader emission lines on average than other
          quasars.

          and  high-mass  young  stars. General trends among outflows are
          identified,  and  the  most  recent  studies on the morphology,
          kinematics, energetics, and evolution of molecular outflows are
          discussed,  focusing on results from high-resolution millimeter
          observations.  We  review  the  existing  four broad classes of
          outflow  models  and  compare  numerical  simulations  with the
          observational data. A single class of models cannot explain the
          range  of  morphological  and  kinematic  properties  that  are
          observed,  and  we  propose  a possible solution. The impact of
          outflows on their cloud is examined, and we review how outflows
          can disrupt their surrounding environment, through the clearing
          of gas and the injection of momentum and energy onto the gas at
          distances  from their powering sources from about 0.01 to a few
          pc.  We  also  discuss  the  effects  of shock-induced chemical
          processes  on  the  ambient medium, and how these processes may
          act  as  a  chemical  clock  to  date  outflows. Lastly, future
          outflow  research  with  existing  and  planned  millimeter and
          submillimeter instruments is presented.

          Title:  How  Do  We  See the Relativistic Accretion Disk during
          Thermal Instability?
          Authors: Akihiro Kawata, Ken-ya Watarai, Jun Fukue
          Comments: 8pages, 5figures, PASJ 58 (2006) in press
          We  calculated the bolometric images of relativistic slim disks
          during  radiation-pressure-driven thermal instability. When the
          mass-accretion  rate  exceeds the critical one, an inner region
          of  the standard accretion disk bursts to change to a slim disk
          state having a large scale height. That is, the inner region of
          the  disk  becomes  high  temperature, and the thickness of the
          disk  increases  due to the increase of the radiation pressure.
          As  a  result,  we  found  that  the observed image of the disk
          during  the  burst  strongly  depends on the inclination angle.
          That is, radiation from the innermost disk would be occulted by
          the  disk  outer  rim  for  high  inclination angles($i \gtrsim
          70^\circ$). We also calculated the spectral energy distribution
          during  thermal  instability.  The Wien peak of the spectrum of
          high  inclination  angles  becomes  softer  than  that  of  low
          inclination angles due to the geometrical thickness. From these
          facts,  even  if the burst happens in black hole candidates, we
          may  not observe the burst when the inclination angle is large.
          We may suggest that numerous luminous black hole candidates are
          still hidden in our Galaxy.

          As  part  of  the first far-IR line survey towards Orion KL, we
          present  the  detection  of  seven  new rotationally excited OH
          Lambda-doublets   (at   48,   65,  71,  79,  98  and  115  um).
          Observations   were   performed   with   the   Long  Wavelength
          Spectrometer  (LWS)  Fabry-Perots  on  board the Infrared Space
          Observatory   (ISO).   In  total,  more  than  20  resolved  OH
          rotational  lines,  with  upper energy levels up to 620 K, have
          been  detected  at an angular and velocity resolutions of 80$''
          and  33  km  s^-1 respectively. OH line profiles show a complex
          behavior  evolving  from  pure absorption, P-Cygni type to pure
          emission.  We  also present a large scale 6' declination raster
          in  the  OH  ^2\Pi_3/2 J=5/2^+-3/2^- and ^2\Pi_3/2 J=7/2^-5/2^+
          lines  (at  119.441  and  84.597  um) revealing the decrease of
          excitation  outside  the  core  of the cloud. From the observed
          profiles,  mean  intrinsic  line  widths  and  velocity offsets
          between  emission  and  absorption  line peaks we conclude that
          most  of  the excited OH arises from Orion outflow(s), i.e. the
          ``plateau''  component.  We  determine an averaged OH abundance
          relative to H_2 of X(OH)=(0.5-1.0)x10^-6, a kinetic temperature
          of  100 K and a density of n(H_2)=5x10^5 cm^-3. Even with these
          conditions,  the  OH  excitation  is  heavily  coupled with the
          strong  dust continuum emission from the inner hot core regions
          and from the expanding flow itself.

          Title:  Imaging Molecular Gas in the Luminous Merger NGC 3256 :
          Detection of High-Velocity Gas and Twin Gas Peaks in the Double
          Nucleus

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          Molecular gas in the merging starburst galaxy NGC 3256 has been
          imaged  with  the  Submillimeter Array at a resolution of 1'' x
          2'' (170 x 340 pc at 35 Mpc). This is the first interferometric
          imaging  of  molecular  gas  in the most luminous galaxy within
          z=0.01.  There  is a large disk of molecular gas (r > 3 kpc) in
          the center of the merger with a strong gas concentration toward
          the  double nucleus. The gas disk having a mass of ~3*10^9 Msun
          in  the  central  3  kpc rotates around a point between the two
          nuclei  that  are 850 pc apart on the sky. The molecular gas is
          warm and turbulent and shows spatial variation of the intensity
          ratio  between  CO  isotopomers. High-velocity molecular gas is
          discovered  at the galactic center. Its velocity in our line of
          sight  is  up  to 420 km/s offset from the systemic velocity of
          the galaxy; the terminal velocity is twice as large as that due
          to  the rotation of the main gas disk. The high-velocity gas is
          most  likely  due  to  a  molecular  outflow from the gas disk,
          entrained  by the starburst-driven superwind in the galaxy. The
          molecular  outflow  is  estimated to have a rate of ~10 Msun/yr
          and to play a significant role in the dispersal or depletion of
          molecular   gas   from  the  galactic  center.  A  compact  gas
          concentration and steep velocity gradient are also found around
          each  of  the  twin  nuclei. They are suggestive of a small gas
          disk   rotating  around  each  nucleus.  If  these  are  indeed
          mini-disks,  their  dynamical  masses  are  ~10^9 Msun within a
          radius of 170 pc.

          Title:  IGR  J11215-5952:  a  hard  X-ray  transient displaying
          recurrent outbursts
          Authors: L. Sidoli, A. Paizis, S. Mereghetti (INAF/IASF Milano,

          The  hard  X-ray source IGRJ11215-5952 has been discovered with
          INTEGRAL  during a short outburst in 2005 and proposed as a new
          member  of  the  class  of supergiant fast X-ray transients. We
          analysed  INTEGRAL  public  observations of the source field in
          order to search for previous outbursts from this transient, not
          reported  in  literature.Our  results are based on a systematic
          re-analysis of INTEGRAL archival observations, using the latest
          analysis  software  and  instrument calibrations. We report the
          discovery  of  two  previously  unnoticed  outbursts, spaced by
          intervals  of  ~330  days,  that  occurred in July 2003 and May
          2004.  The  5-100keV  spectrum  is  well described by a cut-off
          power  law,  with  a  photon index of 0.5, and a cut-off energy
          ~15-20keV,  typical  of  High  Mass  X-ray  Binaries  hosting a
          neutron  star.  A  5-100keV  luminosity  of 3E36 erg/s has been
          derived  (assuming  6.2kpc,  the distance of the likely optical
          counterpart).  The  5-100keV spectral properties, the recurrent
          nature  of the outbursts,together with the reduced error region
          containing   the  blue  supergiant  star  HD306414,support  the
          hypothesis  that IGRJ11215-5952 is a member of the class of the
          Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients.

          Birmingham, UK)
          Comments:  5  pages, 2 figures. To appear in the proceedings of
          ESO  Astrophysics  Symposia:  "Groups of Galaxies in the Nearby
          Universe", eds. I. Saviane, V. Ivanov, J. Burissova (Springer)
          Using  Chandra X-ray data of a sample of 15 X-ray bright galaxy
          groups,  we  present preliminary results of a coherent study of
          the  radial  distribution of metal abundances in the hot gas in
          groups.  The  iron  content  in  group outskirts is found to be
          lower  than in clusters by a factor of ~2, despite showing mean
          levels  in the central regions comparable to those of clusters.
          The  abundance  profiles are used to constrain the contribution
          from  supernovae  type Ia and II to the chemical enrichment and
          thermal  energy  of  the  intragroup  medium at different group
          radii.  The  results  suggest a scenario in which a substantial
          fraction  of  the  chemical  enrichment of groups took place in
          filaments prior to group collapse.

          RX J1554.2+2721
          Authors: A.D. Schwope, M.R. Schreiber, P. Szkody
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, accepted for A&A
          We  report  the detection of a 110 MG cyclotron harmonic in the
          SDSS-spectrum  of  the  magnetic  cataclysmic variable (MCV) RX
          J1554.2+2721.  This  feature  was  noted  earlier by others but
          remained  unexplained.  The  wide  spectral coverage of the new
          spectrum  together with the earlier detection of a Zeeman split
          Ly-a  line in a field of 144 MG makes the identification almost
          unambiguous.   We   propose   to   explain  the  non-conforming
          UV-optical photospheric temperature of the white dwarf by an as
          yet  unobserved  cyclotron  component  in the ultraviolet which
          also  could  significantly  contribute  to  the  overall energy
          balance of the accretion process.

          Title: The X-ray nuclei of intermediate-redshift radio sources
          Authors: M. J. Hardcastle, D. A. Evans, J. H. Croston
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS. 12 pages, 5 figures
          We  present  a  Chandra and XMM-Newton spectral analysis of the
          nuclei  of  the  radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars from the
          3CRR  sample  in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.5. In the range
          of  radio luminosity sampled by these objects, mostly FRIIs, it
          has  been  clear  for  some  time  that  a  population of radio
          galaxies   (`low-excitation   radio  galaxies')  cannot  easily
          participate in models that unify narrow-line radio galaxies and
          broad-line objects. We show that low-excitation and narrow-line
          radio  galaxies  have  systematically  different  nuclear X-ray
          properties: while narrow-line radio galaxies universally show a
          heavily  absorbed  nuclear  X-ray  component,  such  a  heavily
          absorbed  component  is  rarely  found  in  sources  classed as
          low-excitation  objects. Combining our data with the results of
          our  earlier  work  on  the  z<0.1 3CRR sources, we discuss the
          implications of this result for unified models, for the origins
          of mid-infrared emission from radio sources, and for the nature
          of  the  apparent  FRI/FRII dichotomy in the X-ray. The lack of
          direct  evidence  for  accretion-related X-ray emission in FRII
          LERGs leads us to argue that there is a strong possibility that
          some,  or most, FRII LERGs accrete in a radiatively inefficient
          mode.  However, our results are also consistent with a model in
          which   the   accretion   mode   is   the  same  for  low-  and
          high-excitation FRIIs, with the lower accretion luminosities in
          FRII   LERGs   attributed   instead  to  more  efficient  radio
          luminosity production in those objects.

          Disks  are  a  natural outcome of the star formation process in
          which  they  play  a  crucial  role. Luminous, massive stars of
          spectral  type  earlier  than  B4  are  likely to be those that
          benefit  most  from the existence of accretion disks, which may
          significantly  reduce  the  effect of radiation pressure on the
          accreting material. The scope of the present contribution is to
          review  the  current  knowledge  about disks in young high-mass
          (proto)stars and discuss their implications. The issues of disk
          stability and lifetime are also discussed. We conclude that for
          protostars  of  less  than  ~20  solar  masses, disks with mass
          comparable  to  that of the central star are common. Above this
          limit  the  situation is unclear and there are no good examples
          of  proto  O4-O8  stars surrounded by accretion disks: in these
          objects  only huge, massive, toroidal, non-equilibrium rotating
          structures  are  seen.  It  is clear on the other hand that the
          observed  disks in stars of 10-20 solar masses are likely to be
          unstable and with short lifetimes.

          We  present  a  high  quality  multiwavelength (from 0.3 to 8.0
          micron)  catalog  of  the  large  and  deep  area  in the GOODS
          Southern   Field  covered  by  the  deep  near-IR  observations
          obtained  with  the  ESO  VLT. The catalog is entirely based on
          public  data:  in  our  analysis,  we  have included the F435W,
          F606W,  F775W  and  F850LP  ACS  images, the JHKs VLT data, the
          Spitzer data provided by IRAC instrument (3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0
          micron), and publicly available U-band data from the 2.2ESO and
          VLT-VIMOS.  We  describe  in  detail  the procedures adopted to
          obtain   this   multiwavelength   catalog.  In  particular,  we
          developed  a  specific software for the accurate "PSF-matching"
          of  space  and  ground-based images of different resolution and
          depth   (ConvPhot),   of  which  we  analyse  performances  and
          limitations.  We  have  included  both  z-selected,  as well as
          Ks-selected   objects,   yielding   a  unique,  self-consistent
          catalog.  The largest fraction of the sample is 90% complete at
          z~26  or  Ks~23.8  (AB scale). Finally, we cross-correlated our
          data  with  all  the  spectroscopic catalogs available to date,
          assigning  a  spectroscopic redshift to more than 1000 sources.
          The  final  catalog is made up of 14847 objects, at least 72 of
          which  are  known  stars,  68  are  AGNs, and 928 galaxies with
          spectroscopic  redshift  (668  galaxies  with reliable redshift
          determination).  We  applied  our  photometric redshift code to
          this data set, and the comparison with the spectroscopic sample
          shows  that  the quality of the resulting photometric redshifts
          is  excellent,  with  an average scatter of only 0.06. The full
          catalog,  which  we named GOODS-MUSIC (MUltiwavelength Southern
          Infrared  Catalog), including the spectroscopic information, is
          made   publicly   available,   together   with   the   software
          specifically designed to this end.

          We  use  the GOODS-MUSIC sample, a catalog of ~3000 Ks-selected
          galaxies  based  on  VLT and HST observation of the GOODS-South
          field  with  extended  multi-wavelength coverage (from 0.3 to 8
          micron)  and accurate estimates of the photometric redshifts to
          select  179 DRGs with J-Ks>1.3 in an area of 135 sq. arcmin. We
          first  show  that  the  J-Ks>1.3  criterion  selects  a  rather
          heterogeneous  sample  of  galaxies,  going  from  the targeted
          high-redshift   luminous  evolved  systems,  to  a  significant
          fraction  of  lower  redshift  (1<z<2)  and less luminous dusty
          starbursts.  These  low-redshift  DRGs  are  significantly less
          clustered  than  higher-z  DRGs.  With  the  aid of extreme and
          simplified  theoretical  models of clustering evolution we show
          that  it  is  unlikely  that the two samples are drawn from the
          same  population observed at two different stages of evolution.
          High-z  DRGs  likely  represent  the  progenitors  of  the more
          massive  and  more  luminous galaxies in the local Universe and
          might  mark  the regions that will later evolve into structures
          of  intermediate  mass,  like  groups or small galaxy clusters.
          Low-z DRGs, on the other hand, will likely evolve into slightly
          less massive field galaxies.

          spectroscopic  observations were obtained for QS Tel, V834 Cen,
          and  BL  Hyi.  The  optical  light  curves  of all three polars
          displayed  large  magnitude  changes  during  our observations.
          These  same  high/low  state  transitions were also apparent in
          near-infrared  JHK photometry, though with decreased amplitude.
          The  color  of the polar with respect to its state was examined
          and  found  not  to  be  a  good indicator of the instantaneous
          state.  During low to high state transitions, a nearly constant
          magnitude  difference  was  observed  in all three polars. This
          $\Delta$m  value  was  found  to  be  consistent with the level
          expected to occur if accretion onto the white dwarf reached the
          Eddington  luminosity  during  the  high  state. The high state
          Balmer  decrement  was  measured  for  each  star  and  used to
          estimate  that  the  temperature  of  the emission line forming
          region  was  ~12,000K with N$_H$ near 12.8 dex. No relationship
          between  the  Balmer emission line strength and the white dwarf
          magnetic  field  strength  was  seen,  in  contrast  to  a good
          correlation  between  these  two  parameters  observed  for  UV
          emission lines.

          Title:   New   Gamma   Cas-like   objects:  X-ray  and  optical

          A growing number of early Be stars exhibit unusually hard X-ray
          spectra  and luminosities intermediate between those typical of
          early type stars and those emitted by most Be/X-ray binaries in
          quiescence. We report on XMM-Newton and optical observations of
          two  such  Be stars, SAO 49725 and HD 161103. The nature of the
          hard-thermal  X-ray  emission  is discussed in the light of the
          models  proposed  for Gamma Cas, magnetic disc-star interaction
          or  accretion onto a compact companion object - neutron star or
          white  dwarf.  These  two  new  objects  added to similar cases
          discovered  in  XMM-Newton  surveys point at the emergence of a
          new class of Gamma Cas analogs.

          Title:   Gravitational   Recoil   during   Binary   Black  Hole
          Coalescence using the Effective One Body Approach
          Authors: Thibault Damour, Achamveedu Gopakumar
          Comments: 45 pages, 8 figures
          During  the  coalescence  of  binary black holes, gravitational
          waves carry linear momentum away from the source, which results
          in  the  recoil  of the center of mass. Using the Effective One
          Body approach, that includes nonperturbative resummed estimates
          for  the  damping  and conservative parts of the compact binary
          dynamics,  we  compute  the recoil during the late inspiral and
          the subsequent plunge of non-spinning black holes of comparable
          masses  moving  in  quasi-circular  orbits.  Further,  using  a
          prescription  that  smoothly  connects  the  plunge  phase to a
          perturbed  single  black  hole,  we  obtain an estimate for the
          total recoil associated with the binary black hole coalescence.
          We  show that the crucial physical feature which determines the
          magnitude of the terminal recoil is the presence of a ``burst''
          of  linear  momentum  flux emitted slightly before coalescence.
          When  using the most natural expression for the linear momentum
          flux  during  the plunge, we find that the maximum value of the
          terminal  recoil  is  $\sim  74$  km/s  and  occurs for $\eta =
          \frac{m_1  m_2}  {(m_1+ m_2)^2} \simeq 0.2$, {i.e.}, for a mass
          ratio $m_2/m_1 \simeq 0.38$. Away from this optimal mass ratio,
          the  recoil  velocity decreases approximately proportionally to
          the  scaling  function  $\tilde  f  (\eta)  =  \eta^2  (1  -  4
          \eta)^{1/2} (1.0912 - 1.04 \eta + 2.92 \eta^2) $. We comment on
          the  reasons  why  our estimate for the recoil is significantly
          smaller  than  previous  ones,  and  conclude that more work is
          needed  on  the  location  and  amplitude of the peak of linear
          momentum  flux  radiated  during  the  plunge  before  one  can
          analytically  estimate the maximum value of the recoil velocity
          in a reliable way.

          We  present  observations of six late-type members of the young
          cluster  IC  348  detected  at  24  microns  with the Multiband
          Imaging  Photometer  for  Spitzer(MIPS).  At  least four of the
          objects  are  probably  substellar.  Combining  these data with
          ground-based   optical   and   near-infrared   photometry   and
          complementary  observations  with  the  Infrared  Array  Camera
          (IRAC), we have modeled the spectral energy distributions using
          detailed  models  of irradiated accretion disks. We are able to
          fit the observations with models using a range of maximum grain
          sizes  from  ISM-type  dust to grains as large as 1 millimeter.
          Two  objects  show  a  lack  of  excess emission at wavelengths
          shortward  of  5.8-8  microns  but significant excess at longer
          wavelengths,  indicative  of  large optically thin or evacuated
          inner  holes.  Our  models  indicate  a  inner hole of radius ~
          0.5-0.9  AU  for  the brown dwarf L316; this is the first brown
          dwarf with evidence for an AU-scale inner disk hole. We examine
          several possible mechanisms for the inner disk clearing in this
          case, including photoevaporation and planet formation.

          Title: Observed Planetary Nebulae as Descendants of Interacting
          Binary Systems
          Authors: Noam Soker (Technion, Israel)
          Comments: Submitted To ApJ Lett
          We  examine  recent  studies on the formation rate of planetary
          nebulae  and  find  this  rate  to  be  about  one-third of the
          formation  rate  of  white dwarfs. This implies than only about
          one-third  of  all  planetary nebulae that evolve to form white
          dwarfs  are actually bright enough to be observed. This finding
          corresponds  with  the  claim that it is necessary for a binary
          companion  to interact with the asymptotic giant branch stellar
          progenitor  for  the  descendant planetary nebulae to be bright
          enough  to  be  detected.  The finding about the formation rate
          also  strengthens  De  Marco's  conjecture that the majority of
          observed  planetary  nebulae  harbor  binary  systems. In other
          words,  single  stars  almost  never  form  observed  planetary
          nebulae.

          Title: Refining the fundamental plane of accreting black holes
          Authors:  Elmar  Koerding  (U.  of  Southampton),  Heino Falcke
          (ASTRON/U. of Nijmegen), Sephane Corbel (AIM, CEA Saclay)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A
          The  idea  of a unified description of supermassive and stellar
          black  holes  has  been  supported  by  the  extension  of  the
          empirical radio/X-ray correlation from X-ray binaries to active
          galactic  nuclei through the inclusion of a mass term. This has
          lead  to the so-called fundamental plane of black hole activity
          in  the  black hole mass, radio and X-ray luminosity space. Two
          incarnations  of  this  fundamental  plane  have  so  far  been
          suggested  using  different  underlying  models  and  using two
          different  samples of accreting black holes. We present revised
          samples  for  both  studies together with a refined statistical
          analysis  using measured errors of the observables. This method
          is  used to compare the two samples, discuss selection effects,
          and infer parameters for the fundamental plane in a homogeneous
          way.  We  show  that  strongly sub-Eddington objects in a state
          equivalent  to  the low/hard state of X-ray binaries follow the
          fundamental  plane  very  tightly; the scatter is comparable to
          the  measurement  errors.  However,  we find that the estimated
          parameters  depend  strongly  on  the  assumptions  made on the
          sources of scatter and the relative weight of the different AGN
          classes  in  the  sample.  Using  only  hard state objects, the
          fundamental  plane  is  in  agreement  with the prediction of a
          simple   uncooled   synchrotron/jet   model   for  the  emitted
          radiation.   Inclusion  of  high-state  objects  increases  the
          scatter  and  moves the correlation closer to a disk/jet model.
          This is qualitatively consistent with a picture where low-state
          objects  are largely dominated by jet emission while high-state
          objects have a strong contribution from an accretion disk.

          Comments: 12 pages, 1 figure, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  find  self-similar solutions to describe the interaction of

          with an ambient medium having a power law density distribution.
          Using  this  solution, the time evolution of the Lorentz factor

          energy,  the mass of the ejecta, and parameters for the ambient
          medium.  These  solutions  are an ultra-relativistic version of
          the  solutions  for  the circumstellar interaction of supernova

          Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  report  detections  of  six  high-redshift (1.8 < z < 6.4),
          optically  luminous,  radio-quiet  quasars at 350 micron, using
          the  SHARC  II  bolometer  camera  at the Caltech Submillimeter
          Observatory.    Our   observations   double   the   number   of
          high-redshift  quasars  for  which  350  micron  photometry  is
          available.  By  combining  the  350  micron  measurements  with
          observations at other submillimeter/millimeter wavelengths, for
          each  source we have determined the temperature of the emitting
          dust  (ranging from 40 to 60 K) and the far-infrared luminosity
          (0.6  to  2.2  x  10(13) Lo). The combined mean spectral energy
          distribution  (SED)  of  all  high-redshift quasars with two or
          more  rest  frame far-infrared photometric measurements is best
          fit  with  a  greybody with temperature of 47 +- 3 K and a dust
          emissivity  power-law spectral index of beta = 1.6 +- 0.1. This
          warm  dust component is a good tracer of the starburst activity
          of  the  quasar  host  galaxy. The ratio of the far-infrared to
          radio    luminosities   of   infrared   luminous,   radio-quiet
          high-redshift  quasars  is consistent with that found for local
          star-forming galaxies.

          Meteors 2005, Proceedings IAU Symposium 229
          The  discovery  of binaries in each of the major populations of
          minor  bodies  in the solar system is propelling a rapid growth
          of    heretofore   unattainable   physical   information.   The
          availability  of  mass and density constraints for minor bodies
          opens  the  door  to studies of internal structure, comparisons
          with meteorite samples, and correlations between bulk- physical
          and  surface-spectral  properties. The number of known binaries
          is  now more than 70 and is growing rapidly. The relative sizes
          and  separations  of  binaries  in  the  different  minor  body
          populations  point to more than one mechanism for forming bound
          pairs. Collisions appear to play a major role in the Main Belt.
          Rotational  and/or  tidal  fission may be important in the Near
          Earth  population.  For  the Kuiper Belt, capture in multi-body
          interactions  may  be  the  preferred formation mechanism. High
          angular  resolution observations from space and from the ground
          are  critical  for detection of the relatively distant binaries
          in  the  Main Belt and the Kuiper Belt. Radar has been the most
          productive   method  for  detection  of  Near  Earth  binaries.
          Lightcurve analysis is an independent technique that is capable
          of  exploring  phase space inaccessible to direct observations.
          Finally,    spacecraft    flybys    have   played   a   crucial
          paradigm-changing  role  with  discoveries  that  unlocked this
          now-burgeoning field.

          Title:  Analysing  the  atolls:  X-ray  spectral transitions of
          accreting neutron stars
          Authors: Jeanette Gladstone, Chris Done, Marek Gierlinski
          We  systematically  analyse  all the available X-ray spectra of
          disc  accreting  neutron stars (atolls and millisecond pulsars)
          from  the  RXTE  database.  We  show  that while these all show
          similar  spectral  evolution  as  a  function of mass accretion
          rate,   there  are  also  subtle  differences.  There  are  two
          different  types  of  hard/soft  transition,  those  where  the
          spectrum  softens  at all energies, leading to a diagonal track
          on  a  colour-colour  diagram,  and those where only the higher
          energy   spectrum   softens,   giving  a  vertical  track.  The
          luminosity  at  which  the transition occurs is correlated with
          this spectral behaviour, with the vertical transition at L/LEdd
          ~ 0.02 while the diagonal one is at ~ 0.1. Superimposed on this
          is  the well known hysteresis effect, but we show that classic,
          large  scale hysteresis occurs only in the outbursting sources,
          indicating that its origin is in the dramatic rate of change of
          mass  accretion  rate during the disc instability. We show that
          the   long   term  mass  accretion  rate  correlates  with  the
          transition  behaviour,  and  speculate  that this is due to the
          magnetic  field  being  able  to  emerge  from the neutron star
          surface for low average mass accretion rates. While this is not
          strong  enough  to collimate the flow except in the millisecond
          pulsars,  its  presence  may  affect  the  inner accretion flow
          through changing the jet properties.

          Title: Can single O stars produce non-thermal radio emission?
          Authors: S. Van Loo, M.C. Runacres, R. Blomme
          Comments: 10 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication by A&A
          We  present  a  model  for  the non-thermal radio emission from
          presumably  single  O  stars,  in terms of synchrotron emission
          from   relativistic   electrons  accelerated  in  wind-embedded
          shocks.  These  shocks are associated with an unstable, chaotic
          wind.  The  main  improvement with respect to earlier models is
          the  inclusion  of  the radial dependence of the shock velocity
          jump   and   compression  ratio,  based  on  1D  hydrodynamical
          simulations.   The  decrease  of  the  velocity  jump  and  the
          compression  ratio  as  a function of radius produces a rapidly
          decreasing  synchrotron  emissivity. This effectively prohibits
          the  models from reproducing the spectral shape of the observed
          non-thermal  radio emission. We investigate a number of "escape
          routes"  by  which  the  hydrodynamical  predictions  might  be
          reconciled  with  the radio observations. Although these escape
          routes  reproduce  the  observed  spectral shape, none of these
          escape   routes   are   physically  plausible.  In  particular,
          re-acceleration  by  feeding an electron distribution through a
          number   of   shocks,   is   in   contradiction   with  current
          hydrodynamical  simulations.  These  hydrodynamical simulations
          have their limitations, most notably the use of 1D. At present,
          it is not feasible to perform 2D simulations of the wind out to
          the  distances  required for synchrotron-emission models. Based
          on  the  current  hydrodynamic  models,  we  suspect  that  the
          observed  non-thermal  radio  emission  from  O stars cannot be
          explained   by   wind-embedded   shocks   associated  with  the
          instability  of  the  line-driving  mechanism.  The most likely
          alternative  mechanism  is  synchrotron emission from colliding
          winds. That would imply that all O stars with non-thermal radio
          emission should be members of binary or multiple systems.

          The   Galactic   Bulge  region  is  a  rich  host  of  variable
          high-energy  point  sources.  These  sources include bright and
          relatively  faint  X-ray transients, X-ray bursters, persistent
          neutron  star and black-hole candidate binaries, X-ray pulsars,
          etc..  We  have  a program to monitor the Galactic Bulge region
          regularly   and   frequently  with  the  gamma-ray  observatory
          INTEGRAL.   As  a  service  to  the  scientific  community  the
          high-energy  light  curves of all the active sources as well as
          images  of  the  region  are made available through the WWW. We
          show the first results of this exciting new program.

          Title:  Dust  flow  in  gas  disks  in the presence of embedded
          planets
          Authors: S.-J. Paardekooper, G. Mellema
          Comments: 13 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          We  study the dynamics of gas and dust in a protoplanetary disk
          in  the  presence  of  embedded  planets.  We  investigate  the
          conditions for dust-gap formation in terms of particle size and
          planetary  mass.  We  also  monitor  the amount of dust that is
          accreted  by the planet relative to the amount of gas, which is
          an  important parameter in determining the enrichment of solids
          in  giant  planets compared to the solid content of the central
          star.  We  use  a new two-fluid hydrodynamics code to solve the
          flow  equations  for  both  gas and dust. For the gas, we use a
          Godunov-type scheme with an approximate Riemann solver (the Roe
          solver).  The  dust  is  treated  as  a  pressureless  fluid by
          essentially  the  same numerical method as is used for the gas.
          We  find  that it only takes a planet of 0.05 Jupiter masses to
          open  up  a  gap  in  a  disk  with a significant population of
          mm-sized  particles.  Dust  particles  larger  than  150 micron
          participate  in  gap formation. We also find that the formation
          of  the gap severely slows down dust accretion compared to that
          in  the  gas.  Therefore,  it is not possible to enrich a newly
          formed giant planet in solids, if these solids are contained in
          particles with sizes from 150 micron to approximately 10 cm.

          Title:  Stochastic  Acceleration  in  the  Galactic Center HESS
          Source

          Fatuzzo
          Comments: 19 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ApJ
          Stochastic   acceleration  of  charged  particles  in  a  small
          accretion  torus appears to be the likely mechanism responsible
          for   much  of  Sagittarius  A*'s  mm  and  shorter  wavelength
          spectrum. The longer wavelength radiation is produced at larger
          radii  by  electrons  either  diffusing  from smaller scales or
          accelerated  {\it  in  situ}.  An  important prediction of this
          model  is  the  ejection  of a significant flux of relativistic
          protons  from a magnetic-field-dominated acceleration site into
          the  wind-shocked  medium surrounding the black hole. Recently,
          several  air  {\v{C}}erenkov  telescopes,  notably  HESS,  have
          detected  TeV  emission  from within $1^\prime$ of the Galactic
          Center, with characteristics hinting at a pp-induced pion decay
          process  for  the  $\gamma$-ray emission. Given that we can now
          map  the  wind-injected  ISM  within $\sim 3$ pc of the nucleus
          using  the  diffuse  X-rays  detected with {\it Chandra}, it is
          feasible to test the idea that protons accelerated within $\sim
          20$  Schwarzschild  radii  of  the  black  hole produce the TeV
          emission  farther  out.  We  show  that the diffusion length of
          these particles away from their source guarantees a majority of
          TeV  protons  scattering  at  least  once within $\sim 3$ pc of
          Sagittarius A*, and we demonstrate that the proton power ($\sim
          10^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) produced in concert with the 7-mm radio
          emission  matches  the TeV luminosity well. This model explains
          why  the  TeV source is unresolved, yet does not vary on a time
          scale  of  a  year  or  less,  and  it  also  accounts  for the
          high-energy  emission while retaining consistency with Sgr A*'s
          well-studied cm and mm characteristics.

          The  shape  and  the  intensity  of the 6.4 keV iron line bring
          unique  information  on the geometrical and physical properties
          of  the  supermassive  black hole and the surrounding accreting
          gas  at  the very center of Active Galactic Nuclei. While there
          are  convincing  evidences of a relativistically broadened iron
          line in a few nearby bright objects, their properties at larger
          distances  are  basically  unknown.  We  have  searched for the
          presence  of iron line by fully exploiting Chandra observations
          in the deep fields. The line is clearly detected in the average
          spectra  of  about 250 sources stacked in several redshift bins
          over  the  range z=0.5-4.0. We discuss their average properties
          with  particular  enphasys  on  the presence and intensity of a
          broad component.

          mass, short gamma-ray bursts, and quasinormal mode ringing
          Authors: Masaru Shibata, Keisuke Taniguchi

          Phys.Rev.D
          Three-dimensional  simulations for the merger of binary neutron
          stars  (BNSs)  are  performed  in the framework of full general
          relativity.  We pay particular attention to the black hole (BH)
          formation  case  and  to  the resulting mass of the surrounding
          disk  for  exploring  possibility  for formation of the central
          engine  of short-duration gamma-ray bursts. Hybrid equations of
          state  (EOSs)  are  adopted  mimicking realistic, stiff nuclear
          EOSs,  for which the maximum allowed gravitational mass of cold
          and  spherical  neutron  stars  (NSs),  M_sph,  is  larger than
          2M_sun.  For  the simulations, we focus on BNSs of the ADM mass
          M>2.6M_sun. For M>M_thr, the merger results in prompt formation
          of a BH irrespective of the mass ratio Q_M with 0.65<Q_M<1. The
          value  of  M_thr  is approximately written as 1.3-1.35M_sph for
          the  chosen  EOSs.  For  the  BH  formation case, we evolve the
          spacetime  using a BH excision technique and determine the mass
          of  a  quasistationary  disk  surrounding the BH. The disk mass
          steeply  increases  with  decreasing the value of Q_M for given
          ADM  mass  and  EOS. For M<M_thr, the outcome is a hypermassive
          neutron  star  (HMNS)  of  a  large  ellipticity.  If  the HMNS
          collapses   to   a  BH  after  the  longterm  angular  momentum
          transport, the disk mass may be >0.01M_sun. Gravitational waves
          (GWs)   are   computed  in  terms  of  a  gauge-invariant  wave
          extraction   technique.   In   the   formation   of  the  HMNS,
          quasiperiodic  GWs  of  frequency  (3-3.5kHz)  are emitted. The
          effective  amplitude of GWs can be >5x10^{-21} at a distance of
          50  Mpc.  For  the BH formation case, the BH excision technique
          enables  a longterm computation and extraction of ring-down GWs
          associated  with  a  BH  quasinormal mode. It is found that the
          frequency and amplitude are 6.5-7kHz and 10^{-22} at a distance
          of 50Mpc for M=2.7-2.9M_sun.

          Title:  The effect of dust obscuration in RR Tel on optical and

          Comments: 19 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables
          Infrared and optical photometric and spectroscopic observations
          of  the symbiotic nova RR Tel are used to study the effects and
          properties of dust in symbiotic binaries containing a cool Mira
          component, as well as showing "obscuration events" of increased
          absorption,  which  are  typical  for  such  Miras.  A  set  of
          photometric  observations  of  the  symbiotic  nova  RR  Tel in
          different  wavelength  bands  -  visual  from  1949 to 2002 and
          near-infrared  (JHKL)  from  1975  to 2002 - are presented. The
          variability  due  to the normal Mira pulsation was removed from
          the  JHKL  data, which were then compared with the AAVSO visual
          light  curve.  The  changes  of  the Fe II emission line fluxes
          during  the  1996-2000  obscuration episode were studied in the
          optical spectra taken with the Anglo-Australian telescope.
          We  discuss  the  three periods during which the Mira component
          was  heavily  obscured  by  dust  as  observed in the different
          wavelength  bands. A change in the correlations of J with other
          infrared  magnitudes  was  observed  with  the  colour becoming
          redder  after  JD2446000.  Generally, J-K was comparable, while
          K-L was larger than typical values for single Miras. A distance
          estimate  of  2.5 kpc, based on the IR data, is given. A larger
          flux  decrease  for  the permitted than for the forbidden Fe II
          lines,  during the obscuration episode studied, has been found.
          There   is   no  evidence  for  other  correlations  with  line
          properties,  in  particular  with  wavelength,  which  suggests
          obscuration due to separate optically thick clouds in the outer
          layers.

          Title: Star Cluster Evolution: From young massive star clusters
          to old globulars
          Authors: Richard de Grijs (University of Sheffield, UK)
          Comments:  4 pages, to appear in "Globular Clusters - Guides to
          Galaxies", a conference held in Concepcion, Chile, March 2006
          Young,   massive   star  clusters  are  the  most  notable  and
          significant  end  products  of  violent  star-forming  episodes
          triggered  by galaxy collisions, mergers, and close encounters.
          The  question  remains,  however,  whether  or  not  at least a
          fraction of the compact YMCs seen in abundance in extragalactic
          starbursts, are potentially the progenitors of globular cluster
          (GC)-type   objects.   However,   because  of  the  lack  of  a
          statistically  significant  sample of similar nearby objects we
          need  to  resort  to  either  statistical  arguments  or to the
          painstaking  approach  of  case  by  case studies of individual
          objects  in  more  distant  galaxies.  Despite the difficulties
          inherent   to  addressing  this  issue  conclusively,  an  ever
          increasing  body of observational evidence lends support to the
          scenario  that  GCs,  which  were once thought to be the oldest
          building blocks of galaxies, are still forming today.

          Title:  On  the limit cycle instability in magnetized accretion
          discs
          Authors: A. Merloni (MPA), S. Nayakshin (Univ. of Leicester)
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures. MNRAS, submitted
          Observational   evidence   accumulated  over  the  past  decade
          indicates  that accretion discs in X-ray binaries are viscously
          stable  unless  they accrete very close to the Eddington limit.
          This  is  at  odds  with the most basic standard accretion disc
          theory, but could be explained by either having the discs to be
          much  cooler whereby they are not radiation pressure dominated,
          or  by  a  more sophisticated viscosity law. Here we argue that
          the  latter  is  taking  place  in  practice, on the basis of a
          stability analysis that assumes that the
          magneto-rotational-instability (MRI) responsible for generating
          the  turbulent stresses inside the discs is also the source for
          a  magnetically  dominated corona. We show that observations of
          stable discs in the high/soft states of black hole binaries, on
          the  one  hand,  and  of  the strongly variable microquasar GRS
          1915+105  on  the  other,  can all be explained if the magnetic
          turbulent  stresses inside the disc scale proportionally to the
          geometric  mean  of  gas  and total pressure with a constant of
          proportionality  (viscosity  parameter) having a value of a few
          times  10^{-2}.  Implications  for  bright AGN are also briefly
          discussed.

          We  present Spitzer 3.6-160 micron images, Spitzer mid-infrared
          spectra,  and  JCMT  SCUBA  850  micron  images of the Sombrero
          Galaxy  (NGC  4594),  an  Sa  galaxy  with  a  10^9 M_solar low
          luminosity   active   galactic  nucleus  (AGN).  The  brightest
          infrared  sources  in  the  galaxy are the nucleus and the dust
          ring.  The spectral energy distribution of the AGN demonstrates
          that,  while  the  environment  around  the  AGN is a prominent
          source of mid-infrared emission, it is a relatively weak source
          of  far-infrared  emission,  as  had  been  inferred for AGN in
          previous research. The weak nuclear 160 micron emission and the
          negligible  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbon emission from the
          nucleus  also  implies  that the nucleus is a site of only weak
          star  formation  activity  and  the nucleus contains relatively
          little  cool  interstellar gas needed to fuel such activity. We
          propose  that  this galaxy may be representative of a subset of
          low  ionization  nuclear emission region galaxies that are in a
          quiescent  AGN  phase because of the lack of gas needed to fuel
          circumnuclear  star  formation  and  Seyfert-like AGN activity.
          Surprisingly,  the  AGN is the predominant source of 850 micron
          emission.  We  examine  the  possible  emission mechanisms that
          could  give  rise  to  the  850  micron  emission and find that
          neither thermal dust emission, CO line emission, bremsstrahlung
          emission,  nor  the  synchrotron  emission  observed  at  radio
          wavelengths can adequately explain the measured 850 micron flux
          density  by  themselves.  The  remaining  possibilities for the
          source  of  the  850  micron  emission include a combination of
          known   emission   mechanisms,  synchrotron  emission  that  is
          self-absorbed  at  wavelengths  longer  than  850  microns,  or
          unidentified spectral lines in the 850 micron band.

          We  report  the results of high spectral and angular resolution
          infrared  observations  of  the  multiple system GL 569 A and B
          that were intended to measure the dynamical masses of the brown
          dwarf  binary  believed  to comprise GL 569 B. Our analysis did
          not  yield  this  result  but, instead, revealed two surprises.
          First,  at  age  ~100  Myr, the system is younger than had been
          reported  earlier.  Second,  our  spectroscopic and photometric
          results  provide  support for earlier indications that GL 569 B
          is  actually  a  hierarchical  brown dwarf triple rather than a
          binary. Our results suggest that the three components of GL 569
          B have roughly equal mass, ~0.04 Msun.

          The  spectra  of Herbig Haro objects are usually characteristic
          of  ionization  and  excitation in shock-heated gas, whether an
          internal  shock in an unsteady outflow or a bow shock interface
          with the interstellar medium. We examine the eastern-most shock
          --  the  leading  optically  visible  shock -- of a Herbig Haro
          outflow  (HH  529)  seen  projected  on  the  face of the Orion
          Nebula,  using  deep optical echelle spectroscopy, showing that
          the  spectrum of this gas is consistent with photoionization by
          $\theta^1$  Ori C. By modeling the emission lines, we determine
          a  gas-phase  abundance  of  Fe  which  is  consistent with the
          depleted  (relative  to  solar)  abundance  found  in the Orion
          nebula  --  evidence for the presence of dust in the nebula and
          therefore  in the Herbig Haro outflow. The spectrum also allows
          for  the calculation of temperature fluctuations, $t^2$, in the
          nebula  and  the  shock.  These  fluctuations have been used to
          explain   discrepancies   between   abundances   obtained  from
          recombination     lines     versus    those    obtained    from
          collisionally-excited  lines,  although  to  date there has not
          been  a  robust  theory for how such large fluctuations ($t^2 >
          0.02$) can exist.

          Title:  The  Anisoplanatic  Point  Spread  Function in Adaptive
          Optics
          Authors: Matthew Britton
          Comments: 26 pages, 7 figures
          The  effects  of  anisoplanatism  on  the adaptive optics point
          spread  function  are  investigated.  A  model  is derived that
          combines  observations  of  the  guide  star  with  an analytic
          formulation  of  anisoplanatism to generate predictions for the
          adaptive  optics  point  spread function at arbitrary locations
          within the field of view. The analytic formulation captures the
          dependencies  of anisoplanatism on aperture diameter, observing
          wavelength,   angular   offset,  zenith  angle  and  turbulence
          profile.   The  predictions  of  this  model  are  compared  to
          narrowband  2.12  um  and  1.65 um images of a 21 arcsec binary
          (mV=7.3,  7.6) acquired with the Palomar Adaptive Optics System
          on  the Hale 5 meter telescope. Contemporaneous measurements of
          the  turbulence  profile  made  with  a DIMM/MASS unit are used
          together with images of the primary to predict the point spread
          function  of  the  binary companion. Predicted companion Strehl
          ratios are shown to match measurements to within a few percent,
          whereas    predictions   based   on   the   isoplanatic   angle
          approximation  are  highly  discrepant. The predicted companion
          point  spread functions are shown to agree with observations to
          10%.  These  predictions  are  used to measure the differential
          photometry  between  binary members to an accuracy of 1 part in
          10^{-3},  and  the  differential astrometry to an accuracy of 1
          mas.  Errors  in  the  differential  astrometry are shown to be
          dominated   by  differential  atmospheric  tilt  jitter.  These
          results  are  compared  to  other  techniques  that  have  been
          employed for photometry, astrometry, and high contrast imaging.

          Title: Methanol detection in M82
          Authors: S.Martn, J.Martn-Pintado, R.Mauersberger
          Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A Letters
          We  present  a  multilevel  study  of the emission of methanol,
          detected  for  the  first  time in this galaxy, and discuss the
          origin of its emission. The high observed methanol abundance of
          a few 10^-9 can only be explained if injection of methanol from
          dust   grains   is   taken  into  account.  While  the  overall
          [CH3OH]/[NH3]  ratio is much larger than observed towards other
          starbursts, the dense high excitation component shows a similar
          value  to  that found in NGC 253 and Maffei 2. Our observations
          suggest  the  molecular  material in M 82 to be formed by dense
          warm  cores,  shielded from the UV radiation and similar to the
          molecular  clouds  in  other  starbursts,  surrounded by a less
          dense  photodissociated  halo.  The dense warm cores are likely
          the location of recent and future star formation within M 82.

          Argentinian Astronomical Society, baaa-eng.sty
          We  study  the  effects  of  Supernova  (SN)  feedback  on  the
          formation of disc galaxies. For that purpose we run simulations
          using  the extended version of the code GADGET-2 which includes
          a  treatment  of chemical and energy feedback by SN explosions.
          We  found  that  our model succeeds in setting a self-regulated
          star  formation process since an important fraction of the cold
          gas  from the center of the haloes is efficiently heated up and
          transported  outwards.  The  impact  of SN feedback on galactic
          systems is also found to depend on virial mass: smaller systems
          are  more  strongly  affected  with star formation histories in
          which  several starbursts can develop. Our implementation of SN
          feedback  is  also  successful in producing violent outflows of
          chemical enriched material.

          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          A   proof   of   the   relativistic  $H$-theorem  by  including
          nonextensive   effects   is   given.   As  it  happens  in  the
          nonrelativistic  limit, the molecular chaos hypothesis advanced
          by  Boltzmann  does  not  remain  valid,  and the second law of
          thermodynamics  combined  with a duality transformation implies
          that  the  q-parameter  lies  on the interval [0,2]. It is also
          proved  that  the  collisional equilibrium states (null entropy
          source  term)  are  described by the relativistic $q$-power law
          extension   of   the  exponential  Juttner  distribution  which
          reduces,  in  the  nonrelativistic domain, to the Tsallis power
          law  function.  As a simple illustration of the basic approach,
          we    derive    the   relativistic   nonextensive   equilibrium
          distribution  for  a  dilute charged gas under the action of an
          electromagnetic  field  $F^{{\mu\nu}}$.  Such results reduce to
          the  standard ones in the extensive limit, thereby showing that
          the  nonextensive entropic framework can be harmonized with the
          space-time ideas contained in the special relativity theory.

          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          We  study the statistics of the force felt by a particle in the
          class   of   spatially  correlated  distribution  of  identical
          point-like  particles,  interacting  via  a  $1/r^2$ pair force
          (i.e.  gravitational  or  Coulomb),  and  obtained  by randomly
          perturbing  an  infinite  perfect lattice. In the first part we
          specify the conditions under which the force on a particle is a
          well  defined  stochastic  quantity.  We  then  study the small
          displacements approximation, giving both the limitations of its
          validity,  and,  when  it is valid, an expression for the force
          variance.  In  the  second  part of the paper we extend to this
          class  of  particle  distributions  the  method  introduced  by
          Chandrasekhar  to  study the force probability density function
          in  the  homogeneous Poisson particle distribution. In this way
          we  can  derive  an  approximate expression for the probability
          distribution  of the force over the full range of perturbations
          of  the lattice, i.e., from very small (compared to the lattice
          spacing) to very large where the Poisson limit is recovered. We
          show  in  particular  the qualitative change in the large-force
          tail  of  the  force  distribution  between  these  two limits.
          Excellent accuracy of our analytic results is found on detailed
          comparison  with  results  from  numerical  simulations.  These
          results   provide   basic  statistical  information  about  the
          fluctuations   of   the  interactions  (i)  of  the  masses  in
          self-gravitating  systems like those encountered in the context
          of  cosmological N-body simulations, and (ii) of the charges in
          the ordered phase of the One Component Plasma.

          This  lecture  provides  some  introduction  to  perfect  fluid
          dynamics  within  the  framework  of  general  relativity.  The
          presentation  is  based on the Carter-Lichnerowicz approach. It
          has the advantage over the more traditional approach of leading
          very  straightforwardly to important conservation laws, such as
          the  relativistic  generalizations  of  Bernoulli's  theorem or
          Kelvin's  circulation  theorem.  It  also permits to get easily
          first  integrals  of  motion  which are particularly useful for
          computing  equilibrium  configurations of relativistic stars in
          rotation  or  in binary systems. The presentation is relatively
          self-contained  and  does not require any a priori knowledge of
          general   relativity.   In   particular,  the  three  types  of
          derivatives   involved   in   relativistic   hydrodynamics  are
          introduced  in  detail:  this  concerns  the  Lie, exterior and
          covariant derivatives.

          Title:  The  signature  of the magnetorotational instability in
          the Reynolds and Maxwell stress tensors in accretion discs
          Authors:  Martin  E.  Pessah,  Chi-kwan Chan, Dimitrios Psaltis
          (University of Arizona)
          Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          The  magnetorotational instability is thought to be responsible
          for the generation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence that leads
          to  enhanced  outward  angular  momentum transport in accretion
          discs. Here, we demonstrate that, during the exponential growth
          of   the  instability,  the  mean  Reynolds  stress  is  always
          positive, the mean Maxwell stress is always negative, and hence
          the total stress is positive and leads to a net outward angular
          momentum  flux. More importantly, we show that the ratio of the
          Maxwell  to  the  Reynolds stresses at late times is determined
          only  by  the  local  shear  and does not depend on the initial
          spectrum  of perturbations or the strength of the seed magnetic
          field.  Even  though  we derived these properties of the stress
          tensors  for  the  exponential  growth  of  the  instability in
          incompressible  flows,  numerical simulations of shearing boxes
          show  that  they  are  preserved under more general conditions,
          even  during the saturated state of the turbulence generated by
          the instability.

          Protoplanetary gas disks are likely to experience gravitational
          instabilites  (GI's)  during  some  phase  of  their evolution.
          Density  perturbations  in  an  unstable disk grow on a dynamic
          time  scale  into  spiral  arms  that produce efficient outward
          transfer  of  angular  momentum  and  inward  transfer  of mass
          through gravitational torques. In a cool disk with rapid enough
          cooling,   the   spiral   arms   in   an   unstable  disk  form
          self-gravitating  clumps.  Whether  gas  giant protoplanets can
          form by such a disk instability process is the primary question
          addressed  by  this  review.  We  discuss  the  wide  range  of
          calculations  undertaken  by ourselves and others using various
          numerical  techniques, and we report preliminary results from a
          large  multi-code  collaboration.  Additional topics include --
          triggering  mechanisms  for  GI's,  disk  heating  and cooling,
          orbital  survival  of dense clumps, interactions of solids with
          GI-driven  waves  and  shocks,  and hybrid scenarios where GI's
          facilitate core accretion. The review ends with a discussion of
          how  well  disk  instability and core accretion fare in meeting
          observational constraints.

          Title:  Fueling  Low-Level  AGN Activity Through the Stochastic
          Accretion of Cold Gas
          Authors: Philip F. Hopkins, Lars Hernquist (Harvard/CfA)
          Comments: 37 pages, 9 figures. Submitted to ApJS
          Using  a  simple  description  of feedback from black hole (BH)
          growth,  we  develop  an  analytic  model  for  the  fueling of
          Seyferts  (low-luminosity AGN) and their relation to their host
          galaxies,   Eddington  ratio  distributions,  and  cosmological
          evolution.  We  derive  a  solution  for evolution of accretion
          rates   in   a   feedback-driven   blast  wave,  applicable  to
          large-scale  outflows  from  bright  quasars in galaxy mergers,
          low-luminosity  AGN,  and  BHs in supernova remnants. Under the
          assumption that cold gas stochastically accretes onto a central
          SMBH  at  a  rate set by the dynamics of that gas, our solution
          determines  the  Seyfert  light curve evolution. We use this to
          predict  the  Seyfert  luminosity  function  (LF), duty cycles,
          lifetimes,  and  distribution  of  host morphologies, Eddington
          ratios,  and  obscuration  as  a function of AGN luminosity and
          mass,  and find agreement with observations at z=0. We consider
          the  breakdown  of  contributions  from  this  and stellar wind
          accretion   and   merger-driven   activity.  We  make  specific
          predictions  for  the  weak  evolution  of  the Seyfert LF with
          redshift (LF of non-merger driven activity), and for changes in
          both  the  slope  and  scatter  of  the  M_BH-sigma relation at
          low-M_BH.  Quiescent  fueling  dominates over a wide luminosity
          range  (-14  >  M_B  > -22) at z=0, where most BH growth occurs
          around  M_BH~10^7  M_sun,  in  S0  and  Sa/b galaxies. However,
          quasar activity from gas-rich mergers evolves more rapidly with
          redshift,  and  by  z=1  quiescent fueling is important only at
          luminosities  an order of magnitude or more below the LF break.
          Although  non-merger  driven fueling is important for BH growth
          and   the   M_BH-sigma  relation  at  low  M_BH,  it  does  not
          significantly  contribute  to  the  total  BH  mass  density or
          cosmological backgrounds.

          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, ApJL accepted
          We  present  new  results  from  deep  GALEX  UV imaging of the
          cluster  Cl  0024+17  at  z~0.4.  Rest-frame far UV emission is
          detected  from  a  large fraction of so-called ``passive spiral
          galaxies''  -a  significant  population  which  exhibits spiral
          morphology with little or no spectroscopic evidence for ongoing
          star   formation.  This  population  is  thought  to  represent
          infalling  galaxies  whose  star  formation  has  been  somehow
          truncated by environmental processes, possibly in morphological
          transition  to S0 galaxies. Compared to normal cluster spirals,
          we  find  that passive spirals are redder in FUV-optical color,
          while exhibiting much stronger UV emission than cluster E/S0s -
          as  expected for recently-truncated star formation. By modeling
          the  different  temporal  sensitivities of UV and spectroscopic
          data to recent activity, we show that star formation in passive
          spirals  decayed  on  timescales of less than 1 Gyr, consistent
          with `gas starvation' - a process where the cluster environment
          prevents   cold  gas  from  accreting  onto  the  spiral  disk.
          Intriguingly, the fraction of spirals currently observed in the
          passive phase is consistent with the longer period expected for
          the morphological transformation and the subsequent build-up of
          cluster S0s observed since z=0.4.

          discrete  events,  which  correlate  very strongly with strong,
          small-scale  interactions  and accretions between groups within
          the clusters.

          commonly  seen  at  the  earliest epochs ($\sim 10$ days before
          maximum  light)  are  investigated by means of a 3D Monte Carlo
          spectral synthesis code. The increasing number of early spectra
          available  allows  statistical  study  of  the  geometry of the
          ejecta. The observed diversity in strength of the high velocity
          features  (HVFs)  can  be  explained  in  terms of a ``covering
          factor'',  which  represents  the  fraction  of  the  projected
          photosphere  that  is  concealed  by  high  velocity  material.
          Various  geometrical  models  involving  high velocity material
          with  a clumpy structure or a thick torus can naturally account
          for  the  observed  statistics of HVFs. HVFs may be formed by a
          combination   of   density  and  abundance  enhancements.  Such
          enhancements  may be produced in the explosion itself or may be
          the  result  of  interaction  with circumstellar material or an
          accretion  disk.  Models  with  1 or 2 blobs, as well as a thin
          torus  or  disk-like  enhancement  are  unlikely  as a standard
          situation.

          Title:  The  accretion-diffusion  scenario  for  metals in cool
          white dwarfs
          Authors: D. Koester, D. Wilken
          Comments: To be published in A&A
          We  calculated  diffusion timescales for Ca, Mg, Fe in hydrogen
          atmosphere  white  dwarfs  with  temperatures  between 5000 and
          25000  K.  With  these timescales we determined accretion rates
          for  a sample of 38 DAZ white dwarfs from the recent studies of
          Zuckerman  et  al.  (2003)  and Koester et al. (2005). Assuming
          that the accretion rates can be calculated with the Bondi-Hoyle
          formula  for  hydrodynamic accretion, we obtained estimates for
          the  interstellar  matter density around the accreting objects.
          These  densities  are in good agreement with new data about the
          warm,   partially  ionized  phase  of  the  ISM  in  the  solar
          neighborhood.

          Title:   Composite   Dark  Matter  with  Invisible  Light  from
          Almost-Commutative Geometry
          Authors: Maxim Yu. Khlopov, Christoph A. Stephan
          Almost  commutative  geometry  offers  a  specific way to unify
          general relativity, quantum mechanics and gauge symmetries. The
          AC-model   of   elementary  particles,  arising  on  this  way,
          naturally embeds the Standard model and predicts doubly charged
          AC-leptons,  anion-like  A^{--}  and cathion-like C^{++}, which
          can  bind in WIMP-like (AC)-atoms, being a nontrivial candidate
          for  cosmological  dark  matter.  This  state is reached in the
          early  Universe  along a tail of more manifest secondary frozen
          blocks.  They  should  be  now  here  polluting the surrounding
          matter. The main secondary relics are C^{++} "anomalous helium"
          and  a  bound  system  of  A^{--}  with  an ordinary helium ion
          (^4He)^{++},  which is able to attract and capture (in thefirst
          three  minutes)  all the free A^{--} fixing them into a neutral
          OLe-helium  (OHe) nuclear interacting "atom" (^4He^{++}A^{--}).
          The  model  naturally  involves  a  new U(1) gauge interaction,
          possessed  only  by the AC-leptons and providing a Coulomb-like
          attraction   between   them.  This  attraction  stimulates  the
          effective  A-C  recombination into AC-atoms inside dense matter
          bodies   (stars  and  planets),  resulting  in  a  decrease  of
          anomalous   isotopes   below  the  experimental  upper  limits.
          OLe-helium  pollution of terrestrial matter and (OHe) catalysis
          of  nuclear reactions in it is one of the exciting problems (or
          advantages?) of the present model.

          We identify 17 possible 8.0 micron-selected counterparts to the
          submillimeter galaxies in the CUDSS 14-hour field, derived from
          deep  imaging  carried  out  with the IRAC and MIPS instruments
          aboard  the Spitzer Space Telescope. Ten of the 17 counterparts
          are  not  the  same  as  those previously identified at shorter
          wavelengths. We argue that 8.0 micron selection offers a better
          means  for  identifying  counterparts to submillimeter galaxies
          than   near-infrared   or   optical  selection.  Based  on  the
          panchromatic  SEDs,  most  counterparts appear to be powered by
          ongoing star formation. Power-law fits to the SEDs suggest that
          five  objects  in  the  8.0  micron-selected counterpart sample
          harbor  dominant  AGNs;  a  sixth  object  is  identified  as a
          possible   AGN.   The   3.6   to   8.0  micron  colors  of  the
          infrared-selected  counterparts  are  significantly redder than
          the general IRAC galaxy population in the CUDSS 14-hour field.

          stosszahlansatz
          Authors: R. Silva (Observatorio Nacional & UERN)
          Comments: 10 pages, no figures, standard LaTeX file
          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          We  have  investigated  the  proof  of the $H$ theorem within a
          manifestly  covariant  approach by considering the relativistic
          statistical  theory developed in [Phy. Rev. E {\bf 66}, 056125,
          2002;  {\it  ibid.}  {\bf  72},  036108 2005]. In our analysis,
          however,   we   have  not  considered  the  so-called  deformed
          mathematics as did in the above reference. As it happens in the
          nonrelativistic   limit,  the  molecular  chaos  hypothesis  is
          slightly extended within the $\kappa$-formalism, and the second
          law  of thermodynamics implies that the $\kappa$ parameter lies
          on  the  interval  [-1,1].  It  is  shown  that the collisional
          equilibrium  states (null entropy source term) are described by
          a  $\kappa$ power law generalization of the exponential Juttner
          distribution,        e.g.,       $f(x,p)\propto       (\sqrt{1+
          \kappa^2\theta^2}+\kappa\theta)^{1/\kappa}\equiv\exp_\kappa\the
          ta$, with $\theta=\alpha(x)+\beta_\mu p^\mu$, where $\alpha(x)$
          is  a  scalar, $\beta_\mu$ is a four-vector, and $p^\mu$ is the
          four-momentum.   As   a   simple   example,  we  calculate  the
          relativistic  $\kappa$ power law for a dilute charged gas under
          the  action  of  an  electromagnetic  field  $F^{\mu\nu}$.  All
          standard  results  are readly recovered in the particular limit
          $\kappa\to 0$.

          Two   XMM-Newton   observations   of   the   black-hole  binary
          GRS1915+105  were triggered in 2004 (April 17 and 21), during a
          long  "plateau"  state  of  the  source.  We  analyzed the data
          collected with EPIC-pn in Timing and Burst modes, respectively.
          No  thermal disc emission is required by the data; the spectrum
          is  well fitted by four components: a primary component (either
          a  simple power law or thermal Comptonization) absorbed by cold
          matter  with  abundances  different than those of standard ISM;
          reprocessing  from  an  ionized  disc;  emission and absorption
          lines;  and a soft X-ray excess around 1 keV. The latter is not
          confirmed  by  RGS  (which  were used in the second observation
          only);  if real, the excess could be due to reflection from the
          optically  thin,  photoionized  plasma of a disc wind, in which
          case  it  may  provide  a  way  to  disentangle  intrinsic from
          interstellar  absorption.  Indeed, the former is best traced by
          the higher abundances of heavier elements, while an independent
          estimate of the latter may be given by the value we get for the
          disc  wind component only, which roughly coincides with what is
          found for lower-Z species.

          Comments: 7 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication on MNRAS
          We  report  the results of a systematic timing analysis of RXTE
          observations  of  GRS  1915+105  when  the  source  was  in its
          variability  class theta, characterized by alternating soft and
          hard  states  on a time scale of a few hundred seconds. The aim
          was to examine the high-frequency part of the power spectrum in
          order  to  confirm  the hecto-Hertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations
          (QPO)   previously   reported   from  observations  from  mixed
          variability    behaviours.    During    the    hard   intervals
          (corresponding  to  state C in the classification of Belloni et
          al.,  2000,  A&A,  35,  271),  we  find  a significant QPO at a
          frequency   of  ~170  Hz,  although  much  broader  (Q~2)  than
          previously  reported.  No other significant peak is observed at
          frequencies  >30  Hz.  A  time-resolved  spectral  analysis  of
          selected  observations shows that the hard intervals from class
          theta  show  a  stronger  and steeper (Gamma=2.8-3.0) power-law
          component  than  hard  intervals from other classes. We discuss
          these  results  in  the  framework of hecto-Hertz QPOs reported
          from GRS 1915+105 and other black-hole binaries.

          Comments:  6  pages,  invited talk at "Astrophysical Sources of
          High Energy Particles and Radiation," Torun, June 20 - 24, 2005
          Journal-ref: AIP Conf. Proc. 801 (2005), 345-350
          We  discuss 3D simulations of relativistic collisionless shocks
          in  electron-positron  pair  plasmas using the particle-in-cell
          (PIC)  method.  The shock structure is mainly controlled by the
          shock's  magnetization  ("sigma" parameter). We demonstrate how
          the  structure  of  the shock varies as a function of sigma for
          perpendicular  shocks.  At  low  magnetizations  the  shock  is
          mediated  mainly  by  the  Weibel  instability  which generates
          transient magnetic fields that can exceed the initial field. At
          larger  magnetizations  the  shock  is  dominated  by  magnetic
          reflections.  We  demonstrate  where  the transition occurs and
          argue  that  it  is  impossible  to have very low magnetization
          collisionless  shocks  in  nature  (in  more  than  one spatial
          dimension).  We  further discuss the acceleration properties of
          these  shocks, and show that higher magnetization perpendicular
          shocks  do  not  efficiently accelerate nonthermal particles in
          3D.  Among  other  astrophysical  applications, this may pose a
          restriction  on  the  structure  and  composition  of gamma-ray
          bursts and pulsar wind outflows.

          Pulsar  spindown  forms  a reliable yet enigmatic prototype for
          the   energy  loss  processes  in  many  astrophysical  objects
          including  accretion  disks  and  back  holes. In this paper we
          review  the  physics of pulsar magnetospheres, concentrating on
          recent    developments    in   force-free   modeling   of   the
          magnetospheric  structure.  In  particular,  we  discuss  a new
          method  for  solving the equations of time-dependent force-free
          relativistic  MHD in application to pulsars. This method allows
          to dynamically study the formation of the magnetosphere and its
          response  to  perturbations, opening a qualitatively new window
          on  pulsar  phenomena.  Applications  of  the  method  to other
          magnetized rotators, such as magnetars and accretion disks, are
          also discussed.

          We present photometric redshifts for an uniquely large and deep
          sample  of  522286 objects with i'_{AB}<25 in the Canada-France
          Legacy  Survey  ``Deep  Survey''  fields,  which  cover a total
          effective   area  of  3.2  deg^2.  We  use  3241  spectroscopic
          redshifts  with  0<z<5  from  the  VIMOS  VLT  Deep Survey as a
          calibration  to derive these photometric redshifts. We devise a
          robust  calibration  method  which removes systematic trends in
          the   photometric   redshifts  and  significantly  reduces  the
          fraction   of   catastrophic   errors.   We   use   our  unique
          spectroscopic  sample  to  present a detailed assessment of the
          robustness  of  the  photometric  redshift sample. For a sample
          selected  at  i'_{AB}<24,  we  reach  a  redshift  accuracy  of
          \sigma_{\Delta  z/(1+z)}=0.037  with  \eta=3.7% of catastrophic
          error.  The  reliability  of our photometric redshifts is lower
          for  fainter  objects:  we  find \sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z)}=0.029,
          0.043   and   \eta=1.7%,   5.4%   for   samples   selected   at
          i'_{AB}=17.5-22.5  and  22.5-24  respectively. We find that the
          photometric  redshifts  of starburst galaxies in our sample are
          less  reliable:  although  these galaxies represent only 18% of
          the  spectroscopic  sample  they are responsible for 54% of the
          catastrophic errors. We find an excellent agreement between the
          photometric  and  the VVDS spectroscopic redshift distributions
          at  i'_{AB}<24.  Finally, we compare the redshift distributions
          of i' selected galaxies on the four CFHTLS deep fields, showing
          that cosmic variance is already present on fields of 0.8 deg^2.

          Title: Star Formation in QSO Host Galaxies

          Brotherton, Mark Lacy
          Comments:  8  pages,  5  figures,  invited review for "QSO Host

          Center, Universiteit Leiden, August, 2005
          Many of the conditions that are necessary for starbursts appear
          to be important in the triggering of QSOs. However, it is still
          debatable   whether  starbursts  are  ubiquitously  present  in
          galaxies  harboring  QSOs.  In this paper we review our current
          knowledge  from  observations  of  the  role  of  starbursts in
          different types of QSOs. Post-starburst stellar populations are
          potentially  present  in  the  majority of QSO hosts. QSOs with
          far-infrared  colors similar to those of ultraluminous infrared
          galaxies  invariably  reside  in  merging  galaxies  that  have
          interaction-induced  starbursts  of  a few hundred Myr or less.
          Similar,   but   dramatically   more   luminous  post-starburst
          populations  are found in the recently discovered class of QSOs
          known  as post-starburst QSOs, or Q+A's. Both of these classes,
          however,  comprise  only a small fraction (10-15%) of the total
          QSO  population. The so-called "red" QSOs generally suffer from
          strong  extinction  at  optical  wavelengths, making them ideal
          candidates  for  the  study of hosts. Their stellar populations
          typically  show a post-starburst component as well, though with
          a  larger range of ages. Finally, optical "classical" QSO hosts
          show   traces  of  major  star  formation  episodes  (typically
          involving  >10%  of  the  mass of the stellar component) in the
          more  distant  past  (1-2  Gyr).  These starbursts appear to be
          linked  to  past  merger  events.  It  remains to be determined
          whether  these mergers were also responsible for triggering the
          QSO activity that we observe today.

          We  have  obtained  maps  of the large scale outflow associated
          with  the  UCHII  regionG5.89-0.39  in CO and 13CO (J=3-2), SiO
          (J=8-7,J=5-4),  SO2 (13(2,12)-13(1,13)) and H13CO+(J=4-3). From
          these maps we have been able to determine the mass (3.3 M_sun),
          momentum  (96 M_sun km/s), energy (3.5x10^{46} erg), mechanical
          luminosity (141 L_sun), and mass loss rate (~1x10^{-3}M_sun/yr)
          in   the  large  scale  outflow.  The  observationally  derived
          parameters  were  used toguide 3D magnetohydrodynamic models of
          the   jet   entrained   outflow.  Through  the  combination  of
          observations  and  simulations, we suggest that the large scale
          outflowmay  be  inclined by approximately 45 deg to the line of
          sight,  and  that  the  jet  entraining  the observed molecular
          outflow  may have been active for as little as 1000 years, half
          the kinematic age of the outflow.

          We  have  made  continuum  and  spectral  line  observations of
          several  outflow  sources  in the Mon OB1 dark cloud (NGC 2264)
          using   the   Heinrich   Hertz  Telescope  (HHT)  and  ARO  12m
          millimeter-wave  telescope.  This study explores the kinematics
          and  outflow  energetics  of the young stellar systems observed
          and  assesses  the  impact  star  formation  is  having  on the
          surrounding   cloud  environment.  Our  data  set  incorporates
          12CO(3-2),  13CO(3-2),  and  12CO(1-0) observations of outflows
          associated   with   the   sources   IRAS  06382+1017  and  IRAS
          06381+1039,  known  as  IRAS  25  and  27, respectively, in the
          northern cloud complex. Complementary 870 micron continuum maps
          were  made with the HHT 19 channel bolometer array. Our results
          indicate  that  there  is a weak (approximately less than 0.5%)
          coupling between outflow kinetic energy and turbulent energy of
          the cloud. An analysis of the energy balance in the IRAS 25 and
          27   cores   suggests  they  are  maintaining  their  dynamical
          integrity  except  where outflowing material directly interacts
          with the core, such as along the outflow axes.

          Nebula HB 12

          Comments: 9 pages, 11 figures, Accepted for publication in AJ
          The  young  planetary nebulae play an important role in stellar
          evolution  when  intermediate-  to low-mass stars (0.8 $\sim$ 8
          M$_\odot$) evolve from the proto-planetary nebulae phase to the
          planetary  nebulae  phase. Many young planetary nebulae display
          distinct  bipolar  structures  as  they  evolve  away  from the
          proto-planetary  nebulae  phase.  One  possible  cause of their
          bipolarity  could  be  due  to  a  binary  origin of its energy
          source.  Here we report our detailed investigation of the young
          planetary  nebula,  Hubble  12,  which  is  well-known  for its
          extended  hourglass-like  envelope.  We  present  evidence with
          time-series   photometric  observations  the  existence  of  an
          eclipsing  binary  at  the  center of Hubble 12. Low-resolution
          spectra  of  the  central  source  show,  on  the  other  hand,
          absorption features such as CN, G-band & Mg b${\arcsec}$, which
          can  be  suggestive  of  a  low-mass  nature  of  the secondary
          component.

          publication on A&A, main journal
          We  observed  with Chandra two peculiar galactic X-ray sources,
          4U  1700+24  and  4U  1954+319,  which  are suspected to have a
          M-type  giant  star  as optical counterpart, in order to get an
          high-precision  astrometric  position  for  both  of  them. The
          peculiarity  of  these  sources lies in the fact that these are
          the  only  two  cases  among  low-mass  X-ray binaries (LMXBs),
          besides  the  confirmed case of GX 1+4, for which the companion
          can possibly be a M-type giant. We found that in both cases the
          field  M-type  giant  star  is  indeed the counterpart of these
          X-ray  sources.  We also determined the distance to 4U 1954+319
          to  be  about  1.7  kpc.  This result suggests that a number of
          faint  (L_X  around 10^32-10^34 erg s-1) Galactic X-ray sources
          are  `symbiotic  X-ray  binaries',  that  is,  wide-orbit LMXBs
          composed  of  a  compact  object,  most  likely a neutron star,
          accreting from the wind of a M-type giant.

          Almost  all  young  stars  are  found in multiple systems. This
          suggests  that  protostellar  cores almost always fragment into
          multiple  objects.  The observed properties of multiple systems
          such  as  their separation distribution and mass ratios provide
          strong  constraints  on  star formation theories. We review the
          observed  properties of young and old multiple systems and find
          that  the  multiplicity  of stars changes. Such an evolution is
          probably  due  to  (a)  the  dynamical decay of small-N systems
          and/or  (b)  the  destruction  of multiple systems within dense
          clusters.   We  review  simulations  of  the  fragmentation  of
          rotating  and  turbulent  molecular  cores.  Such models almost
          always  produce  multiple  systems,  however  the properties of
          those  systems  do not match observations at all well. Magnetic
          fields appear to supress fragmentation, prehaps suggesting that
          they are not dynamically important in the formation of multiple
          systems.  We  finish  by discussing possible reasons why theory
          fails  to  match observation, and the future prospects for this
          field.

          Comments:  59  pages  including 14 Figures, 12 Tables; Accepted
          for publication in the Astronomical Journal
          This  paper  continues  the  analysis  of faint high latitude B
          stars from Martin (2004). Here we analyze the kinematics of the
          stars  and combine them with the abundance information from the
          first  paper  to  classify  each  one.  The  sample contains 31
          Population  I  runaways,  fifteen  old evolved stars (including
          five  BHB stars, three post-HB stars, a pulsating helium dwarf,
          and  six  stars  of ambiguous classification), one F-dwarf, and
          two  stars  which  do  not  easily  fit  in  one  of  the other
          categories.  No  star  in  the  sample  unambiguously shows the
          characteristics  of  a young massive star formed in situ in the
          halo.   The   two   unclassified  stars  are  probably  extreme
          Population  I runaways. The low binary frequency and rotational
          velocity  distribution  of the Population I runaways imply that
          most  were  ejected  from  dense  star clusters by DES (dynamic
          ejection  scenario).  However  we remain puzzled by the lack of
          runaway Be stars. We also confirm that PB 166 and HIP 41979 are
          both nearby solar-metallicity BHB stars.

          Comments:  submitted  to  ApJ  Letters,  revised  version after
          referee's comments, 4 pages with 2 color figures
          We  selected  40 candidate Lyman Alpha Emitting galaxies (LAEs)
          at  z  ~=3.1  with  observed  frame equivalent widths >150A and
          inferred emission line fluxes >2.5x10^-17 ergs/cm^2/s from deep
          narrow-band and broad-band MUSYC images of the Extended Chandra
          Deep  Field South. Covering 992 sq. arcmin, this is the largest
          ``blank field'' surveyed for LAEs at z ~3, allowing an improved
          estimate  of the space density of this population of 3+-1x10^-4
          h_70^3/Mpc^3.  Spectroscopic follow-up of 23 candidates yielded
          18  redshifts,  all at z ~=3.1. Over 80% of the LAEs are dimmer
          in  continuum  magnitude  than  the  typical Lyman break galaxy
          spectroscopic  limit  of  R= 25.5 (AB), with a median continuum
          magnitude  R  ~=27  and  very blue continuum colors, (V-z) ~=0.
          Over  80%  of the LAEs have the right UVR colors to be selected
          as  Lyman  break  galaxies,  but  only  10%  also have R<=25.5.
          Stacking  the  UBVRIzJK  fluxes  reveals that LAEs have stellar
          masses ~=5x10^8 M_sun and minimal dust extinction, A_V < ~ 0.1.
          Inferred   star  formation  rates  are  ~=6  h_70^-2  M_sun/yr,
          yielding  a  cosmic star formation rate density of 2x10^-3 h_70
          M_sun/yr/Mpc^3.  None  of  our LAE candidates show evidence for
          rest-frame  emission  line equivalent widths EW_rest>240A which
          might  imply  a  non-standard IMF. One candidate is detected by
          Chandra,  implying  an  AGN fraction of 2+-2% for LAE candidate
          samples.  In  summary, LAEs at z ~ 3 have rapid star formation,
          low stellar mass, little dust obscuration and no evidence for a
          substantial AGN component.

          In  the  present-day  universe,  supermassive black hole masses
          (MBH)  appear  to  be  strongly  correlated with their galaxy's
          bulge  luminosity,  among  other  properties. In this study, we
          explore  the  analogous relationship between MBH, derived using
          the virial method, and the stellar R-band bulge luminosity (Lr)
          or  stellar  bulge  mass  (M*) at epochs of 1 < z < 4.5 using a
          sample  of  31  gravitationally  lensed  AGNs and 20 non-lensed
          AGNs.  At redshifts z > 1.7 (10--12 Gyrs ago), we find that the
          observed  MBH--Lr  relation  is nearly the same (to within ~0.3
          mag)  as  it  is  today. When the observed Lr are corrected for
          luminosity  evolution,  this means that the black holes grew in
          mass  faster than their hosts, with the MBH/M* mass ratio being
          a  factor  of  >  4(+2)(-1)  times larger at z > 1.7 than it is
          today.  By the redshift range 1 < z < 1.7 (8--10 Gyrs ago), the
          MBH/M*  ratio is only 1.3--2 times higher than today. Combining
          the  results,  we  conclude  that  the  ratio MBH/M* rises with
          look-back  time, although it may saturate at ~6 times the local
          value.  Scenarios  in which moderately luminous quasar hosts at
          z>1.7  were  fully  formed  bulges  that passively faded to the
          present epoch are ruled out.

          We   present   results   of   axisymmetic   magnetohydrodynamic
          simulations   of   the   interaction   of  a  rapidly-rotating,
          magnetized  star with an accretion disk. The disk is considered
          to  have  a finite viscosity and magnetic diffusivity. The main
          parameters  of  the  system are the star's angular velocity and
          magnetic  moment,  and  the  disk's  viscosity, diffusivity. We
          focus  on  the "propeller" regime where the inner radius of the
          disk  is  larger  than  the  corotation  radius.  Two  types of
          magnetohydrodynamic  flows  have  been  found  as  a  result of
          simulations:   "weak"   and  "strong"  propellers.  The  strong
          propeller  is  characterized  by  a  powerful  disk  wind and a
          collimated magnetically dominated outflow or jet from the star.
          The weak propeller have only weak outflows. We investigated the
          time-averaged  characteristics  of  the interaction between the
          main  elements of the system, the star, the disk, the wind from
          the  disk,  and  the jet. Rates of exchange of mass and angular
          momentum  between  the  elements of the system are derived as a
          function of the main parameters. The propeller mechanism may be
          responsible for the fast spinning-down of the classical T Tauri
          stars  in  the  initial  stages of their evolution, and for the
          spinning-down of accreting millisecond pulsars.

          Two   XMM-Newton   observations   of   the   black-hole  binary
          GRS1915+105  were triggered in 2004 (April 17 and 21), during a
          long  "plateau"  state  of  the  source.  We  analyzed the data
          collected with EPIC-pn in Timing and Burst modes, respectively.
          No  thermal disc emission is required by the data; the spectrum
          is  well fitted by four components: a primary component (either
          a  simple power law or thermal Comptonization) absorbed by cold
          matter  with  abundances  different than those of standard ISM;
          reprocessing  from  an  ionized  disc;  emission and absorption
          lines;  and a soft X-ray excess around 1 keV. The latter is not
          confirmed  by  RGS  (which  were used in the second observation
          only);  if real, the excess could be due to reflection from the
          optically  thin,  photoionized  plasma of a disc wind, in which
          case  it  may  provide  a  way  to  disentangle  intrinsic from
          interstellar  absorption.  Indeed, the former is best traced by
          the higher abundances of heavier elements, while an independent
          estimate of the latter may be given by the value we get for the
          disc  wind component only, which roughly coincides with what is
          found for lower-Z species.

          Title:  High-frequency  Quasi-Periodic  Oscillations  from  GRS
          1915+105 in its C state

          We  report  the results of a systematic timing analysis of RXTE
          observations  of  GRS  1915+105  when  the  source  was  in its
          variability  class theta, characterized by alternating soft and
          hard  states  on a time scale of a few hundred seconds. The aim
          was to examine the high-frequency part of the power spectrum in
          order  to  confirm  the hecto-Hertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations
          (QPO)   previously   reported   from  observations  from  mixed
          variability    behaviours.    During    the    hard   intervals
          (corresponding  to  state C in the classification of Belloni et
          al.,  2000,  A&A,  35,  271),  we  find  a significant QPO at a
          frequency   of  ~170  Hz,  although  much  broader  (Q~2)  than
          previously  reported.  No other significant peak is observed at
          frequencies  >30  Hz.  A  time-resolved  spectral  analysis  of
          selected  observations shows that the hard intervals from class
          theta  show  a  stronger  and steeper (Gamma=2.8-3.0) power-law
          component  than  hard  intervals from other classes. We discuss
          these  results  in  the  framework of hecto-Hertz QPOs reported
          from GRS 1915+105 and other black-hole binaries.

          Title:  Simulations of relativistic collisionless shocks: shock
          structure and particle acceleration
          Authors: Anatoly Spitkovsky (KIPAC, Stanford University)
          Comments:  6  pages,  invited talk at "Astrophysical Sources of
          High Energy Particles and Radiation," Torun, June 20 - 24, 2005
          Journal-ref: AIP Conf. Proc. 801 (2005), 345-350
          We  discuss 3D simulations of relativistic collisionless shocks
          in  electron-positron  pair  plasmas using the particle-in-cell
          (PIC)  method.  The shock structure is mainly controlled by the
          shock's  magnetization  ("sigma" parameter). We demonstrate how
          the  structure  of  the shock varies as a function of sigma for
          perpendicular  shocks.  At  low  magnetizations  the  shock  is
          mediated  mainly  by  the  Weibel  instability  which generates
          transient magnetic fields that can exceed the initial field. At
          larger  magnetizations  the  shock  is  dominated  by  magnetic
          reflections.  We  demonstrate  where  the transition occurs and
          argue  that  it  is  impossible  to have very low magnetization
          collisionless  shocks  in  nature  (in  more  than  one spatial
          dimension).  We  further discuss the acceleration properties of
          these  shocks, and show that higher magnetization perpendicular
          shocks  do  not  efficiently accelerate nonthermal particles in
          3D.  Among  other  astrophysical  applications, this may pose a
          restriction  on  the  structure  and  composition  of gamma-ray
          bursts and pulsar wind outflows.

          Pulsar  spindown  forms  a reliable yet enigmatic prototype for
          the   energy  loss  processes  in  many  astrophysical  objects
          including  accretion  disks  and  back  holes. In this paper we
          review  the  physics of pulsar magnetospheres, concentrating on
          recent    developments    in   force-free   modeling   of   the
          magnetospheric  structure.  In  particular,  we  discuss  a new
          method  for  solving the equations of time-dependent force-free
          relativistic  MHD in application to pulsars. This method allows
          to dynamically study the formation of the magnetosphere and its
          response  to  perturbations, opening a qualitatively new window
          on  pulsar  phenomena.  Applications  of  the  method  to other
          magnetized rotators, such as magnetars and accretion disks, are
          also discussed.

          We present photometric redshifts for an uniquely large and deep
          sample  of  522286 objects with i'_{AB}<25 in the Canada-France
          Legacy  Survey  ``Deep  Survey''  fields,  which  cover a total
          effective   area  of  3.2  deg^2.  We  use  3241  spectroscopic
          redshifts  with  0<z<5  from  the  VIMOS  VLT  Deep Survey as a
          calibration  to derive these photometric redshifts. We devise a
          robust  calibration  method  which removes systematic trends in
          the   photometric   redshifts  and  significantly  reduces  the
          fraction   of   catastrophic   errors.   We   use   our  unique
          spectroscopic  sample  to  present a detailed assessment of the
          robustness  of  the  photometric  redshift sample. For a sample
          selected  at  i'_{AB}<24,  we  reach  a  redshift  accuracy  of
          \sigma_{\Delta  z/(1+z)}=0.037  with  \eta=3.7% of catastrophic
          error.  The  reliability  of our photometric redshifts is lower
          for  fainter  objects:  we  find \sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z)}=0.029,
          0.043   and   \eta=1.7%,   5.4%   for   samples   selected   at
          i'_{AB}=17.5-22.5  and  22.5-24  respectively. We find that the
          photometric  redshifts  of starburst galaxies in our sample are
          less  reliable:  although  these galaxies represent only 18% of
          the  spectroscopic  sample  they are responsible for 54% of the
          catastrophic errors. We find an excellent agreement between the
          photometric  and  the VVDS spectroscopic redshift distributions
          at  i'_{AB}<24.  Finally, we compare the redshift distributions
          of i' selected galaxies on the four CFHTLS deep fields, showing
          that cosmic variance is already present on fields of 0.8 deg^2.

          Title: Star Formation in QSO Host Galaxies
          Authors:   Gabriela   Canalizo,   Alan   Stockton,  Michael  S.
          Brotherton, Mark Lacy
          Comments:  8  pages,  5  figures,  invited review for "QSO Host
          Galaxies:  Evolution  and  Environment",  held  at  the Lorentz
          Center, Universiteit Leiden, August, 2005
          Many of the conditions that are necessary for starbursts appear
          to be important in the triggering of QSOs. However, it is still
          debatable   whether  starbursts  are  ubiquitously  present  in
          galaxies  harboring  QSOs.  In this paper we review our current
          knowledge  from  observations  of  the  role  of  starbursts in
          different types of QSOs. Post-starburst stellar populations are
          potentially  present  in  the  majority of QSO hosts. QSOs with
          far-infrared  colors similar to those of ultraluminous infrared
          galaxies  invariably  reside  in  merging  galaxies  that  have
          interaction-induced  starbursts  of  a few hundred Myr or less.
          Similar,   but   dramatically   more   luminous  post-starburst
          populations  are found in the recently discovered class of QSOs
          known  as post-starburst QSOs, or Q+A's. Both of these classes,
          however,  comprise  only a small fraction (10-15%) of the total
          QSO  population. The so-called "red" QSOs generally suffer from
          strong  extinction  at  optical  wavelengths, making them ideal
          candidates  for  the  study of hosts. Their stellar populations
          typically  show a post-starburst component as well, though with
          a  larger range of ages. Finally, optical "classical" QSO hosts
          show   traces  of  major  star  formation  episodes  (typically
          involving  >10%  of  the  mass of the stellar component) in the
          more  distant  past  (1-2  Gyr).  These starbursts appear to be
          linked  to  past  merger  events.  It  remains to be determined
          whether  these mergers were also responsible for triggering the
          QSO activity that we observe today.

          We  have  obtained  maps  of the large scale outflow associated
          with  the  UCHII  regionG5.89-0.39  in CO and 13CO (J=3-2), SiO
          (J=8-7,J=5-4),  SO2 (13(2,12)-13(1,13)) and H13CO+(J=4-3). From
          these maps we have been able to determine the mass (3.3 M_sun),
          momentum  (96 M_sun km/s), energy (3.5x10^{46} erg), mechanical
          luminosity (141 L_sun), and mass loss rate (~1x10^{-3}M_sun/yr)
          in   the  large  scale  outflow.  The  observationally  derived
          parameters  were  used toguide 3D magnetohydrodynamic models of
          the   jet   entrained   outflow.  Through  the  combination  of
          observations  and  simulations, we suggest that the large scale
          outflowmay  be  inclined by approximately 45 deg to the line of
          sight,  and  that  the  jet  entraining  the observed molecular
          outflow  may have been active for as little as 1000 years, half
          the kinematic age of the outflow.

          We  have  made  continuum  and  spectral  line  observations of
          several  outflow  sources  in the Mon OB1 dark cloud (NGC 2264)
          using   the   Heinrich   Hertz  Telescope  (HHT)  and  ARO  12m
          millimeter-wave  telescope.  This study explores the kinematics
          and  outflow  energetics  of the young stellar systems observed
          and  assesses  the  impact  star  formation  is  having  on the
          surrounding   cloud  environment.  Our  data  set  incorporates
          12CO(3-2),  13CO(3-2),  and  12CO(1-0) observations of outflows
          associated   with   the   sources   IRAS  06382+1017  and  IRAS
          06381+1039,  known  as  IRAS  25  and  27, respectively, in the
          northern cloud complex. Complementary 870 micron continuum maps
          were  made with the HHT 19 channel bolometer array. Our results
          indicate  that  there  is a weak (approximately less than 0.5%)
          coupling between outflow kinetic energy and turbulent energy of
          the cloud. An analysis of the energy balance in the IRAS 25 and
          27   cores   suggests  they  are  maintaining  their  dynamical
          integrity  except  where outflowing material directly interacts
          with the core, such as along the outflow axes.

          Comments: 9 pages, 11 figures, Accepted for publication in AJ
          The  young  planetary nebulae play an important role in stellar
          evolution  when  intermediate-  to low-mass stars (0.8 $\sim$ 8
          M$_\odot$) evolve from the proto-planetary nebulae phase to the
          planetary  nebulae  phase. Many young planetary nebulae display
          distinct  bipolar  structures  as  they  evolve  away  from the
          proto-planetary  nebulae  phase.  One  possible  cause of their
          bipolarity  could  be  due  to  a  binary  origin of its energy
          source.  Here we report our detailed investigation of the young
          planetary  nebula,  Hubble  12,  which  is  well-known  for its
          extended  hourglass-like  envelope.  We  present  evidence with
          time-series   photometric  observations  the  existence  of  an
          eclipsing  binary  at  the  center of Hubble 12. Low-resolution
          spectra  of  the  central  source  show,  on  the  other  hand,
          absorption features such as CN, G-band & Mg b${\arcsec}$, which
          can  be  suggestive  of  a  low-mass  nature  of  the secondary
          component.

          We  observed  with Chandra two peculiar galactic X-ray sources,
          4U  1700+24  and  4U  1954+319,  which  are suspected to have a
          M-type  giant  star  as optical counterpart, in order to get an
          high-precision  astrometric  position  for  both  of  them. The
          peculiarity  of  these  sources lies in the fact that these are
          the  only  two  cases  among  low-mass  X-ray binaries (LMXBs),
          besides  the  confirmed case of GX 1+4, for which the companion
          can possibly be a M-type giant. We found that in both cases the
          field  M-type  giant  star  is  indeed the counterpart of these
          X-ray  sources.  We also determined the distance to 4U 1954+319
          to  be  about  1.7  kpc.  This result suggests that a number of
          faint  (L_X  around 10^32-10^34 erg s-1) Galactic X-ray sources
          are  `symbiotic  X-ray  binaries',  that  is,  wide-orbit LMXBs
          composed  of  a  compact  object,  most  likely a neutron star,
          accreting from the wind of a M-type giant.

          Almost  all  young  stars  are  found in multiple systems. This
          suggests  that  protostellar  cores almost always fragment into
          multiple  objects.  The observed properties of multiple systems
          such  as  their separation distribution and mass ratios provide
          strong  constraints  on  star formation theories. We review the
          observed  properties of young and old multiple systems and find
          that  the  multiplicity  of stars changes. Such an evolution is
          probably  due  to  (a)  the  dynamical decay of small-N systems
          and/or  (b)  the  destruction  of multiple systems within dense
          clusters.   We  review  simulations  of  the  fragmentation  of
          rotating  and  turbulent  molecular  cores.  Such models almost
          always  produce  multiple  systems,  however  the properties of
          those  systems  do not match observations at all well. Magnetic
          fields appear to supress fragmentation, prehaps suggesting that
          they are not dynamically important in the formation of multiple
          systems.  We  finish  by discussing possible reasons why theory
          fails  to  match observation, and the future prospects for this
          field.

          This  paper  continues  the  analysis  of faint high latitude B
          stars from Martin (2004). Here we analyze the kinematics of the
          stars  and combine them with the abundance information from the
          first  paper  to  classify  each  one.  The  sample contains 31
          Population  I  runaways,  fifteen  old evolved stars (including
          five  BHB stars, three post-HB stars, a pulsating helium dwarf,
          and  six  stars  of ambiguous classification), one F-dwarf, and
          two  stars  which  do  not  easily  fit  in  one  of  the other
          categories.  No  star  in  the  sample  unambiguously shows the
          characteristics  of  a young massive star formed in situ in the
          halo.   The   two   unclassified  stars  are  probably  extreme
          Population  I runaways. The low binary frequency and rotational
          velocity  distribution  of the Population I runaways imply that
          most  were  ejected  from  dense  star clusters by DES (dynamic
          ejection  scenario).  However  we remain puzzled by the lack of
          runaway Be stars. We also confirm that PB 166 and HIP 41979 are
          both nearby solar-metallicity BHB stars.

          Comments:  submitted  to  ApJ  Letters,  revised  version after
          referee's comments, 4 pages with 2 color figures
          We  selected  40 candidate Lyman Alpha Emitting galaxies (LAEs)
          at  z  ~=3.1  with  observed  frame equivalent widths >150A and
          inferred emission line fluxes >2.5x10^-17 ergs/cm^2/s from deep
          narrow-band and broad-band MUSYC images of the Extended Chandra
          Deep  Field South. Covering 992 sq. arcmin, this is the largest
          ``blank field'' surveyed for LAEs at z ~3, allowing an improved
          estimate  of the space density of this population of 3+-1x10^-4
          h_70^3/Mpc^3.  Spectroscopic follow-up of 23 candidates yielded
          18  redshifts,  all at z ~=3.1. Over 80% of the LAEs are dimmer
          in  continuum  magnitude  than  the  typical Lyman break galaxy
          spectroscopic  limit  of  R= 25.5 (AB), with a median continuum
          magnitude  R  ~=27  and  very blue continuum colors, (V-z) ~=0.
          Over  80%  of the LAEs have the right UVR colors to be selected
          as  Lyman  break  galaxies,  but  only  10%  also have R<=25.5.
          Stacking  the  UBVRIzJK  fluxes  reveals that LAEs have stellar
          masses ~=5x10^8 M_sun and minimal dust extinction, A_V < ~ 0.1.
          Inferred   star  formation  rates  are  ~=6  h_70^-2  M_sun/yr,
          yielding  a  cosmic star formation rate density of 2x10^-3 h_70
          M_sun/yr/Mpc^3.  None  of  our LAE candidates show evidence for
          rest-frame  emission  line equivalent widths EW_rest>240A which
          might  imply  a  non-standard IMF. One candidate is detected by
          Chandra,  implying  an  AGN fraction of 2+-2% for LAE candidate
          samples.  In  summary, LAEs at z ~ 3 have rapid star formation,
          low stellar mass, little dust obscuration and no evidence for a
          substantial AGN component.

          The  Multiwavelength  Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC) is optimized
          for  the  study  of  galaxies  at  z=3,  AGN  demographics, and
          Galactic  structure.  MUSYC  consists of deep optical (UBVRIz')
          and  near-infrared  (JHK)  imaging  of  four  fields on the sky
          covering 1.2 square degrees to AB limiting depths of U,B,V,R=26
          and K=22. Our optical catalog contains 277,341 objects detected
          in  BVR  images with median seeing of 0.9''. Satellite coverage
          of  our  fields  includes  Chandra,  XMM,  GALEX,  HST-ACS, and
          Spitzer,  with  the Extended Chandra Deep Field South imaged at
          all  of these wavelengths plus the radio, making it the premier
          multiwavelength   field   on   the   sky.   Detailed  follow-up
          spectroscopy  is being performed with VLT+VIMOS, Magellan+IMACS
          and  Gemini+GNIRS.  MUSYC  provides  ideal  supporting data for
          surveys  with Z-Machines and rich target lists for spectroscopy
          with  ALMA.  We  are  conducting  a  census of protogalaxies at
          redshift  three  (Lyman  break  galaxies, Lyman-alpha emitters,
          Distant red galaxies, Sub-millimeter galaxies and AGN) in order
          to  separate  physical  properties  from  selection effects. We
          discuss  measurements  of  the dark matter halo masses and halo
          occupation numbers of these populations and of the total cosmic
          star  formation  rate  at  z=3.  MUSYC  publications  and  data

          Comments: ApJ submitted. 23 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables
          In  the  present-day  universe,  supermassive black hole masses
          (MBH)  appear  to  be  strongly  correlated with their galaxy's
          bulge  luminosity,  among  other  properties. In this study, we
          explore  the  analogous relationship between MBH, derived using
          the virial method, and the stellar R-band bulge luminosity (Lr)
          or  stellar  bulge  mass  (M*) at epochs of 1 < z < 4.5 using a
          sample  of  31  gravitationally  lensed  AGNs and 20 non-lensed
          AGNs.  At redshifts z > 1.7 (10--12 Gyrs ago), we find that the
          observed  MBH--Lr  relation  is nearly the same (to within ~0.3
          mag)  as  it  is  today. When the observed Lr are corrected for
          luminosity  evolution,  this means that the black holes grew in
          mass  faster than their hosts, with the MBH/M* mass ratio being
          a  factor  of  >  4(+2)(-1)  times larger at z > 1.7 than it is
          today.  By the redshift range 1 < z < 1.7 (8--10 Gyrs ago), the
          MBH/M*  ratio is only 1.3--2 times higher than today. Combining
          the  results,  we  conclude  that  the  ratio MBH/M* rises with
          look-back  time, although it may saturate at ~6 times the local
          value.  Scenarios  in which moderately luminous quasar hosts at
          z>1.7  were  fully  formed  bulges  that passively faded to the
          present epoch are ruled out.

          We   present   results   of   axisymmetic   magnetohydrodynamic
          simulations   of   the   interaction   of  a  rapidly-rotating,
          magnetized  star with an accretion disk. The disk is considered
          to  have  a finite viscosity and magnetic diffusivity. The main
          parameters  of  the  system are the star's angular velocity and
          magnetic  moment,  and  the  disk's  viscosity, diffusivity. We
          focus  on  the "propeller" regime where the inner radius of the
          disk  is  larger  than  the  corotation  radius.  Two  types of
          magnetohydrodynamic  flows  have  been  found  as  a  result of
          simulations:   "weak"   and  "strong"  propellers.  The  strong
          propeller  is  characterized  by  a  powerful  disk  wind and a
          collimated magnetically dominated outflow or jet from the star.
          The weak propeller have only weak outflows. We investigated the
          time-averaged  characteristics  of  the interaction between the
          main  elements of the system, the star, the disk, the wind from
          the  disk,  and  the jet. Rates of exchange of mass and angular
          momentum  between  the  elements of the system are derived as a
          function of the main parameters. The propeller mechanism may be
          responsible for the fast spinning-down of the classical T Tauri
          stars  in  the  initial  stages of their evolution, and for the
          spinning-down of accreting millisecond pulsars.

          Comments: 5 Pages, 3 figures, accepted by ApJ Lett
          The  recent  localization  of  some short-hard gamma ray bursts
          (GRBs)  in  galaxies  with  low  star  formation rates has lent
          support to the suggestion that these events result from compact
          object  binary  mergers.  We  discuss  how  new  simulations in
          general  relativity  are helping to identify the central engine
          of  short-hard GRBs. Motivated by our latest relativistic black
          hole-neutron star merger calculations, we discuss a scenario in
          which  these  events  may  trigger short-hard GRBs, and compare
          this  model  to  competing relativistic models involving binary
          neutron  star  mergers and the delayed collapse of hypermassive
          neutron stars. Distinguishing features of these models may help
          guide   future  GRB  and  gravitational  wave  observations  to
          identify the nature of the sources.

          Physics and Astronomy, UC Berkeley)
          Comments: 5 pages, Accepted to ApJ Letters
          We  argue  that  rich star clusters take at least several local
          dynamical   times   to   form,  and  so  are  quasi-equilibrium
          structures  during their assembly. Observations supporting this
          conclusion   include   morphologies   of  star-forming  clumps,
          momentum  flux  of protostellar outflows from forming clusters,
          age  spreads  of  stars  in  the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and
          other  clusters, and the age of a dynamical ejection event from
          the  ONC.  We  show  that  these  long formation timescales are
          consistent  with  the expected star formation rate in turbulent
          gas,  as  recently  evaluated  by Krumholz & McKee. Finally, we
          discuss the implications of these timescales for star formation
          efficiencies,  the  disruption of gas by stellar feedback, mass
          segregation  of  stars,  and  the  longevity  of  turbulence in
          molecular clumps.

          Comments:  Accepted for publication in ApJ. Numerical code that
          is used in the analysis is available at this http URL
          Using  non-linear  time  series  analysis, along with surrogate
          data  analysis, it is shown that the various types of long term
          variability  exhibited  by  the black hole system GRS 1915+105,
          can  be explained in terms of a deterministic non-linear system
          with some inherent stochastic noise. Evidence is provided for a
          non-linear  limit  cycle origin of one of the low frequency QPO
          detected  in  the source, while some other types of variability
          could  be  due to an underlying low dimensional chaotic system.
          These  results  imply  that  the partial differential equations
          which   govern  the  magneto-hydrodynamic  flow  of  the  inner
          accretion disk, can be approximated by a small number ($\approx
          3 -5$) of non-linear but {\it ordinary} differential equations.
          While  this  analysis does not reveal the exact nature of these
          approximate  equations,  they  may  be  obtained in the future,
          after  results  of magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of realistic
          accretion disks become available.

          Title:  Constraining  the  GRB  Collimation  with  a Survey for
          Orphan Afterglows
          Authors:  Arne Rau (Caltech, MPE), Jochen Greiner (MPE), Robert
          Schwartz (AIP)
          Comments: 11 pages, A&A in press
          Gamma-ray    bursts    are   believed   to   be   produced   in
          highly-relativistic collimated outflows. Support for this comes
          among  others  from  the  association  of the times of detected
          breaks  in  the  decay  of  afterglow  light  curves  with  the
          collimation  angle  of  the  jets.  An  alternative approach to
          estimate  a  limit on the collimation angle uses GRB afterglows
          without  detected  prompt-emission counterparts. Here we report
          on  the  analysis of a dedicated survey for the search of these
          orphan  afterglows  using  the  Wide  Field  Imager at the 2.2m
          MPI/ESO  telescope  at La Silla, Chile. We monitored ~12 square
          degrees.  in  up  to  25  nights typically spaced by one to two
          nights  with  a  limiting  magnitude  of  R=23. Four previously
          unknown  optical  transients were discovered and three of these
          associated  with  a  flare  star,  a cataclysmic variable and a
          dwarf   nova.  The  fourth  source  shows  indications  for  an
          extragalactic origin but the sparse sampling of the light curve
          prevents  a  reliable classification. We discuss the results in
          the context of the collimation of GRBs.

          Comments: ApJ Letters, 3 pages
          We  compare  different  examples  of spherical accretion onto a
          gravitating  mass.  Limiting  cases  include the accretion of a
          collisionally    dominated   fluid   and   the   accretion   of
          collisionless   particles.   We   derive  expressions  for  the
          accretion   rate   and  density  profile  for  semi-collisional
          accretion  which  bridges the gap between these limiting cases.
          Particle  crossing  of  the Hill sphere during the formation of
          the  outer  planets  is  likely  to  have  taken  place  in the
          semi-collisional regime.

          Accretion Disc
          Authors: D. X. Wang, Y. C. Ye, X. X. Lan
          Comments: 11 pages, 9 figures
          A  toy  model  for  magnetic  connection  in  black  hole  (BH)
          accretion  disc is discussed based on a poloidal magnetic field
          generated  by  a  single electric current flowing around a Kerr
          black  hole  in the equatorial plane. We discuss the effects of
          the  coexistence  of  two  kinds  of  magnetic  connection (MC)
          arising  respectively from (1)the closed field lines connecting
          the  BH  horizon  with  the disc (henceforth MCHD), and (2) the
          closed field lines connecting the plunging region with the disc
          (henceforth   MCPD).   The   magnetic  field  configuration  is
          constrained by conservation of magnetic flux and a criterion of
          the  screw instability of the magnetic field. The condition for
          negative  energy  of  the  accreting  particles in the plunging
          region  is  discussed  in detail. It turns out that MCPD can be
          regarded  as  a  supplement  to  MCHD  in extracting energy and
          angular  momentum from a BH, and a very steep emmisivity in the
          inner  disc  can  be produced by MCPD, which is consistent with
          the  observations  of  the  Seyfert1 galaxy MCG-6-30-15 and the
          galactic BH candidate XTE J1650-500.

          Hamburg/ESO   Survey  and  the  Veron-Cetty  &  Veron  catalog.
          Hydrogen  recombination  lines  Pa$\alpha$  and  Br$\gamma$ are
          observed  in  seven  of  the  nine sources of which five show a
          broad   component.   In   three   sources,   extended   1-0S(1)
          rotational-vibrational molecular hydrogen emission is detected.
          Stellar  CO absorption is seen in four sources. In one of these
          objects,  an  upper limit of the central mass can be determined
          from  the  stellar velocity field. H- and Ks-band imaging allow
          us  to  determine  the  morphology  class of the host galaxies.
          Colors  (with  supplementary J-band 2MASS images) show that the
          four  galaxies with detected CO absorption are characterized by
          an  overall  strong  stellar  contribution. One galaxy shows an
          increased  extinction towards the nucleus. After removal of the
          nuclear point source, the host galaxies show colors typical for
          non-active spiral galaxies.

          We  investigate  why  half  of  X-ray--selected active galactic
          nuclei  (AGN)  in deep surveys lack signs of accretion in their
          optical  spectra. The majority of these ``optically--dull'' AGN
          are  no  more  than 6 times fainter than their host galaxies in
          rest-frame  R-band;  as  such,  AGN  lines  are  unlikely to be
          overwhelmed  by  stellar continuum in at least half the sample.
          We   find  that  optically--dull  AGN  have  the  mid--infrared
          emission   and   L(x)/L(IR)   ratios  characteristic  of  local
          Seyferts,  suggesting that the cause of optical dullness is not
          missing UV--optical continua. We compare the morphologies of 22
          optically--dull  and  9 optically--active AGN at 0.5<z<0.8, and
          find  that optically--dull AGN show a wide range of axis ratio,
          but  optically--active AGN have only very round axis ratios. We
          conclude  that  hard  X-rays select AGN in host galaxies with a
          wide range of inclination angle, but only those AGN in the most
          face-on  or  spheroidal  host  galaxies  show  optical emission
          lines.  Thus,  extranuclear  dust  in  the host galaxy plays an
          important  role in hiding the emission lines of optically--dull
          AGN.

          Title:  Finding  benchmark  brown  dwarfs to probe the IMF as a

          MNRAS
          Using  a  simulated  disk  brown dwarf (BD) population, we find
          that  new  large area infrared surveys are expected to identify
          enough BDs covering wide enough mass--age ranges to potentially
          measure the mass function down to ~0.03Mo, and the BD formation
          history out to 10 Gyr, at a level capable of establishing if BD
          formation follows star formation. We suggest these capabilities
          are best realised by spectroscopic calibration of BD properties
          (Teff,  g  and  [M/H])  which,  when  combined  with a measured
          luminosity  and  an evolutionary model can give BD mass and age
          relatively   independent   of   BD   atmosphere   models.  Such
          calibration  requires  an  empirical  understanding  of  how BD
          spectra  are  affected  by  variations in these properties, and
          thus  the identification and study of "benchmark BDs" whose age
          and  composition  can be established independently. We identify
          the  best  sources  of  benchmark  BDs  as  young  open cluster
          members, moving group members, and wide (>1000AU) BD companions
          to  both  subgiant  stars  and high mass white dwarfs (WDs). We
          have used 2MASS to measure a wide L dwarf companion fraction of
          2.7(+0.7/-0.5)%,  which  equates  to a BD companion fraction of
          34(+9/-6)%  for  an alpha~1 companion mass function. Using this
          value we simulate populations of wide BD binaries, and estimate
          that   80(+21/-14)   subgiant--BD   binaries,  and  50(+13/-10)
          benchmark WD--BD binaries could be identified using current and
          new  facilities. The WD--BD binaries should all be identifiable
          using  the  Large Area Survey component of UKIDSS combined with
          Sloan.  Discovery  of  the subgiant--BD binaries will require a
          NIR  imaging campaign around a large (~900) sample of Hipparcos
          subgiants.  If  identified, spectral studies of these benchmark
          brown dwarfs could reveal the spectral sensitivities across the
          Teff, g and [M/H] space probed by new surveys.

          We  present  radio observations of the unique, recently formed,
          planetary  nebula (PN) associated with a very long-period OH/IR
          variable  star  V1018  Sco  that  is unequivocally still in its
          asymptoticgiant  branch  phase.  Two regions within the optical
          nebula  are  clearly  detected  in  nonthermal  radio continuum
          emission,  with radio spectral indices comparable to those seen
          in  colliding-wind  Wolf-Rayet  binaries. We suggest that these
          represent  shocked  interactions  between the hot, fast stellar
          wind  and  the cold nebular shell that represents the PN's slow
          wind  moving  away  from  the central star. This same interface
          produces  both  synchrotron  radio continuum and the optical PN
          emission.  The  fast  wind is neither spherical in geometry nor
          aligned  withany  obvious optical or radio axis. We also report
          the detection of transient H2O maser emission in this nebula.

          Title:   Beta   decay  radiation  signature  from  neutron-rich
          gamma-ray bursts?
          Authors: Soebur Razzaque, Peter Meszaros
          Comments: 11 pages, 2 figures
          Core  collapse  of  massive  stars  and binary neutron stars or
          black  hole-neutron  star binary mergers are likely progenitors
          of  long  and  short  duration  gamma-ray  bursts respectively.
          Neutronized material in the former and neutron star material in
          the  latter  are  ejected  by  the  central  engine  implying a
          neutron-rich  jet outflow. A free neutron, however, beta decays
          to  a  proton, an electron (beta) and an anti-neutrino in about
          fifteen  minutes  in  its  rest  frame.  Sudden  creation  of a
          relativistic  electron  is accompanied by radiation with unique
          temporal   and  spectral  signature.  We  calculate  here  this
          radiation  signature  collectively  emitted  by  all beta decay
          electrons   from   neutron-rich   outflow.  Detection  of  this
          signature may thus provide strong evidence for not only neutron
          but also for proton content in the relativistic gamma-ray burst
          jets.

          Title:   The   hot  stars  in  orbit  around  the  M31  central
          supermassive black hole: are they young or old?
          Authors: Pierre Demarque, Shanil Virani (Yale University)
          Comments:  9  pages,  2 figures, submitted to New Astronomy for
          publication
          The  cluster  of hot stars observed in orbit around the central
          black  hole  of M31 has been interpreted by Bender et al (2005)
          as  a 200 Myr starburst. The formation of a population of young
          stars  in  close  proximity  to a massive black hole presents a
          difficult challenge to star formation theory. We point out that
          in  a  high  stellar density environment, the course of stellar
          evolution  is  modified  by frequent collisions and mergers. An
          old  stellar population of evolved blue horizontal-branch stars
          and  of merger products cannot be ruled out on the basis of the
          available  data.  Observations  are  suggested  that would help
          distinguish  between a ``young'' and ``old'' stellar population
          interpretation of the observations.

          We   present   images   taken   with  the  GMOS  instrument  on
          Gemini-South,  in  excellent (<0.5 arcsec) seeing, of SN 2001ig
          in NGC 7424, ~1000 days after explosion. A point source seen at
          the  site  of the SN is shown to have colours inconsistent with
          being  an  H  II  region or a SN 1993J-like remnant, but can be
          matched  to  a  late-B through late-F supergiant with A_V<1. We
          believe this object is the massive binary companion responsible
          for  periodic  modulation  in  mass  loss  material  around the
          Wolf-Rayet  progenitor which gave rise to significant structure
          in the SN radio light curve.

          Comments:  8  pages, 4 figures, to appear in the proceedings of
          "Infrared Diagnostics of Galaxy Evolution"
          Dust  plays crucial roles in galaxy formation and evolution. In
          the  early  epoch  of galaxy evolution dust is only supplied by
          supernovae  (SNe). With the aid of a new physical model of dust
          production by SNe, we constructed a model of dust emission from
          forming  galaxies. We show the evolution of the spectral energy
          distribution  (SED).  Then  we  adopt  this  model  to  a local
          starbursting  dwarf  galaxy  SBS 0335$-$052. Further we discuss
          the   SEDs  of  high  redshift  galaxies,  and  consider  their
          observational feasibility.

          addressing the referee report
          We  build a large sample of Seyfert 2 galaxies (Sy2s) with both
          optical  spectropolarimetric and X-ray data available, in which
          41  Sy2s  with  the  detection of polarized broad emission line
          (PBL) and 32 without. We found that for luminous Sy2s (with L_2
          -  10keV > 10^42 erg/s), most (92%) of the Compton-thin sources
          show PBL, while only 53% Compton-thick sources do. Our results,
          for  the first time with high statistical confidence, show that
          at  least  for  luminous Sy2s, the nuclear obscuration plays an
          important  role in the visibility of PBL in Sy2s. These results
          put    constraints   on   the   geometry   of   the   obscuring
          material/electron  scattering  region  in  the framework of the
          unified  model. We can reach these results in the unified model
          if:  a)  the  absorption  column  density  is  higher  at large
          inclinations  and b) the scattering region is obscured at large
          inclinations. Consistent with previous studies, we also found a
          much  lower  detection rate of PBL in less luminous Sy2s (23%),
          indicating the detectability of PBL also depends on the central
          AGN activities.

          emission line
          Authors: P. Jiang, J. X. Wang, T. G. Wang (USTC)
          Comments: 21 pages, including 3 tables and 7 figures, ApJ 2006,
          v644 in press
          Most  Active  Galactic  Nuclei (AGN) exhibit a narrow Fe Kalpha
          line  at ~ 6.4 keV in the X-ray spectra, due to the fluorescent
          emission  from cold material far from the inner accretion disk.
          Using  XMM-Newton  observations,  Page  et  al.  found that the
          equivalent  width  (EW)  of the narrow Fe Kalpha line decreases
          with  increasing  luminosity (EW ~ L^-0.17pm0.08), suggesting a
          decrease  in  the  covering factor of the material emitting the
          line  (presumably the torus). By combining the archival Chandra
          HETG  observations  of  34 type 1 AGNs with XMM observations in
          literature, we build a much large sample with 101 AGNs. We find
          a   similar   X-ray   Baldwin   effect  in  the  sample  (EW  ~
          L^-0.2015pm0.0426),  however, we note that the anti-correlation
          is  dominated  by the radio loud AGN in the sample, whose X-ray
          spectra   might   be  contaminated  by  the  relativistic  jet.
          Excluding   the   radio   loud  AGN,  we  find  a  much  weaker
          anti-correlation   (EW   ~   L^-0.1019pm0.0524).   We   present
          Monte-Carlo    simulations    showing    that   such   a   weak
          anti-correlation  can  be attributed to the relative short time
          scale variations of the X-ray continuum.

          Recent  spectroscopic  models  of  active galactic nuclei (AGN)
          have  indicated that the recommended electron-ion recombination
          rate  coefficients for iron ions with partially filled M-shells
          are incorrect in the temperature range where these ions form in
          photoionized  plasmas. We have investigated this experimentally
          for  Fe XIV forming Fe XIII. The recombination rate coefficient
          was  measured employing the electron-ion merged beams method at
          the  Heidelberg heavy-ion storage-ring TSR. The measured energy
          range  of  0-260  eV encompassed all dielectronic recombination
          (DR)  1s2  2s2 2p6 3l 3l' 3l'' nl''' resonances associated with
          the  3p1/2  ->  3p3/2,  3s  ->  3p,  3p -> 3d and 3s -> 3d core
          excitations within the M-shell of the Fe XIV 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p
          parent  ion.  This  range  also includes the 1s2 2s2 2p6 3l 3l'
          4l'' nl''' resonances associated with 3s -> 4l'' and 3p -> 4l''
          core  excitations.  We find that in the temperature range 2--14
          eV,  where Fe XIV is expected to form in a photoionized plasma,
          the   Fe  XIV  recombination  rate  coefficient  is  orders  of
          magnitude larger than previously calculated values.

          [ABRIDGED]  This  is  the  third  in  a  series of three papers
          exploring the connection between the multiwavelength properties
          of AGN in nearby early-type galaxies and the characteristics of
          their  hosts.  We selected 116 AGN candidates requiring a radio
          flux  of  1 mJy. We classified the objects with HST images into
          ``core''  and  ``power-law''  galaxies,  on  the  basis  of the
          nuclear  slope  of  their  brightness profiles. We used HST and
          Chandra  data  to  isolate  their nuclear emission to study the
          multiwavelength  behaviour  of  their nuclei. The properties of
          the  nuclei  hosted  by  the 29 core galaxies were presented in
          Paper  II.  Core galaxies invariably host a radio-loud nucleus,
          with  a median radio-loudness of Log R = 3.6 and an X-ray based
          radio loudness parameter of Log R,X = -1.3. Here we discuss the
          properties of the nuclei of the 22 ``power-law'' galaxies. They
          show  a  substantial  excess of optical and X-ray emission with
          respect to core galaxies at the same level of radio luminosity.
          Conversely,  their  radio-loudness  parameters, Log R ~ 1.6 and
          Log  R,X  ~  -3.3,  are  similar  to  those measured in Seyfert
          galaxies.  Thus  the radio-loudness of AGN hosted by early-type
          galaxies  appears  to  be  univocally  related  to  the  host's
          brightness  profile:  radio-loud  AGN  are  only hosted by core
          galaxies,  while  radio-quiet  AGN  are found only in power-law
          galaxies.  The brightness profile is determined by the galaxy's
          evolution, through its merger history; our results suggest that
          the same process sets the AGN flavour.

          We  report  the  results  of a prototype photometric search for
          transiting  extrasolar planets using Subaru Suprime-Cam. Out of
          about  100,000  stars monitored around the Galactic plane (l=90
          degree,b=0  degree), we find that 7,700 (27,000) stars show the
          photometric  precision  below  1%  (3%) for 60 second exposures
          which  is  required to detect extrasolar planets by the transit
          method.  Thus  Suprime-Cam  has  the  photometric stability and
          accuracy  required  for a transiting planet survey. During this
          observing   run,   we   detected   three  transiting  planetary
          candidates  (i'-band  magnitude  around  18.5)  which exhibit a
          single full transit-like light curve with a fractional depth of
          <5%.  While  future photometric and/or spectroscopic follow-ups
          remain  to  be  done,  the  estimated  parameters for the three
          systems   are   consistent  with  planetary  companions  around
          main-sequence   stars.  We  also  found  two  eclipsing  binary
          candidates  and  eleven  variable  stars  exhibiting W UMa-like
          light curves.

          XMM-Newton observations aimed at determining for the first time
          the  broad-band  X-ray  properties  of  the faint high galactic
          latitude  Intermediate Polar UU Col are presented. We performed
          X-ray  timing  analysis  in different energy ranges of the EPIC
          cameras  which  reveals  the  dominance of the 863s white dwarf
          rotational period. The spin pulse is strongly energy dependent.
          Weak  variabilities  at  the beat 935s and at the 3.5hr orbital
          periods  are  also  observed,  but  the  orbital  modulation is
          detected   only  below  0.5keV.  Simultaneous  UV  and  optical
          photometry  shows  that  the  spin  pulse  is  anti-phased with
          respect  to  the  hard  X-rays.  Analysis  of  the EPIC and RGS
          spectra  reveals  the  complexity  of the X-ray emission, being
          composed of a soft 50eV black--body component and two optically
          thin  emission components at 0.2keV and 11keV strongly absorbed
          by dense material with an equivalent hydrogen column density of
          10**(23)cm**(-2) partially (50%) covering the X-ray source. The
          complex  X-ray and UV/optical temporal behaviour indicates that
          accretion  occurs predominantly (80%) via a disc with a partial
          contribution (20%) directly from the stream. The main accreting
          pole  dominates  at  high  energies  whilst  the secondary pole
          mainly  contributes  in  the soft X-rays and at lower energies.
          The  bolometric  flux ratio of the soft-to-hard X-ray emissions
          is  found  to be consistent with the prediction of the standard
          accretion  shock  model.  We  find  the  white  dwarf in UU Col
          accretes  at a low rate and possesses a low magnetic moment. It
          is  therefore  unlikely that UU Col will evolve into a moderate
          field  strength Polar, which leaves the soft X-ray Intermediate
          Polars  a  still  enigmatic small group of magnetic Cataclysmic
          Variables.

          Association  with  X-ray  cavity,  Halpha filaments and cooling

          Cold  molecular  gas  has  been  recently  detected  in several
          cooling   flow   clusters   of   galaxies  where  huge  optical
          nebulosities  often  stand. These optical filaments are tightly
          linked  to  the cooling flow and to the related phenomena, like
          the  rising  bubbles  of  relativistic plasma, fed by the radio
          jets.  We  present here a map in the CO(2-1) rotational line of
          the  cold  molecular  gas associated with some Halpha filaments
          surrounding  the  central  galaxy  of  the Perseus cluster: NGC
          1275.  The map, extending to about 50 kpc (135 arcsec) from the
          center  of the galaxy, has been made with the 18-receiver array
          HERA,  at the focus of the IRAM 30m telescope. Although most of
          the  cold  gas is concentrated to the center of the galaxy, the
          CO   emission  is  also  clearly  associated  to  the  extended
          filaments conspicuous in ionised gas and could trace a possible
          reservoir  fueling  the  star  formation  there. Some of the CO
          emission is also found where the X-ray gas could cool down more
          efficiently: at the rims of the central X-ray cavity (where the
          hot  gas  is  thought to have been pushed out and compressed by
          the   central   AGN  expanding  radio  lobes).  The  CO  global
          kinematics does not show any rotation in NGC 1275. The cold gas
          is probably a mixture of gas falling down on the central galaxy
          and  of  uplifted  gas  dragged  out  by a rising bubble in the
          intracluster  medium.  As  recenlty  suggested in other cluster
          cores,  the  cold  gas peculiar morphology and kinematics argue
          for  the picture of an intermittent cooling flow scenario where
          the central AGN plays an important role.

          Title:    Thermal   Stability   of   White   Dwarfs   Accreting
          Hydrogen-rich Matter and Progenitors of Type Ia Supernovae

          including 6 figures
          We   revisit   the   properties   of   white  dwarfs  accreting
          hydrogen-rich  matter  by  constructing steady-state models, in
          which hydrogen shell burning consumes hydrogen at the same rate
          as  the  white  dwarf  accretes it. We obtain such steady-state
          models  for  various accretion rates and white dwarf masses. We
          confirm that these steady models are thermally stable only when
          the  accretion rate is higher than ~1 E-7 Msun/yr. We show that
          recently   claimed   ``quiescent  burning''  in  the  ``surface
          hydrogen  burning''  models  at a much wider range of accretion
          rates results from the too large zone mass in the outer part of
          the  models;  hydrogen  burning  must  occur  in  a  much  more
          superficial  layer.  A  comparison  of  the positions on the HR
          diagram  suggests  that  most  of  the luminous supersoft X-ray
          sources  are white dwarfs accreting matter at rates high enough
          that   the   hydrogen   burning   shell  is  thermally  stable.
          Implications  on  the  progenitors  of  Type  Ia supernovae are
          discussed.

          The  last  few years have seen the discovery of a number of new
          aspects  of  Type  I  X-ray bursts: the extremely energetic and
          long  duration superbursts, intermediate duration bursts at low
          luminosities,   mHz   QPOs,   and   burst  oscillations.  These
          discoveries  promise  a new understanding of nuclear burning on
          accreting neutron stars, and offer a chance to use observations
          to  probe  neutron star properties. I discuss what we can learn
          from future long term monitoring with MIRAX.

          Title:  HST/FOS  Spectral  Mapping  of  V2051 Ophiuchi in a Low
          State
          Authors: R. K. Saito, R. Baptista
          Comments:  20  pages,  11 figures, accept to publication in The
          Astronomical Journal (issue 131, April 2006)
          We report a study of the spectra and structure of the accretion
          disk  of the dwarf nova V2051 Ophiuchi while the star was in an
          unusual  faint  brightness  state  during 1996. The differences
          between  the  UV  resonant  lines  and  continuum  disk surface
          brightness  distributions  indicate  a vertically extended disk
          with  the  emission  from  these  lines  arising from the upper
          atmospheric   layers.   Distinct   emission  along  the  stream
          trajectory  suggests  the  occurrence  of  gas stream overflow.
          Spatially  resolved spectra show that the lines are in emission
          at  all disk radii. The Balmer decrement becomes shallower with
          increasing  radius.  The  FWHMs  of  the  emission  lines  show
          differences  with  respect  to  that  expected  for  a  gas  in
          Keplerian  rotation and the line intensities drop with a radial
          dependency   of  $I\propto  R^{-1.78}$.  The  uneclipsed  light
          contributes  about  5  - 10 per cent of the total flux, and its
          spectrum  is  dominated  by  a  Balmer jump and strong lines in
          emission.  Broad  absorption  bands, possibly due to Fe II, are
          present  in  the spectra of the disk side farther away from the
          secondary  star,  suggesting  it  arises  from  absorption by a
          extended gas region above the disk; the differences between the
          spectra  of  the  hemisphere  farther  from  and  nearer to the
          secondary  star  are  interpreted  in  terms  of  chromospheric
          emission  from a disc with a non-negligible opening angle (limb
          brightening  effect).  Stellar  atmosphere  model  fits  to the
          extracted  white  dwarf spectrum lead to a temperature $T_{WD}=
          9500 ^{+2900}_{-1900} K$ and a distance of $d = 67 ^{+22}_{-25}
          pc$ if the inner disk is opaque, or $d = 92 ^{+30}_{-35} pc$ if
          the inner disk is optically thin.

          In this review we re-evaluate our observational and theoretical
          understanding  of  the  chemical  evolution  of  protoplanetary
          disks.  We discuss how improved observational capabilities have
          enabled  the detection of numerous molecules exposing an active
          disk chemistry that appears to be in disequilibrium. We outline
          the primary facets of static and dynamical theoretical chemical
          models.  Such  models  have demonstrated that the observed disk
          chemistry  arises  from warm surface layers that are irradiated
          by  X-ray and FUV emission from the central accreting star. Key
          emphasis  is placed on reviewing areas where disk chemistry and
          physics  are  linked:  including  the  deuterium chemistry, gas
          temperature   structure,   disk   viscous  evolution  (mixing),
          ionization fraction, and the beginnings of planet formation.

          This  work  focuses  on  the properties of dusty tori in active
          galactic  nuclei (AGN) derived from the comparison of SDSS type
          1  quasars  with  mid-Infrared  (MIR)  counterparts  and a new,
          detailed  torus  model.  The  infrared  data  were taken by the
          Spitzer  Wide-area InfraRed Extragalactic (SWIRE) Survey. Basic
          model parameters are constraint, such as the density law of the
          graphite  and  silicate  grains, the torus size and its opening
          angle.  A  whole  variety  of  optical depths is supported. The
          favoured models are those with decreasing density with distance
          from  the  centre,  while  there is no clear tendency as to the
          covering  factor,  ie  small, medium and large covering factors
          are almost equally distributed. Based on the models that better
          describe  the  observed  SEDs, properties such as the accretion
          luminosity,  the  mass of dust, the inner to outer radius ratio
          and the hydrogen column density are computed.

          Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ
          The  present  paper  is  the  last  of  a  series  studying the
          first-order  Fermi acceleration processes at relativistic shock
          waves  with  the  method  of Monte Carlo simulations applied to
          shocks  propagating in realistically modeled turbulent magnetic
          fields. The model of the background magnetic field structure of
          Niemiec  &  Ostrowski (2004, 2006) has been augmented here by a
          large-amplitude short-wave downstream component, imitating that
          generated by plasma instabilities at the shock front. Following
          Niemiec    &    Ostrowski    (2006),    we    have   considered
          ultrarelativistic  shocks with the mean magnetic field oriented
          both  oblique  and parallel to the shock normal. For both cases
          simulations  have  been  performed  for  different  choices  of
          magnetic field perturbations, represented by various wave power
          spectra  within  a wide wavevector range. The results show that
          the  introduction of the short-wave component downstream of the
          shock  is  not sufficient to produce power-law particle spectra
          with  the  "universal"  spectral  index  4.2.  On the contrary,
          concave  spectra  with  cutoffs  are preferentially formed, the
          curvature  and  cutoff energy being dependent on the properties
          of  turbulence.  Our  results  suggest that the electromagnetic
          emission  observed  from  astrophysical sites with relativistic
          jets,  e.g.  AGN  and  GRBs,  is  likely generated by particles
          accelerated   in   processes  other  than  the  widely  invoked
          first-order Fermi mechanism.

          Comments: 12 pages, 16 PNG figures, in press for A&A
          In this paper we analyse five observations of the BL Lac object
          AO 0235+16 performed with the Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites
          during  the  years  2000-2005. In the February 2002 observation
          the  source  is  found  in  a bright state and presents a steep
          X-ray  spectrum,  while in all the other epochs it is faint and
          the  spectrum  is  hard.  The soft X-ray spectrum appears to be
          strongly absorbed, likely by the intervening system at z=0.524,
          which  also  absorbs  the  optical-UV  radiation.  We find that
          models  that consider spectral curvature are superior to single
          power law ones in fitting the X-ray spectrum. In particular, we
          favour  a  double  power  law  model,  which  agrees  with  the
          assumption  of  a  superposition of two different components in
          the  X-ray  domain.  Both  in  the  Chandra  and  in one of the
          XMM-Newton   observations,   a   tentative   detection  of  the
          redshifted  Fe Kalpha emission line may suggest its origin from
          the inner part of an accretion disc. Thermal emission from this
          accretion  disc  might  explain  the  UV-soft-X-ray  bump  that
          appears  in  the  spectral energy distributions, when the X-ray
          spectra  are  complemented  with  the  optical-UV data from the
          Optical  Monitor  onboard XMM-Newton. More likely, the bump can
          be  interpreted in terms of an additional synchrotron component
          emitted  from  an  inner region of the jet with respect to that
          where  the  lower-energy  emission comes from. An inspection of
          the X-ray light curves reveals that intraday variability occurs
          only when the source is in a bright state.

          Title: A simple accretion model of a rotating gas sphere onto a

          Authors: E. A. Huerta, S. Mendoza
          Comments: 19 pages, 5 figures
          We   construct   a   simple   accretion  model  of  a  rotating
          pressureless  gas  sphere  onto  a Schwarzschild black hole. We
          show  how  to  build  analytic  solutions  in  terms  of Jacobi
          elliptic  functions.  This  construction  represents  a general
          relativistic  generalisation  of  the Newtonian accretion model
          first proposed by Ulrich (1976). In exactly the same form as it
          occurs  for the Newtonian case, the flow naturally predicts the
          existence  of  an  equatorial rotating accretion disc about the
          hole.  However,  the radius of the disc increases monotonically
          without  limit  as the flow reaches its maximum allowed angular
          momentum.

          We  report on the Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of the
          globular  cluster  NGC 288. We detect four X-ray sources within
          the  core  radius  and  seven  additional  sources  within  the
          half-mass radius down to a limiting luminosity of Lx=7e30 erg/s
          (assuming  cluster  membership)  in the 0.3-7 keV band. We also
          observed  the  cluster with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced
          Camera  for  Surveys and identify optical counterparts to seven
          X-ray   sources   out  of  the  nine  sources  within  the  HST
          field-of-view.  Based  on  the X-ray and optical properties, we
          find   2-5   candidates   of  cataclysmic  variables  (CVs)  or
          chromospherically  active binaries, and 2-5 background galaxies
          inside  the half-mass radius. Since the core density of NGC 288
          is  very  low,  the faint X-ray sources of NGC 288 found in the
          Chandra  and  HST observations is higher than the prediction on
          the  basis  of the collision frequency. We suggest that the CVs
          and chromospherically active binaries are primordial in origin,
          in agreement with theoretical expectation.

          Title: When Extrasolar Planets Transit Their Parent Stars

          When  extrasolar  planets  are observed to transit their parent
          stars,  we  are  granted unprecedented access to their physical
          properties.  It  is  only  for  transiting  planets that we are
          permitted  direct  estimates of the planetary masses and radii,
          which  provide  the  fundamental constraints on models of their
          physical structure. In particular, precise determination of the
          radius  may  indicate  the  presence  (or absence) of a core of
          solid  material,  which  in  turn  would speak to the canonical
          formation  model  of  gas accretion onto a core of ice and rock
          embedded  in  a  protoplanetary disk. Furthermore, the radii of
          planets in close proximity to their stars are affected by tidal
          effects and the intense stellar radiation. As a result, some of
          these  "hot  Jupiters" are significantly larger than Jupiter in
          radius.  Precision  follow-up  studies of such objects (notably
          with  the space-based platforms of the Hubble and Spitzer Space
          Telescopes)   have   enabled   direct   observation   of  their
          transmission  spectra and emitted radiation. These data provide

          these  extrasolar  gas  giants,  and permit a direct comparison
          with  the  gas  giants of the Solar system. Despite significant
          observational   challenges,   numerous   transit   surveys  and

          photometry  enabled  by  upcoming  space  missions  offers  the
          prospect  of  the  first  detection of an extrasolar Earth-like
          planet  in  the habitable zone of its parent star, just in time

          Title: The Unusual X-ray Spectrum of FU Orionis
          Authors: S.L. Skinner, K.R. Briggs, M. Guedel
          Comments: ApJ, vol. 643, in press. 23 pages, 4 figures, 1 table
          FU Orionis stars (FUors) are young low-mass eruptive stars that
          are thought to be accreting at high rates. They could give rise
          to  soft  X-ray emission from accretion shocks, but their X-ray
          properties  are  largely  unknown.  We  report  the first X-ray
          detection of the prototype star FU Orionis with XMM-Newton. Its
          X-ray  spectrum  is  unusual  compared  to those of classical T
          Tauri  stars  (cTTS).  The  cool  and  hot components typically
          detected  in  cTTS  are  present but are seen through different
          absorption  column  densities. A heavily-absorbed hot component
          at  kT  >  5  keV  accounts for most of the observed flux and a
          strong  Fe  K  emission line is present. Such high temperatures
          are  characteristic  of  magnetic  processes  rather than shock
          emission.  We  discuss possible origins of the unusual spectrum
          in  the  context  of a complex physical environment that likely
          includes  disk accretion, a strong wind, magnetic activity, and
          close binarity.

          Title:  The  unprecedented  optical  outburst  of the quasar 3C
          454.3. The WEBT campaign of 2004-2005
          Authors: M. Villata, C. M. Raiteri, T. J. Balonek, for the WEBT
          Collaboration
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, to be published in A&A
          The  radio  quasar  3C  454.3  underwent an exceptional optical
          outburst  lasting  more  than  1 year and culminating in spring
          2005.  The  maximum  brightness  detected  was  R = 12.0, which
          represents  the  most  luminous  quasar state thus far observed
          (M_B ~ -31.4). In order to follow the emission behaviour of the
          source   in   detail,  a  large  multiwavelength  campaign  was
          organized   by   the   Whole  Earth  Blazar  Telescope  (WEBT).
          Continuous  optical, near-IR and radio monitoring was performed
          in  several  bands.  ToO  pointings by the Chandra and INTEGRAL
          satellites  provided additional information at high energies in
          May  2005.  The  historical radio and optical light curves show
          different   behaviours.   Until   about  2001.0  only  moderate
          variability  was present in the optical regime, while prominent
          and  long-lasting  radio  outbursts were visible at the various
          radio  frequencies,  with higher-frequency variations preceding
          the lower-frequency ones. After that date, the optical activity
          increased  and  the  radio flux is less variable. This suggests
          that the optical and radio emissions come from two separate and
          misaligned  jet regions, with the inner optical one acquiring a
          smaller  viewing angle during the 2004-2005 outburst. Moreover,
          the  colour-index  behaviour  (generally  redder-when-brighter)
          during  the  outburst  suggests  the  presence  of  a  luminous
          accretion  disc.  A  huge mm outburst followed the optical one,
          peaking in June-July 2005. The high-frequency (37-43 GHz) radio
          flux started to increase in early 2005 and reached a maximum at
          the  end  of our observing period (end of September 2005). VLBA
          observations at 43 GHz during the summer confirm the

          St.Petersburg University, Russia)
          We  present  a  near-IR  study  of the EXor variable V1118 Ori,
          performed  by  following  a  slightly  declining  phase after a
          recent  outburst. In particular, the near-IR (0.8 - 2.3 micron)
          spectrum, obtained for the first time, shows a large variety of
          emission  features  of  the  HI  and  HeI  recombination and CO
          overtone. By comparing the observed spectrum with a wind model,
          a  mass  loss rate value is derived along with other parameters
          whose  values  are  typical  of  an  accreting T Tauri star. In
          addition,  we  have used X-ray data from the XMM archive, taken
          in two different epochs during the declining phase monitored in
          IR.  X-ray  emission  (in  the  range  0.5 - 10 keV) permits to
          derive  several  parameters which confirm the T Tauri nature of
          the  source.  In  the near-IR the object maintains a low visual
          extinction  during  all  the  activity  phases, confirming that
          variable   extinction   does   not   contribute  to  brightness
          variations.   The   lack   of  both  a  significant  amount  of
          circumstellar  material  and  any  evidence  of IR cooling from
          collimated jet/outflow driven by the source, indicates that, at
          least  this member of the EXor class, is in a late stage of the
          Pre-Main  Sequence  evolution.  In the X-ray regime, an evident
          fading  is  present,  detected in the post-outburst phase, that
          cannot  be  reconciled  with  the  presence  of  any  absorbing
          material.  This circumstance, combined with the persistence (in
          the  pre-  and post-outburst phases) of a temperature component
          at  about  10 MK, suggests that accretion has some influence in
          regulating the coronal activity.

          (abridged) The review describes observations of SS433. The main
          difference  between  SS433  and  other  X-ray  binaries  is the
          supercritical   regime   for   the   gas   accretion  onto  the
          relativistic star (most likely a black hole), which has lead to
          the  formation  of collimated relativistic jets. The properties
          of  the  jets are determined by their interaction with the disk
          wind.  The  precession  of  the  disk  and jets, as well as the
          eclipsing  in the binary system, make SS433 a unique laboratory
          for  studies  of  mechanisms  for  the  microquasar phenomenon.
          Essentially  all  photometric  and  spectroscopic properties of
          SS433 are determined by the accretion disk and its orientation,
          but  the disk itself is not observed, being located beneath the
          photosphere  of the dense wind. Observational manifestations of
          the  wind  and of gas flows in the system are described. Little
          is  known  about the structure of the central regions where the
          hot bases of the jets are located. The available X-ray, UV, and
          optical  observations point towards the picture where the bases
          of  the  jets  are surrounded by cocoons of hot gas reradiating
          emission  from  the  inner  regions  of the jet channel. Direct
          investigations  of  this channel in the supercritical accretion
          disk  of  SS433  are  not  possible;  however, a similar object
          oriented  face-on  would  likely  be  an extremely bright X-ray
          source,  such as ultra-luminous X-ray sources observed in other
          galaxies.

          Title:  Detection  of Ks-excess stars in the 14Myr open cluster
          NGC4755
          Authors: C. Bonatto, E. Bica, S. Ortolani, B. Barbuy
          Comments: 10 figs. Astronomy & Astrophysics, in press
          We  derive  the structure, distribution of MS and PMS stars and
          dynamical  state of the young open cluster NGC 4755. We explore
          the possibility that, at the cluster age, some MS and PMS stars
          still  present  infrared excesses related to dust envelopes and
          proto-planetary  discs.  The  radial  density  profile  follows
          King's  law  with  a  core  radius  $\rm\rc=0.7\pm0.1 pc$ and a
          limiting  radius  $\rm\rl=6.9\pm0.1  pc$;  the  cluster  age is
          $\rm14\pm2  Myr$.  Field-star  decontamination reveals a low-MS
          limit  at $\rm\approx1.4 \ms$. The core MF ($\chi=0.94\pm0.16$)
          is  flatter  than  the  halo's  ($\chi=1.58\pm0.11$).  NGC 4755
          contains $\rm\sim285$ candidate PMS stars of age $\rm\sim1 - 15
          Myr$,  and  a  few evolved stars. The mass locked up in PMS, MS
          and  evolved stars amounts to $\rm\sim1150 \ms$. Proper motions
          show  that  \ks-excess  MS  and  PMS stars are cluster members.
          \ks-excess  fractions  in  PMS and MS stars are $\rm5.4\pm2.1%$
          and  $\rm3.9\pm1.5%$  respectively, consistent with the cluster
          age.  The  core  is deficient in PMS stars, as compared with MS
          ones.  NGC  4755 hosts binaries in the halo but they are scarce
          in  the  core. Compared to open clusters in different dynamical
          states  studied  with  similar methods, NGC 4755 fits relations
          involving  structural  and dynamical parameters in the expected
          locus for its age and mass. On the other hand, the flatter core
          MF  probably  originates  from  primordial processes related to
          parent  molecular cloud fragmentation and mass segregation over
          $\rm\sim14 Myr$. Star formation in NGC 4755 began $\rm\approx14
          Myr$  ago  and  proceeded  for  about  the same length of time.
          Detection  of  \ks-excess  emission in member MS stars suggests
          that  some  circumstellar  dust discs survived for $\rm\sim10^7
          yr$,  occurring  both  in some MS and PMS stars for the age and
          spread observed in NGC 4755.

          Images of 7 Compact groups of galaxies (CG) were obtained using
          the  2.1m  telescope in San Pedro Martir (B.C. Mexico) equipped
          with  the  NIR  camera CAMILA. The NIR images trace the mass of
          the  galaxies,  through  the  oldest  and  more evolved stellar
          populations. The goal of this project is to search for evidence
          of  morphological  perturbations  correlated  with the level of
          activity  (AGN or star formation) of the galaxies. We find that
          the  level  of  perturbation  is  well correlated with activity
          observed  in optical spectrocopy (Coziol et al. 2004). Evidence
          for  perturbations  decreases  from  more active groups to less
          active  groups,  confirming  the  classification.  Our analysis
          suggests  that  galaxies  in  more active groups are undergoing
          important  transformations  due  to interaction and merging and
          that  the  whole  groups  is on a merger path. Galaxies in less
          active  CG  have  gone  through similar processes in the recent
          past  and are either in a final merging phase or in equilibrium
          due to a more massive halo of dark matter.

          10^{12}  L_sun) and 19 new LIGs (with L_FIR equal to or greater
          than  10^{11} L_sun). Twenty of the galaxies in the sample were

          dimensional  fitting  program GALFIT and the residuals examined

          at least 30% are involved in tidal interactions, with 20% being

          The  bipolar  outflow  from the massive star forming cluster in
          DR21  is one of the most powerful known, and in IRAC images the
          outflow  stands out by virtue of its brightness at 4.5 um (Band
          2). Indeed, IRAC images of many galactic and extragalactic star
          formation  regions  feature  prominent  Band 2 morphologies. We
          have  analyzed archival ISOSWS spectra of the DR21 outflow, and
          compare them to updated H2 shocked and UV-excitation models. We
          find that H2 line emission contributes about 50% of the flux of
          the  IRAC  bands  at  3.6  um,  4.5  um  , and 5.8 um, and is a
          significant contributor to the 8.0 um band as well, and confirm
          that the outflow contains multiple excitation mechanisms. Other
          potentially  strong  features,  in  particular  Br alpha and CO
          emission, have been suggested as contributing to IRAC fluxes in
          outflows,  but  they  are weak or absent in DR21; surprisingly,
          there  also is no evidence for strong PAH emission. The results
          imply  that  IRAC  images  can  be  a powerful detector of, and
          diagnostic  for,  outflows  caused  by  massive  star formation
          activity  in  our  galaxy,  and in other galaxies as well. They
          also suggest that IRAC color-color diagnostic diagrams may need
          to  take  into  account  the possible influence of these strong
          emission  lines.  IRAC images of the general ISM in the region,
          away  from  the  outflow,  are  in  approximate but not precise
          agreement with theoretical models.

          We  investigate  the  effect of embedded active galactic nuclei
          (AGN)  in  galaxy  mergers on the CO molecular line emission by
          combining  non-local  thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) radiative
          transfer  calculations  with  hydrodynamic simulations. We find
          that  AGN  feedback  energy  in  gas  rich  galaxy  mergers can
          contribute  to large molecular outflows which may be detectable
          via  velocity-integrated  emission  contour  maps,  as  well as
          through kinematic features in the emission line profiles.

          Title: Chandra and Hubble Space Telescope Study of the Globular
          Cluster NGC 288

          We  report on the Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of the
          globular  cluster  NGC 288. We detect four X-ray sources within
          the  core  radius  and  seven  additional  sources  within  the
          half-mass radius down to a limiting luminosity of Lx=7e30 erg/s
          (assuming  cluster  membership)  in the 0.3-7 keV band. We also
          observed  the  cluster with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced
          Camera  for  Surveys and identify optical counterparts to seven
          X-ray   sources   out  of  the  nine  sources  within  the  HST
          field-of-view.  Based  on  the X-ray and optical properties, we
          find   2-5   candidates   of  cataclysmic  variables  (CVs)  or
          chromospherically  active binaries, and 2-5 background galaxies
          inside  the half-mass radius. Since the core density of NGC 288
          is  very  low,  the faint X-ray sources of NGC 288 found in the
          Chandra  and  HST observations is higher than the prediction on
          the  basis  of the collision frequency. We suggest that the CVs
          and chromospherically active binaries are primordial in origin,
          in agreement with theoretical expectation.

          Title: When Extrasolar Planets Transit Their Parent Stars
          Authors:  David  Charbonneau,  Timothy  M. Brown, Adam Burrows,

          When  extrasolar  planets  are observed to transit their parent
          stars,  we  are  granted unprecedented access to their physical
          properties.  It  is  only  for  transiting  planets that we are
          permitted  direct  estimates of the planetary masses and radii,
          which  provide  the  fundamental constraints on models of their
          physical structure. In particular, precise determination of the
          radius  may  indicate  the  presence  (or absence) of a core of
          solid  material,  which  in  turn  would speak to the canonical
          formation  model  of  gas accretion onto a core of ice and rock
          embedded  in  a  protoplanetary disk. Furthermore, the radii of
          planets in close proximity to their stars are affected by tidal
          effects and the intense stellar radiation. As a result, some of
          these  "hot  Jupiters" are significantly larger than Jupiter in
          radius.  Precision  follow-up  studies of such objects (notably
          with  the space-based platforms of the Hubble and Spitzer Space
          Telescopes)   have   enabled   direct   observation   of  their
          transmission  spectra and emitted radiation. These data provide
          the  first  observational  constraints on atmospheric models of
          these  extrasolar  gas  giants,  and permit a direct comparison
          with  the  gas  giants of the Solar system. Despite significant
          observational   challenges,   numerous   transit   surveys  and
          quick-look  radial  velocity surveys are active, and promise to
          deliver  an  ever-increasing  number of these precious objects.
          The   detection   of  transits  of  short-period  Neptune-sized
          objects,   whose   existence  was  recently  uncovered  by  the
          radial-velocity  surveys, is eagerly anticipated. Ultra-precise
          photometry  enabled  by  upcoming  space  missions  offers  the
          prospect  of  the  first  detection of an extrasolar Earth-like
          planet  in  the habitable zone of its parent star, just in time
          for Protostars and Planets VI.

          Title: The Unusual X-ray Spectrum of FU Orionis
          Authors: S.L. Skinner, K.R. Briggs, M. Guedel
          Comments: ApJ, vol. 643, in press. 23 pages, 4 figures, 1 table
          FU Orionis stars (FUors) are young low-mass eruptive stars that
          are thought to be accreting at high rates. They could give rise
          to  soft  X-ray emission from accretion shocks, but their X-ray
          properties  are  largely  unknown.  We  report  the first X-ray
          detection of the prototype star FU Orionis with XMM-Newton. Its
          X-ray  spectrum  is  unusual  compared  to those of classical T
          Tauri  stars  (cTTS).  The  cool  and  hot components typically
          detected  in  cTTS  are  present but are seen through different
          absorption  column  densities. A heavily-absorbed hot component
          at  kT  >  5  keV  accounts for most of the observed flux and a
          strong  Fe  K  emission line is present. Such high temperatures
          are  characteristic  of  magnetic  processes  rather than shock
          emission.  We  discuss possible origins of the unusual spectrum
          in  the  context  of a complex physical environment that likely
          includes  disk accretion, a strong wind, magnetic activity, and
          close binarity.

          Title:  The  unprecedented  optical  outburst  of the quasar 3C
          454.3. The WEBT campaign of 2004-2005
          Authors: M. Villata, C. M. Raiteri, T. J. Balonek, for the WEBT
          Collaboration
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, to be published in A&A
          The  radio  quasar  3C  454.3  underwent an exceptional optical
          outburst  lasting  more  than  1 year and culminating in spring
          2005.  The  maximum  brightness  detected  was  R = 12.0, which
          represents  the  most  luminous  quasar state thus far observed
          (M_B ~ -31.4). In order to follow the emission behaviour of the
          source   in   detail,  a  large  multiwavelength  campaign  was
          organized   by   the   Whole  Earth  Blazar  Telescope  (WEBT).
          Continuous  optical, near-IR and radio monitoring was performed
          in  several  bands.  ToO  pointings by the Chandra and INTEGRAL
          satellites  provided additional information at high energies in
          May  2005.  The  historical radio and optical light curves show
          different   behaviours.   Until   about  2001.0  only  moderate
          variability  was present in the optical regime, while prominent
          and  long-lasting  radio  outbursts were visible at the various
          radio  frequencies,  with higher-frequency variations preceding
          the lower-frequency ones. After that date, the optical activity
          increased  and  the  radio flux is less variable. This suggests
          that the optical and radio emissions come from two separate and
          misaligned  jet regions, with the inner optical one acquiring a
          smaller  viewing angle during the 2004-2005 outburst. Moreover,
          the  colour-index  behaviour  (generally  redder-when-brighter)
          during  the  outburst  suggests  the  presence  of  a  luminous
          accretion  disc.  A  huge mm outburst followed the optical one,
          peaking in June-July 2005. The high-frequency (37-43 GHz) radio
          flux started to increase in early 2005 and reached a maximum at
          the  end  of our observing period (end of September 2005). VLBA
          observations at 43 GHz during the summer confirm the

          Title: Evidence for T Tauri-like emission in the EXor V1118 Ori
          from near-IR and X-ray data

          St.Petersburg University, Russia)
          We  present  a  near-IR  study  of the EXor variable V1118 Ori,
          performed  by  following  a  slightly  declining  phase after a
          recent  outburst. In particular, the near-IR (0.8 - 2.3 micron)
          spectrum, obtained for the first time, shows a large variety of
          emission  features  of  the  HI  and  HeI  recombination and CO
          overtone. By comparing the observed spectrum with a wind model,
          a  mass  loss rate value is derived along with other parameters
          whose  values  are  typical  of  an  accreting T Tauri star. In
          addition,  we  have used X-ray data from the XMM archive, taken
          in two different epochs during the declining phase monitored in
          IR.  X-ray  emission  (in  the  range  0.5 - 10 keV) permits to
          derive  several  parameters which confirm the T Tauri nature of
          the  source.  In  the near-IR the object maintains a low visual
          extinction  during  all  the  activity  phases, confirming that
          variable   extinction   does   not   contribute  to  brightness
          variations.   The   lack   of  both  a  significant  amount  of
          circumstellar  material  and  any  evidence  of IR cooling from
          collimated jet/outflow driven by the source, indicates that, at
          least  this member of the EXor class, is in a late stage of the
          Pre-Main  Sequence  evolution.  In the X-ray regime, an evident
          fading  is  present,  detected in the post-outburst phase, that
          cannot  be  reconciled  with  the  presence  of  any  absorbing
          material.  This circumstance, combined with the persistence (in
          the  pre-  and post-outburst phases) of a temperature component
          at  about  10 MK, suggests that accretion has some influence in
          regulating the coronal activity.

          (abridged) The review describes observations of SS433. The main
          difference  between  SS433  and  other  X-ray  binaries  is the
          supercritical   regime   for   the   gas   accretion  onto  the
          relativistic star (most likely a black hole), which has lead to
          the  formation  of collimated relativistic jets. The properties
          of  the  jets are determined by their interaction with the disk
          wind.  The  precession  of  the  disk  and jets, as well as the
          eclipsing  in the binary system, make SS433 a unique laboratory
          for  studies  of  mechanisms  for  the  microquasar phenomenon.
          Essentially  all  photometric  and  spectroscopic properties of
          SS433 are determined by the accretion disk and its orientation,
          but  the disk itself is not observed, being located beneath the
          photosphere  of the dense wind. Observational manifestations of
          the  wind  and of gas flows in the system are described. Little
          is  known  about the structure of the central regions where the
          hot bases of the jets are located. The available X-ray, UV, and
          optical  observations point towards the picture where the bases
          of  the  jets  are surrounded by cocoons of hot gas reradiating
          emission  from  the  inner  regions  of the jet channel. Direct
          investigations  of  this channel in the supercritical accretion
          disk  of  SS433  are  not  possible;  however, a similar object
          oriented  face-on  would  likely  be  an extremely bright X-ray
          source,  such as ultra-luminous X-ray sources observed in other
          galaxies.

          Title:  Detection  of Ks-excess stars in the 14Myr open cluster
          NGC4755
          Authors: C. Bonatto, E. Bica, S. Ortolani, B. Barbuy
          Comments: 10 figs. Astronomy & Astrophysics, in press
          We  derive  the structure, distribution of MS and PMS stars and
          dynamical  state of the young open cluster NGC 4755. We explore
          the possibility that, at the cluster age, some MS and PMS stars
          still  present  infrared excesses related to dust envelopes and
          proto-planetary  discs.  The  radial  density  profile  follows
          King's  law  with  a  core  radius  $\rm\rc=0.7\pm0.1 pc$ and a
          limiting  radius  $\rm\rl=6.9\pm0.1  pc$;  the  cluster  age is
          $\rm14\pm2  Myr$.  Field-star  decontamination reveals a low-MS
          limit  at $\rm\approx1.4 \ms$. The core MF ($\chi=0.94\pm0.16$)
          is  flatter  than  the  halo's  ($\chi=1.58\pm0.11$).  NGC 4755
          contains $\rm\sim285$ candidate PMS stars of age $\rm\sim1 - 15
          Myr$,  and  a  few evolved stars. The mass locked up in PMS, MS
          and  evolved stars amounts to $\rm\sim1150 \ms$. Proper motions
          show  that  \ks-excess  MS  and  PMS stars are cluster members.
          \ks-excess  fractions  in  PMS and MS stars are $\rm5.4\pm2.1%$
          and  $\rm3.9\pm1.5%$  respectively, consistent with the cluster
          age.  The  core  is deficient in PMS stars, as compared with MS
          ones.  NGC  4755 hosts binaries in the halo but they are scarce
          in  the  core. Compared to open clusters in different dynamical
          states  studied  with  similar methods, NGC 4755 fits relations
          involving  structural  and dynamical parameters in the expected
          locus for its age and mass. On the other hand, the flatter core
          MF  probably  originates  from  primordial processes related to
          parent  molecular cloud fragmentation and mass segregation over
          $\rm\sim14 Myr$. Star formation in NGC 4755 began $\rm\approx14
          Myr$  ago  and  proceeded  for  about  the same length of time.
          Detection  of  \ks-excess  emission in member MS stars suggests
          that  some  circumstellar  dust discs survived for $\rm\sim10^7
          yr$,  occurring  both  in some MS and PMS stars for the age and
          spread observed in NGC 4755.

          Images of 7 Compact groups of galaxies (CG) were obtained using
          the  2.1m  telescope in San Pedro Martir (B.C. Mexico) equipped
          with  the  NIR  camera CAMILA. The NIR images trace the mass of
          the  galaxies,  through  the  oldest  and  more evolved stellar
          populations. The goal of this project is to search for evidence
          of  morphological  perturbations  correlated  with the level of
          activity  (AGN or star formation) of the galaxies. We find that
          the  level  of  perturbation  is  well correlated with activity
          observed  in optical spectrocopy (Coziol et al. 2004). Evidence
          for  perturbations  decreases  from  more active groups to less
          active  groups,  confirming  the  classification.  Our analysis
          suggests  that  galaxies  in  more active groups are undergoing
          important  transformations  due  to interaction and merging and
          that  the  whole  groups  is on a merger path. Galaxies in less
          active  CG  have  gone  through similar processes in the recent
          past  and are either in a final merging phase or in equilibrium
          due to a more massive halo of dark matter.

          We  present high resolution imaging observations of a sample of
          previously  unidentified  far-infrared galaxies at z < 0.3. The
          objects  were  selected  by  cross-correlating  the  IRAS Faint
          Source  Catalog  with  the  VLA FIRST catalog and the HST Guide
          Star  Catalog  to  allow  for  adaptive optics observations. We
          found  two  new  ULIGs  (with  L_FIR  equal  to or greater than
          10^{12}  L_sun) and 19 new LIGs (with L_FIR equal to or greater
          than  10^{11} L_sun). Twenty of the galaxies in the sample were
          imaged  with either the Lick or Keck adaptive optics systems in
          H  or  K'.  Galaxy  morphologies  were determined using the two
          dimensional  fitting  program GALFIT and the residuals examined
          to look for interesting structure. The morphologies reveal that
          at least 30% are involved in tidal interactions, with 20% being
          clear  mergers.  An  additional  50%  show  signs  of  possible
          interaction.  Line  ratios  were  used  to  determine  powering
          mechanism;  of  the  17  objects  in  the  sample showing clear
          emission  lines - four are active galactic nuclei and seven are
          starburst  galaxies.  The  rest  exhibit  a combination of both

          The  bipolar  outflow  from the massive star forming cluster in
          DR21  is one of the most powerful known, and in IRAC images the
          outflow  stands out by virtue of its brightness at 4.5 um (Band
          2). Indeed, IRAC images of many galactic and extragalactic star
          formation  regions  feature  prominent  Band 2 morphologies. We
          have  analyzed archival ISOSWS spectra of the DR21 outflow, and
          compare them to updated H2 shocked and UV-excitation models. We
          find that H2 line emission contributes about 50% of the flux of
          the  IRAC  bands  at  3.6  um,  4.5  um  , and 5.8 um, and is a
          significant contributor to the 8.0 um band as well, and confirm
          that the outflow contains multiple excitation mechanisms. Other
          potentially  strong  features,  in  particular  Br alpha and CO
          emission, have been suggested as contributing to IRAC fluxes in
          outflows,  but  they  are weak or absent in DR21; surprisingly,
          there  also is no evidence for strong PAH emission. The results
          imply  that  IRAC  images  can  be  a powerful detector of, and
          diagnostic  for,  outflows  caused  by  massive  star formation
          activity  in  our  galaxy,  and in other galaxies as well. They
          also suggest that IRAC color-color diagnostic diagrams may need
          to  take  into  account  the possible influence of these strong
          emission  lines.  IRAC images of the general ISM in the region,
          away  from  the  outflow,  are  in  approximate but not precise
          agreement with theoretical models.

          We  investigate  the  effect of embedded active galactic nuclei
          (AGN)  in  galaxy  mergers on the CO molecular line emission by
          combining  non-local  thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) radiative
          transfer  calculations  with  hydrodynamic simulations. We find
          that  AGN  feedback  energy  in  gas  rich  galaxy  mergers can
          contribute  to large molecular outflows which may be detectable
          via  velocity-integrated  emission  contour  maps,  as  well as
          through kinematic features in the emission line profiles.

          Title:  Mass Deficits, Stalling Radii, and the Merger Histories
          of Elliptical Galaxies
          Authors: David Merritt
          Comments: 11 pages, uses emulateapj.sty
          A  binary  supermassive  black  hole  leaves  an  imprint  on a
          galactic nucleus in the form of a "mass deficit," a decrease in
          the mass of the nucleus due to ejection of stars by the binary.
          The  magnitude  of  the mass deficit is in principle related to
          the  galaxy's  merger  history, but the relation has never been
          quantified.  Here, high-accuracy N-body simulations are used to
          calibrate   this  relation.  Mass  deficits  are  shown  to  be
          approximately  0.5M_{12},  with  M_{12}  the  total mass of the
          binary;  the  coefficient  in  this relation is found to depend
          only  weakly  on  the  binary  mass  ratio  or  on the galaxy's
          pre-existing  nuclear  density profile. Hence, after N mergers,
          the  mass  deficit  is  ~0.5 N M_h with M_h the final (current)
          black  hole  mass.  When  compared with observed mass deficits,
          this  result implies between 1 and 3 mergers for most galaxies,
          in   accord   with  hierarchical  structure  formation  models.
          Implications   for   binary   stalling  radii,  the  origin  of
          hyper-velocity  stars,  and  the distribution of dark matter at
          the centers of galaxies are discussed.

          Title: The redshift distribution of short gamma-ray bursts from
          dynamically formed neutron star binaries
          Authors:   Clovis  Hopman,  Dafne  Guetta,  Eli  Waxman,  Simon
          Portegies Zwart
          Comments: Submitted to ApJL
          Short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) may arise from gravitational
          wave  (GW) driven mergers of double neutron star (DNS) systems.
          DNSs  may  be  "primordial"  or  can form dynamically by binary
          exchange    interactions    in    globular    clusters   during
          core-collapse.  For primordial binaries, the time delay between
          formation  and  merger  is  expected  to be short, tau~0.1 Gyr,
          implying that the redshift distribution of merger events should
          follow  that  of  star-formation.  We  point  out here that for
          dynamically  formed DNSs, the time delay between star-formation
          and  merger  is  dominated  by  the cluster core-collapse time,
          rather than by the GW inspiral time, yielding delays comparable
          to  the  Hubble  time.  We  derive the redshift distribution of
          merger events of dynamically formed DNSs, and find it to differ
          significantly  from  that  typically  expected  for  primordial
          binaries.  The  observed  redshift  distribution of SHBs favors
          dynamical  formation,  although  a  primordial origin cannot be
          ruled  out  due  to possible detection biases. Future red-shift
          observations  of  SHBs  may allow to determine whether they are
          dominated by primordial or dynamically formed DNSs.

          We present the results of IRS low-resolution spectroscopy of 51
          Seyfert  galaxies, part of a large Spitzer observing program to
          determine the mid-to-far infrared spectral energy distributions
          of  a  well-defined  sample  of  87  nearby, 12 micron-selected
          Seyferts.  We  find that the spectra clearly divide into groups
          based  on  their  continuum  shapes  and spectral features. The
          infrared  spectral  types  appear  to be related to the Seyfert
          types.  Some  features  are  clearly  related  to  a  starburst
          contribution  to  the IR spectrum, while the observed power-law
          continuum  shapes,  attributed  to  the  AGN,  may  be  dust or
          non-thermal  emission.  Principal  component  analysis  results
          suggest that the relative contribution of starburst emission is
          the dominant cause of variance in the spectra. We find that the
          Sy  2's  show  on average stronger starburst contributions than
          the Sy 1's.

          Comments: Submitted to ApJ. 8 pages, 6 figures
          We   report   the   serendipitous   discovery   of  two  strong
          gravitational   lens   candidates  (ACS  J160919+6532  and  ACS
          J160910+6532)  in deep images obtained with the Advanced Camera
          for  Surveys  on  the Hubble Space Telescope, each less than 40
          arcsec  from  the  previously  known  gravitational lens system
          CLASS  B1608+656. The redshifts of both lens galaxies have been
          measured  with  Keck  and  Gemini:  one  is a member of a small
          galaxy  group at z~0.63, which also includes the lensing galaxy
          in  the  B1608+656  system,  and  the  second  is a member of a
          foreground  group  at  z~0.43. By measuring the effective radii
          and  surface  brightnesses  of  the two lens galaxies, we infer
          their  velocity  dispersions  based  on  the passively evolving
          Fundamental  Plane  (FP)  relation.  Elliptical isothermal lens
          mass  models  are  able  to  explain their image configurations
          within   the   lens  hypothesis,  with  a  velocity  dispersion
          compatible  with  that  estimated  from the FP for a reasonable
          source-redshift  range.  Based  on  the large number of massive
          early-type  galaxies  in  the  field  and the number-density of
          faint  blue  galaxies,  the  presence  of  two  additional lens
          systems  around  CLASS  B1608+656 is not unlikely in hindsight.
          Gravitational   lens   galaxies  are  predominantly  early-type
          galaxies,  which  are  clustered,  and  the  lensed quasar host
          galaxies   are   also   clustered.  Therefore,  obtaining  deep
          high-resolution  images  of the fields around known strong lens
          systems  is an excellent method of enhancing the probability of
          finding additional strong gravitational lens systems.

          Title: The Origin of the Initial Mass Function
          Authors: Ian A. Bonnell (St Andrews), Richard B. Larson (Yale),
          Hans Zinnecker (Potsdam)
          Comments: PPV conference paper, 16 pages, 11 figure
          We review recent advances in our understanding of the origin of
          the  initial  mass  function  (IMF).  We  emphasize  the use of
          numerical  simulations to investigate how each physical process
          involved in star formation affects the resulting IMF. We stress
          that it is insufficient to just reproduce the IMF, but that any
          successful  model  needs  to  account  for  the  many  observed
          properties  of  star forming regions including clustering, mass
          segregation and binarity. Fragmentation involving the interplay
          of   gravity,  turbulence,  and  thermal  effects  is  probably
          responsible   for  setting  the  characteristic  stellar  mass.
          Low-mass   stars   and   brown  dwarfs  can  form  through  the
          fragmentation  of  dense filaments and disks, possibly followed
          by early ejection from these dense environments which truncates
          their  growth  in mass. Higher-mass stars and the Salpeter-like
          slope  of  the  IMF  are  most  likely formed through continued
          accretion  in  a clustered environment. The effects of feedback
          and  magnetic fields on the origin of the IMF are still largely
          unclear.  Lastly,  we  discuss a number of outstanding problems
          that need to be addressed in order to develop a complete theory
          for the origin of the IMF.

          by  Emission-Line  Reverberation  of  Active  Galactic  Nuclei:
          Eddington Ratio and Inclination
          Authors:  Suzy  Collin,  Toshihiro  Kawaguchi,  Brad  Peterson,
          Marianne Vestergaard
          Comments: 19 pages, 11 figures
          We   try  to  identify  the  sources  and  systematics  of  the
          uncertainty  of the masses of the central black holes in active
          galactic   nuclei   (AGNs)   which   have   been   obtained  by
          reverberation-mapping   methods.   We  characterize  the  broad
          H$\beta$   emission-line   profiles   by  the  ratio  of  their
          full-width  at  half  maximum  (FWHM) to their line dispersion,
          i.e.,  the  second  moment  of  the  line  profile. We use this
          parameter  to  separate  the reverberation-mapped AGNs into two
          populations,  the  first  with  narrower  H$\beta$  lines  with
          relatively  extended  wings,  and the second with broader lines
          that  are  relatively  flat-topped.  The  first  population  is
          characterized  by  higher  Eddington  ratios  than  the second.
          Within  each population, we calibrate the black-hole mass scale
          by   comparison  of  the  reverberation-based  mass  with  that
          predicted  by  the  bulge  velocity dispersion. We also use the
          distribution  of  ratios of the reverberation-based mass to the
          velocity-dispersion  mass  prediction  in  a  comparison with a
          ``generalized thick disk'' model in order to see if inclination
          can  plausibly  account  for the observed distribution. We find
          that  the line dispersion is a less biased parameter in general
          than FWHM for black hole mass estimation, although we show that
          it  is  possible to empirically correct for the bias introduced
          by  using FWHM to characterize the emission-line width. We also
          argue  that  inclination effects are apparent in a small subset
          of  objects  with  the  narrowest emission lines. Our principal
          conclusion  is that the H$\beta$ profile is sensitive primarily
          to Eddington ratio, but that inclination effects play a role in
          some cases. (abridged)

          We  present  the 1.4 GHz map of the centre of MS0451.6-0305 and
          report  the detection of gravitationally lensed radio emission,
          coincident   with   the  previously  discovered  sub-mm  lensed
          emission.  The  radio  emission  is  resolved  into  7 distinct
          components  with predicted total magnifications \mu>10, and the
          overall  structure can be explained, using a simple lens model,
          with   three   multiply-imaged  radio  sources  at  z~2.9.  The
          morphology  and  scale  of  the  radio  and sub-mm emission are
          strikingly similar, extending ~1' across the sky. This suggests
          that  the  radio  and  sub-mm emission both arise from the same
          sources,  most  likely high redshift star forming galaxies. One
          of  the  multiply-imaged  radio  sources  is  predicted  to lie
          between  the  suggested  optical/NIR counterparts in the source
          plane;  together these sources constitute an interacting system
          extending  across a region of ~10 kpc. Preliminary estimates of
          the  total  S(850micron)/S(1.4GHz) flux density ratio appear to
          be  consistent  with  the  value expected from a SED similar to
          M82.

          We  present the results of photometric measurements from images
          of  the  LMC  cluster  ESO  121-SC03  taken  with  HST/ACS. Our
          resulting  CMD  reaches  3  magnitudes  below the main-sequence
          turn-off,  representing the deepest observation of this cluster
          to date. We also present similar photometry from ACS imaging of
          the  accreted  Sagittarius  dSph  cluster Pal. 12, used in this
          work  as  a  comparison  cluster.  From analysis of its CMD, we
          obtain  estimates  for  the  metallicity  and  reddening of ESO
          121-SC03:  [Fe/H]  = -0.97 +/- 0.10 and E(V-I) = 0.04 +/- 0.02,
          in  excellent  agreement  with  previous  studies. The observed
          horizontal  branch  level in ESO 121-SC03 suggests this cluster
          may  lie  20  per cent closer to us than does the centre of the
          LMC.  ESO  121-SC03  also possesses a significant population of
          blue  stragglers,  which we briefly discuss. Our new photometry
          allows  us  to  undertake  a  detailed  study of the age of ESO
          121-SC03  relative to Pal. 12 and the Galactic globular cluster
          47  Tuc.  Our  main result is that ESO 121-SC03 is 73 +/- 4 per
          cent  the  age of 47 Tuc, and 91 +/- 5 per cent the age of Pal.
          12.  Pal.  12 is 79 +/- 6 per cent as old as 47 Tuc, consistent
          with  previous  work. Our result corresponds to an absolute age
          for  ESO 121-SC03 in the range 8.3-9.8 Gyr depending on the age
          assumed  for  47  Tuc, therefore confirming ESO 121-SC03 as the
          only  known  cluster to lie squarely within the LMC age gap. We
          briefly  discuss  a  suggestion  from  earlier  work  that  ESO
          121-SC03 may have been accreted into the LMC system.

          Major progress has been achieved in recent years in mapping the
          properties  of  passively-evolving,  early-type  galaxies (ETG)
          from  the  local universe all the way to redshift ~2. Here, age
          and  metallicity estimates for local cluster and field ETGs are
          reviewed   as   based   on  color-magnitude,  color-sigma,  and
          fundamental  plane  relations,  as  well  as  on  spectral-line
          indices  diagnostics. The results of applying the same tools at
          high  redshifts  are then discussed, and their consistency with
          the  low-redshift  results  is  assessed.  Most low- as well as
          high-redshift  (z~1)  observations  consistently  indicate 1) a
          formation  redshift z>~3 for the bulk of stars in cluster ETGs,
          with  their  counterparts  in low-density environments being on
          average  ~1-2  Gyr  younger,  i.e.,  formed at z>~1.5-2, 2) the
          duration  of the major star formation phase anticorrelates with
          galaxy  mass,  and  the oldest stellar populations are found in
          the  most  massive  galaxies. With increasing redshift there is
          evidence  for  a  decrease  in  the  number  density  of  ETGs,
          especially  of  the  less  massive  ones, whereas existing data
          appear  to  suggest  that  most  of  the most-massive ETGs were
          already fully assembled at z~1. Beyond this redshift, the space
          density  of  ETGs  starts  dropping  significantly, and as ETGs
          disappear,   a   population  of  massive,  strongly  clustered,
          starburst   galaxies   progressively   becomes  more  and  more
          prominent, which makes them the likely progenitors to ETGs.

          Title: Geometric parametrization of binary elastic collisions
          Authors: Amaro J. Rica da Silva, Jos P. S. Lemos
          Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures
          Subj-class: Classical Physics; Space Physics
          A geometric view of the possible outcomes of elastic collisions
          of  two massive bodies is developed that integrates laboratory,
          center  of  mass, and relative body frames in a single diagram.
          From  these  diagrams  all  the scattering properties of binary
          collisions   can   be   obtained.   The   particular   case  of
          gravitational scattering by a moving massive object corresponds
          to   the  slingshot  maneuver,  and  its  maximum  velocity  is
          obtained.

          We  develop  a  formalism  for  the identification and accurate
          estimation of the strength of structure formation shocks during
          cosmological   smoothed   particle  hydrodynamics  simulations.
          Shocks  not only play a decisive role for the thermalization of
          gas  in virialising structures but also for the acceleration of
          relativistic   cosmic   rays   (CRs)  through  diffusive  shock
          acceleration.  Our  formalism  is  applicable  both to ordinary
          non-relativistic  thermal  gas,  and to plasmas composed of CRs
          and  thermal gas. To this end, we derive an analytical solution
          to  the  one-dimensional  Riemann  shock  tube  problem  for  a
          composite  plasma  of CRs and thermal gas. We apply our methods
          to  study  the  properties  of  structure  formation  shocks in
          high-resolution  hydrodynamic simulations of the LCDM model. We
          find  that  most  of  the energy is dissipated in weak internal
          shocks  with  Mach  numbers M~2 which are predominantly central
          flow  shocks  or  merger  shock  waves traversing halo centres.
          Collapsed  cosmological  structures  are surrounded by external
          shocks  with  much  higher  Mach numbers up to M~1000, but they
          play only a minor role in the energy balance of thermalization.
          We  show  that  after the epoch of cosmic reionisation the Mach
          number  distribution  is significantly modified by an efficient
          suppression   of   strong  external  shock  waves  due  to  the
          associated  increase  of  the  sound  speed of the diffuse gas.
          Invoking  a  model  for CR acceleration in shock waves, we find
          that  the  average  strength  of shock waves responsible for CR
          energy  injection  is higher than that for shocks that dominate
          the  thermalization  of  the  gas. When combined with radiative
          dissipation  and star formation, our formalism can also be used
          to  study  CR  injection  by  supernova shocks, or to construct
          models  for  shock-induced  star  formation in the interstellar
          medium. (abridged)

          SDSSJ1049+5103,  commonly  known  as Willman 1, is an extremely
          low-luminosity   Milky   Way  companion  whose  properties  are
          intermediate  between  those  of  globular  clusters  and dwarf
          spheroidals. In this paper, we use deep photometry to show that
          this object is old and moderately metal-poor, has a distance of
          38  +/-  7  kpc,  has  an M_V of -2.5 mag, and has a half-light
          radius  of 21 +/- 7 pc, consistent with previous estimates. The
          spatial  distribution  of Willman 1's main sequence stars shows
          1)  its  total  spatial  extent  exceeds its tidal radius for a
          range  of assumptions about its total mass and its orbit and 2)
          the  presence of prominent multi-directional stellar tails. The
          tidal  interactions causing these tail features may explain the
          large  physical  size  of  Willman 1 relative to low-luminosity
          globular  clusters.  It is the most distant Galactic object yet
          known  to  display  prominent  tails,  and  is the only distant
          satellite  to  display  multi-directional  tails.  Although  we
          cannot   at   present  determine  the  cause  of  this  unusual
          morphology,  preliminary  comparisons between the morphology of
          Willman 1 and published simulations suggest that it may be near
          the apocenter of its orbit, or that it may have interacted with
          another  halo  object. We find a significant difference between
          the  luminosity  functions  of  stars  in the center and in the
          tails  of  Willman 1, strongly suggesting mass segregation much
          like  that  seen  in  Palomar  5.  Although  Willman 1 has more
          pronounced  tidal  tails  than  most  confirmed Milky Way dwarf
          galaxies,  because  of  its  very low stellar mass we cannot at
          present  rule  out  the  possibility  that it has a dark matter
          halo. (Abridged)

          The  inner  0.1 AU around accreting T Tauri stars hold clues to
          many  physical  processes that characterize the early evolution
          of  solar-type  stars.  The accretion-ejection connection takes
          place at least in part in this compact magnetized region around
          the central star, with the inner disk edge interacting with the
          star's    magnetosphere    thus   leading   simultaneously   to
          magnetically  channeled  accretion  flows  and to high velocity
          winds  and  outflows.  The  magnetic  star-disk  interaction is
          thought  to  have  strong implications for the angular momentum
          evolution  of  the  central  system, the inner structure of the
          disk,  and  possibly for halting the migration of young planets
          close to the stellar surface. We review here the current status
          of  magnetic  field  measurements  in T Tauri stars, the recent
          modeling  efforts  of  the  magnetospheric  accretion  process,
          including   both   radiative  transfer  and  multi-D  numerical
          simulations,  and  summarize  current  evidence  supporting the
          concept  of magnetically-channeled accretion in young stars. We
          also   discuss   the   limits   of  the  models  and  highlight
          observational   results   which   suggest  that  the  star-disk
          interaction  is a highly dynamical and time variable process in
          young stars.

          Title:  A  Viscous  Heating Mechanism for the Hot Plasma in the
          Galactic Center Region
          Authors: R. Belmont, M. Tagger
          Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          In  addition  to  lines originating in a soft phase at ~0.8 keV
          and  to  cold  molecular  clouds,  the  X-ray  spectra from the
          Galactic center region also exhibit properties similar to those
          of  a  diffuse,  thin,  very  hot plasma at 8 keV on a scale of
          hundreds of parsecs. This phase is surprising for more than one
          reason.  First,  such  a  hot plasma should not be bound to the
          Galactic  plane  and  the  power needed to sustain the escaping
          matter  would be higher then any known source. Second, there is
          no  known  mechanism able to heat the plasma to more than a few
          keV.  Recently we have suggested that, hydrogen having escaped,
          the  hot  plasma  could  be a helium plasma, heavy enough to be
          gravitationally  confined.  In this case, the required power is
          much  more  reasonable.  We  present  here  a  possible heating
          mechanism  which taps the gravitational energy of the molecular
          clouds.  We note that the 8 keV plasma is highly viscous and we
          show  how  viscous  friction of molecular clouds flowing within
          the  hot  phase can dissipate energy in the gas and heat it. We
          detail  the  MHD  wake  of a spherical cloud by considering the
          different  MHD waves the cloud can excite. We find that most of
          the   energy   is   dissipated   by  the  damping  of  Alfvenic
          perturbations  in  two  possible  manners, namely by non-linear
          effects  and  by  a  large  scale curvature of the field lines.
          Depending  on  the field strength, this heating can balance the
          radiative  cooling.  We  note that the plasma parameters may be
          optimal  to  make  the dissipation most efficient, suggesting a
          self-regulation    mechanism.   The   loss   of   kinetic   and
          gravitational  energy  also  causes accretion of the clouds and
          may  have significant action on the gas dynamics in this region
          between  the  large  scale,  bar dominated flow and the central
          accretion to the massive black hole.

          Title: New Results from High Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy
          Authors: Heinrich J. Vlk

          No.230,  2005,  in Dublin (Ireland); E.J.A. Meurs, G. Fabbiano,

          High  energy  gamma-ray astronomy has recently made significant
          progresss   through  ground-based  instruments  like  the  {\it
          H.E.S.S.}  array  of  imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.
          The  unprecedented  angular  resolution  and the large field of
          view  has  allowed  to spatially resolve for the first time the
          morphology  of  gamma-ray  sources in the TeV energy range. The
          experimental  technique  is  described and the types of sources
          detected  and  still  expected  are discussed. Selected results
          include  objects  as different as a Galactic binary Pulsar, the
          Galactic  Center  and  Supernova Remnants but they also concern
          the  diffuse  extragalactic  optical/infrared  radiation field.
          Finally,  a  scan  of  the  Galactic plane in TeV gamma rays is
          described  which  has  led  to  a significant number of new TeV
          sources,   many  of  which  are  still  unidentified  in  other
          wavelengths.  The  field  has  a  close  connection  with X-ray
          astronomy  which  allows  the study of the synchrotron emission
          from these very high energy sources.

          The  mass  spectrum  of  the  primordial  black holes formed by
          density  perturbation  in  the  radiation-dominated  era of the
          Randall-Sundrum   type-2   cosmology  is  given.  The  spectrum
          coincides  with  standard  four-dimensional one on large scales
          but  the  deviation  is  apparent  on  smaller scales. The mass
          spectrum  is  initially  softer  than standard four-dimensional
          one,  while  after accretion during the earliest era it becomes
          harder  than  that. We also show expected extragalactic diffuse
          photon  background  spectra  varying  the  initial perturbation
          power-law  power  spectrum  and  give  constraints  on the blue
          spectra  and/or  the  reheating  temperature.  The  most recent
          observations on the small scale density perturbation from WMAP,
          SDSS  and  Lyman-\alpha  Forest  are  used.  What  we  get  are
          interpreted  as  constraints  on the smaller scale inflation on
          the  brane  connected  to  the  larger  one  at  the  scale  of
          Lyman-\alpha  Forest. If we set the bulk curvature radius to be
          0.1 mm and assume the reheating temperature is higher than 10^6
          GeV, the scalar spectral index from the smaller scale inflation
          is constrained to be n \lesssim 1.3. Typically, the constraints
          are  tighter  than standard four-dimensional one, which is also
          revised by us using the most recent observations.

          Title:  The  black hole fundamental plane from a uniform sample
          of radio and X-ray emitting broad line AGNs
          Authors: Ran Wang (PKU), Xue-Bing Wu (PKU), Min-Zhi Kong (NAOC)
          Comments: 23 pages, 7 figures, ApJ accepted
          We  derived the black hole fundamental plane relationship among
          the  1.4GHz radio luminosity (L_r), 0.1-2.4keV X-ray luminosity
          (L_X),  and  black hole mass (M) from a uniform broad line SDSS
          AGN  sample  including  both  radio  loud and radio quiet X-ray
          emitting  sources.  We found in our sample that the fundamental
          plane  relation  has  a  very weak dependence on the black hole
          mass, and a tight correlation also exists between the Eddington
          luminosity  scaled  X-ray  and radio luminosities for the radio
          quiet  subsample. Additionally, we noticed that the radio quiet
          and  radio  loud  AGNs  have  different power-law slopes in the
          radio--X-ray  non-linear  relationship.  The  radio loud sample
          displays  a  slope of 1.39, which seems consistent with the jet
          dominated  X-ray  model.  However, it may also be partly due to
          the  relativistic  beaming  effect.  For radio quiet sample the
          slope  of the radio--X-ray relationship is about 0.85, which is
          possibly  consistent  with  the theoretical prediction from the
          accretion  flow  dominated  X-ray model. We briefly discuss the
          reason  why  our  derived  relationship  is different from some
          previous  works and expect the future spectral studies in radio
          and  X-ray bands on individual sources in our sample to confirm
          our result.

          Comments: Submitted to Nature
          During  the  last  eight  years  a  clear  connection  has been
          established  between  the  two  most powerful explosions in our
          Universe:  core-collapse  supernovae  (SNe)  and long gamma ray
          bursts (GRBs). Theory suggests that every GRB is simultaneously
          accompanied  by a SN, but in only a few nearby cases have these
          two  phenomena  been observed together. We report the discovery
          and daily monitoring of SN2006aj associated with the GRB060218.
          Because  the  event was the second closest GRB, both explosions
          could  be  examined  in detail. GRB060218 had an unusually soft
          spectrum,  long  duration, and a total energy 100 to 1000 times
          less than most other GRBs. Yet SN2006aj was similar to those in
          other  GRBs,  aside  from  rising  more  rapidly and being ~40%
          fainter.  Taken  together, these observations suggest that GRBs
          have  two  components:  a  broad,  energetic,  but  only mildly
          relativistic  outflow  that  makes  a  SN,  and a more narrowly
          focused,  highly  relativistic jet responsible for the GRB. The
          properties of the GRB jet apparently vary greatly from event to
          event,  while the broad SN outflow varies much less. Low energy
          transients  like GRB060218 may be the most common events in the
          Universe.

          We  report  recent  Chandra  observations  of  the  ULX  in the
          elliptical   galaxy   NGC3379  that  clearly  detect  two  flux
          variability  cycles.  Comparing  these  data  with  the Chandra
          observation  of  ~5yr  ago, we measure a flux modulation with a
          period   of  ~12.6hr.  Moreover,  we  find  that  the  emission
          undergoes  a correlated spectral modulation, becoming softer at
          low  flux. We argue that our results establish this source as a
          ULX binary in NGC3379. Given the old stellar population of this
          galaxy,  the  ULX  is  likely  to  be a soft transient, however
          historical  X-ray  sampling  suggests that the current on phase
          has  lasted  ~10yr.  We discuss our results in terms of ADC and
          wind-feedback  models.  We constrain the donor mass and orbital
          period  at  the  onset  of  mass  transfer within 1.15-1.4M and
          12.5-16hr,  respectively.  The  duration  of  the mass-transfer
          phase  so  far is probably ~1Gyr and the binary has been a soft
          X-ray  transient  throughout  this  time. These constraints are
          insensitive to the mass of the accretor.

          Title: Microlensing modulation by binaries
          Authors: Florian Dubath, Maria Alice Gasparini, Ruth Durrer
          We  compute  the effect of the lens quadrupole on microlensing.
          The  time  dependence  of  the  quadrupole can lead to specific
          modulations  of  the  amplification signal. We study especially
          binary   system   lenses  in  our  galaxy.  The  modulation  is
          observable if the rotation period of the system is smaller than
          the time over which the amplification is significant and if the
          impact parameter of the passing light ray is sufficiently close
          to the Einstein radius so that the amplification is very large.
          Observations   of   this   modulation   can   reveal  important
          information  on  the  quadrupole  and thus on the gravitational
          radiation emitted by the lens.

          accompanied  by  violations  of  the  Hamiltonian  and momentum
          constraints.   Recently,   we  introduced  a  numerical  method
          (Hamiltonian  relaxation)  that greatly reduces the Hamiltonian
          constraint  violation  and  helps  improve  the  quality of the
          numerical  model.  We  present  here a method that controls the
          violation  of  the  momentum constraint. The method is based on
          the  addition  of  a  longitudinal  component  to the traceless
          extrinsic  curvature  generated  by  a vector potential w_i, as
          outlined  by  York.  The components of w_i are relaxed to solve
          approximately the momentum constraint equations, pushing slowly
          the  evolution  toward the space of solutions of the constraint
          equations.  We  test  this  method  with  simulations of binary
          neutron  stars  in  circular  orbits  and show that effectively
          controls  the  growth of the aforementioned violations. We also
          show  that  a full numerical enforcement of the constraints, as
          opposed  to  the  gentle  correction of the momentum relaxation
          scheme,  results  in the development of instabilities that stop
          the runs shortly.

          figures available at this http URL
          We  present  observations  of  3.86  sq.  deg.  of  the Perseus
          molecular  cloud  complex  with  the  Spitzer  Space  Telescope
          Infrared  Array  Camera  (IRAC).  The maps show strong extended
          emission  arising from shocked H2 in outflows in the region and
          from   polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbon  features.  More  than
          120,000  sources are extracted toward the cloud. Based on their
          IRAC  colors  and  comparison  to  off-cloud  and extragalactic
          fields,  we identify 400 candidate young stellar objects. About
          two  thirds  of  these  are  associated with the young clusters
          IC348 and NGC1333, while the last third is distributed over the
          remaining   cloud.   We  classify  the  young  stellar  objects
          according to the traditional scheme based on the slope of their
          spectral  energy  distributions.  Significant  differences  are
          found  for  the numbers of embedded Class I objects relative to
          more  evolved  Class  II  objects  in  IC348,  NGC1333  and the
          remaining  cloud  with the embedded Class I and "flat spectrum"
          YSOs  constituting 14%, 36% and 47% of the total number of YSOs
          identified in each of these regions. The high number of Class I
          objects  in  the  extended cloud (61% of the Class I objects in
          the  entire  cloud) suggests that a significant fraction of the
          current  star  formation  is  occuring  outside  the  two  main
          clusters.  Finally we discuss a number of outflows and identify
          their  driving  sources,  including  the  known deeply embedded
          Class  0  sources  outside  the two major clusters. The Class 0
          objects  are  found to be detected by Spitzer and have very red
          [3.6]-[4.5]  colors  but  do not show similarly red [5.8]-[8.0]
          colors.   The  Class  0  objects  are  easily  identifiable  in
          color-color   diagrams   plotting  these  two  colors  but  are
          problematic  to  extract  automatically  due  to  the  extended
          emission  from  shocked  gas  or  scattered  light  in cavities
          related to the associated outflows.

          High  resolution MERLIN 5 GHz observations (0.04") of 7 Seyfert
          galaxies,  selected  as the ones previously showing evidence of
          collimated  ejection,  have  been compared with high resolution
          archive  HST data. The radio maps reveal rich structures in all
          the  galaxies.  NGC  2639  and TXFS 2226-184 have multiple knot
          parsec-scale extended structures, Mrk 1034, Mrk 1210, NGC 4922C
          and  NGC  5506  reveal one-sided jets, while IC 1481 exhibits a
          jet-like   extension.   The   close   correlation  between  the
          radio-emitting  relativistic  plasma and the ionized gas in the
          inner  regions  of  these galaxies allows us to study in detail
          the physics close to the center of low luminosity AGN.

          We  present  new  images  (groundbased optical and mid-infrared
          (MIR)  from  the  Spitzer  Space  Telescope)  and spectra (from
          Spitzer)  of  the archetypal starburst galaxy M 82. The Spitzer
          data  show  that  the MIR emission extends at least 6 kpc along
          the  minor  axis of the galaxy. We use the optical and infrared
          data  to demonstrate that the extended emission is dominated by
          emission  from  dust.  The  colors  of the MIR emission and the
          spectra  indicate  that there is a strong component of aromatic
          feature  emission  (the  MIR  features  commonly  attributed to
          polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons).  The  dust  continuum  and
          aromatic  feature  emission  are  both strong in the well-known
          superwind  region  of  this  galaxy; clearly the carrier of the
          aromatic  features  can survive in close proximity to the wind,
          far  from  the  plane  of  the  galaxy. We also see significant
          emission  by  dust well outside the superwind region, providing
          the  clearest  picture  to date of the dust distribution in the
          halo of this galaxy.

          Title:  The  Distribution  of  Secondary  Masses in Post-Common
          Envelope  Binaries:  A  Potential  Test  of  Disrupted Magnetic
          Braking
          Authors: Michael Politano, Kevin P. Weiler
          The  distribution  of  secondary  star  masses  in  present-day
          post-common  envelope binaries (PCEBs) is calculated using four
          different  models  for  angular  momentum loss (AML) during the
          post-CE   phase:   only  gravitational  radiation  (GR),  GR  +
          disrupted  magnetic  braking  (DMB),  GR + reduced MB, and GR +
          intermediate  MB. For the DMB model, we find that the number of
          PCEBs  decreases  abruptly by 38% once MB begins to operate for
          non-fully  convective  secondaries.  We  do  not find a similar
          feature  in the distributions calculated using any of the other
          three  AML models in which MB is not disrupted. This percentage
          decrease in the number of present-day PCEBs predicted using the
          DMB   model   is  easily  large  enough  so  that  an  observed
          distribution  of  secondary  masses  or  even spectral types in
          PCEBs can provide an important test of whether magnetic braking
          is  indeed  substantially  reduced  in secondary stars that are
          fully  convective.  We  discuss briefly the feasibility of such
          observations.

          We  present  the  catalog of 477 spectra from the Serendipitous
          Extragalactic  X-ray  Source  Identification (SEXSI) program, a
          survey  designed to probe the dominant contributors to the 2-10
          keV  cosmic  X-ray background. Our survey covers 1 deg^2 of sky
          to  2-10  keV  fluxes of 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1, and 2 deg^2 for
          fluxes of 3 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1. Our spectra reach to R <24
          and  have  produced  redshifts  for 438 hard X-ray sources. The
          vast  majority  of  the  2-10  keV-selected sample are AGN with
          redshifts  between  0.1  and 3. We find that few sources at z<1
          have high X-ray luminosities, reflecting a dearth of high-mass,
          high-accretion-rate   sources   at   low   redshift,  a  result
          consistent  with  other  recent  wide-area surveys. Half of our
          sources  show  significant  obscuration,  with N_H>10^22 cm^-2,
          independent  of  unobscured luminosity. We classify 168 sources
          as  emission-line galaxies; all are X-ray luminous objects with
          optical spectra lacking both high-ionization lines and evidence
          of  a non-stellar continuum. The redshift distribution of these
          emission-line  galaxies peaks at a significantly lower redshift
          than  does that of the sources we spectroscopically identify as
          AGN.  We  conclude  that few of these sources can be powered by
          starburst  activity.  Stacking  spectra  for  a subset of these
          sources,  we  detect  [Ne V] emission, a clear signature of AGN
          activity,  confirming  that  the  majority of these objects are
          Seyfert  2s  in  which the high-ionization lines are diluted by
          stellar  emission.  We  find  33 objects lacking broad lines in
          their  optical  spectra  which  have  quasar X-ray luminosities
          (Lx>10^44  erg  s^-1),  the  largest  sample  of  such  objects
          identified  to  date. In addition, we explore 17 AGN associated
          with  galaxy  clusters  and  find  that  the cluster-member AGN
          sample  has  a  lower  fraction of broad-line AGN than does the
          background sample.

          Journal. 17 pages, 5 color figures
          We  present 0.5" resolution near-IR integral field spectroscopy
          of  the  Ha  line emission of 14 z~2 UV-selected BM/BX galaxies
          obtained with SINFONI at ESO/VLT. The mean Ha half-light radius
          r_1/2 is about 4kpc and line emission is detected over > ~20kpc
          in  several sources. In 9 sources, we detect spatially-resolved
          velocity  gradients,  from  40  to  410  km/s  over ~10kpc. The
          observed  kinematics  of the larger systems are consistent with
          orbital  motions.  Four galaxies are well described by rotating
          disks  with  clumpy morphologies and we extract rotation curves
          out  to  radii > ~10kpc. One or two galaxies exhibit signatures
          more  consistent with mergers. Analyzing all 14 galaxies in the
          framework  of  rotating  disks,  we infer mean inclination- and
          beam-corrected  maximum circular velocities v_c of 180+-90 km/s
          and  dynamical  masses  of (0.5-25)x10^10 Msun within r_1/2. On
          average,  the  dynamical masses are consistent with photometric
          stellar masses assuming a Chabrier/Kroupa IMF but too small for
          a  0.1-100  Msun  Salpeter IMF. The specific angular momenta of
          our  BM/BX  galaxies  are  similar  to those of local late-type
          galaxies.  The  specific  angular  momenta of their baryons are
          comparable  to  those of their dark matter halos. Extrapolating
          from  the  average v_c at 10kpc, the virial mass of the typical
          halo  of  a  galaxy  in  our  sample  is  10^(11.7+-0.5)  Msun.
          Kinematic  modeling  of the 3 best cases implies a ratio of v_c
          to  local  velocity  dispersion  of order 2-4 and accordingly a
          large  geometric  thickness. We argue that this suggests a mass
          accretion (alternatively, gas exhaustion) timescale of ~500Myr.
          We  also  argue  that  if our BM/BX galaxies were initially gas
          rich,  their  clumpy disks will subsequently lose their angular
          momentum  and  form  compact  bulges  on a timescale of ~1 Gyr.

          University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 2006
          We review the phenomenon of ultra-compact H II regions (UCHIIs)
          as  a  key phase in the early lives of massive stars. This most
          visible manifestation of massive star formation begins when the
          Lyman  continuum  output  from the massive young stellar object
          becomes sufficient to ionize the surroundings from which it was
          born.  Knowledge  of  this  environment  is  gained  through an
          understanding  of  the  morphologies  of  UCHII  regions and we
          examine  the  latest  developments  in  deep  radio  and mid-IR
          imaging.  SPITZER data from the GLIMPSE survey are an important
          new  resource  in which PAH emission and the ionizing stars can
          be seen. We review the role played by strong stellar winds from
          the  central stars in sweeping out central cavities and causing
          the  limb-brightened  appearance.  A  range  of  evidence  from
          velocity  structure,  proper motions, the molecular environment
          and  recent  hydrodynamical  modeling  indicates  that cometary
          UCHII  regions  require a combination of champagne flow and bow
          shock  motion. Finally, we discuss the class of hyper-compact H
          II regions or broad recombination line objects. They are likely
          to  mark  the  transition  soon after the breakout of the Lyman
          continuum  radiation  from  the  young  star.  Models for these
          objects  are  presented,  including photo-evaporating disks and
          ionized  accretion  flows  that  are  gravitationally  trapped.
          Evolutionary  scenarios  tracing  young  massive  stars passage
          through these ionized phases are discussed.

          Light  curves  of  the  long-period  Algols are known for their
          complex  shape  (asymmetry  in  the  eclipse,  light variations
          outside   eclipse,  changes  from  cycle-to-cycle),  and  their
          interpretation  is not possible in the standard model of binary
          stars. Complex structures present in these active Algol systems
          could  be  studied  with  the  eclipse-mapping method which was
          successfully   applied   to   the   new   7-color   photometric
          observations  in  the  Geneva system of W Cru, belonging to the
          isolated  group  of these active Algols. Several cycles of this
          long-period  (198.5 days) eclipsing binary have been covered by
          observations.  We have used a modified Rutten's approach to the
          eclipse-mapping.  The  optimization  of the system's parameters
          and  the  recovery  of  the  disk  intensity  distribution  are
          performed  using  a  genetic algorithm (GA). It is found that a
          hot  component  is  hidden  in  the  thick accretion disk which
          confirms previous findings. The mass of the component, M1 = 8.2
          Ms  indicates  that  it  is  a mid-B type star. The mass-losing
          component  is  filling  its  critical  lobe which means it is a
          G-type  supergiant  with  a  mass  M2  =  1.6  Ms.  The disk is
          geometrically  very  extended and its outer radius is about 80%
          of the primary's critical lobe. A reconstructed image reveals a
          rather  clumpy  and  nonuniform  brightness  distribution of an
          accretion  disk  rim  in  this almost edge-on seen system. This
          clumpyness   accounts   for   light   curve   distortions   and
          asymmetries, as well as for secular changes.

          A  precise  derivation  of the evolution of the Tully Fisher is
          crucial  to  understand  the  interplay between dark matter and
          baryonic  matter  in  cosmological  models, Using 15 deployable
          integral   field  units  of  FLAMES/GIRAFFE  at  VLT,  we  have
          recovered  the  velocity  fields of 35 galaxies at intermediate
          redshift (0.4 < z < 0.75). This facility is able to recover the
          velocity  fields  of almost all the emission line galaxies with
          Iab  <=22.5  and  W_0(OII)>=15A In our sample, we find only 35%
          rotating  disks.  These  rotating  disks produce a Tully-Fisher
          relationship  (stellar  mass  or  M_K  versus  V_max) which has
          apparently  not  evolved in slope, zero point and scatter since
          z=0.6.  The only evolution found is a brightening of the B band
          luminosity  of  a  third  of  the  disks,  possibly  due  to an
          enhancement  of  the  star  formation.  The very large scatters
          found  in  previously  reported  Tully-Fisher  relationships at
          moderate  redshifts  are  caused by the numerous (65%) galaxies
          with  perturbed  or  complex kinematics. Those galaxies include
          minor  or major mergers, merger remnants and/or inflow/outflows
          and  their  kinematics  can  be  easily  misidentified  by slit
          spectroscopy. Their presence suggests a strong evolution in the
          dynamical properties of galaxies during the last 7 Gyrs.

          We   used   the   moderately   high   spectral   resolution  of
          FLAMES/GIRAFFE  (R=10000)  to  derive  electron  densities from
          [OII]  line  ratios in 6 galaxies at z~0.55. These measurements
          have  been  done  through  the  GIRAFFE multiple integral field
          units  and  are the very first mapping of electron densities in
          such  distant objects. This allows us to confirm an outflow and
          identify  the role of giant HII regions in galactic disks. Such
          measurements  could  be  used  in the future to investigate the
          nature  of the physical processes responsible for the high star
          formations rates observed in galaxies between z~0.4 and z~1.

          Title:  Consistency  between  deep  crustal  heating of strange
          stars in superbursters and soft X-ray transients
          Authors: Morten Stejner, Jes Madsen (University of Aarhus)
          Comments: Submitted to A&A
          Both  superbursters and soft X-ray transients probe the process
          of deep crustal heating in compact stars. It was recently shown
          that  the  transfer  of  matter from crust to core in a strange
          star can heat the crust and ignite superbursts provided certain
          constraints  on  the strange quark matter equation of state are
          fulfilled.  We derive corresponding constraints on the equation
          of  state  for  soft  X-ray transients assuming their quiescent
          emission  is  powered  in the same way, and further discuss the
          time dependence of this heating mechanism in transient systems.
          We  approach  this  using  a simple parametrized model for deep
          crustal heating in strange stars assuming slow neutrino cooling
          in  the core and blackbody photon emission from the surface.The
          constraints  derived  for  hot  frequently accreting soft X-ray
          transients  are always consistent with those for superbursters.
          The  colder  sources are consistent for low values of the quark
          matter   binding   energy,   heat   conductivity  and  neutrino
          emissivity.  The heating mechanism is very time dependent which
          may  help  to  explain cold sources with long recurrence times.
          Thus  deep  crustal  heating  in  strange  stars  can provide a
          consistent   explanation   for  superbursters  and  soft  X-ray
          transients.

          Aims.  The  aim  of this work is to identify and study spectral
          features in the quasar 3C 273 usually blended by its strong jet
          emission.  Method.  A  historic  minimum  in the sub-millimetre
          emission  of  3C  273  triggered  coordinated  multi-wavelength
          observations   in   June  2004.  X-ray  observations  from  the
          INTEGRAL,  XMM-Newton  and  RXTE satellites are complemented by
          ground-based    optical,   infrared,   millimetre   and   radio
          observations.  The  overall  spectrum  is  used  to  model  the
          infrared  and X-ray spectral components. Results. Three thermal
          dust  emission  components  are identified in the infrared. The
          dust  emission on scales from 1 pc to several kpc is comparable
          to  that  of  other  quasars,  as  expected  by AGN unification
          schemes.  The  observed weakness of the X-ray emission supports
          the hypothesis of a synchrotron self-Compton origin for the jet
          component.  There  is  a clear soft-excess and we find evidence
          for  a  very  broad  iron line which could be emitted in a disk
          around  a  Kerr  black hole. Other signatures of a Seyfert-like
          X-ray component are not detected.

          March 2006
          We  have carried out a detailed abundance analysis for a sample
          of  16  carbon stars found among candidate extremely metal-poor
          (EMP)  stars  from  the  Hamburg/ESO  Survey.  We find that the
          Fe-metallicities  for  the  cooler  C-stars (Teff ~ 5100K) have
          been  underestimated  by  a  factor  of ~10 by the standard HES
          survey  tools.  The  results  presented  here  provided crucial
          supporting  data  used  by  Cohen  et  al  (2006) to derive the
          frequency of C-stars among EMP stars.
          C-enhancement in these EMP C-stars appears to be independent of
          Fe-metallicity  and  approximately  constant  at ~1/5 the solar
          C/H.  The  mostly  low  C12/C13  ratios  (~4)  and  the  high N
          abundances  in  many of these stars suggest that material which
          has been through proton burning via the CN cycle comprises most
          of  the  stellar  envelope.  C-enhancement  is  associated with
          strong  enrichment of heavy nuclei beyond the Fe-peak for 12 of
          the 16 stars. The remaining C-stars from the HES, which tend to
          be  the most Fe-metal poor, show no evidence for enhancement of
          the heavy elements. Very high enhancements of lead are detected
          in  some of the C-stars with highly enhanced Ba. (We show that)
          the  s-process  is responsible for the enhancement of the heavy
          elements for the majority of the C-stars in our sample.
          We  suggest  that both the s-process rich and Ba-normal C-stars
          result  from  phenomena associated with mass transfer in binary
          systems. This leads directly to the progression from C-stars to
          CH  stars and then to Ba stars as the Fe-metallicity increases.

          Title: Starbursts near supermassive black holes: young stars in
          the Galactic Center, and gravitational waves in LISA band
          Authors: Yuri Levin (Leiden Observatory and Lorentz Institute)
          Comments:  11  pages.  Submitted  to  MNRAS  in  December, this
          version addresses referee's remarks
          We  propose  a  scenario  in  which  massive  stars  form  in a
          self-gravitating gaseous disc around a supermassive black hole.
          We  find  that  once  the surface density of the disc exceeds a
          critical  value,  the  disc  fragments  into  dense clumps. The
          clumps  accrete material from the remaining disc and merge into
          larger  clumps;  the upper mass of a merged clump is a few tens
          to  a  few  hundreds of solar mass. This picture fits well with
          the  observed  young stellar discs near the SgrA* black hole in
          the  Galactic Center. In particular, we show how the masses and
          spatial  distribution of the young stars, and the total mass in
          the Galactic Center discs can be explained. However, explaining
          the origin of the several young stars closest to the black hole
          (the  S-stars)  is  more problematic: their orbits are compact,
          eccentric,  and  have  random  orientation. We propose that the
          S-stars were born in a previous starburst(s), and then migrated
          through  their  parent  disc  via  type I or runaway migration.
          Their   orbits  were  then  randomized  by  the  Rauch-Tremaine
          resonant  relaxation.  We  then explore the consequences of the
          star-formation  scenario  for AGN discs, which are continuously
          resupplied  with  gas.  We  argue  that  some  compact remnants
          generated  by  the starburst will get embedded in the disc. The
          disc-born    stellar-mass    black    holes    will    interact
          gravitationally  with the massive accretion disc and be dragged
          towards  the  central  black  hole. Merger of a disc-born black
          hole  with  the  central  black  hole  will  produce a burst of
          gravitational  waves. If the central black hole is accreting at
          a rate comparable to the Eddington limit, the gas drag from the
          accretion disc will not alter significantly the dynamics of the
          final  year  of  merger,  and the gravitational waves should be
          observable by LISA.

          Title:  Swift  Observations of the highly X-ray variable Narrow
          Line Seyfert 1 galaxy RX J0148.3-2758

          Comments: 25 pages; submitted to the Astronomical Journal
          We  report  on  Swift observations of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1
          galaxy  (NLS1) RX J0148.3--2758. It was observed for 41.6 ks in
          2005  May and for 15.8 ks in 2005 December. On short as well as
          on  long  timescales  RX  J0148.3--2758  is  a  highly variable
          source.  It  doubles  its  X-ray  flux  within  18-25  ks.  The
          observation of 2005 December 09, which had a flux 4 times lower
          than  during  the  2005  May  observations, shows a significant
          hardening  of  the  X-ray  hardness  ratio  compared  with  the
          2005-May  and  2005-December  20/21  observations.  A  detailed
          analysis  of  the  X-ray spectra shows that we actually observe
          two  spectral  changes  in RX J0148.3-2758: First a decrease of
          the  soft  X-ray  component  between  2005 May and December 09,
          which  is  most  likely  due  to  an  increase of the intrinsic
          absorber  column,  and second a decrease of the hard X-ray flux
          in  the  December  20/21  observations. The soft X-ray spectral
          slope  $\alpha_{\rm X, soft}$=2.58$^{+0.15}_{-0.12}$ during the
          high  state in 2005 May agrees well with that measured by ROSAT
          (\axs=2.54\plm0.82).   In   contrast   to   the   strong  X-ray
          variability,  the  analysis  of  the Swift UVOT photometry from
          December   2005   of  RX  J0148.3--2758  shows  no  significant
          variability in any of the 6 UVOT filters. From the simultaneous
          X-ray  and  UV  observations  in  2005 December we measured the
          X-ray  loudness  alpha-ox  varies between alpha-ox=1.5 and 1.8.
          Our Swift observations of RX J0148.3-2758 demonstrate the great
          potential  the  multi-wavelength  observatory Swift has for AGN
          science. (shortened)

          We review advances in the theoretical and computational studies
          of  disk  winds,  jets  and  outflows including: the connection
          between  accretion and jets, the launch of jets from magnetized
          disks, the coupled evolution of jets and disks, the interaction
          of  magnetized  young  stellar  objects  with their surrounding
          disks  and  the  relevance  to  outflows, and finally, the link
          between  jet  formation  and  gravitational  collapse.  We also
          address  the  predictions  that  the  theory  makes  about  jet
          kinematics,  collimation, and rotation, that have recently been
          confirmed by high spatial and spectral resolution observations.
          Disk winds have a universal character that may account for jets
          and  outflows  during the formation of massive stars as well as
          brown dwarfs.

          Title:  CB17:  Inferring  the dynamical history of a prestellar
          core with chemo-dynamical models
          Authors: Ya. Pavlyuchenkov, D. Wiebe, R. Launhardt, Th. Henning
          Comments: ApJ, in press
          We  present  a  detailed  theoretical study of the isolated Bok
          globule  CB17  (L1389)  based  on spectral maps of CS, HCO$^+$,
          C$^{18}$O,    C$^{34}$S,    and    H$^{13}$CO$^+$    lines.   A
          phenomenological   model   of   prestellar  core  evolution,  a
          time-dependent   chemical   model,  and  a  radiative  transfer
          simulation  for molecular lines are combined to reconstruct the
          chemical and kinematical structure of this core. We developed a
          general  criterion  that  allows  to  quantify  the  difference
          between  observed  and  simulated  spectral maps. By minimizing
          this  difference, we find that very high and very low values of
          the  effective sticking probability $S$ are not appropriate for
          the  studied  prestellar  core. The most probable $S$ value for
          CB17  is  0.3--0.5. The spatial distribution of the intensities
          and  self-absorption  features  of  optically  thick  lines  is
          indicative   of   UV   irradiation  of  the  core.  By  fitting
          simultaneously  optically thin and optically thick transitions,
          we isolate the model that reproduces all the available spectral
          maps  to  a  reasonable accuracy. The line asymmetry pattern in
          CB17  is  reproduced  by a combination of infall, rotation, and
          turbulent  motions  with  velocities  $\sim0.05$  km  s$^{-1}$,
          $\sim0.1$ km s$^{-1}$, and $\sim0.1$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively.
          These   parameters   corresponds   to   energy  ratios  $E_{\rm
          rot}/E_{\rm     grav}\approx0.03$,     $E_{\rm    therm}/E_{\rm
          grav}\approx0.8$,  and  $E_{\rm  turb}/E_{\rm grav}\approx0.05$
          (the  rotation parameters are determined for $i=90^\circ$). The
          chemical  age  of the core is about 2 Myrs. In particular, this
          is  indicated  by the central depletion of CO, CS, and HCO$^+$.
          Based  on the angular momentum value, we argue that the core is
          going  to  fragment,  i.e.,  to  form a binary (multiple) star.

          Galaxies  selected at 170um by the ISO FIRBACK survey represent
          the   brightest   \~10%  of  the  Cosmic  Infrared  Background.
          Examining  their  nature  in  detail  is  therefore crucial for
          constraining  models  of  galaxy  evolution.  Here  we  combine
          Spitzer archival data with previous near-IR, far-IR, and sub-mm
          observations  of a representative sample of 22 FIRBACK galaxies
          spanning  three  orders of magnitude in infrared luminosity. We
          fit   a  flexible,  multi-component,  empirical  SED  model  of
          star-forming  galaxies  designed  to model the entire ~1-1000um
          wavelength  range.  The  fits are performed with a Markov Chain
          Monte   Carlo   (MCMC)   approach,   allowing   for  meaningful
          uncertainties  to  be  derived.  This  approach also highlights
          degeneracies  such  as between Td and beta, which we discuss in
          detail. From these fits and standard relations we derive: L_IR,
          L_PAH,  SFR,  tau_V, M_star, M_dust, Td, and beta. We look at a
          variety  of correlations between these and combinations thereof
          in  order to examine the physical nature of these galaxies. Our
          conclusions  are  supplemented  by morphological examination of
          the  sources,  and  comparison  with local samples. We find the
          bulk  of  our sample to be consistent with fairly standard size
          and  mass  disk  galaxies with somewhat enhanced star-formation
          relative to local spirals, but likely not bona fide starbursts.
          A few higher-z LIGs and ULIGs are also present, but contrary to
          expectation,  they  are  weak  mid-IR  emitters and overall are
          consistent  with  star-formation  over  an extended cold region
          rather than concentrated in the nuclear regions. We discuss the
          implications   of  this  study  for  understanding  populations
          detected  at  other wavelengths, such as the bright 850um SCUBA
          sources or the faint Spitzer 24um sources.

          Type  II  quasars  are  luminous  Active  Galactic Nuclei whose
          centers  are obscured by large amounts of gas and dust. In this
          paper we present 3-band HST images of nine type II quasars with
          redshifts  0.2  <  z  < 0.4 selected from the Sloan Digital Sky
          Survey  based  on their emission line properties. The intrinsic
          luminosities  of these AGN are estimated to be -24 > M_B > -26,
          but  optical  obscuration  allows  their  host  galaxies  to be
          studied  unencumbered  by  bright  nuclei. Each object has been
          imaged  in  three continuum filters (`UV', `blue' and `yellow')
          placed between the strong emission lines. The spectacular, high
          quality  images  reveal a wealth of details about the structure
          of  the  host  galaxies and their environments. Six of the nine
          galaxies  in  the  sample  are  ellipticals with de Vaucouleurs
          light  profiles,  one  object has a well-defined disk component
          and  the remaining two have marginal disks. Stellar populations
          of  type  II  quasar  hosts  are  more luminous (by a median of
          0.3-0.7  mag,  depending on the wavelength) and bluer (by about
          0.4 mag) than are M* galaxies at the same redshift. When smooth
          fits  to  stellar light are subtracted from the images, we find
          both positive and negative residuals that become more prominent
          toward   shorter   wavelengths.  We  argue  that  the  negative
          residuals  are  due  to  kpc-scale dust obscuration, while most
          positive  residuals  are  due  to  the  light  from the nucleus
          scattered   off  interstellar  material  in  the  host  galaxy.
          Scattered  light  makes a significant contribution to the broad
          band  continuum  emission  and can be the dominant component of
          the extended emission in the UV in extreme cases.

          We  present  the  results of a second epoch of 18cm global Very
          Long-Baseline  Interferometry  (VLBI) observations, taken on 23
          February   2001,  of  the  central  kiloparsec  of  the  nearby
          starburst   galaxy   Messier  82.  These  observations  further
          investigate  the  structural  and  flux  evolution  of the most
          compact  radio  sources  in  the central region of M82. The two
          most  compact  radio  objects  in  M82  have  been investigated
          (41.95+575  and  43.31+592). Using this recent epoch of data in
          comparison  with  our previous global VLBI observations and two
          earlier epochs of European VLBI Network observations we measure
          expansion   velocities   in  the  range  of  1500-2000km/s  for
          41.95+575,  and  9000-11000km/s  for  43.31+592  using  various
          independent   methods.   In  each  case  the  measured  remnant
          expansion   velocities   are   significantly  larger  than  the
          canonical  expansion  velocity  (500km/s) of supernova remnants
          within M82 predicted from theoretical models.
          In  this  paper  we  discuss the implications of these measured
          expansion   velocities   with   respect  to  the  high  density
          environment  that  the SNR are expected to reside in within the
          centre of the M82 starburst.

          We  present  the results of a five-day monitoring campaign with
          XMM-Newton  of six X-ray bright young stellar objects (YSOs) in
          the  star-forming  complex  L1551  in Taurus. All stars present
          significant  variability on the five-day time scale. Modulation
          of  the  light  curve on time scales comparable with the star's
          rotational  period  appeared  to  be present in the case of one
          weak-lined   T  Tauri  star.  Significant  spectral  variations
          between the 2000 and the 2004 observations were detected in the
          (unresolved)  classical  T  Tauri  binary  system XZ Tau: a hot
          plasma  component  which  was  present in the X-ray spectrum in
          2000  had  significantly  weakened  in  2004.  As  XZ Tau N was
          undergoing  a  strong  optical  outburst  in  2000,  which  had
          terminated   since   then,   we   speculate   on  the  possible
          relationship  between  episodic,  burst  accretion,  and  X-ray
          heating.  The transition object HL Tau underwent a strong flare
          with a complex temperature evolution, which is indicative of an
          event  confined  within  a  very  large magnetic structure (few
          stellar  radii), similar to the ones found in YSOs in the Orion
          Nebula Cluster.

          properties of the dwarf nova SS UMi

          Astrophysics
          We  report  on  extensive photometry of the dwarf nova SS Ursae
          Minoris  throughout  nine months of 2004. In total, we recorded
          two  superoutbursts and 11 normal outbursts of the star. SS UMi
          has  been  known  to  show  frequent superoutbursts with a mean
          interval  of  84.7  days.  Our  data  suggest that the interval
          between  successive  superoutbursts  lengthened  to  197  days,
          indicating  that  SS UMi entered a period of untypical behavior
          manifested  by  a growth in the quiescent magnitude of the star
          and  a  series  of  frequent,  low-amplitude,  normal outbursts
          observed from July to September 2004.
          The   mean   superhump   period  derived  for  the  April  2004
          superoutburst  of  SS  UMi  is 0.070149(16) days (101.015 min).
          Combining   this   value   with   an   earlier  orbital  period
          determination,  we were able to derive the period excess, which
          is  equal  to  3.5 +/- 1.6%, and estimate the mass ratio of the
          binary system as equal to q=0.16 +/- 0.07.
          During the entire superoutburst, the period decreased at a rate
          of  $\dot  P/P_{\rm  sh}  = -6.3(1.4) \times 10^{-5}$. However,
          detailed  analysis  of  the timings of superhump maxima seem to
          suggest  a  more  complex period change, with a decrease in the
          period  during  the  first and last stages of the superoutburst
          but an increase in the middle interval.

          Letters
          We  report  on  the  discovery  of  several  compact regions of
          mid-infrared emission in the starforming circum nuclear disk of
          the  starburst/Seyfert2  galaxy NGC7582. The compact sources do
          not   have  counterparts  in  the  optical  and  near-infrared,
          suggesting  that  they  are deeply embedded in dust. We use the
          [NeII]12.8  micron  line  emission  to  estimate  the  emission
          measure of the ionized gas, which in turn is used to assess the
          number  of  ionizing  photons.  Two of the brighter sources are
          found  to  have  ionizing  fluxes  of  ~2.5x10^52,  whereas the
          fainter  ones have ~1x10^52 photons/s. Comparing with a one Myr
          old starburst, we derive stellar masses in the range (3-5)x10^5
          Msun,  and  find  that  the  number  of O-stars in each compact
          source  is  typically  (0.6-1.6)x10^3.  We  conclude  that  the
          compact  mid-infrared  sources are likely to be young, embedded
          star  clusters,  of  which  only  a  few  are known so far. Our
          observation   highlights   the   need   for   high   resolution
          mid-infrared  imaging  to  discover  and  study  embedded  star
          clusters in the proximity of active galactic nuclei.

          Comments: 7 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          The  intermediate polar PQ Geminorum shows a complex pulsation,
          caused  by  a  spinning white dwarf, which varies markedly with
          wavelength.  We  report  XMM-Newton observations, including the
          soft  and hard X-ray bands and the first UV lightcurves of this
          star.  We  update the ephemeris for PQ Gem allowing us to align
          these  data  with a compilation of lightcurves from the optical
          to the X-ray. Building on work by previous authors, we show how
          a  model  in  which  accretion  flows along skewed field lines,
          viewed  at  the  correct  inclination,  can  explain  the major
          features  of  the  lightcurves in all bands. We discuss how the
          skew  of  the  field  lines relates to the spinning down of the
          white-dwarf rotation.

          Title:  Cosmic  Evolution  of Black Holes and Spheroids. I: The
          M_BH-sigma Relation at z=0.36

          Comments: ApJ, accepted, 31 pages, 13 figures
          We  test  the  evolution  of the correlation between black hole
          mass and bulge velocity dispersion (M$_{\rm BH}-\sigma$), using
          a  carefully  selected  sample  of  14  Seyfert  1  galaxies at
          $z=0.36\pm0.01$.  We  measure  velocity dispersion from stellar
          absorption  lines  around  Mgb (5175\AA) and Fe (5270\AA) using
          high  S/N  Keck  spectra, and estimate black hole mass from the
          H$\beta$  line  width  and  the  optical luminosity at 5100\AA,
          based on the empirically calibrated photo-ionization method. We
          find a significant offset from the local relation, in the sense
          that  velocity  dispersions  were  smaller for given black hole
          masses at $z=0.36$ than locally. We investigate various sources
          of  systematic uncertainties and find that those cannot account
          for  the  observed  offset. The measured offset is $\Delta \log
          M_{\rm   BH}=0.62   \pm  0.10  \pm  0.25$,  i.e.  $\Delta  \log
          \sigma=0.15  \pm 0.03 \pm 0.06$, where the error bars include a
          random component and an upper limit to the systematics. At face
          value,  this  result  implies a substantial growth of bulges in
          the  last  4  Gyr,  assuming that the local M$_{\rm BH}-\sigma$
          relation  is  the  universal evolutionary end-point. Along with
          two  samples  of  active  galaxies with consistently determined
          black  hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion taken from the
          literature,  we  quantify  the observed evolution with the best
          fit linear relation, $\Delta \log M_{\rm BH} = (1.66\pm0.43)z +
          (0.04\pm0.09)$  with  respect  to  the  local  relationship  of
          Tremaine   et  al.  (2002),  and  $\Delta  \log  M_{\rm  BH}  =
          (1.55\pm0.46)z   +  (0.01\pm0.12)$  with  respect  to  that  of
          Ferrarese  (2002). This result is consistent with the growth of
          black  holes predating the final growth of bulges at these mass
          scales ($<\sigma>$=170 km s$^{-1}$).

          Shortly after the discovery of the binary system PSR J0737-3039
          we  predicted  that  it has a small proper motion and suggested
          that  this  implies  that  the  progenitor  mass of the younger
          pulsar  (B)  must be around 1.45M_sun. This is in contradiction
          to  standard  evolutionary  scenarios  that  suggest  a He-star
          progenitor  with  M  >2.1-2.3M_sun  and  in sharp contrast to a
          velocity  of ~100 km/s predicted by these models. It requires a
          new  previously  unseen  type  of  gravitational  collapse. Our
          (generally  ignored)  prediction  of  a low peculiar motion was
          confirmed later by pulsar timing observations that found v_\bot
          <  30  km/s.  Recently  Willems et al. put forward an elaborate
          simulation  suggesting that in spite of these observations, the
          most   likely  natal  kick  is  large  (50-170  km/s)  and  the
          corresponding  most likely progenitor mass is large as well. We
          refute  this  claim  and  show  that  Willems et al. implicitly
          assume the result that they obtain.

          Comments: 14 pages, ApJ accepted
          Potential  condensed  clouds  of  gas  in the Galactic halo are
          examined  in  the  context  of  the  recent  models of cooling,
          fragmenting clouds building up the baryonic mass of the Galaxy.
          582  high-velocity  clouds  (HVCs) are defined as the potential
          infalling,  condensed  clouds  and  the  sample's  spatial  and
          velocity  distribution  are presented. With the majority of the
          hydrogen  in  the  clouds  ionized  (~85%),  the  clouds  at  a
          distribution  of distances within 150 kpc, and their individual
          total  masses  below  10^7  Msun, the total mass in potentially
          condensed  clouds  is  1.1  -  1.4  x 10^9 Msun. If the tighter
          distance  constraint  of  <  60  kpc is adopted this mass range
          drops  to  4.5  -  6.1  x  10^8  Msun.  The implications on the
          condensing  cloud  models,  as  well as feedback and additional
          accretion methods, are discussed.

          Expansion  velocities  (Vexp) of different ions and line widths
          at  the  base of the lines are measured and analyzed for 24 PNe
          with  [WC]-type  nuclei  (WRPNe), 9 PNe ionized by WELS (WLPNe)
          and  14  ordinary  PNe.  A comparative study of the kinematical
          behavior  of the sample clearly demonstrates that WRPNe have in
          average  40-45%  larger Vexp, and possibly more turbulence than
          WLPNe  and  ordinary  PNe. WLPNe have velocity fields very much
          alike  the ones of ordinary PNe, rather than the ones of WRPNe.
          All  the samples (WRPNe, WLPNe and ordinary PNe) show expansion
          velocities  increasing  with age indicators, for example <Vexp>
          is  larger  for  low-density  nebulae and also it is larger for
          nebulae  around high-temperature stars. This age effect is much
          stronger for evolved WRPNe, suggesting that the [WC] winds have
          been  accelerating  the  nebulae  for  a  long  time, while for
          non-WRPNe the acceleration seems to stop at some point when the
          star  reaches  a  temperature of about 90,000-100,000 K. Non-WR
          nebulae  reach  a  maximum  Vexp  < 30 km/s while evolved WRPNe
          reach  maximum  Vexp  of about 40 km/s. For all kind of objects
          (WRPNe  and  non-WRPNe) it is found that in average Vexp(N+) is
          slightly  larger  than  Vexp(O++),  indicating that the nebulae
          present acceleration of the external shells.

          The ultraluminous x-ray source (ULX) in the galaxy M82 has been
          identified  as a possible intermediate-mass black hole. We have
          found  that  the  x-ray  flux  from  M82  is  modulated  with a
          peak-to-peak amplitude corresponding to an isotropic luminosity
          of  2.4x10^40  erg/s  in M82 and a period of 62.0 +/- 2.5 days,
          which  we  interpret  as  the orbital period of the ULX binary.
          This  orbital period implies that the mass-donor star must be a
          giant  or  supergiant. Large mass-transfer rates, sufficient to
          fuel  the  ULX, are expected for a giant-phase mass donor in an
          x-ray  binary. The giant phase has a short lifetime, indicating
          that we see the ULX in M82 in a brief and unusual period of its
          evolution.

          We  have  studied  the  infrared  properties  of  the brightest
          cluster  galaxies (BCGs) located in the cores of X-ray-luminous
          clusters  at  0.15 < z < 0.35. The majority of the BCGs are not
          particularly  infrared-luminous  compared  with  other  massive
          early-type  galaxies,  suggesting  that the cluster environment
          has  little influence on the infrared luminosities of the BCGs.
          The   exceptions,   however,   are   the   BCGs  in  the  three
          X-ray-brightest  clusters  in  the  sample,  A1835,  Z3146, and
          A2390.  These  BCGs have a prominent far-infrared peak in their
          spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and two of them (those in
          A1835  and  Z3146)  can  be  classified  as  luminous  infrared
          galaxies (LIRGs: L_{IR} > 10^{11} L_{sun}). Although radio AGNs
          are  found  to  be  prevalent  among  the  BCGs,  the  infrared
          luminosities  of these three BCGs, judged from the infrared SED
          signatures,  are  likely  to  be  powered  by  star  formation.
          Considering  the  overall  trend  that  clusters  with  shorter
          radiative gas cooling times harbor more infrared-luminous BCGs,
          the  enhanced  star  formation  may  be  caused  by the cooling
          cluster gas accreting onto the BCGs.

          Title: Annihilation Emission from the Galactic Black Hole
          Authors: K. S. Cheng, D. O. Chernyshov, V. A. Dogiel
          Comments: Accepted by ApJ on March 24, 2006
          Both   diffuse   high   energy   gamma-rays   and  an  extended
          electron-positron annihilation line emission have been observed
          in the Galactic Center (GC) region. Although X-ray observations
          indicate  that  the  galactic  black hole Sgr A$^*$ is inactive
          now,  we  suggest  that  Sgr  A$^*$  can  become  active when a
          captured  star is tidally disrupted and matter is accreted into
          the  black hole. As a consequence the galactic black hole could
          be  a  powerful  source of relativistic protons. We are able to
          explain  the  current  observed diffuse gamma-rays and the very
          detailed  511  keV  annihilation line of secondary positrons by
          $p-p$  collisions  of  such protons, with appropriate injection
          times and energy. Relativistic protons could have been injected
          into  the  ambient  material  if  the  black  hole  captured  a
          50M$_\odot$   star  at  several  tens  million  years  ago.  An
          alternative  possibility  is  that  the black hole continues to
          capture  stars  with  $\sim$1M$_\odot$  every  hundred thousand
          years.  Secondary  positrons  produced  by  $p-p$ collisions at
          energies  $\ga  30$  MeV are cooled down to thermal energies by
          Coulomb  collisions,  and  annihilate  in  the warm neutral and
          ionized  phases  of  the  interstellar medium with temperatures
          about   several  eV,  because  the  annihilation  cross-section
          reaches  its  maximum at these temperatures. It takes about ten
          million  years  for  the  positrons  to  cool  down  to thermal
          temperatures  so  they  can  diffuse into a very large extended
          region  around  the  Galactic  center.  A much more recent star
          capture may be also able to account for recent TeV observations
          within  10  pc  of  the  galactic  center  as  well  as for the
          unidentified  GeV  gamma-ray  sources found by EGRET at GC. The
          spectral difference between the GeV flux and the TeV flux could
          be explained naturally in this model as well.

          Title:   A  model  for  the  metallicity  evolution  of  damped
          Lyman-alpha systems
          Authors: P.H. Johansson (IoA), G.Efstathiou (IoA)
          Comments: 18 pages, 12 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  apply  a  physically  motivated  stellar  feedback model to
          analyse   the  statistical  properties  of  damped  Lyman-alpha
          systems  (DLAs)  expected  in  the concordance cold dark matter
          (CDM)    model.    Our   feedback   model   produces   extended
          low-metallicity cold gaseous discs around small galaxies. Since
          the space density of galaxies with low circular speeds is high,
          these  discs  dominate the cross-section for the identification
          of  DLAs  at  all  redshifts.  The  combined  effects  of  star
          formation,  outflows  and  infall  in our models result in mild
          evolution  of  the  N_{HI}-weighted metallicity content in DLAs
          with  redshift,  consistent with observations. According to our
          model,  DLAs  contribute  only  a  small fraction of the volume
          averaged star formation rate at redshifts z \simlt 5. Our model
          predicts  weak  evolution in Omega_{HI} over the redshift range
          z=0-5.  Furthermore, we show that the cosmological evolution of
          Omega_{HI}  and  the  cosmic  star  formation  rate are largely
          disconnected and conclude that the evolution of Omega_{HI} as a
          function  of  redshift is more likely to tell us about feedback
          processes  and the evolution of the outer gaseous components of
          small galaxies than about the cosmic history of star formation.

          Title: Discovery of an Optically Thick, Edge-on Disk around the
          Herbig Ae star PDS 144N
          Authors: Marshall D. Perrin, Gaspard Duchene, Paul Kalas, James
          R. Graham
          Comments:   Accepted   for  publication  in  the  Astrophysical
          Journal. 31 pages, 6 figures
          We  have  discovered  an optically thick, edge-on circumstellar
          disk  around  a  Herbig  Ae  star in the binary system PDS 144,
          providing  the  first  intermediate-mass  analog  of HK Tau and
          similar T Tauris. This system consists of a V ~ 13 mag. primary
          and  a  fainter  companion,  with spectra of both stars showing
          evidence for circumstellar disks and accretion; both stars were
          classified  as  Herbig Aes by the Pico dos Dias survey. In Lick
          adaptive  optics  polarimetry,  we  resolved extended polarized
          light  scattered  from  dust around the northern star. Followup
          Keck  adaptive  optics  and mid-infrared observations show that
          this  star is entirely hidden by an optically thick disk at all
          wavelengths  from  1.2  to  11.7  microns.  The disk major axis
          subtends  ~  0.8"  on  the  sky, corresponding to ~ 800 AU at a
          distance of 1000 pc. Bright "wings" extend 0.3" above and below
          the disk ansae, due most likely to scattering from the edges of
          an  outflow  cavity in a circumstellar envelope. We discuss the
          morphology of the disk and the spectral energy distributions of
          the  two  PDS  144  stars, present preliminary disk models, and
          identify  a number of open questions regarding this fascinating
          system.

          Title:  Line  profiles of water for the photon dominated region
          and embedded sources in the S140 region
          Authors: D. R. Poelman, M. Spaans
          A  radiative  transfer  method  for  the treatment of molecular
          lines  is  presented. We apply this method to previous SWAS and
          ISO  observations of water vapor in the source S140 in order to
          make  models  to  plan  for, and to interpret, HIFI data. Level
          populations  are calculated with the use of a three-dimensional
          (multi-zone)   escape   probability  method  and  with  a  long
          characteristic code that uses Monte Carlo techniques with fixed
          directions.  Homogeneous  and  inhomogeneous models are used to
          compute  the differences between water line profiles across the
          S140  region.  We  find that when an outflow or infall velocity
          field  with  a  gradient  of  a  few  kms^{-1} is adopted, line
          profiles with a FWHM of 6 kms^{-1} are found, in agreement with
          observations.  Inhomogeneous  models  are favoured to produce a
          single-peaked  line profile. When zooming in on smaller regions
          within the PDR, the shapes of the line profiles start to differ
          due  to  the  different  temperature  and density distributions
          there. The embedded sources are traced by high excitation lines
          of,   e.g.,  3_{21}-2_{21},  3_{03}-2_{12},  2_{12}-1_{01}  and
          2_{20}-1_{11}.  The computed intensities are roughly consistent
          with  existing ISO observations. Water emission in a PDR source
          like  S140 requires a combination of a pure PDR and an embedded
          source  in order to match the observations. Because of its good
          angular  resolution, HIFI will be able to distinguish between a
          dense  star  forming region or a more diffuse gas component. It
          is   therefore  important  for  future  observing  programs  to
          consider   both   in   their   predictions   of   the  emission
          characteristics of water in these environments.

          Title: The Rotation of Young Low-Mass Stars and Brown Dwarfs
          Authors: W. Herbst, J. Eisloeffel, R. Mundt, A. Scholz
          Comments:  Review chapter for Protostars and Planets V. 15 page
          and 8 figures
          We  review  the  current  state of our knowledge concerning the
          rotation  and  angular  momentum  evolution  of  young  stellar
          objects  and  brown  dwarfs from a primarily observational view
          point.  Periods  are typically accurate to 1% and available for
          about  1700  stars  and  30  brown  dwarfs  in  young clusters.
          Discussion   of   angular   momentum  evolution  also  requires
          knowledge of stellar radii, which are poorly known for pre-main
          sequence  stars. It is clear that rotation rates at a given age
          depend  strongly on mass; higher mass stars (0.4-1.2 M$_\odot$)
          have  longer periods than lower mass stars and brown dwarfs. On
          the  other  hand,  specific  angular  momentum is approximately
          independent  of  mass  for low mass pre-main sequence stars and
          young brown dwarfs. A spread of about a factor of 30 is seen at
          any given mass and age. The evolution of rotation of solar-like
          stars  during  the first 100 Myr is discussed. A broad, bimodal
          distribution  exists at the earliest observable phases ($\sim$1
          Myr)  for  stars  more  massive  than  0.4 M$_\odot$. The rapid
          rotators  (50-60% of the sample) evolve to the ZAMS with little
          or no angular momentum loss. The slow rotators continue to lose
          substantial  amounts  of  angular  momentum  for  up  to 5 Myr,
          creating  the  even broader bimodal distribution characteristic
          of  30-120 Myr old clusters. Accretion disk signatures are more
          prevalent   among  slowly  rotating  PMS  stars,  indicating  a
          connection  between  accretion  and  rotation.  Disks appear to
          influence  rotation for, at most, $\sim$5 Myr, and considerably
          less than that for the majority of stars. If the dense clusters
          studied  so  far  are  an  accurate  guide,  then  the  typical
          solar-like  star  may  have  only $\sim$1 Myr for this task. It
          appears  that both disk interactions and stellar winds are less
          efficient at braking these objects.

          Title:  The Importance of Phase in Nulling Interferometry and a
          Three Telescope Closure-Phase Nulling Interferometer Concept
          Authors: W. C. Danchi, J. Rajagopal, M. Kuchner, J. Richardson,
          D. Deming
          We  discuss  the theory of the Bracewell nulling interferometer
          and  explicitly demonstrate that the phase of the "white light"
          null  fringe is the same as the phase of the bright output from
          an ordinary stellar interferometer. As a consequence a "closure
          phase"  exists  for a nulling interferometer with three or more
          telescopes.  We  calculate  the  phase  offset as a function of
          baseline  length  for an Earth-like planet around the Sun at 10
          pc,  with  a  contrast  ratio  of  $10^{-6}$  at 10 $\mu$m. The
          magnitude  of  the  phase  due  to the planet is $\sim 10^{-6}$
          radians, assuming the star is at the phase center of the array.
          Although  this  is  small,  this  phase  may be observable in a
          three-telescope   nulling   interferometer  that  measures  the
          closure    phase.    We    propose   a   simple   non-redundant
          three-telescope  nulling  interferometer  that can perform this
          measurement.  This  configuration  is expected to have improved
          characteristics   compared   to  other  nulling  interferometer
          concepts,  such  as  a  relaxation  of  pathlength  tolerances,
          through  the  use  of  the  "ratio of wavelengths" technique, a
          closure phase, and better discrimination between exodiacal dust
          and planets.

          Effects in the Perturbed Keplerian Motion
          Authors: Lszl . Gergely, Zoltn Keresztes, Balzs Mikczi
          Binary  systems  subject  to  generic  perturbations  evolve on
          quasiperiodic  orbits.  We  derive  the  most  generic class of
          perturbations   (including   both   the   Brumberg   force  and
          gravitational  radiation reaction to sufficiently high orders),
          which allow to evaluate secular effects via generalized complex
          true  and  eccentric  anomaly parameters, by use of the residue
          theorem. We illustrate the power of the method by computing the
          self-spin  contributions  to  the gravitational luminosity of a
          compact binary.

          objects  are  detected  in all four IRAC bands, of which ~2,000
          are  associated with X-ray sources. We also study X-ray fainter
          sources  using  stacking techniques, and find that X-ray fluxes
          are  highest  for objects with IRAC colors that are known to be
          characteristic  of  AGNs. Because these are shallow, wide-field

          M. S. Yun
          We  present  a  hierarchical  galaxy  formation model which can
          account for the number counts of sources detected through their
          emission  at sub-millimetre wavelengths. The first stage in our
          approach  is  an  ab  initio  calculation of the star formation
          histories  for  a  representative  sample of galaxies, which is
          carried  out  using  the semi-analytical galaxy formation model
          GALFORM. These star formation histories are then input into the
          spectro-photometric  code  GRASIL, to produce a spectral energy
          distribution  for each galaxy. Dust extinction and emission are
          treated  self  consistently  in  our  model,  without having to
          resort to ad-hoc assumptions about the amount of attenuation by
          dust  or  the  temperature at which the dust radiates. We argue
          that  it is necessary to modify the form of the stellar initial
          mass  function  in  starbursts  in  order to match the observed
          number of sub-mm sources, if we are to retain the previous good
          matches  enjoyed  between observations and model predictions in
          the local universe. We also list some other observational tests
          that have been passed by our model.

          We  present  the first systematic study of (non-radio-selected)
          radio-loud    narrow-line    Seyfert    1    (NLS1)   galaxies.
          Cross-correlation  of  the  `Catalogue  of  Quasars  and Active
          Nuclei'  with  several  radio and optical catalogues led to the
          identification  of  11  radio-loud  NLS1 candidates including 4
          previously  known  ones.  Most  of  the  radio-loud  NLS1s  are
          compact,  steep  spectrum sources accreting close to, or above,
          the  Eddington  limit.  The  radio-loud NLS1s of our sample are
          remarkable  in  that  they occupy a previously rarely populated
          regime  in  NLS1  multi-wavelength parameter space. While their
          [OIII]/H_beta and FeII/H_beta intensity ratios almost cover the
          whole  range  observed in NLS1 galaxies, their radio properties
          extend  the  range  of  radio-loud  objects to those with small
          widths of the broad Balmer lines. Among the radio-detected NLS1
          galaxies,  the  radio  index R distributes quite smoothly up to
          the  critical  value  of  R  ~  10 and covers about 4 orders of
          magnitude  in  total.  Statistics  show  that  ~7%  of the NLS1
          galaxies are formally radio-loud while only 2.5% exceed a radio
          index   R   >   100.   Several  mechanisms  are  considered  as
          explanations  for  the  radio loudness of the NLS1 galaxies and
          for  the  lower  frequency  of  radio-louds  among  NLS1s  than
          quasars. While properties of most sources (with 2-3 exceptions)
          generally do not favor relativistic beaming, the combination of
          accretion   mode   and   spin  may  explain  the  observations.

          Title:   Testing   RIAF   model  for  Sgr  A*  using  the  size
          measurements
          Authors: Feng Yuan, Zhi-Qiang Shen, Lei Huang
          Comments: 10 pages, 1 figure; accepted by ApJL
          Recent  radio observations by the VLBA at 7 and 3.5 mm produced
          the  high-resolution images of the compact radio source located
          at   the  center  of  our  Galaxy--Sgr  A*,  and  detected  its
          wavelength-dependent  intrinsic  sizes  at the two wavelengths.
          This    provides   us   with   a   good   chance   of   testing
          previously-proposed theoretical models for Sgr A*. In this {\em
          Letter},  we  calculate  the  size  based  on  the  radiatively
          inefficient  accretion  flow  (RIAF)  model  proposed  by Yuan,
          Quataert  &  Narayan  (2003).  We find that the predicted sizes
          after  taking  into  account the scattering of the interstellar
          electrons  are  consistent  with  the  observations. We further
          predict  an  image  of  Sgr A* at 1.3 mm which can be tested by
          future observations.

          We   have   carried   out  Very  Large  Array  (VLA)  continuum
          observations  to  study  the  variability  of  Sgr A* at 43 GHz
          ($\lambda$=7mm)  and  22  GHz  ($\lambda$=13mm). A low level of
          flare  activity  has  been detected with a duration of $\sim$ 2
          hours  at these frequencies, showing the peak flare emission at
          43 GHz leading the 22 GHz peak flare by $\sim20$ to 40 minutes.
          The   overall   characteristics   of  the  flare  emission  are
          interpreted  in  terms of the van der Laan model by considering
          the   ejection   and  adiabatically  expansion  of  a  uniform,
          spherical  plasma blob due to flare activity. The observed peak
          of  the flare emission with a spectral index $\nu^{-\alpha}$ of
          $\alpha$=1.6  is  consistent  with the prediction that the peak
          emission    shifts    toward    lower    frequencies    in   an
          adiabatically-expanding  self-absorbed  source.  We present the
          expected synchrotron light curves for an expanding blob as well
          as  the  peak  frequency  emission  as a function of the energy
          spectral   index   constrained   by   the   available   flaring
          measurements  in  near-IR, sub-millimeter, millimeter and radio
          wavelengths.  The  blob  model is consistent with the available
          measurements.  If  expanding  material leaves the gravitational
          potential of Sgr A*, the total mass-loss rate of nonthermal and
          thermal particles is estimated to be
          $\sim2\times10^{-8}$\,M$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$.   We   discuss  the
          implication  of  the  mass-loss  rate  since this value matches
          closely with the estimated accretion rate based on polarization
          measurements.

          We  report  the  imaging  and spectroscopic localization of GRB
          060218  to  a  low-metallicity  dwarf  starburst  galaxy at z =
          0.03345  +/-  0.00006.  In  addition  to  making  it the second
          nearest gamma-ray burst known, optical spectroscopy reveals the
          earliest  detection  of  weak,  supernova-like  Si II near 5720
          Angstroms,  starting  1.95  days after the burst trigger. UBVRI
          photometry  obtained  between 1 and 26 days post-burst confirms
          the  early  rise  of  supernova light, and agrees with an upper
          limit Delta t < 159 s for the delay between the gamma-ray burst
          and   the  onset  of  the  supernova  explosion  if  the  early
          appearance  of  a  soft  component  in  the  X-ray  spectrum is
          understood  as  a  ``shock  breakout''. Together, these results
          verify the long-hypothesized origin of soft gamma-ray bursts in
          the deaths of massive stars.

          Fragment Production
          Authors: S. G. Mashnik, K. K. Gudima, M. I. Baznat
          Comments: 30 pages, 19 figures
          This paper presents part of an internal LANL Progress Report on
          completion  of  the  "S"  and  "G"  versions  of  the  improved
          Cascade-Exciton Model (CEM03.01) and the Los Alamos Quark-Gluon
          String  Model  (LAQGSM.03.01)  codes. The "S" versions consider
          fragmentation   of   compound   nuclei   produced   after   the
          preequilibrium stage of reactions for excitation energies above
          2A  MeV using the Statistical Multifragmentation Model (SMM) by
          Botvina  et  al.  ("S"  stands for SMM), while the "G" versions
          describe  evaporation/fission  stages  of  reactions  using the
          fission-like  binary-decay  model GEMINI of Charity et al. ("G"
          stands  for  GEMINI)  instead  of  using  the  the  Generalized
          Evaporation  Model  GEM2  of  Furihata  incorporated  into  the
          standard  versions  of these codes. We present here an analysis
          of  the  recent  660  MeV  p + 129I and 3.65 GeV p + 112Sn JINR
          measurements,  of  the  new COSY data on 1.2 GeV p + (13 nuclei
          from Al to Th), of the 300 MeV and 1 GeV p + 56Fe data measured
          at  GSI  in  inverse  kinematics,  and of the new GSI data on 1
          GeV/nucleon  124Xe  and  136Xe  +  Pb. To better understand the
          mechanisms   of   fragment   production,   we  discuss  several
          calculated  but  not-yet-measured  kinematic characteristics of
          products  of  these  reactions, which are predicted to be quite
          different  by  SMM,  GEMINI,  and GEM2. We find these kinematic
          quantities  to  be  potentially useful in differentiating these
          reaction   mechanisms   if  they  can  be  measured  in  future
          experiments.

          Title: Persistent Patterns in Accretion Disks
          Authors: Mustafa A. Amin, Andrei V. Frolov
          Comments: 4 pages, 5 figures; MNLaTeX 2.2
          We  present  a set of new characteristic frequencies associated
          with  accretion disks around compact objects. These frequencies
          arise  from  persistent  rotating patterns in the disk that are
          finite in radial extent and driven purely by the gravity of the
          central  body.  Their existence depends on general relativistic
          corrections  to  orbital motion and, if observed, could be used
          to probe the strong gravity region around a black hole. We also
          discuss  a  possible connection to the puzzle of quasi-periodic
          oscillations.

          Comments:  Twenty  pages,  thirteen figures; revised version as
          returned to MNRAS following minor comments from the referee
          We   analyse   absorption   line-strength   indices  for  ~3000
          red-sequence  galaxies  in  94  nearby clusters, to investigate
          systematic variations of their stellar content with location in
          the  host cluster. The data are drawn from the NOAO Fundamental
          Plane  Survey.  Our  adopted method is a generalization of that
          introduced by Nelan et al. to determine the global age-mass and
          metallicity-mass relations from the same survey. We find strong
          evidence for a change in galaxy properties, at fixed mass, over
          a  range  from  the cluster centre to the virial radius, R_200.
          For  example, red-sequence galaxies further out in the clusters
          have  weaker  Mgb5177  (at  ~8 sigma significance) and stronger
          Hbeta  and Hgamma absorption (~3 sigma, ~4 sigma) than galaxies
          of  the  same  velocity  dispersion  in  the cluster cores. The
          Fe5270  and  Fe5335  indices  show  only  very weak trends with
          radius.  Using  a  total  of  twelve  indices,  the  pattern of
          cluster-centric  gradients  is  considered  in  light  of their
          different  dependences on stellar age and chemical composition.
          The measured gradients for all twelve indices can be reproduced
          by  a  model in which red-sequence galaxies at ~1 R_200 have on
          average  younger  ages  (by  15+/-4%)  and  lower alpha-element
          abundance  ratios  (by  10+/-2%),  than  galaxies  of  the same
          velocity  dispersion  but  located near the cluster centre. For
          the  total  metallicity,  Z/H, no significant gradient is found
          (2+/-3%  larger at R_200 than in the core). The cluster-centric
          age  and  alpha/Fe  gradients  are  in  the  sense  expected if
          galaxies  in the cluster core were accreted at an earlier epoch
          than  those  at  larger  radii,  and  if this earlier accretion
          contributed to an earlier cessation of star formation. The size
          of  the  observed  age  trend is comparable to predictions from
          semi-analytic models of hierarchical galaxy formation.

          We  present  deep  Hubble  Space  Telescope  and  Spitzer Space
          Telescope  observations  of  the  host  galaxy of GRB 050904 at
          z=6.295.  The  host is detected in the H-band and marginally at
          3.6  micron.  From  these detections, and limits in the z'-band
          and  4.5  micron,  we  infer  an  extinction-corrected absolute
          magnitude,   M(UV)=-20.7   mag,  or  ~L*,  a  substantial  star
          formation  rate of 15 solar masses per year, and a stellar mass
          of  a  few  10^9  solar  masses.  A comparison to the published
          sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z>5.5 reveals
          that  the  host  of  GRB  050904  would  evade detection and/or
          confirmation  in  any of the current surveys due to the lack of
          detectable  Ly-alpha  emission,  which  is likely the result of
          dust  extinction  (A[1200]~1.5 mag). This suggests that not all
          luminous   starburst   galaxies  at  z~6  are  currently  being
          accounted  for.  Most  importantly,  using  the  metallicity of
          Z~0.05  solar  inferred from the afterglow absorption spectrum,
          our  observations indicate for the first time that the observed
          evolution  in  the  mass-  and luminosity-metallicity relations
          from  z=0  to  z~2  continues  on to z>6. The ease of measuring
          redshifts   and   metallicities  from  the  afterglow  emission
          suggests  that  in  tandem with the next generation ground- and
          space-based  telescopes,  a  GRB mission with dedicated near-IR
          follow-up  can  provide  unique information on the evolution of
          stars and galaxies through the epoch of re-ionization.

          Comments: 20 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  present  X-ray  observations  of the blazar Mrk501 obtained
          with  RXTE during 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2004. The goal of
          this study is twofold: 1) characterize the long-term X-ray flux
          and spectral variability of the source with a model-independent
          analysis,  and  2) investigate the X-ray and TeV correlation on
          long   timescales.   The   spectral  and  temporal  variability
          properties appear to be markedly different compared to those of
          non-jet-dominated radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN monitored with
          RXTE.   To   investigate  the  X-ray/TeV  correlation  on  long
          timescales  we  compared  RXTE  data  with  HEGRA  and  Whipple
          historical  light  curves.  We confirm the presence of a direct
          correlation,  which  appears  to be stronger when the source is
          brighter.  The  analysis  of  individual  flares shows that the
          X-ray\TeV  correlated  activity is heterogeneous. However, more
          sensitive  TeV  observations  are  necessary  to  confirm these
          findings,   and  to  put  tighter  constraints  on  jet  models
          (abridged).

          The  first  observations  conducted as part of the Chandra ACIS
          survey  of M 33 (ChASeM33) sampled the eclipsing X-ray binary M
          33  X-7 over a large part of the 3.45 d orbital period and have
          resolved  eclipse  ingress  and  egress for the first time. The
          occurrence  of  the  X-ray  eclipse  allows  us to determine an
          improved  ephemeris  of  mid-eclipse  and  binary period as HJD
          (2453639.119+-0.005)  +- N x (3.453014+-0.000020) and constrain
          the  eclipse  half  angle  to  (26.5+-1.1)  degree.  There  are
          indications  for  a shortening of the orbital period. The X-ray
          spectrum is best described by a disk blackbody spectrum typical
          for  black  hole  X-ray  binaries in the Galaxy. We find a flat
          power  density  spectrum  and no significant regular pulsations
          were  found  in  the frequency range of 10^{-4} to 0.15 Hz. HST
          WFPC2  images  resolve  the  optical  counterpart, which can be
          identified  as  an  O6III  star with the help of extinction and
          colour  corrections derived from the X-ray absorption. Based on
          the  optical light curve, the mass of the compact object in the
          system most likely exceeds 9 M_sun. This mass, the shape of the
          X-ray  spectrum  and  the  short  term  X-ray  time variability
          identify  M  33 X-7 as the first eclipsing black hole high mass
          X-ray binary.

          We  have  measured  the X-ray spectral properties of a complete
          flux-limited sample of bright AGNs from HEAO-1 all-sky catalogs
          to investigate their statistics and provide greater constraints
          on  the bright-end of the hard X-ray luminosity function (HXLF)
          of  AGNs  and  the  AGN population synthesis model of the X-ray
          background.  Spectral  studies using data from ASCA, XMM-Newton
          and/or  Beppo-SAX  observations  have  been made for almost all
          AGNs in this sample.
          The  spectral  measurements  enable us to construct the neutral
          absorbing  column  density  (Log  nH) distribution and separate
          HXLFs  for absorbed (Log nH[cm-2]> 21.5) and unabsorbed AGNs in
          the  local universe. Our results show evidence for a difference
          in  the shapes of HXLFs of absorbed and unabsorbed AGNs in that
          absorbed  AGN  HXLF  drops  more rapidly at higher luminosities
          than  that  of  unabsorbed  AGNs,  which  is  similar  to  that
          previously  reported.  In  the Lx - nH plot, we found no AGN in
          the   high-luminosity  high-intrinsic  absorption  regime  (Log
          Lx[erg/s]>  44.5,  Log  nH[cm-2]> 21.5) in our sample, where we
          expect  about  5 AGNs if we assume that absorbed and unabsorbed
          having  identical  AGN  HXLF  shapes.  We  also  find  that the
          observed flux with ASCA or XMM-Newton is smaller than that with
          HEAO-1  by  a  factor of 0.29 on average, which is expected for
          re-observation   of  sources  with  a  factor  2.5  variability
          amplitude scale.

          Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, submitted to MNRAS
          We  report  the  discovery  of  an X-ray transient, observed in
          outburst  with  XMM-Newton on March 20, 2003, and with position
          18h12m27.8s,  -18  12  34  (J2000, approximate positional error
          2"). No known source is present at this position and the source
          was not detected during published ROSAT or ASCA observations of
          that  region.  However,  the  source  may  be  associated  with
          1H1812-182  detected  by HEAO 1, although the error bars on the
          HEAO  1  position are very large and the two sources could also
          be    unrelated.   Therefore,   we   name   the   source   XMMU
          J181227.8-181234.  Initially, the source was not detected using
          the  All-Sky  Monitor  (ASM)  on-board  the  Rossi X-ray Timing
          Explorer,  however, reprocessing of the ASM data shows that the
          source  was  in  fact  detected  and it was active for about 50
          days.  The  X-ray  spectrum of this transient is fitted equally
          well by an absorbed power-law (with a spectral index of 2.5) or
          multi-colour  disk  blackbody model (with kT ~ 2 keV), where we
          find   that  the  source  is  highly  absorbed.  We  detect  an
          unabsorbed  0.5-10  keV flux in the range (2-5)E-9 ergs cm^{-2}
          s^{-1},  which  at  a distance of 8 kpc corresponds to a 0.5-10
          keV  luminosity  of  (1-4)E37  ergs  s^{-1}. No pulsations were
          detected  by  timing analysis. A colour-colour diagram from ASM
          data of different accreting objects suggests that the transient
          is  a  high-mass X-ray binary, as is also suggested by the high
          absorption  compared  to  the average interstellar value in the
          direction  of the source. However, the power-law spectral index
          is  far  more  typical of a low-mass X-ray binary. Thus, we are
          unable to conclusively identify the nature of the transient. We
          also  report  on  three  sources  first  detected  by  the ASCA
          Galactic Plane Survey that are close to this transient.

          We  combine emission line and X-ray luminosities for 45 sources
          from  the  Chandra  Deep  Field South (CDF-S), and seven HELLAS
          sources,  to  obtain  a new sample of 52 X-ray selected type-II
          active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Eighteen of our sources are very
          luminous   with   a   typical,  absorption-corrected  2-10  keV
          luminosity  of  few  10^{44} erg/sec (type-II QSOs). We compare
          the  emission  line properties of the new sources with emission
          line and X-ray luminosities of known low redshift, mostly lower
          luminosity  AGNs  by  using  a composite spectrum. We find that
          ${\rm L_{[OIII]}}$/${\rm L_{2-10}}$ and ${\rm L_{[OII]}}$/${\rm
          L_{2-10}}$   decrease   with   L(2-10   keV)  such  that  ${\rm
          L_{[OIII]}}/{\rm L_{2-10}} \propto {\rm L_{2-10}}^{-0.42}$. The
          trend  was  already evident, yet neglected in past low redshift
          samples.   This   lead   to   erroneous   calibration   of  the
          line-to-X-ray  luminosity  in earlier AGN samples. The analysis
          of  several  type-I samples shows the same trend with a similar
          slope but a median ${\rm L_{[OIII]}}$/${\rm L_{2-10}}$ which is
          larger  by  a  factor  of  about  two  compared  with optically
          selected  type-II  samples.  We  interpret this shift as due to
          additional  reddening in type-II sources and comment in general
          on  the  very  large extinction in many type-II objects and the
          significantly  smaller  average  reddening  of the SDSS type-II
          AGNs.  The decrease of ${\rm L_{[OIII]}}$/${\rm L_{2-10}}$ with
          L(2--10  keV)  is  large  enough  to suggest that a significant
          fraction  of  high  luminosity  high redshift type-II AGNs have
          very  weak  emission  lines  that may have escaped detection in
          large  samples.  A  related decrease of EW([OIII]) with optical
          continuum  luminosity  is demonstrated by an analysis of 12,000
          type-I SDSS AGNs.

          Title:  4U  1344-60:  a  bright  intermediate Seyfert galaxy at

          Comments: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics
          We present analysis of the optical and X-ray spectra of the low
          Galactic  latitude  bright  (F(2-10)  = 3.6 10^{-11} erg/cm2/s)
          source  4U 1344-60. On the basis of the optical data we propose
          to  classify  4U 1344-60 as an intermediate type Seyfert galaxy
          and we measure a value of z=0.012+/-0.001 for its redshift.
          From  the XMM-Newton observation we find that the overall X-ray
          spectral shape of 4U 1344-60 is complex and can be described by
          a  power-law  continuum  (Gamma ~ 1.55) obscured by two neutral
          absorption  components  (Nh(f)  ~ 10^{22} cm^{-2} and Nh(p) ~ 4
          10^{22}  cm^{-2}),  the  latter  covering  only the ~50% of the
          primary  X-ray source. The X-ray data therefore lend support to
          our  classification  of  4U  1344-60.  It  exhibits a broad and
          skewed  Fe Kalpha line at 6.4 keV, which suggests the existence
          of  an  accretion  disk  that  is able to reprocess the primary
          continuum  down  to  a  few  gravitational  radii.  Such a line
          represents  one of the clearest examples of a relativistic line
          observed  by  XMM-Newton so far. Our analysis has also revealed
          the marginal presence of two narrow line-like emission features
          at ~4.9 and ~5.2 keV.

          We  present  the results of optical identification of two X-ray
          sources from RXTE and INTEGRAL all sky surveys: XSS J00564+4548
          and    IGR   J00234+6141.   Using   the   optical   data   from
          Russian-Turkish   1.5-m  Telescope  (RTT150)  and  SWIFT  X-ray
          observations,  we  show  that  these  sources most probably are
          intermediate  polars,  i.e. binary systems with accreting white
          dwarfs   with   not  very  strong  magnetic  field  (<~10  MG).
          Periodical  oscillations of optical emission with periods 480 s
          and 570 s were found. We argue that these periods most probably
          correspond to the rotating periods of the white dwarfs in these
          systems.  Further optical observations scheduled at RTT150 will
          allow to study the parameters of these systems in more detail.

          Reconstruction of the spectral energy distribution (SED) during
          the  outburst.  The  Raman  scattering process. Results: At the
          initial stages of the outburst the hot object was characterized
          by the two-temperature spectrum (a warm stellar radiation and a
          strong  nebular  emission) with signatures of a mass-outflow at
          moderate   (100-200   km/s)  and  very  high  (1000-2000  km/s)
          velocities.  The  corresponding  structure  of  the  hot object
          consists  of  an  optically  thick,  slowly-expanding disk-like
          material  encompassing  the accretor at the orbital plane and a
          fast  optically  thin  wind  over  the remainder of the star. A
          striking  similarity  of  [FeVII]6087  and  Raman 6825 profiles
          at/after the dilution of the disk suggested their origin within
          the interaction zone where the winds from the binary components
          collide.

          Title:  Active Galactic Nuclei: Unification, Blazar Variability
          and the Radio Galaxy/Cosmology Interface
          Authors: Paul J. Wiita (Georgia State U.)
          Comments:  10 pages, 0 figures; to appear in J. Korean Physical
          Society;  summary  of  lectures  presented  at  the 2006 Winter
          School on Black Hole Astrophysics, Pohang, Korea
          We  first  review  some  basic properties of the most important
          classes  of  active  galactic  nuclei (AGN), including quasars,
          blazars, Seyfert galaxies and radio galaxies. The most commonly
          accepted  type  of  scheme  designed  to individually unify the
          radio-loud  and  radio-quiet  categories  of  AGN is based upon
          three  parameters:  black  hole  mass,  accretion rate, and our
          orientation  to  the  accretion flow. Some recent evidence from
          optical  microvariability  of  several classes of AGN points in
          favor   of   a  strong  unification  scheme  that  unites  both
          radio-loud  and  radio-quiet  categories. An important question
          concerning  the  nature  of  blazars  and  other  AGN whose jet
          emission    appears   to   dominate   their   spectral   energy
          distributions involves the velocities of those flows. A variety
          of  apparently  contradictory observations can be reconciled if
          such flows are ultrarelativistic but have an opening angle of a
          few  degrees.  Radio  galaxies (RGs) were much more numerous at
          redshifts  ~2 than they are today. Combining this fact with the
          realization that older RGs at such redshifts are very difficult
          to  detect,  and with cosmological simulations of the growth of
          structure  in  the universe has led us to propose that RG lobes
          have  impacted  a  significant  fraction  of  the cosmic web of
          baryons.  These  impacts  may  have  triggered  extensive  star
          formation  and  perhaps even engendered new galaxies; they also
          probably  played  important  roles in the spreading of magnetic
          fields and heavier elements into the intergalactic medium.

          Title:   Jet-dominated   advective  systems:  radio  and  X-ray
          luminosity dependence on the accretion rate
          Authors:    Elmar    Koerding    (Southampton),    Rob   Fender
          (Southampton), Simone Migliari (UCSD)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  present  a  novel  method  to measure the accretion rate of
          radio emitting X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei
          (AGN) independently of the X-ray luminosity. The radio emission
          of  the  jet  is used as a tracer for the accretion rate and is
          normalised using sources of known accretion rates: island state
          neutron  stars and efficiently radiating black holes close to a
          state  transition.  We show that the radio power in black holes
          and neutron stars is comparable for a given mass accretion rate
          and  verify  empirically  the  assumed  analytic scaling of the
          radio  luminosity with accretion rate. As our accretion measure
          is  independent  of  the  X-ray luminosities, we can search for
          radiatively  inefficient  accretion in black holes by comparing
          the X-ray luminosities with the accretion rate in XRBs and AGN.
          While  the  X-ray  luminosity  of efficiently radiating objects
          scales  linearly with accretion rate, the scaling of hard state
          black  holes  is  quadratical,  in  agreement  with theoretical
          models.   We  show  that  the  turnover  from  the  inefficient
          quadratic  scaling  to  the  linear  scaling  has  to  occur at
          accretion  rates  of 1-10 % Eddington both in XRBs and AGN. The
          comparison of both accretion states supports the idea that in a
          black  hole  in the hard state some accretion power is advected
          into  the  black  hole  while  the  jet power exceeds the X-ray
          luminosity:   these   are   therefore  jet-dominated  advective
          systems.

          We   discuss   spectral   energy   distributions,   photometric
          redshifts,   redshift   distributions,   luminosity  functions,
          source-counts  and the far infrared to optical luminosity ratio
          for  sources  in  the  SWIRE Legacy Survey. The spectral energy
          distributions  of  selected SWIRE sources are modelled in terms
          of  a  simple set of galaxy and quasar templates in the optical
          and  near  infrared,  and with a set of dust emission templates
          (cirrus,  M82 starburst, Arp 220 starburst, and AGN dust torus)
          in  the  mid infrared. The optical data, together with the IRAC
          3.6  and  4.5  mu data, have been used to determine photometric
          redshifts.  For  galaxies  with  known  spectroscopic redshifts
          there is a notable improvement in the photometric redshift when
          the  IRAC  data  are  used, with a reduction in the rms scatter
          from  10%  in (1+z) to 5%. While further spectroscopic data are
          needed to confirm this result, the prospect of determining good
          photometric  redshifts  for the 2 million extragalactic objects
          in  SWIRE  is  excellent.  The  distribution  of  the different
          infrared  sed  types  in  the  L{ir}/L{opt} versus L{ir} plane,
          where  L{ir} and L{opt} are the infrared and optical bolometric
          luminosities,  is discussed. Source-counts at 24, 70 and 160 mu
          are  discussed,  and  luminosity functions at 3.6 and 24 mu are
          presented.

          Title: Does Sgr A* Have an Intrinsic Magnetic Moment Instead of
          an Event Horizon?
          Authors: Stanley L. Robertson, Darryl J. Leiter
          Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure, to be submitted to ApJ Letters
          We  have previously developed a general relativistic model of a
          gravitationally   compact,  intrinsically  magnetic,  eternally
          collapsing  object (MECO). It has been shown to account for the
          low quiescent x-ray luminosities and spectral state switches in
          galactic   black   hole   candidates   (GBHC)  while  correctly
          predicting the radio/x-ray luminosity correlations of both GBHC
          and  active galactic nuclei. We show here that a MECO model for
          Sgr  A*  is  consistent  with  its  observed low NIR luminosity
          levels.  It has the unique property of providing an explanation
          for  observed polarizations in the context of an inverted polar
          jet  flow while reconciling the low luminosity of Sgr A* with a
          standard  Bondi accretion flow. Thus the conclusion that Sgr A*
          contains   a   black  hole  with  an  event  horizon  is  still
          unsubstantiated.

          Title:  Testing  Low-Mass  Stellar  Models:  Three New Detached
          Eclipsing Binaries below 0.75 Msun
          Authors: Mercedes Lopez-Morales, J. Scott Shaw
          Comments:  to  appear in the Proceedings of the 7th Pacific Rim
          Conference on Stellar Astrophysics, November 1--5, 2005, Sejong
          University, Seoul, Korea, ASP Conference Series, 2006
          Full  tests  to  stellar models below 1 Msun have been hindered
          until  now  by the scarce number of precise measurements of the
          stars'  most  fundamental  parameters:  their masses and radii.
          With   the   current  observational  techniques,  the  required
          precision to distinguish between different models (errors < 2-3
          %) can only be achieved using detached eclipsing binaries where
          1) both stars are similar in mass, i.e. q = M1/M2 ~ 1.0, and 2)
          each star is a main sequence object below 1 Msun.
          Until 2003 only three such binaries had been found and analyzed
          in  detail.  Two new systems were published in 2005 (Creevey et
          al.;  Lopez-Morales  &  Ribas),  almost  doubling  the previous
          number  of data points. Here we present preliminary results for
          3 new low-mass detached eclipsing binaries. These are the first
          studied systems from our sample of over 41 new binaries (Shaw &
          Lopez-Morales,  this  proceedings).  We also provide an updated
          comparison  between the Mass-Radius and the Mass-Teff relations
          predicted  by  the  models  and  the  observational  data  from
          detached eclipsing binaries.

          We  describe  our first attempt at modelling nucleosynthesis in
          massive AGB stars which have undergone core carbon burning, the
          super-AGB  stars.  We fit a synthetic model to detailed stellar

          and  extrapolate these fits to the end of the AGB. We determine

          mass    and    mass-loss    prescription.    Our    preliminary
          nucleosynthesis   calculations  show  that,  for  a  reasonable
          mass-loss  rate,  the effect of hot-bottom burning in super-AGB
          stars  on  the  integrated yield of a stellar population is not
          large.  There  are  many  uncertainties,  such as mass-loss and
          convective   overshooting,   which   prevent   accurate   yield
          calculations.    However,    as    potential   progenitors   of
          electron-capture  supernovae,  these stars may contribute 7% of
          non-type-Ia supernovae.

          Supergiant  high mass X-ray binaries (SGXBs) are believed to be
          rare  objects,  as  stars  in  the supergiant phase have a very
          short lifetime and to date only about a dozen of them have been
          discovered.  They  are  known to be persistent and bright X-ray
          sources.  INTEGRAL  is  changing  this classical picture as its
          observations  are  revealing  the presence of a new subclass of
          SGXBs  which  have  been  labelled  as  supergiant  fast  X-ray
          transients  (SFXTs)  as they are strongly characterized by fast
          X-ray outbursts lasting less than a day, typically a few hours.
          We  report  on  IBIS  detections of newly discovered fast X-ray
          outbursts  from  10  sources,  four of which have been recently
          optically identified as supergiant high mass X-ray binaries. In
          particular  for  one  of them, IGR J11215-5952, we observe fast
          X-ray transient behaviour for the first time. The remaining six
          sources  (IGR  J16479-4514, IGR J16418-4532, XTE J1743-363, IGR
          J16195-4945=AX  J161929-4945, AX J1749.1-2733, IGR J17407-2808)
          are  still  unclassified,  however  they  can  be considered as
          candidate SFXTs because of their similarity to the known SFXTs.

          Authors:  Prado Martin-Moruno, Jose A. Jimenez Madrid, Pedro F.

          The  Babichev-Dokuchaev-Eroshenko  model  for  the accretion of
          dark  energy  onto  black  holes has been extended to deal with
          black  holes  with non-static metrics. The possibility that for
          an  asymptotic  observer  a  black  hole  with  large mass will
          rapidly increase and eventually engulf the Universe at a finite
          time  in the future has been studied by using reasonable values
          for  astronomical  parameters.  It  is  concluded  that  such a
          phenomenon  is  forbidden for all black holes in quintessential
          cosmological models.

          accreting black holes
          Authors: T. Suebsuwong, J. Malzac, E. Jourdain, A. Marcowith
          Comments: 13 pages, 18 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A
          Relativistic  distortions  can strongly affect the shape of the
          reflected spectrum. Light bending can dramatically increase the
          observable  reflected  flux and reduce the primary emission. In
          addition,  multiple  reflections  due  to the reflected photons
          deflected  toward the disc can alter significantly the shape of
          the  spectrum above 10 keV. We explore the predicted variations
          of  the  observed  reflected and primary fluxes with the height
          and  radius  of the source. Large variations of the ring radius
          at constant height can lead to an (unobserved) anti-correlation
          between  primary  and  reflected  flux.  In  another  side, the
          variability  behaviour  of several sources can be reproduced if
          the ring source radius is small (<5 r_g), and its height varies
          by  a  large  factor.  In  particular,  a  non-linear flux-flux
          relation,  similar  to that observed in several sources, can be
          produced.  We  compare  our  model  with  the flux-flux plot of
          NGC4051,  and find an agreement for low inclination angles (<20
          deg.),  ring  source radius <3 r_g and a height varying between
          0.5  to  10  r_g.  Regarding  the  angular  distribution of the
          radiation,  we find some important qualitative differences with
          respect  to  the  Newtonian  case. The reflected flux at larger
          inclination is relatively stronger than in the Newtonian model,
          the reflection fraction increasing with inclination.

          Environment

          Comments:  2  pages, 2 figures, to appear in the proceedings of
          the  IAU  Symposium 230, "Populations of High Energy Sources in
          Galaxies", Dublin, 15-19 Aug 2005
          We  present  optical  observations  of  an  ultraluminous X-ray
          source  (ULX)  in Holmberg IX, a dwarf galaxy near M81. The ULX
          has  an  average  X-ray luminosity of some 10^{40} erg/s. It is
          located  in  a  huge  (400pc x 300pc) ionized nebula being much
          larger  than  normal  supernova  remnants.  From  the  observed
          emission  lines  (widths and ratios) we find that the structure
          is  due  to  collisional  excitation  by shocks, rather than by
          photoionization.
          We  identify the optical counterpart to be a 22.8 mag blue star
          (M_V=-5.0) belonging to a small stellar cluster. From isochrone
          fitting  of  our multi-colour photometry we determine a cluster
          age of 20 to 50 Myr. We also discovered strong stellar HeII4686
          emission   (equivalent   width   of  10  A)  which  proves  the
          identification  with  the  X-ray source, and which suggests the
          presence  of an X-ray heated accretion disc around the putative
          black hole.

          Optical  studies of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX) in nearby
          galaxies  have  turned out to be instrumental in discriminating
          between   various   models   including   the   much  advertised
          intermediate  mass  black  hole  hypothesis and various beaming
          scenarios. Here we report on ESO VLT and SUBARU observations of
          ULX that have revealed the parent stellar clusters with ages of
          some  60 million years in two cases. Thus we are able to derive
          upper  limits  of  about  8  M_sun for the mass donors in these
          systems. The optical counterparts are dominated by X-ray heated
          accretion  disks,  and  the  discovery of the HeII4686 emission
          line  now  allows  to derive dynamical masses in these systems.
          Apparent  radial  velocity  variations  of  300  km/s have been
          detected  in  NGC  1313  X-2  which,  if  confirmed  by further
          observations,  would  exclude  the  presence  of  IMBH in these
          systems.

          Title:  A  Unified  Model of Active Galactic Nuclei, Black Hole
          X-Ray Sources and Gamma-Ray Bursts
          Authors: J. I. Katz
          Comments: 22 pages
          I  consider  models  of  active  galactic  nuclei, stellar-mass
          accreting  black  holes  and microquasars based on a previously
          developed  (Katz  1997)  model of gamma-ray bursts. When energy
          fluxes  exceed a critical value ~ 10^{29} erg/cm^2s, as in GRB,
          a black body equilibrium pair plasma forms. At the lower fluxes
          found  in  AGN,  BHXS and microquasars power electrodynamically
          accelerates   a  small  number  of  very  energetic  particles,
          explaining  their  non-thermal  spectra  and  the  high  energy
          gamma-ray  emission  of  blazars. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays
          may   be   accelerated   by   massive  black  holes,  otherwise
          undetectable, with very low thermal luminosities. New-born fast
          high-field pulsars may be in the black-body equilibrium regime,
          resembling  SGR  in  permanent  outburst.  I  also consider the
          question of whether collisionless plasmas interpenetrate rather
          than  forming  hydrodynamic  shocks,  and  propose  this  as an
          alternative to internal shock models of gamma-ray bursts.

          We  report  the  results  of  the  Chandra  observations of the
          Swift-discovered  short  Gamma-Ray  Burst  GRB  050724. Chandra
          observed this burst twice, about two days after the burst and a
          second  time  three  weeks  later.  The  first Chandra pointing
          occurred  at  the  end  of  a strong late-time flare. About 150
          photons  were  detected  during this 49.3 ks observation in the
          0.4-10.0  keV range. The spectral fit is in good agreement with
          spectral  analysis  of  earlier  Swift  XRT data. In the second
          Chandra  pointing  the  afterglow  was  clearly detected with 8
          photons   in   44.6   ks.  From  the  combined  Swift  XRT  and
          Chandra-ACIS-S   light   curve   we  find  significant  flaring
          superposed   on   an   underlying   power-law  decay  slope  of
          $\alpha$=0.90\plm0.02. There is no evidence for a break between
          about  1 ks after the burst and the last Chandra pointing about
          three  weeks  after the burst. The non-detection of a jet break
          places  a lower limit of 25$^{\circ}$ on the jet opening angle,
          indicating  that  the  outflow is less strongly collimated than
          most  previously-reported  long  GRBs.  This  implies  that the
          beaming  corrected  energy  of  GRB 050724 is at least $4\times
          10^{49}$ ergs.

          Title:  Unipolar  Inductor Model coupled to GW emission: energy
          budget and model application to RX J0806+15 and RX J1914+24
          Authors: S. Dall'Osso, G.L. Israel, L. Stella
          Comments:  24  pages,  9  figures,  accepted for publication on
          Astronomy & Astrophysics
          We further discuss the Unipolar Inductor Model (UIM) coupled to
          GW  emission (Dall'Osso et al. 2005) and compare it to observed
          properties  of  the two candidate ultrashort period binaries RX
          J0806+15  and  RX  J1914+24  . We consider the measured orbital
          periods,  period derivatives and inferred X-ray luminosities of
          these  two sources and find constraints on system parameters in
          order  for  the  model  to account for them. We find that these
          properties  point to the two sources being in different regimes
          of  the  UIM,  with  the  requirement  of  low  magnetic moment
          primaries  ($\sim  10^{30}  G  cm^3$) for both. Given this weak
          magnetization,  RX  J0806+15  has a sufficiently low luminosity
          that  it  can  be  interpreted  as having a primary spin almost
          synchronous  to  and  just  slightly  slower  than  the orbital
          motion.  Its measured orbital spin-up is only slightly affected
          by  spin-orbit  coupling  and  is mostly due to GW emission. RX
          J1914+24,  on  the  other hand, is too bright in X-rays and has
          too  slow  an  orbital spin-up for the same regime to apply. We
          suggest  that  this  binary  system  may  be  emitting GWs at a
          significantly   higher   rate  than  implied  by  its  measured
          $\dot{\omega}_o  = 6 \times 10^{-17} rad s^{-2}$. The latter is
          explained,  in  this  framework,  by  the  primary  spin  being
          slightly faster than the orbital motion ($\alpha <or= 1.1$). In
          this  case, the associated spin-orbit coupling transfers to the
          orbit  a significant amount of angular momentum, thus partially
          balancing  that  lost  to  GW emission. All expectations can be
          tested  in  the  near  future  to  confirm the viability of the
          model.

          Measure the Evolution of the Sources?

          Comments: 11 pages, submission to Astroparticle Physics
          Interactions  between cosmic ray protons and the photons of the
          cosmic microwave background radiation, as well as the expansion
          of the universe, cause cosmic rays to lose energy in a way that
          depends  on  the  distance  from  the cosmic nray source to the
          earth.  Because  of this, there is a correlation between cosmic
          ray  energies  and  the  average redshift of their origin. This
          correlation  may  be  exploited to measure the evolution of the
          sources of cosmic rays.
          Sky  surveys  of  Quasi  Stellar  Objects  (QSO's)  and  Active
          Galactic Nuclei (AGN's), made at optical and x-ray wavelengths,
          are  consistent  in  showing that the evolution of such objects
          exhibits  a  break  at  a redshift, z, of about 1.6. At smaller
          redshifts,  the luminosity density of QSO's and AGN's follows a
          $(1+z)^m$  distribution,  with $m \sim 2.6$, and exhibit a much
          flatter  distribution above the break. Measurements of the star
          formation rate are also consistent with this picture.
          If  QSO's and AGN's are sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays
          the  break  in  their evolution should appear in the cosmic ray
          spectrum  at  an  energy  of  about $10^{17.6}$ eV. This is the
          energy of the second knee.

          publication  in  Monthly  Notices  of  the  Royal  Astronomical
          Society
          We   present  high  quality  optical  spectroscopy  of  the  SU
          UMa-subtype  dwarf  nova,  VW Hyi taken while the system was in
          quiescence.  An S-wave is executed by the emission cores of the
          Hydrogen Balmer lines and by the emission lines of He I, Ca II,
          Fe II and He II. Using Doppler tomography we show it originates
          in  the accretion stream-disc impact region. The He II emission
          is   strongly   phase-dependent,   suggesting   it   originates
          exclusively  within  a hot cavity at the initial impact. We map
          the ionization structure of the stream-disc interaction region.
          One  possible interpretation of this is that the Balmer hotspot
          lies  downstream  of  the  He II hotspot in the outer accretion
          disc,  with  the  He  I  and  Ca  II  hotspots  at intermediate
          locations  between  the two. This suggests that Balmer emission
          is  suppressed until material has cooled somewhat downstream of
          the  impact  site  and  is able to recombine. We favour a phase
          offset  of  0.15+/-0.04  between  the photometric ephemeris and
          inferior  conjunction  of  the  mass  donor.  The  white  dwarf
          contributes  significantly to the optical continuum, with broad
          Balmer  absorption  and  narrow  Mg  II 4481 absorption clearly
          apparent.   This   latter   feature  yields  the  gravitational
          redshift:  v_grav=38+/-21 km s^-1, so M_1=0.71+0.18-0.26 M_sun.
          This implies M_2=0.11 +/- 0.03 M_sun and hence the donor is not
          a  brown  dwarf.  A  prominent Balmer jump is also observed. We
          note that the previously accepted system parameters for both VW
          Hyi  and WX Hyi incoporate an algebraic error, and we provide a
          recalculated M_1(q) plane for WX Hyi.

          tested   at   Columbia   University   Nevis  Laboratories.  The
          electronics  consist  of  an  FADC  module  that  digitizes  16
          photomultipliers  at  40  MHz  with  14-bit  dynamic range. The
          module  is  read  out  to  a  PC  (running Linux) through a PCI

          NLR  clouds  appear  to  be  unaffected  by  the  radio  knots,
          indicating  that  the  radio  jet  is not the principal driving
          force  on the outflowing NLR clouds. However, the velocities of
          the  fainter  NLR  clouds  are  split  near  knots  in the jet,
          indicating  a  possible  interaction.  Biconical outflow models
          were generated to match the data and for comparison to previous
          models  done  with  lower  dispersion observations. The general
          trend is an increase in radial velocity roughly proportional to
          distance  from  the nucleus followed by a linear decrease after
          roughly  100  parsec  similar  to  that  seen  in other Seyfert
          galaxies,     indicating    common    acceleration/deceleration
          mechanisms.

          Title:  The  Host  Galaxies  of Narrow-Line Seyfert 1s: Nuclear
          Dust Morphology and Starburst Rings

          We  present  a  study  of the nuclear morphology of a sample of
          narrow-  and  broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1's and BLS1's)
          based  on  broad-band  images  in  the  Hubble  Space Telescope
          archives.  In  our  previous  study,  we found that large-scale
          stellar  bars  at  >  1 kpc from the nucleus are more common in
          NLS1's   than  BLS1's.  In  this  paper  we  find  that  NLS1's
          preferentially  have grand-design dust spirals within approx. 1
          kpc  of  their  centers. We also find that NLS1's have a higher
          fraction  of  nuclear  star-forming  rings than BLS1's. We find
          that  many  of  the  morphological  differences  are due to the
          presence  or  absence  of  a large-scale stellar bar within the
          spiral  host galaxy. In general, barred Seyfert 1s tend to have
          grand-design  dust  spirals  at  their  centers, confirming the
          results of other researchers. The high fraction of grand-design
          nuclear  dust  spirals  and  stellar  nuclear rings observed in
          NLS1's  host galaxies suggests a means for efficient fueling of
          their nuclei to support their high Eddington ratios.

          We  present  and  discuss  the radio observations of 27 Type Ia
          supernovae  (SNe  Ia)  observed  over two decades with the Very
          Large  Array.  No  SN Ia has been detected so far in the radio,
          implying  a  very  low  density  for any possible circumstellar
          material  established  by the progenitor, or progenitor system,
          before  explosion.  We  derive 2-sigma upper limits to a steady
          mass-loss rate for individual SN systems as low as ~3 X 10^{-8}
          Msun  yr^{-1},  discriminating  strongly  against  white  dwarf
          accretion via a stellar wind from a massive binary companion in
          the  symbiotic  star,  an  example of the ``single degenerate''
          scenario.  However,  a  white dwarf accreting from a relatively
          low   mass   companion   via  a  sufficiently  high  efficiency
          (>60-80%),  Roche  lobe  overflow  is still consistent with our
          limits.  The  ``double degenerate'' merger scenario also cannot
          be excluded.

          Hard  X-ray  imaging  of  the  Galactic  plane  by the INTEGRAL
          satellite   is  uncovering  many  new  20-100  keV  sources.  A
          significant  fraction  of  these  sources  are  High-Mass X-Ray
          Binaries  (HMXBs)  containing  neutron  stars. In this work, we
          present   results  from  INTEGRAL,  Chandra,  optical,  and  IR
          observations  of  4  of  the  IGR sources: IGR J16195-4945, IGR
          J16207-5129,  IGR J16167-4957, and IGR J17195-4100. In all four
          cases,  one  relatively  bright  Chandra  source is seen in the
          INTEGRAL   error  circle,  and  these  are  all  likely  to  be
          counterparts  of  the IGR sources. The sources have hard 0.3-10
          keV  spectra  with  power-law  photon  indices  of 0.5-1.1. The
          Chandra positions along with optical and IR sky survey catalogs
          as well as our own photometry have allowed us to obtain optical
          and IR identifications for all 4 sources. The J-band magnitudes
          are  in  the  range  14.9-10.4, and we have used the optical/IR
          spectral  energy  distributions  to constrain the nature of the
          sources.  Blackbody components with temperature lower limits of
          >9400  K  for IGR J16195-4945 and >18,000 K for IGR J16207-5129
          indicate  that  these  are  very likely HMXBs. However, for IGR
          J16167-4957,  the  spectral  type  of the putative companion is
          later  than  A0V, so this source is not a typical HMXB. For IGR
          J17195-4100,  the  extinction  is  very  low,  and we calculate
          distance  and  luminosity  upper  limits of d < 2.6 kpc and L <
          2x10^34  ergs/s.  The  low  X-ray luminosity allows for several
          possible source types.

          Title: Evidence for Rapidly Spinning Black Holes in Quasars
          Authors:  Jian-Min  Wang (1), Yan-Mei Chen (1), Luis C. Ho (2),
          Ross  J.  McLure  (3)  (1  Institute  of  High  Energy Physics,

          It  has  long  been  believed  that accretion onto supermassive
          black  holes  powers quasars, but there has been relatively few
          observational  constraints  on the spins of the black holes. We
          address  this  problem  by  estimating  the  average  radiative
          efficiencies  of  a  large  sample of quasars selected from the
          Sloan   Digital  Sky  Survey,  by  combining  their  luminosity
          function  and their black hole mass function. Over the redshift
          interval   $0.4<z<2.1$,  we  find  that  quasars  have  average
          radiative efficiencies of $\sim 30% - 35%$, strongly suggesting
          that  their  black  holes are rotating very fast, with specific
          angular  momentum  $a  \approx 1$, which stays roughly constant
          with  redshift.  The  average  radiative  efficiency  could  be
          reduced  by  a  factor  of  $\sim$2,  depending  on the adopted
          zeropoint  for  the  black  hole mass scale. The inferred large
          spins  and their lack of significant evolution are in agreement
          with  the  predictions  of  recent  semi-analytical  models  of
          hierarchical galaxy formation if black holes gain most of their
          mass through accretion.

          Submillimeter  Array  1.3mm  line  and  continuum  observations
          toward the young massive star-forming region IRAS18182-1433 are
          presented. The data are complemented with short-spacing CO(2-1)
          observations  and  SiO(1-0) data from the VLA. Multiple massive
          outflows  emanate  from the mm continuum peak. The CO(2-1) data
          reveal  a quadrupolar outflow system consisting of two outflows
          inclined  by  \~90  degrees.  One  outflow exhibits a cone-like
          red-shifted morphology with a jet-like blue-shifted counterpart
          where  a  blue counter-cone can only be tentatively identified.
          The  SiO(1-0)  data  suggest  the  presence of a third outflow.
          Analyzing  the  12CO/13CO  line  ratios indicates decreasing CO
          line  opacities  with  increasing  velocities.  The other seven
          detected  molecular  species  -  also high-density tracers like
          CH3CN,  CH3OH,  HCOOCH3  -  are  all  ~1-2'' offset from the mm
          continuum   peak,   but  spatially  associated  with  a  strong
          molecular  outflow peak and a cm emission feature indicative of
          a  thermal jet. This spatial displacement between the molecular
          lines  and  the mm continuum emission could be either due to an
          unresolved sub-source at the position of the cm feature, or the
          outflow/jet  itself  alters the chemistry of the core enhancing
          the  molecular  abundances  toward  that  region. A temperature
          estimate   based   on   the   CH3CN(12_k-11_k)  lines  suggests
          temperatures  of  the  order  150K.  A velocity analysis of the
          high-density  tracing  molecules  reveals  that  at  the  given
          spatial  resolution  none  of  them shows any coherent velocity
          structure  which  would  be consistent with a rotating disk. We
          discuss  this  lack  of rotation signatures and attribute it to
          intrinsic   difficulties  to  observationally  isolate  massive
          accretion  disks  from  the surrounding dense gas envelopes and
          the molecular outflows.

          Title: SNe feedback and the formation of elliptical galaxies
          Authors:  Antonio  Pipino  (1),  Francesca  Matteucci  (1) ((1)
          Dipartimento di Astronomia, Universita' di Trieste, Italy)
          Comments: 3 pages, 2 figures, contributed paper to be published
          in  the  proceedings  of"  Origin  of  Matter  and Evolution of
          Galaxies  - New Horizon of Nuclear Astrophysics and Cosmology",
          Ed.S.Kubono
          The  processes  governing  both  the formation and evolution of
          elliptical  galaxies are discussed by means of a new multi-zone
          photo-chemical  evolution model for elliptical galaxies, taking
          into  account  detailed  nucleosynthetic  yields, feedback from
          supernovae, Pop III stars and an initial infall episode.
          By  comparing  model predictions with observations, we derive a
          picture  of galaxy formation in which the higher is the mass of
          the  galaxy,  the shorter are the infall and the star formation
          timescales.  In  particular, by means of our model, we are able
          to  reproduce  the overabundance of Mg relative to Fe, observed
          in  the  nuclei  of  bright  ellipticals, and its increase with
          galactic mass.
          This is a clear sign of an anti-hierarchical formation process.
          Therefore, in this scenario, the most massive objects are older
          than  the  less massive ones, in the sense that larger galaxies
          stop forming stars at earlier times.
          Each  galaxy  is created outside-in, i.e. the outermost regions
          accrete  gas,  form  stars  and  develop  a  galactic wind very
          quickly,  compared  to  the  central  core  in  which  the star
          formation  can  last  up  to  ~1.3  Gyr.  This  finding will be
          discussed at the light of recent observations of the galaxy NGC
          4697  which  clearly  show a strong radial gradient in the mean
          stellar [<Mg/Fe>] ratio.
          The  role of galactic winds in the IGM/ICM enrichment will also
          be discussed.

          We  report  on  new  aspects  of the star-forming region S235AB
          revealed  through  high-resolution  observations  at  radio and
          mid-infrared  wavelengths.  Using  the  Very  Large  Array,  we
          carried   out  sensitive  observations  of  S235AB  in  the  cm
          continuum  (6, 3.6, 1.3, and 0.7) and in the 22 GHz water maser
          line.  These  were  complemented  with  Spitzer Space Telescope
          Infrared   Array   Camera   archive   data   to   clarify   the
          correspondence  between  radio and IR sources. We made also use
          of  newly  presented data from the Medicina water maser patrol,
          started  in  1987, to study the variability of the water masers
          found  in  the  region.  S235A  is a classical HII region whose
          structure  is  now  well  resolved.  To  the  south,  no  radio
          continuum   emission   is  detected  either  from  the  compact
          molecular  core  or from the jet-like structure observed at 3.3
          mm,  suggesting  emission  from dust in both cases. We find two
          new compact radio continuum sources (VLA-1 and VLA-2) and three
          separate  maser  spots.  VLA-1  coincides with one of the maser
          spots  and  with  a previously identified IR source (M1). VLA-2
          lies  towards  S235B  and  represents the first radio detection
          from  this  peculiar  nebula that may represent an ionized wind
          from  a  more  evolved star. The two other maser spots coincide
          with  an  elongated  structure  previously  observed within the
          molecular   core   in   the   C34S   line.  This  structure  is
          perpendicular  to  a  bipolar  molecular  outflow  observed  in
          HCO+(1-0)  and  may  trace  the associated equatorial disk. The
          Spitzer  images reveal a red object towards the molecular core.
          This  is  the  most  viable  candidate  for the embedded source
          originating  the  outflow  and maser phenomenology. The picture
          emerging  from  these  and  previous  data  shows  the  extreme
          complexity  of  a  small  (<  0.5 pc) star-forming region where
          widely different stages of stellar evolution are present.

          We  show  that  our  anti-hierarchical baryon collapse scenario
          (Granato  et  al.  2004) for the joint evolution of black holes
          and  host  galaxies  predicts  quasar  luminosity  functions at
          redshifts  1.5 < z < 6 and local demographic properties in nice
          agreement  with  observations. In our model the quasar activity
          marks and originates the transition between an earlier phase of
          violent   and   heavily   dust-enshrouded   starburst  activity
          promoting  rapid black hole growth, and a later phase of almost
          passive    evolution;    the    former   is   traced   by   the
          submillimeter-selected  sources,  while the latter accounts for
          the  high  number  density  of  massive galaxies at substantial
          redshifts z > 1.5, the population of Extremely Red Objects, and
          the properties of local ellipticals.

          Comments:  Proceedings  of  the  Workshop  on  "AGN  and galaxy
          evolution",  Specola  Vaticana,  Castel  Gandolfo,  Italy,  3-6
          October 2005
          We present the latest determination of the X-ray (2-10 keV) AGN
          luminosity  function accounting for the selection effect due to
          X-ray  absorption.  The  main  results are: 1) the inclusion of
          obscured   AGN   confirms   the   AGN  differential  luminosity
          evolution,  but  makes  it  less  extreme  than  what  is found
          selecting  unobscured AGN in soft X-rays, and more similar to a
          pure  luminosity  evolution;  2)  significant  correlations are
          found  between the fraction of obscured sources, the luminosity
          and  the redshift, this fraction increasing toward both low AGN
          luminosities  and  high redshifts. We discuss our findings in a
          scenario  for  the  formation and evolution of the structure in
          the  Universe where the bulk of nuclear activity is produced at
          z=1-2.  At  the  same  redshifts  also  the star-formation rate
          reaches  a  maximum,  and this age can therefore be regarded as
          the  "golden  age"  for nuclear and galaxy activity. We discuss
          the  current  observational  limits  of  this  program  and the
          improvements needed to obtain an unbiased census of the AGN and
          super-massive black hole (SMBH) population.

          We  present  a  multiwavelength  analysis of a compact group of
          galaxies  infalling  at  high  speed into the dynamically young
          cluster  Abell  1367.  Peculiar morphologies and unusually high
          Halpha  emission  are associated with two giant galaxies and at
          least  ten  dwarfs/extragalactic HII regions, making this group
          the  region with the highest density of star formation activity
          ever  observed  in  the local clusters. Moreover Halpha imaging
          observations reveal extraordinary complex trails of ionized gas
          behind  the galaxies, with projected lengths exceeding 150 kpc.
          These  unique  cometary  trails  mark the gaseous trajectory of
          galaxies,   witnessing   their   dive   into  the  hot  cluster
          intergalactic medium. Under the combined action of tidal forces
          among group members and the ram-pressure by the cluster ambient
          medium,  the group galaxies were fragmented and the ionized gas
          was  blown  out.  The  properties  of  this  group suggest that
          environmental   effects   within   infalling  groups  may  have
          represented a preprocessing step of the galaxy evolution during

          Title:  AGN  Outflows  in  Emission  and  Absorption:  The SDSS
          Perspective
          Authors: Gordon T. Richards
          Comments:  Summary  of talk presented at the ``AGN Winds in the
          Caribbean'' Workshop, St. John, USVI; 28 November - 2 December,
          2005; this http URL
          A  variety  of  investigations  have demonstrated commonalities
          between  the  Baldwin  (1977)  Effect,  the blueshifting of CIV
          emission  lines (e.g., Gaskell 1982; Richards et al. 2002), and
          the   L_UV-L_X  relationship  (e.g.,  Avni  &  Tananbaum  1982;
          Strateva et al. 2005; Steffen et al. 2006); indeed all three of
          these  observational  effects may be manifestations of the same
          underlying  (but  still uncertain) physics. This commonality is
          of  interest  to  investigations of accretion disk winds (e.g.,
          Murray  et  al.  1995;  Proga et al. 2000) from active galactic
          nuclei  (AGN)  as  there is evidence that broad absorption line
          quasars  (BALQSOs)  are  drawn  from a parent sample of quasars
          that  exhibit  larger  than average CIV blueshifts, weaker than
          average  CIV  emission  line  strengths, and bluer than average
          (intrinsic)  colors.  The  properties of the absorption troughs
          appear  to  be  dependent  upon  these  parameters. Thus, it is
          suggested that not all quasars will host bona-fide BAL troughs,
          but  that  all  (broad  emission line) quasars host outflows of
          some  type, the structure of which is strongly dependent on the
          quasar's spectral energy distribution.

          We  have imaged the entire Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of
          the  two nearest star-forming dwarf galaxies, in all seven IRAC
          and MIPS bands. The low mass and low metallicity (1/6 solar) of
          the SMC make it the best local analog for primitive galaxies at
          high  redshift.  By  studying  the  properties of dust and star
          formation   in   the  SMC  at  high  resolution,  we  can  gain
          understanding  of  similar  distant  galaxies  that can only be
          observed  in much less detail. In this contribution, we present
          a  preliminary  analysis  of  the  properties  of point sources
          detected  in  the  Spitzer Survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud
          (S^3MC).  We  find  ~400,000  unresolved or marginally resolved
          sources  in  our  IRAC  images,  and  our MIPS 24 micron mosaic
          contains  ~17,000  point sources. Source counts decline rapidly
          at   the  longer  MIPS  wavelengths.  We  use  color-color  and
          color-magnitude  diagrams  to  investigate  the nature of these
          objects,  cross-correlate  their  positions with those of known
          sources  at  other  wavelengths, and show examples of how these
          data  can  be  used  to identify interesting classes of objects
          such  as carbon stars and young stellar objects. For additional
          examples  of  some  of  the  questions that can be studied with
          these  data,  please  see the accompanying contributions by the
          other  members  of our team. The mosaic images and point source
          catalogs  we  have made have been released to the public on our

          We  present  results of a reconnaissance for stellar companions
          to   all   131  radial-velocity-detected  candidate  extrasolar
          planetary systems known as of July 1, 2005. CPM companions were
          investigated using the multi-epoch DSS images, and confirmed by
          matching  the trigonometric parallax distances of the primaries
          to  companion  distances  estimated  photometrically.  We  also
          attempt   to   confirm  or  refute  companions  listed  in  the
          Washington  Double  Star Catalog, the Catalogs of Nearby Stars,
          in Hipparcos results, and in Duquennoy & Mayor (1991).
          Our findings indicate that a lower limit of 30 (23%) of the 131
          exoplanet  systems  have  stellar  companions.  We  report  new
          stellar  companions  to  HD  38529  and  HD  188015,  and a new
          candidate  companion  to  HD 169830. We confirm many previously
          reported  stellar  companions,  including  six  stars  in  five
          systems that are recognized for the first time as companions to
          exoplanet  hosts. We have found evidence that 20 entries in the
          Washington  Double  Star  Catalog are not gravitationally bound
          companions. At least three, and possibly five, of the exoplanet
          systems  reside in triple star systems. Three exoplanet systems
          have  potentially close-in stellar companions ~ 20 AU away from
          the  primary.  Finally,  two  of  the exoplanet systems contain
          white   dwarf  companions.  This  comprehensive  assessment  of
          exoplanet  systems  indicates that solar systems are found in a
          variety   of   stellar  multiplicity  environments  -  singles,
          binaries,   and   triples;   and   that   planets  survive  the
          post-main-sequence evolution of companion stars.

          We  present  a new method for studying the intrinsic brightness
          temperatures  of  the parsec-scale jet cores of Active Galactic
          Nuclei (AGN). Our method uses observed superluminal motions and
          observed  brightness  temperatures for a large sample of AGN to
          constrain  the  characteristic intrinsic brightness temperature
          of  the  sample  as  a  whole.  To  study  changes in intrinsic
          brightness  temperature,  we assume that the Doppler factors of
          individual  jets  are  constant  in  time as justified by their
          relatively small changes in observed flux density. We find that
          in  their  median-low brightness temperature state, the sources
          in  our  sample  have  a  narrow  range of intrinsic brightness
          temperatures  centered on a characteristic temperature, T_int =
          3  x  10^10  K,  which  is  close  to  the  value  expected for
          equipartition,  when  the  energy  in  the  radiating particles
          equals  the  energy  stored in the magnetic fields. However, in
          their  maximum  brightness  state,  we find that sources in our
          sample  have  a characteristic intrinsic brightness temperature
          greater  than  2  x  10^11  K,  which  is well in excess of the
          equipartition  temperature.  In  this  state,  we  estimate the
          energy  in  radiating  particles  exceeds  the  energy  in  the
          magnetic  field  by  a  factor  of  ~ 10^5. We suggest that the
          excess  of  particle  energy  when sources are in their maximum
          brightness  state  is  due  to  injection  or  acceleration  of
          particles  at the base of the jet. Our results suggest that the
          common  method  of  estimating  jet  Doppler factors by using a
          single  measurement  of  observed brightness temperature and/or
          the  assumption  of  equipartition may lead to large scatter or
          systematic errors in the derived values.

          We  present  far-ultraviolet  spectra  of  the  Seyfert2 galaxy
          Mrk533   obtained   with   FUSE.   These  spectra  show  narrow
          asymmetrical  OVI  1032,1038 emission lines with stronger wings
          shortward  of  the peak wavelength, but the degree of asymmetry
          of these wings in velocity is much lower than that of the wings
          of  the  lines of lower ionization. In the combined OVI profile
          there  are  marginal  indications  of  local absorptions in the
          outflow.  The  CIII  977  line  is  seen  weakly with a similar
          profile,  but  with very low signal to noise. These FUV spectra
          are among the first for a Seyfert of type2, i.e., a purportedly
          obscured  Seyfert. The HST STIS spectral image of Mrk533 allows
          delineation  of  the  various components of the outflow, and we
          infer  that  the outflow is accelerated. We discuss the results
          in terms of nuclear geometry and kinematics.

          We  report  an  extremely  rapid  mechanism  for magnetic field
          amplification  during  the  merger  of  a  binary  neutron star
          system.  This  has implications for the production of the short
          class  of  Gamma-Ray  Bursts, which recent observations suggest
          may  originate in such mergers. In detailed magnetohydrodynamic
          simulations of the merger process, the fields are amplified via
          Kelvin-Helmholtz  instabilities  beyond magnetar field strength
          and  may  therefore  represent the strongest magnetic fields in
          the Universe. The amplification occurs in the shear layer which
          forms  between  the neutron stars and on a time scale of only 1
          millisecond,  i.e.  long before the remnant can collapse into a
          black hole.

          Comments:  8  pages, 8 figures, to appear in Proceedings of the
          Albert Einstein Century International Conference
          Kilohertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) have been detected
          in  many  accreting  X-ray binaries. It has been suggested that
          the  highest  QPO frequencies observed in the modulation of the
          X-ray  flux reflect a non-linear resonance between two modes of
          accreting  disk  oscillation.  This  hypothesis implies certain
          very  general predictions, several of which have been borne out
          by  observations.  Some  of  these  follow  from  properties of
          non-linear  oscillators,  while  the  others  are  specific  to
          oscillations  of  fluid in strong gravity. A 3:2 resonant ratio
          of  frequencies  can be clearly recognized in the black-hole as
          well as in the neutron-star QPO data.

          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          It  is  well known that the [O {\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007 emission
          line  and  hard X-ray(2-10keV) luminosities are good indicators
          of  AGN  activities and that the near and mid-infrared emission
          of  AGN  originates from re-radiation of dusty clouds heated by
          the UV/optical radiation from the accretion disk. In this paper
          we  present  a  study  of  the near-infrared K-band (2.2$\mu$m)
          properties  for a sample of 65 Seyfert 2 galaxies. By using the
          AGN/Bulge/Disk  decomposition  technique, we analyzed the 2MASS
          K$_{\rm  S}$-band  images  for  Seyfert  2 galaxies in order to
          derive the K$_{\rm S}$- band magnitudes for the central engine,
          bulge,  and  disk components. We find that the K$_{\rm S}$-band
          magnitudes  of  the central AGN component in Seyfert 2 galaxies
          are  tightly correlated with the [O {\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007 and
          the hard X-ray luminosities, which suggests that the AGN K-band
          emission   is  also  an  excellent  indicator  of  the  nuclear
          activities at least for Seyfert 2 galaxies. We also confirm the
          good relation between the central black hole masses and bulge's
          K-band magnitudes for Seyfert 2s.

          reflector,  was  built  and  its performance evaluated with ion
          beam  data.  Preliminary results of the in-beam tests performed

          Cherenkov  rings  for  a large range of charged nuclei and with
          reflected photons were observed. The data analysis confirms the

          Title:  X-ray  emission  from  the  double  neutron star binary
          B1534+12: Powered by the pulsar wind?
          Authors: O. Kargaltsev, G. G. Pavlov, G. P. Garmire
          Comments: 11 pages, 8 figures, accepted to ApJ
          We  report  the  detection  of  the  double neutron star binary
          (DNSB)   B1534+12   (=   J1537+1155)  with  the  Chandra  X-ray
          Observatory. This DNSB (orbital period 10.1 hr) consists of the
          millisecond  (recycled)  pulsar J1537+1155A (P_A=37.9 ms) and a
          neutron  star  not  detected in the radio. After the remarkable
          double  pulsar  binary  J0737-3039,  it  is the only other DNSB
          detected   in   X-rays.   We   measured  the  flux  of  (2.2\pm
          0.6)\times10^{-15}  ergs  s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the 0.3-6 keV band.
          The   small  number  of  collected  counts  allows  only  crude
          estimates  of spectral parameters. The power-law fit yields the
          photon  index  of  3.2\pm  0.5  and  the  unabsorbed 0.2-10 keV
          luminosity    L_X=6\times10^{29}    ergs   s^{-1}   =   3\times
          10^{-4}Edot_A,   where   Edot_A   is  the  spin-down  power  of
          J1537+1155A.  Alternatively,  the  spectrum  can be fitted by a
          blackbody model with T = 2.2 MK and the projected emitting area
          of ~ 5\times 10^3 m^2. The distribution of photon arrival times
          over  binary  orbital  phase  shows a deficit of X-ray emission
          around  apastron, which suggests that the emission is caused by
          interaction  of the relativistic wind from J1537+1155A with its
          neutron  star  companion.  We  also  reanalyzed the Chandra and
          XMM-Newton  observations of J0737-3039 and found that its X-ray
          spectrum  is similar to the spectrum of B1534+12, and its X-ray
          luminosity is about the same fraction of Edot_A, which suggests
          similar  X-ray emission mechanisms. However, the X-ray emission
          from  J0737-3039  does  not show orbital phase dependence. This
          difference  can  be  explained  by  the smaller eccentricity of
          J0737-3039  or  a  smaller  misalignment between the equatorial
          plane  of  the  millisecond pulsar and the orbital plane of the

          Title: The formation of massive stars: accretion, disks and the
          development of hypercompact HII regions
          Authors: Eric Keto
          Comments: submitted to ApJ
          Observations of hypercompact HII (HCHII) regions are not easily
          explained  by  the standard model of HII regions whose dynamics
          and  evolution  are dominated by thermal or turbulent pressure,
          but   these  observations  are  simply  understood  within  the
          contexts of more recent models -- hot molecular cores, quenched
          HII    regions,    gravitationally   trapped   HCHII   regions,
          photo-evaporating  disks,  and  champagne flows -- that include
          the gravitational attraction of embedded stars. These different
          theoretical  models  and  the  different observed structures of
          HCHII  regions  may  be  unified by a single model in which the
          HCHII  region  develops in an accretion flow that is subject to
          ionizing  radiation. The differences in the structures of HCHII
          regions  result  from  the differences in the structures of the
          accretion  flows that form with a particular mass, gas density,
          and  angular  momentum, and the flux of ionizing radiation. The
          HCHII  regions  and some ultracompact HII (UCHII) regions are a
          distinct  class  of  HII regions whose structure, dynamics, and
          evolution   are   dominated   not   by   pressure  but  by  the
          gravitational   attraction   of  the  embedded  stars  and  the
          structures associated with accretion.

          Title:  Numerical  simulations  of  coronal magnetic field loop
          evolution
          Authors: T.G. Yelenina, G.V. Ustyugova, A.V. Koldoba
          Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures, submitted to A&A
          We  present  the  results  of  the numerical simulations of the
          interaction  between  a  magnetized  star  and  an  imperfectly
          conducting   accretion   disk.  To  analyze  the  ''star-disk''
          interaction  we  numerically investigate the MHD equations used
          Godunov-type  high  resolution  numerical  method. It was found
          that  the  ''star-disk'' interaction occurs with quasi-periodic
          reconnection  of  the magnetic field coronal loops and plasmoid
          ejections.  In  the  case  of the perfect disk conductivity the
          evolution  of  the coronal magnetic field leads to the periodic
          outflow  of  angular  momentum from the disk. In the case of an
          imperfectly  conducting  disk the configuration of the magnetic
          field  is formed such that the disk angular momentum carried by
          magnetic  field  gets  balanced  by angular momentum carried by
          matter.

          Title: Surface Tension and the Cosmological Constant
          Authors: Joseph Samuel, Supurna Sinha
          Comments: Dedicated to Rafael Sorkin on his 60th birthday
          Subj-class: Soft Condensed Matter
          The  astronomically observed value of the cosmological constant
          is small but non-zero. This raises two questions together known
          as the cosmological constant problem a) why is lambda so nearly
          zero?  b)  why  is lambda not EXACTLY zero? Sorkin has proposed
          that  b)  can  be naturally explained as a one by square root N
          fluctuation by invoking discreteness of spacetime at the Planck
          scale  due  to  quantum gravity. In this paper we shed light on
          these   questions   by   developing   an  analogy  between  the
          cosmological constant and the surface tension of membranes. The
          ``cosmological constant problem'' has a natural analogue in the
          membrane  context:  the  vanishingly  small  surface tension of
          fluid  membranes  provides  an  example where question a) above
          arises  and  is answered. We go on to find a direct analogue of
          Sorkin's  proposal  for  answering  question b) in the membrane
          context,  where  the  discreteness of spacetime translates into
          the   molecular   structure  of  matter.  We  propose  analogue
          experiments to probe a small and fluctuating surface tension in
          fluid  membranes.  A  counterpart of dimensional reduction a la
          Kaluza-Klein  and  large  extra  dimensions also appears in the
          physics of fluid membranes.

          Title: Brane-world cosmology with black strings
          Authors: Lszl . Gergely
          Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures
          We  consider  the simplest scenario when black strings (cigars)
          penetrate  the cosmological brane. As a result, the brane has a
          Swiss-cheese structure, with Schwarzschild black holes immersed
          in  a  Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker brane. There is
          no dark radiation in the model, the cosmological regions of the
          brane  are  characterized  by a cosmological constant $\Lambda$
          and   flat   spatial  sections.  Regardless  of  the  value  of
          $\Lambda$,  these  brane-world  universes  forever  expand  and
          forever  decelerate.  The  totality  of  source  terms  in  the
          modified  Einstein  equation  sum  up to a dust, establishing a
          formal    equivalence    with    the    general    relativistic
          Einstein-Straus  model.  However  in  this brane-world scenario
          with  black  strings  the  evolution  of the cosmological fluid
          strongly  depends  on $\Lambda$. For $\Lambda$ less or equal to
          zero  it  has  positive  energy  density  $\rho$  and  negative
          pressure   $p$   and  at  late  times  it  behaves  as  in  the
          Einstein-Straus  model.  For  (not too high) positive values of
          $\Lambda$ the cosmological evolution begins with positive $\rho
          $  and negative $p$, but this is followed by an epoch with both
          $\rho $ and $p$ positive. Eventually, $\rho $ becomes negative,
          while  $p$  stays  positive. A similar evolution is present for
          high  positive  values  of  $\Lambda$, however in this case the
          evolution  ends  in  a  pressure  singularity, accompanied by a
          regular  behaviour  of the cosmic acceleration. This is a novel
          type of singularity appearing in brane-worlds.

          Title: Beyond scaling and locality in turbulence
          Authors: A. Bershadskii
          Subj-class: Chaotic Dynamics; Statistical Mechanics
          An  analytic  perturbation theory is suggested in order to find
          finite-size  corrections  to  the  scaling  power  laws. In the
          frames  of  this  theory  it  is  shown  that  the  first order
          finite-size  correction to the scaling power laws has following
          form  $S(r) \cong cr^{\alpha_0}[\ln(r/\eta)]^{\alpha_1}$, where
          $\eta$ is a finite-size scale (in particular for turbulence, it
          can  be  the  Kolmogorov  dissipation  scale).  Using  data  of
          laboratory  experiments  and  numerical simulations it is shown
          shown  that  a degenerated case with $\alpha_0 =0$ can describe
          turbulence statistics in the near-dissipation range $r > \eta$,
          where  the  ordinary  (power-law)  scaling  does not apply. For
          moderate  Reynolds numbers the degenerated scaling range covers
          almost  the  entire  range  of  scales  (about  two decades) of
          velocity  structure  functions.  Interplay  between  local  and
          non-local   regimes   has   been   considered   as  a  possible
          hydrodynamic  mechanism  providing  basis  for  the degenerated
          scaling   of   the   structure   functions   and  the  extended
          self-similarity.

          The  recent detection of $\gamma$-rays with energy up to 10 TeV
          from  dense  regions  surrounding some Supernova Remnants (SNR)
          provides strong, though still not conclusive, evidence that the
          nucleonic  component  of galactic Cosmic Rays is accelerated in
          the  supernova  outflows.  Neutrino  telescopes  could  further
          support  the  validity  of such scenario by detecting neutrinos
          coming  from  the  same  regions.  We re-evaluate the TeV range
          neutrino-photon  flux  ratio  to  be  expected from pion decay,
          finding  small  differences respect to previous derivations. We
          apply  our results and the recent HESS measurements of the very
          high  energy $\gamma$-ray flux from the molecular cloud complex
          in the Galactic Centre, to estimate the neutrino flux from that
          region    discussing   the   detectability   perspectives   for
          Mediterranean  Neutrino Telescopes. We also discuss under which
          conditions  neutron  decay  may  give rise to a significant TeV
          antineutrino  flux  from  a  SNR  embedded  in  Molecular Cloud
          complexes.

          Spectroscopy

          Comments:   55   pages,  including  16  figures.  Astrophysical
          Journal, accepted
          In  a  high  dispersion 1 micron survey of 39 classical T Tauri
          stars  veiling  is  detected  in 80%, and He I 10830 and Pgamma
          line  emission  in  97%  of the stars. On average, the 1 micron
          veiling  exceeds  the level expected from previously identified
          sources  of  excess  emission,  suggesting  the  presence of an
          additional contributor to accretion luminosity in the star-disk
          interface  region.  Strengths  of  both  lines  correlate  with
          veiling,  and  at  Pgamma  there is a systematic progression in
          profile   morphology   with   veiling.   He   I  10830  has  an
          unprecedented  sensitivity  to inner winds, showing blueshifted
          absorption  below  the continuum in 71% of the CTTS compared to
          0%  at  pgamma.  This  line is also sensitive to magnetospheric
          accretion flows, with redshifted absorption below the continuum
          found  in  47%  of  the  CTTS  compared  to  24% at Pgamma. The
          blueshifted absorption at 10830 shows considerable diversity in
          its   breadth   and   penetration  depth  into  the  continuum,
          indicating  that  a  range  of  inner  wind conditions exist in
          accreting  stars.  We  interpret  the broadest and deepest blue
          absorptions as formed from scattering of the 1 micron continuum
          by  outflowing gas whose full acceleration region envelopes the
          star,  suggesting  radial  outflow  from the star. In contrast,
          narrow  blue  absorption with a range of radial velocities more
          likely  arises  via  scattering  of the 1 micron continuum by a
          wind  emerging from the inner disk. Both stellar and disk winds
          are  accretion  powered  since neither is seen in non-accreting
          WTTS  and  among  the  CTTS  helium  strength  correlates  with
          veiling.

          Mid-infrared  diagnostics  are presented for a large portion of
          the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) sample plus
          archival  data  from  the  Infrared  Space  Observatory and the
          Spitzer   Space  Telescope.  Our  main  result  is  that  these
          mid-infrared   diagnostics  effectively  constrain  a  target's
          dominant  power  source.  The  combination of a high ionization
          line index and PAH strength serves as an efficient discriminant
          between  AGN  and star-forming nuclei, confirming progress made
          with   ISO   spectroscopy  on  starbursting  and  ultraluminous
          infrared  galaxies.  The  sensitivity  of  Spitzer allows us to
          probe  fainter  nuclei  and  star-forming regions within galaxy
          disks.  We  find that both star-forming nuclei and extranuclear
          regions  stand apart from nuclei that are powered by Seyfert or
          LINER   activity.  In  fact,  we  identify  areas  within  four
          diagnostic  diagrams  containing  >90%  Seyfert/LINER nuclei or
          >90%  HII  regions/HII  nuclei.  We also find that, compared to
          starbursting  nuclei,  extranuclear  regions typically separate
          even   further   from   AGN,   especially  for  low-metallicity
          extranuclear   environments.   In   addition,  instead  of  the
          traditional  mid-infrared  approach  to differentiating between
          AGN  and  star-forming  sources  that  utilizes relatively weak
          high-ionization  lines,  we  show  that  strong  low-ionization
          cooling  lines  of  X-ray  dominated  regions like [SiII] 34.82
          micron  can  alternatively  be  used  as excellent discrimants.
          Finally,  the  typical  target  in this sample shows relatively
          modest   interstellar   electron  density  (~400  cm^{-3})  and
          obscuration (A_V ~ 1.0 mag for a foreground screen), consistent
          with  a  lack  of  dense clumps of highly obscured gas and dust
          residing in the emitting regions. [Abridged]

          We present the X-ray spectra of 86 optically-identified sources
          in  the  13H XMM-Newton/Chandra deep field which have >70 X-ray
          counts.  The  sample  consists  of 50 broad line AGN, 25 narrow
          emission  line  galaxies,  6  absorption  line  galaxies, and 5
          Galactic stars. The majority (42/50) of the broad line AGN have
          X-ray spectra which are consistent with a power law shape. They
          have a mean photon index of Gamma = 2.0 +- 0.1 and an intrinsic
          dispersion  sigma  =  0.4  +- 0.1. Five BLAGN show a deficit of
          soft  X-rays,  indicating absorption. Significant absorption is
          more  common  in  the narrow emission line galaxies (13/25) and
          absorption  line  galaxies  (2/6)  than  in  the broad line AGN
          (5/50), but is not universal in any of these classes of object.
          The  majority  of  the  20  absorbed sources have X-ray spectra
          consistent  with a simple cold photoelectric absorber, but 6/20
          require more complex models with either an additional component
          of  soft  X-ray emitting plasma, or an ionised absorber. Of the
          16  galaxies  which  do not show evidence for X-ray absorption,
          only  2 objects are likely to be powered by star formation, and
          both  have  2-10  keV  X-ray  luminosities of <= 10^40 cgs. The
          X-ray emission in the other 14 unabsorbed NELGs and galaxies is
          most  likely  powered  by  AGN,  which  are not detected in the
          optical  because  they  are  outshone  by  their  luminous host
          galaxies.  The  Galactic  stars  show multi-temperature thermal
          spectra   which   peak   between   0.5   and  1  keV.  Star/AGN
          discrimination  is  possible  for  4 of the 5 stars solely from
          their X-ray spectra.

          ($>10^4$  sec)  X-ray  afterglow  showed  a canonical power law
          decay.   Assuming   that   this   component  arises  due  to  a
          relativistic  blast wave decelerated by a circumburst matter we
          infer  that the blast wave's kinetic energy was rather high, $5
          \times  10^{50}$  erg, close to what is seen in other GRBs. The
          lack  of  a  "jet  break"  implies  that  the  outflow was wide
          $\theta_j \sim 1$. The rather weak early optical emission rules
          out  a  dense  circumburst wind profile. It also constrains the
          initial  Lorentz  factor  to be significantly lower than usual,
          $\Gamma_{\rm ini}\sim 15$. The observed afterglow suggests that
          the  medium  surrounding  a  massive  star  progenitor  (up  to
          distances  of  $\sim  10^{17}-10^{18}$  cm) is not the expected
          dense  stellar  wind  (a  similar result was seen in many other
          bursts  and in particular in GRB 030329). This implies that the
          progenitor's  wind  was  weak  during  the  last 100-1000 years
          before  the  burst.  This  interpretation  requires a different
          source  for  the  thermal  emission seen in the early X-ray and
          late  optical/UV.  We expect that this emission arises from the
          interaction   of  the  relativistic  ejecta  with  the  stellar
          envelope.

          Title:  A  test  on  external  Compton  models for $\gamma$-ray
          active galactic nuclei
          Authors: Zhonghui Fan, Xinwu Cao, Minfeng Gu
          Comments: 18 pages, accepted by ApJ
          There  is  clear  evidence  that the $\gamma$-ray emission from
          active  galactic  nuclei  (AGNs)  is  attributed to the inverse
          Compton  scatterings in the relativistic blobs near the massive
          black  holes.  If  the  soft  seed photons are from the regions
          outside   the   blobs,   a   linear   relation   between  $(\nu
          F_{\nu,\gamma}/\nu  F_{\nu, \rm syn} u^{*})^{1/(1+\alpha)}$ and
          Doppler factor $\delta$ is expected, where $\nu F_{\nu,\gamma}$
          and  $\nu  F_{\nu, \rm syn}$ are monochromatic $\gamma$-ray and
          synchrotron  fluxes,  respectively,  and  $u^{*}$ is the energy
          density  of soft seed photons \citep{D97}. We estimate the soft
          photon  energy density in the relativistic blobs contributed by
          the  broad  line region (BLRs) in these $\gamma$-ray AGNs using
          their  broad-line  emission  data. The Doppler factors $\delta$
          are  derived  from  their  radio  core and X-ray emission data,
          based  on  the  assumption  that the X-ray emission is produced
          through synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scatterings. We find two
          nearly  linear  correlations:  $(\nu  F_{\nu,\gamma}/\nu F_{\rm
          opt}  u^{*})^{1/(1+\alpha)}  \propto  \delta^{1.09}$, and $(\nu
          F_{\nu,\gamma}/\nu  F_{\rm  IR}  u^{*})^{1/(1+\alpha)}  \propto
          \delta^{1.20}$,  which  are  roughly consistent with the linear
          correlation  predicted  by  the  theoretical model for external
          Compton  scatterings.  Our  results  imply  that  the soft seed
          photons  are  dominantly  from  the  BLRs in these $\gamma$-ray
          AGNs.

          Title:  Beyond  the  bubble  catastrophe of Type Ia supernovae:
          Pulsating Reverse Detonation models
          Authors: Eduardo Bravo, Domingo Garcia-Senz
          Comments:  Accepted  for  The Astrophysical Journal Letters, 12
          pages, 3 figures
          We  describe  a  mechanism  by which a failed deflagration of a
          Chandrasekhar-mass  carbon-oxygen  white  dwarf can turn into a
          successful  thermonuclear supernova explosion, without invoking
          an  ad  hoc  high-density  deflagration-detonation  transition.
          Following  a pulsating phase, an accretion shock develops above
          a  core  of  1  M_sun composed of carbon and oxygen, inducing a
          converging  detonation.  A  three-dimensional simulation of the
          explosion  produced  a  kinetic energy of 1.05E51 ergs and 0.70
          M_sun  of  56Ni,  ejecting scarcely 0.01 M_sun of C-O moving at
          low   velocities.  The  mechanism  works  under  quite  general
          conditions  and is flexible enough to account for the diversity
          of   normal   Type  Ia  supernovae.  In  given  conditions  the
          detonation  might  not  occur,  which would reflect in peculiar
          signatures in the gamma and UV-wavelengths

          galaxies  at  z ~ 1, with the aim of deriving the corresponding
          star  formation  rates  (SFRs) from H_alpha as well as studying
          the  relationship  with  other  SFR  indicators. The new galaxy
          sample  will  be selected from the Extended Groth Strip Survey,
          where  galaxies  will  also  have  measures  of stellar masses,

          Up  to now only a few intermediate-mass molecular outflows have
          been  studied  with  enough high-angular resolution. The aim of
          this  work is to study in detail the intermediate-mass YSO IRAS
          22272+6358A,  which  is  embedded  in  L1206, and its molecular
          outflow, in order to investigate the interaction of the outflow
          with  the  dense  protostellar  material,  and to compare their
          properties with those of lower mas counterparts. We carried out
          OVRO  observations  of  the 2.7 mm continuum emission, CO(1-0),
          C18O(1-0),  and  HC3N(12-11)  in order to map with high-angular
          resolution  the  core of L1206, and to derive the properties of
          the   dust  emission,  the  molecular  outflow  and  the  dense
          protostellar  envelope.  The 2.7 mm continuum emission has been
          resolved  into  four  sources, labeled OVRO~1, 2, 3, and 4. The
          intermediate-mass  Class~0/I  object OVRO 2, with a mass traced
          by  the  dust  emission  of 14.2 Msun, is the source associated
          with IRAS 22272+6358A. The CO(1-0) observations have revealed a
          very  collimated  outflow  driven by OVRO 2, at a PA ~140 degr,
          that  has a very weak southeastern red lobe and a much stronger
          northwestern  blue  lobe. Photodissociation toward the red lobe
          produced  by the ionization front coming from the bright-rimmed
          diffuse  HII  region  could be responsible of the morphology of
          the  outflow.  The  spatial correlation between the outflow and
          the elongated dense protostellar material traced by HC3N(12-11)
          suggests  an  interaction between the molecular outflow and the
          protostellar   envelope.   Shocks  produced  by  the  molecular
          outflow,   and  possibly  by  the  shock  front  preceding  the
          ionization  front could account for the southern enhancement of
          HC3N.  The properties of the intermediate-mass protostar OVRO 2
          and  the  molecular  outflow are consistent with those of lower
          mass counterparts.

          Title:  A  62 Day X-Ray Periodicity and an X-Ray Flare from the
          Ultraluminous X-Ray Source in M82
          Authors: Philip Kaaret, Melanie G. Simet, Cornelia C. Lang
          Comments: 15 pages, one color figure, to appear in ApJ
          In  240  days of X-ray monitoring of M82, we have discovered an
          X-ray  periodicity  at  $62.0 \pm 2.5$ days with a peak to peak
          amplitude  corresponding  to  an  isotropic  luminosity of $2.4
          \times  10^{40}  \rm  erg  s^{-1}$  in  M82  and an X-ray flare
          reaching  a  peak  luminosity  of  $9.8  \times 10^{40} \rm erg
          s^{-1}$.  The  periodicity  and flare likely originate from the
          ultraluminous   X-ray  source  (ULX)  in  M82  which  has  been
          identified  as  a  possible  intermediate  mass  black hole. We
          suggest  that  the  62~day  modulation is due to orbital motion
          within  an X-ray binary with a Roche-lobe overflowing companion
          star  which  would  imply  that  the  average  density  of  the
          companion  star is near $5 \times 10^{-5} \rm g cm^{-3}$ and is
          therefore  a  giant  or  supergiant.  Chandra observations just
          after the flare show an energy spectrum that is consistent with
          a  power-law  with  no  evidence of a thermal component or line
          emission. Radio observations made with the VLA during the flare
          allow us to rule out a blazar identification for the source and
          place  strong  constraints on relativistically beamed models of
          the  X-ray  emission.  The Chandra observations reveal a second
          X-ray  source  reached  a  flux of $4.4 \times 10^{-12} \rm erg
          cm^{-2}  s^{-1}$  in  the  0.3-7 keV band which is dramatically
          higher  than  any  flux  previously  seen  from this source and
          corresponds  to  an isotropic luminosity of $1.1 \times 10^{40}
          \rm  erg  s^{-1}$.  This source is a second ultraluminous X-ray
          source  in  M82 and may give rise to the QPOs detected from the
          central region of M82.

          Title:  Disk  Evolution in Young Binaries: from Observations to
          Theory
          Authors: J.-L. Monin, C. J. Clarke, L. Prato, C. McCabe
          Comments:  16  pages,  7  figures,  chapter  in  Protostars and
          Planets V
          The  formation  of  a  binary system surrounded by disks is the
          most  common  outcome  of stellar formation. Hence studying and
          understanding the formation and the evolution of binary systems
          and  associated  disks  is  a  cornerstone  of  star  formation
          science.  Moreover,  since the components within binary systems
          are  coeval and the sizes of their disks are fixed by the tidal
          truncation  of their companion, binary systems provide an ideal
          "laboratory"  in  which  to  study  disk  evolution  under well
          defined boundary conditions.
          In  this  paper,  we  review observations of several inner disk
          diagnostics  in  multiple  systems, including hydrogen emission
          lines  (indicative of ongoing accretion), $K-L$ and $K-N$ color
          excesses  (evidence  of  warm  inner  disks),  and polarization
          (indicative  of  the  relative orientations of the disks around
          each component). We examine to what degree these properties are
          correlated  within  binary  systems  and  how  this  degree  of
          correlation depends on parameters such as separation and binary
          mass ratio. These findings will be interpreted both in terms of
          models  that treat each disk as an isolated reservoir and those
          in  which  the disks are subject to re-supply from some form of
          circumbinary reservoir, the observational evidence for which we
          will  also  critically  review. The planet forming potential of
          multiple  star  systems  is  discussed in terms of the relative
          lifetimes  of  disks  around single stars, binary primaries and
          binary  secondaries.  Finally, we summarize several potentially
          revealing observational problems and future projects that could
          provide  further  insight  into  disk  evolution  in the coming
          decade

          The  importance  of  horizontal  branch  and  RR Lyrae stars is
          discussed  in  the  context  of  cosmological arguments for the
          formation   of  the  Galactic  halo  and  its  satellite  dwarf
          galaxies.  It  is  shown, in particular, that the Galactic halo
          globular  cluster  system cannot have formed from the accretion
          of   ``protogalactic  fragments''  resembling  the  very  early
          counterparts of the present-day dwarf satellite galaxies of the
          Milky  Way,  or  else  its  RR  Lyrae  properties would be very
          different from what is currently observed.

          We  present  analysis  of  the  near-infrared  spectra  of  114
          rest-frame   UV-selected   star-forming  galaxies  at  z~2.  By
          combining  the  H-alpha  spectra  with photometric measurements
          from  observed  0.3--8  micron,  we  assess  the  relationships
          between  kinematics,  dynamical masses, inferred gas fractions,
          and  stellar  masses  and  ages. The H-alpha line widths give a
          mean  dynamical  mass  M_dyn=6.9  +/- 0.6 x 10^10 Msun within a
          typical  radius  of  ~6  kpc,  after excluding AGN. The average
          dynamical  mass  is  ~2  times  larger than the average stellar
          mass,  and the two agree to within a factor of several for most
          objects. However, ~15% of the sample has M_dyn >> M_star. These
          objects  are  best fit by young stellar populations and tend to
          have  high  H-alpha equivalent widths, suggesting that they are
          young  starbursts  with  large  gas  masses. Rest-frame optical
          luminosity  and velocity dispersion are correlated with 4 sigma
          significance.  Using  the  local  empirical correlation between
          star  formation  rate per unit area and gas surface density, we
          estimate  the  mass  of the gas associated with star formation,
          and  find  a mean gas fraction of ~50% and a strong decrease in
          gas  fraction  with  increasing stellar mass. The masses of gas
          and  stars combined are considerably better correlated with the
          dynamical  masses  than are the stellar masses alone, and agree
          to  within  a  factor  of  three  for  85%  of  the sample. The
          combination of kinematic measurements, estimates of gas masses,
          and  stellar  population  properties suggest that the factor of
          ~500  range  in  stellar mass across the sample cannot be fully
          explained  by  intrinsic differences in the total masses of the
          galaxies,  which  vary  by  a  factor  of  ~40;  the  remaining
          variation is due to the evolution of the stellar population and
          the conversion of gas into stars. [Abridged]

          We  report on the discovery of a supermassive binary black hole
          system   in   the  radio  galaxy  0402+379,  with  a  projected
          separation  between the two black holes of just 7.3 pc. This is
          the  closest  black hole pair yet found by more than two orders
          of   magnitude.   These   results   are   based   upon   recent
          multi-frequency observations using the Very Long Baseline Array
          (VLBA)  which  reveal  two  compact,  variable,  flat-spectrum,
          active  nuclei  within  the elliptical host galaxy of 0402+379.
          Multi-epoch observations from the VLBA also provide constraints
          on  the  total  mass  and  dynamics of the system. Low spectral
          resolution   spectroscopy   using  the  Hobby-Eberly  Telescope
          indicates  two velocity systems with a combined mass of the two
          black  holes of ~1.5 x 10^8 solar masses. The two nuclei appear
          stationary  while the jets emanating from the weaker of the two
          nuclei  appear  to  move out and terminate in bright hot spots.
          The discovery of this system has implications for the number of
          close binary black holes that might be sources of gravitational
          radiation.  Green  Bank  Telescope  observations  at  22 GHz to
          search  for  water  masers  in this interesting system are also
          presented.

          We   analyse   archival  Rossi  X-Ray  Timing  Explorer  (RXTE)
          proportional  counter  array  (PCA) data of thermonuclear X-ray
          bursts  from  the  2002  outburst  of the accreting millisecond
          pulsar  SAX  J1808.4-3658.  We present evidence of nonmonotonic
          variations  of  oscillation  frequency  during  burst rise, and
          correlations  among  the  time  evolution  of  the  oscillation
          frequency,  amplitude, and the inferred burning region area. We
          also  discuss  that  the  amplitude  and  burning  region  area
          evolutions are consistent with thermonuclear flame spreading on
          the  neutron  star  surface. Based on this discussion, we infer
          that  for  the  2002  Oct. 15 thermonuclear burst, the ignition
          likely  occured in the mid-latitudes, the burning region took ~

          star, and after that the lower amplitude oscillation originated
          from  the  remaining asymmetry of the burning front in the same
          hemisphere  where the burst ignited. Our observational findings
          and   theoretical  discussion  indicate  that  studies  of  the
          evolution of burst oscillation properties during burst rise can
          provide  a  powerful  tool  to  understand  thermonuclear flame

          conditions.

          Title:  The Starburst in the Abell 1835 Cluster Central Galaxy:
          A  Case Study of Galaxy Formation Regulated by an Outburst from
          a Supermassive Black Hole

          We  present  an  optical,  X-ray,  and  radio  analysis  of the
          starburst  in  the  Abell 1835 cluster's central cD galaxy. The
          dense  gas  surrounding  the  galaxy is radiating X-rays with a
          luminosity  of  ~1E45  erg/s  consistent with a cooling rate of
          ~1000-2000  solar  masses  per  year.  However, new Chandra and
          XMM-Newton  observations  find  less  than 200 solar masses per
          year  of  gas  cooling below ~2 keV, a level that is consistent
          with  the  cD's  current  star  formation rate of 100-180 solar
          masses  per  year.  One  or more heating agents (feedback) must
          then  be  replenishing the remaining radiative losses. The heat
          fluxes  from  supernova explosions and thermal conduction alone
          are  unable to do so. However, a pair of X-ray cavities from an
          AGN outburst has deposited ~1.7E60 erg into the surrounding gas
          over  the  past  40  Myr.  The  corresponding  jet power 1.4E45
          erg/sec  is  enough to offset most of the radiative losses from
          the  cooling  gas.  The jet power exceeds the radio synchrotron
          power  by  ~4000 times, making this one of the most radiatively
          inefficient  radio  sources  known. The large jet power implies
          that  the  cD's supermassive black hole accreted at a mean rate
          of
          ~0.3 solar masses per year over the last 40 Myr or so, which is
          a  small  fraction  of  the Eddington accretion rate for a 10E9
          solar  mass  black  hole.  The  ratio  of the bulge growth rate
          through  star  formation and the black hole growth rate through
          accretion  is  consistent  with  the  slope  of the (Magorrian)
          relationship  between  bulge  and  central  black  hole mass in
          nearby quiescent galaxies. The consistency between net cooling,
          heating  (feedback),  and  the cooling sink (star formation) in
          this  system  resolves  the  primary  objection  to traditional
          cooling flow models. (abridged)

          Title:  Detection  of  Highly Ionized Metal Absorption Lines in
          the Ultracompact X-ray Dipper 4U 1916-05
          Authors: Adrienne M. Juett (Virginia), Deepto Chakrabarty (MIT)
          Comments:  7  pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We   present  the  high-resolution  Chandra  X-ray  Observatory
          persistent  (non-dip)  spectrum  of  4U  1916-05 which revealed
          narrow   absorption  lines  from  hydrogenic  neon,  magnesium,
          silicon,  and  sulfur,  in  addition to the previous identified
          hydrogenic and helium-like iron absorption lines. This makes 4U
          1916-05  only  the second of the classical X-ray dipper systems
          to  show narrow absorption lines from elements other than iron.
          We  propose  two  possible  explanations for the small measured
          line  widths  (>~ 500-2000 km s^{-1}), compared to the expected
          Keplerian  velocities  (> 1000 km s^{-1}) of the accretion disk
          in  this  50-min  orbital period system, and lack of wavelength
          shifts  (>~  250 km s^{-1}). First, the ionized absorber may be
          stationary.  Alternatively, the line properties may measure the
          relative  size of the emission region. From this hypothesis, we
          find  that  the  emission  region  is constrained to be >~ 0.25
          times the radial extent of the absorber. Our results also imply
          that   the   ionized  absorber  spans  a  range  of  ionization
          parameters.

          Title: Hydrogen in Type Ic Supernovae?
          Authors:  David  Branch, David J. Jeffery, Timothy R. Young, E.
          Baron
          Comments: Submitted to PASP, comments welcome
          By  definition,  a  Type  Ic  supernova  (SN  Ic) does not have
          conspicuous   lines  of  hydrogen  or  helium  in  its  optical
          spectrum.   SNe  Ic  usually  are  modelled  in  terms  of  the
          gravitational collapse of bare carbon-oxygen cores. We consider
          the  possibility  that  the spectra of ordinary (SN 1994I-like)
          SNe  Ic  have  been  misinterpreted,  and  that  SNe  Ic  eject
          hydrogen.  An  absorption feature usually attributed to a blend
          of  Si  II 6355 and C II 6580 may be produced by H-alpha. If SN
          1994I-like   SNe   Ic  eject  hydrogen,  the  possibility  that
          hypernova (SN 1998bw-like) SNe Ic, some of which are associated
          with   gamma-ray   bursts,   also   eject  hydrogen  should  be
          considered.  The implications of hydrogen for SN Ic progenitors
          and explosion models are briefly discussed.

          The Survey for Transiting Extrasolar Planets in Stellar Systems
          (STEPSS)  project  is  a  search for planetary transits in open
          clusters.  In this paper, we analyze the STEPSS observations of
          the  open  cluster  NGC  1245  to  determine  the variable star
          content of the cluster. Out of 6787 stars observed with V < 22,
          of  which ~870 are cluster members, we find 14 stars with clear
          intrinsic  variability  that are potential cluster members, and
          29  clear variables that are not cluster members. None of these
          variables  have  been  previously  identified. We present light
          curves,  finding  charts, and stellar/photometric data on these
          variable  objects.  Several  of  the  interacting binaries have
          estimated   distances  consistent  with  the  cluster  distance
          determined  from isochrone fits to the color magnitude diagram.
          Four  stars  at  the  main sequence turnoff of the cluster have
          light  curves  consistent  with  gamma  Doradus variability. If
          these  gamma  Doradus  candidates are confirmed, they represent
          the  oldest  and  coolest  members  of  this  class of variable
          discovered to date.

          Title: Which jet launching mechanism(s) in TTauri stars?
          Authors:  Jonathan  Ferreira (LAOG), Catherine Dougados (LAOG),
          Sylvie Cabrit (LERMA)
          Comments: 14 pages, accepted by A&A
          AIMS:  We  examine  whether ejection phenomena from accreting T
          Tauri   stars   can   be   described   by   only  one  type  of
          self-collimated  jet  model.  METHODS:  We  present  analytical
          kinematic predictions valid soon after the Alfv\'en surface for
          all  types  of steady magnetically self-confined jets. RESULTS:
          We  show  that  extended disc winds, X-winds, and stellar winds
          occupy  distinct  regions  in  the  poloidal speed vs. specific
          angular  momentum  plane. Comparisons with current observations
          of  T Tauri jets yield quantitative constraints on the range of
          launching radii, magnetic lever arms, and specific energy input
          in  disc  and  stellar winds. Implications on the origin of jet
          asymmetries and disc magnetic fields are outlined. CONCLUSIONS:
          We  argue  that ejection phenomena from accreting T Tauri stars
          most  likely  include  three dynamical components: (1) an outer
          self-collimated steady disc wind carrying most of the mass-flux
          in   the   optical   jet   (when   present),  confining  (2)  a
          pressure-driven  coronal  stellar wind and (3) a hot inner flow
          made  of  blobs  sporadically ejected from the magnetopause. If
          the  stellar  magnetic  moment is parallel to the disc magnetic
          field,   then  the  highly  variable  inner  flow  resembles  a
          "Reconnection  X-wind",  that  has  been  proven to efficiently
          brake  down  an  accreting  and  contracting young star. If the
          magnetic  moment  is anti-parallel, then larger versions of the
          solar  coronal mass ejections are likely to occur. The relative
          importance  of  these three components in the observed outflows
          and  the  range of radii involved in the disc wind are expected
          to  vary  with  time,  from the stage of embedded source to the
          optically revealed T Tauri star phase.

          We  imaged  the  Lynds  723  dark nebula (L723) with the aim of
          studying  the  morphology  of the Herbig-Haro object HH 223 and
          other  line-emission nebula detected in the region. We obtained
          deep  narrow-band  images  in the Halpha and [SII] lines and in
          the  continuum nearby Halpha of a field of ~5' of the L723 dark
          nebula  centered  on HH 223. The Halpha and [SII] images reveal
          the  detailed  morphology  of  HH  223,  unresolved in previous
          optical  images.  Both  images  show  a  quite  complex knotty,
          wiggling   structure   embedded   in   a  low-emission  nebula.
          Comparison between the [SII] and Halpha fluxes of the knots are
          indicative  of  variations in the excitation conditions through
          HH 223. In addition, several other faint nebula are detected in
          Halpha  a  few arcmin to the SE and to the NW of HH 223, all of
          them  lying  projected  onto the east-west pair of lobes of the
          quadrupolar  CO  outflow. Comparison between the Halpha and the
          continuum images confirms the HH-like nature of the Vrba object
          V83, while the Vrba objects V84 and V85 are identified as faint
          field stars.

          Authors:  Brian  M.  Yencho,  Kathryn  V.  Johnston,  James  S.
          Bullock, Katherine L. Rhode
          Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures, Astrophysical Journal, in press
          Large  galaxies  are  thought  to form hierarchically, from the
          accretion  and  disruption  of  many  smaller  galaxies. Such a
          scenario   should   naturally   lead  to  galactic  phase-space
          distributions   containing  some  degree  of  substructure.  We
          examine the errors in mass estimates of galaxies and their dark
          halos  made  using  the projected phase-space distribution of a
          tracer  population  (such  as  a  globular  cluster  system  or
          planetary nebulae) due to falsely assuming that the tracers are
          distributed randomly. The level of this uncertainty is assessed
          by  applying a standard mass estimator to samples drawn from 11
          random  realizations  of  galaxy  halos  containing  levels  of
          substructure   consistent  with  current  models  of  structure
          formation.  We  find  that  substructure  will distort our mass
          estimates  by  up  to  ~20%  -  a  negligible error compared to
          statistical  and  measurement  errors in current derivations of
          masses for our own and other galaxies. However, this represents
          a  fundamental  limit  to  the  accuracy  of  any  future  mass
          estimates  made under the assumption that the tracer population
          is  distributed  randomly, regardless of the size of the sample
          or the accuracy of the measurements.

          We  present  analysis  of  the  near-infrared  spectra  of  114
          rest-frame   UV-selected   star-forming  galaxies  at  z~2.  By
          combining  the  H-alpha  spectra  with photometric measurements
          from  observed  0.3--8  micron,  we  assess  the  relationships
          between  kinematics,  dynamical masses, inferred gas fractions,
          and  stellar  masses  and  ages. The H-alpha line widths give a
          mean  dynamical  mass  M_dyn=6.9  +/- 0.6 x 10^10 Msun within a
          typical  radius  of  ~6  kpc,  after excluding AGN. The average
          dynamical  mass  is  ~2  times  larger than the average stellar
          mass,  and the two agree to within a factor of several for most
          objects. However, ~15% of the sample has M_dyn >> M_star. These
          objects  are  best fit by young stellar populations and tend to
          have  high  H-alpha equivalent widths, suggesting that they are
          young  starbursts  with  large  gas  masses. Rest-frame optical
          luminosity  and velocity dispersion are correlated with 4 sigma
          significance.  Using  the  local  empirical correlation between
          star  formation  rate per unit area and gas surface density, we
          estimate  the  mass  of the gas associated with star formation,
          and  find  a mean gas fraction of ~50% and a strong decrease in
          gas  fraction  with  increasing stellar mass. The masses of gas
          and  stars combined are considerably better correlated with the
          dynamical  masses  than are the stellar masses alone, and agree
          to  within  a  factor  of  three  for  85%  of  the sample. The
          combination of kinematic measurements, estimates of gas masses,
          and  stellar  population  properties suggest that the factor of
          ~500  range  in  stellar mass across the sample cannot be fully
          explained  by  intrinsic differences in the total masses of the
          galaxies,  which  vary  by  a  factor  of  ~40;  the  remaining
          variation is due to the evolution of the stellar population and
          the conversion of gas into stars. [Abridged]

          We  report on the discovery of a supermassive binary black hole
          system   in   the  radio  galaxy  0402+379,  with  a  projected
          separation  between the two black holes of just 7.3 pc. This is
          the  closest  black hole pair yet found by more than two orders
          of   magnitude.   These   results   are   based   upon   recent
          multi-frequency observations using the Very Long Baseline Array
          (VLBA)  which  reveal  two  compact,  variable,  flat-spectrum,
          active  nuclei  within  the elliptical host galaxy of 0402+379.
          Multi-epoch observations from the VLBA also provide constraints
          on  the  total  mass  and  dynamics of the system. Low spectral
          resolution   spectroscopy   using  the  Hobby-Eberly  Telescope
          indicates  two velocity systems with a combined mass of the two
          black  holes of ~1.5 x 10^8 solar masses. The two nuclei appear
          stationary  while the jets emanating from the weaker of the two
          nuclei  appear  to  move out and terminate in bright hot spots.
          The discovery of this system has implications for the number of
          close binary black holes that might be sources of gravitational
          radiation.  Green  Bank  Telescope  observations  at  22 GHz to
          search  for  water  masers  in this interesting system are also

          We   analyse   archival  Rossi  X-Ray  Timing  Explorer  (RXTE)
          proportional  counter  array  (PCA) data of thermonuclear X-ray
          bursts  from  the  2002  outburst  of the accreting millisecond
          pulsar  SAX  J1808.4-3658.  We present evidence of nonmonotonic
          variations  of  oscillation  frequency  during  burst rise, and
          correlations  among  the  time  evolution  of  the  oscillation
          frequency,  amplitude, and the inferred burning region area. We
          also  discuss  that  the  amplitude  and  burning  region  area
          evolutions are consistent with thermonuclear flame spreading on
          the  neutron  star  surface. Based on this discussion, we infer
          that  for  the  2002  Oct. 15 thermonuclear burst, the ignition
          likely  occured in the mid-latitudes, the burning region took ~
          0.2  s  to nearly encircle the equatorial region of the neutron
          star, and after that the lower amplitude oscillation originated
          from  the  remaining asymmetry of the burning front in the same
          hemisphere  where the burst ignited. Our observational findings
          and   theoretical  discussion  indicate  that  studies  of  the
          evolution of burst oscillation properties during burst rise can
          provide  a  powerful  tool  to  understand  thermonuclear flame
          spreading  on  neutron  star  surfaces  under  extreme physical

          dense  gas  surrounding  the  galaxy is radiating X-rays with a
          luminosity  of  ~1E45  erg/s  consistent with a cooling rate of
          ~1000-2000  solar  masses  per  year.  However, new Chandra and
          XMM-Newton  observations  find  less  than 200 solar masses per
          year  of  gas  cooling below ~2 keV, a level that is consistent
          with  the  cD's  current  star  formation rate of 100-180 solar
          masses  per  year.  One  or more heating agents (feedback) must
          then  be  replenishing the remaining radiative losses. The heat
          fluxes  from  supernova explosions and thermal conduction alone
          are  unable to do so. However, a pair of X-ray cavities from an
          AGN outburst has deposited ~1.7E60 erg into the surrounding gas
          over  the  past  40  Myr.  The  corresponding  jet power 1.4E45
          erg/sec  is  enough to offset most of the radiative losses from
          the  cooling  gas.  The jet power exceeds the radio synchrotron
          power  by  ~4000 times, making this one of the most radiatively
          inefficient  radio  sources  known. The large jet power implies
          that  the  cD's supermassive black hole accreted at a mean rate
          of
          ~0.3 solar masses per year over the last 40 Myr or so, which is
          a  small  fraction  of  the Eddington accretion rate for a 10E9
          solar  mass  black  hole.  The  ratio  of the bulge growth rate
          through  star  formation and the black hole growth rate through
          accretion  is  consistent  with  the  slope  of the (Magorrian)
          relationship  between  bulge  and  central  black  hole mass in
          nearby quiescent galaxies. The consistency between net cooling,
          heating  (feedback),  and  the cooling sink (star formation) in
          this  system  resolves  the  primary  objection  to traditional
          cooling flow models. (abridged)

          Title:  Detection  of  Highly Ionized Metal Absorption Lines in
          the Ultracompact X-ray Dipper 4U 1916-05
          Authors: Adrienne M. Juett (Virginia), Deepto Chakrabarty (MIT)
          Comments:  7  pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We   present  the  high-resolution  Chandra  X-ray  Observatory
          persistent  (non-dip)  spectrum  of  4U  1916-05 which revealed
          narrow   absorption  lines  from  hydrogenic  neon,  magnesium,
          silicon,  and  sulfur,  in  addition to the previous identified
          hydrogenic and helium-like iron absorption lines. This makes 4U
          1916-05  only  the second of the classical X-ray dipper systems
          to  show narrow absorption lines from elements other than iron.
          We  propose  two  possible  explanations for the small measured
          line  widths  (>~ 500-2000 km s^{-1}), compared to the expected
          Keplerian  velocities  (> 1000 km s^{-1}) of the accretion disk
          in  this  50-min  orbital period system, and lack of wavelength
          shifts  (>~  250 km s^{-1}). First, the ionized absorber may be
          stationary.  Alternatively, the line properties may measure the
          relative  size of the emission region. From this hypothesis, we
          find  that  the  emission  region  is constrained to be >~ 0.25
          times the radial extent of the absorber. Our results also imply
          that   the   ionized  absorber  spans  a  range  of  ionization
          parameters.

          Title: Hydrogen in Type Ic Supernovae?
          Authors:  David  Branch, David J. Jeffery, Timothy R. Young, E.
          Baron
          Comments: Submitted to PASP, comments welcome
          By  definition,  a  Type  Ic  supernova  (SN  Ic) does not have
          conspicuous   lines  of  hydrogen  or  helium  in  its  optical
          spectrum.   SNe  Ic  usually  are  modelled  in  terms  of  the
          gravitational collapse of bare carbon-oxygen cores. We consider
          the  possibility  that  the spectra of ordinary (SN 1994I-like)
          SNe  Ic  have  been  misinterpreted,  and  that  SNe  Ic  eject
          hydrogen.  An  absorption feature usually attributed to a blend
          of  Si  II 6355 and C II 6580 may be produced by H-alpha. If SN
          1994I-like   SNe   Ic  eject  hydrogen,  the  possibility  that
          hypernova (SN 1998bw-like) SNe Ic, some of which are associated
          with   gamma-ray   bursts,   also   eject  hydrogen  should  be
          considered.  The implications of hydrogen for SN Ic progenitors
          and explosion models are briefly discussed.

          The Survey for Transiting Extrasolar Planets in Stellar Systems
          (STEPSS)  project  is  a  search for planetary transits in open
          clusters.  In this paper, we analyze the STEPSS observations of
          the  open  cluster  NGC  1245  to  determine  the variable star
          content of the cluster. Out of 6787 stars observed with V < 22,
          of  which ~870 are cluster members, we find 14 stars with clear
          intrinsic  variability  that are potential cluster members, and
          29  clear variables that are not cluster members. None of these
          variables  have  been  previously  identified. We present light
          curves,  finding  charts, and stellar/photometric data on these
          variable  objects.  Several  of  the  interacting binaries have
          estimated   distances  consistent  with  the  cluster  distance
          determined  from isochrone fits to the color magnitude diagram.
          Four  stars  at  the  main sequence turnoff of the cluster have
          light  curves  consistent  with  gamma  Doradus variability. If
          these  gamma  Doradus  candidates are confirmed, they represent
          the  oldest  and  coolest  members  of  this  class of variable
          discovered to date.

          Title: Which jet launching mechanism(s) in TTauri stars?
          Authors:  Jonathan  Ferreira (LAOG), Catherine Dougados (LAOG),
          Sylvie Cabrit (LERMA)
          Comments: 14 pages, accepted by A&A
          AIMS:  We  examine  whether ejection phenomena from accreting T
          Tauri   stars   can   be   described   by   only  one  type  of
          self-collimated  jet  model.  METHODS:  We  present  analytical
          kinematic predictions valid soon after the Alfv\'en surface for
          all  types  of steady magnetically self-confined jets. RESULTS:
          We  show  that  extended disc winds, X-winds, and stellar winds
          occupy  distinct  regions  in  the  poloidal speed vs. specific
          angular  momentum  plane. Comparisons with current observations
          of  T Tauri jets yield quantitative constraints on the range of
          launching radii, magnetic lever arms, and specific energy input
          in  disc  and  stellar winds. Implications on the origin of jet
          asymmetries and disc magnetic fields are outlined. CONCLUSIONS:
          We  argue  that ejection phenomena from accreting T Tauri stars
          most  likely  include  three dynamical components: (1) an outer
          self-collimated steady disc wind carrying most of the mass-flux
          in   the   optical   jet   (when   present),  confining  (2)  a
          pressure-driven  coronal  stellar wind and (3) a hot inner flow
          made  of  blobs  sporadically ejected from the magnetopause. If
          the  stellar  magnetic  moment is parallel to the disc magnetic
          field,   then  the  highly  variable  inner  flow  resembles  a
          "Reconnection  X-wind",  that  has  been  proven to efficiently
          brake  down  an  accreting  and  contracting young star. If the
          magnetic  moment  is anti-parallel, then larger versions of the
          solar  coronal mass ejections are likely to occur. The relative
          importance  of  these three components in the observed outflows
          and  the  range of radii involved in the disc wind are expected
          to  vary  with  time,  from the stage of embedded source to the
          optically revealed T Tauri star phase.

          We  imaged  the  Lynds  723  dark nebula (L723) with the aim of
          studying  the  morphology  of the Herbig-Haro object HH 223 and
          other  line-emission nebula detected in the region. We obtained
          deep  narrow-band  images  in the Halpha and [SII] lines and in
          the  continuum nearby Halpha of a field of ~5' of the L723 dark
          nebula  centered  on HH 223. The Halpha and [SII] images reveal
          the  detailed  morphology  of  HH  223,  unresolved in previous
          optical  images.  Both  images  show  a  quite  complex knotty,
          wiggling   structure   embedded   in   a  low-emission  nebula.
          Comparison between the [SII] and Halpha fluxes of the knots are
          indicative  of  variations in the excitation conditions through
          HH 223. In addition, several other faint nebula are detected in
          Halpha  a  few arcmin to the SE and to the NW of HH 223, all of
          them  lying  projected  onto the east-west pair of lobes of the
          quadrupolar  CO  outflow. Comparison between the Halpha and the
          continuum images confirms the HH-like nature of the Vrba object
          V83, while the Vrba objects V84 and V85 are identified as faint
          field stars.

          Title: The Effect of Substructure on Mass Estimates of Galaxies
          Authors:  Brian  M.  Yencho,  Kathryn  V.  Johnston,  James  S.
          Bullock, Katherine L. Rhode
          Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures, Astrophysical Journal, in press
          Large  galaxies  are  thought  to form hierarchically, from the
          accretion  and  disruption  of  many  smaller  galaxies. Such a
          scenario   should   naturally   lead  to  galactic  phase-space
          distributions   containing  some  degree  of  substructure.  We
          examine the errors in mass estimates of galaxies and their dark
          halos  made  using  the projected phase-space distribution of a
          tracer  population  (such  as  a  globular  cluster  system  or
          planetary nebulae) due to falsely assuming that the tracers are
          distributed randomly. The level of this uncertainty is assessed
          by  applying a standard mass estimator to samples drawn from 11
          random  realizations  of  galaxy  halos  containing  levels  of
          substructure   consistent  with  current  models  of  structure
          formation.  We  find  that  substructure  will distort our mass
          estimates  by  up  to  ~20%  -  a  negligible error compared to
          statistical  and  measurement  errors in current derivations of
          masses for our own and other galaxies. However, this represents
          a  fundamental  limit  to  the  accuracy  of  any  future  mass
          estimates  made under the assumption that the tracer population
          is  distributed  randomly, regardless of the size of the sample
          or the accuracy of the measurements.

          The   Pierre   Auger   Observatory  was  designed  for  a  high
          statistics,  full  sky  study  of  cosmic  rays  at the highest
          energies.  Energy,  direction  and composition measurements are
          intended  to  illuminate  the  mysteries  of the most energetic
          particles  in  nature. The Auger Observatory utilizes a surface
          array  together with air fluorescence telescopes which together
          provide  a  powerful  instrument for air shower reconstruction.
          The   southern   part  of  the  Auger  Observatory,  now  under
          construction  in  the  Province  of Mendoza, Argentina, is well
          over half finished. Active detectors have been recording events
          for  one  and  a  half years. Preliminary results based on this
          first data set are presented.

          in Space Research
          We  performed 2D and full 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
          disk accretion to a rotating star with an aligned or misaligned
          dipole   magnetic   field.   We   investigated  the  rotational
          equilibrium  state  and  derived  from  simulations  the  ratio
          between  two  main  frequencies: the spin frequency of the star
          and  the  orbital frequency at the inner radius of the disk. In
          3D  simulations  we  observed different features related to the
          non-axisymmetry  of the magnetospheric flow. These features may
          be  responsible  for high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations
          (QPOs).  Variability at much lower frequencies may be connected
          with  restructuring  of  the  magnetic flux threading the inner
          regions of the disk. Such variability is specifically strong at
          the propeller stage of evolution.

          Comments: 5 pages, 5 figures. Submitted to ApJL
          Using  a  sample  of  89  snapshots from 58 hydrodynamic binary
          galaxy  major merger simulations, we find that stellar remnants
          are mostly oblate while dark matter halos are mostly prolate or
          triaxial.  The  stellar  minor axis and the halo major axis are
          almost  always  nearly perpendicular. This can be understood by
          considering  the  influence of angular momentum and dissipation
          during  the  merger.  If  binary mergers of spiral galaxies are
          responsible  for  the  formation of elliptical galaxies or some
          subpopulation  thereof,  these  galaxies  can be expected to be
          oblate  and  inhabit  their halos with the predicted shapes and
          orientations.  These  predictions  are  potentially relevant to
          observational  studies of weak gravitational lensing, where one
          must   stack  many  optically  aligned  galaxies  in  order  to
          determine the shape of the resulting stacked mass distribution.
          The  simple  relationship  between the dark and luminous matter
          presented here can be used to guide the stacking of galaxies to
          minimize the information lost.

          Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures, A&A in press
          The pre-main sequence binary system V773 Tau A shows remarkable
          flaring  activity  around  periastron passage. Here, we present
          the  observation  of  such  a flare at a wavelength of 3 mm (90
          GHz)  performed  with  the  Plateau  de Bure Interferometer. We
          examine   different  possible  causes  for  the  energy  losses
          responsible  for the e-folding time of 2.3 hours of that flare.
          We exclude synchrotron, collisional, and inverse Compton losses
          because they are not consistent with observational constraints,
          and  we  propose  that the fading of the emission is due to the
          leakage  of electrons themselves at each reflection between the
          two  mirror points of the magnetic structure partially trapping
          them.  The  magnetic structure compatible with both our leakage
          model  and  previous  observations is that of a helmet streamer
          that,  as  in  the  solar  case,  can  occur  at the top of the
          X-ray-emitting,  stellar-sized  coronal  loops  of  one  of the
          stars. The streamer may extend up to 20 R and interact with the
          corona  of  the  other  star  at  periastron  passage,  causing
          recurring  flares.  The inferred magnetic field strength at the
          two mirror points of the helmet streamer is in the range 0.12 -
          125  G,  and  the  corresponding  Lorentz factor, gamma, of the
          partially  trapped  electrons is in the range 20 < gamma < 632.
          We   therefore   rule   out  that  the  emission  could  be  of
          gyro-synchrotron nature: the derived high Lorentz factor proves
          that  the  nature  of the emission at 90 GHz from this pre-main
          binary system is synchrotron radiation.

          We  report  R~4300  VLT  SINFONI adaptive optics integral field
          K-band  spectroscopy  of  the  nucleus  of the Seyfert 1 galaxy
          NGC3227 at a spatial resolution of 0.085" (7pc). We present the
          morphologies  and  kinematics  of emission lines and absorption
          features, and give the first derivation of a black hole mass in
          a  Seyfert  1 nucleus from spatially resolved stellar dynamics.
          We  show  that the gas in the nucleus has a mean column density
          of  order  10^{24}-10^{25}cm^{-2}  and that it is geometrically
          thick,   in  agreement  with  the  standard  `molecular  torus'
          scenario. We discuss which heating processes may be responsible
          for  maintaining the vertical height of the torus. We have also
          resolved the nuclear stellar distribution, and find that within
          a  few  parsecs of the AGN there has been an intense starburst,
          the  most  recent episode of which began ~40Myr ago but has now
          ceased. The current luminosity of stars within 30pc of the AGN,
          ~3x10^9L_sun,  is  comparable  to  that  of the AGN. Based on a
          comparison  of  the  respective  size scales, we argue that the
          star  formation  has  been  occuring  in  the  obscuring torus.
          Finally,  we  present the first derivation of a black hole mass
          in  a  Seyfert 1 nucleus from stellar dynamics which marginally
          spatially  resolve  the  black  hole's  sphere of influence. We

          its  mass-to-light  ratio;  the  recent  star  formation in the
          nucleus  and  its  mass-to-light ratio; the contribution of the
          gas  mass  to  the  potential;  and the inclination. Our models

          Title: The Supernova Gamma-Ray Burst Connection
          Authors: Stan Woosley (UCSC), Alexander Heger (LANL)
          Comments:  10  pages,  to  appear in AIP Conf. Proc. "Gamma Ray
          Bursts  in  the  Swift  Era",  Eds.  S. S. Holt, N. Gehrels, J.

          The chief distinction between ordinary supernovae and long-soft
          gamma-ray  bursts (GRBs) is the degree of differential rotation
          in the inner several solar masses when a massive star dies, and
          GRBs  are  rare  mainly because of the difficulty achieving the
          necessary  high  rotation  rate.  Models  that  do  provide the
          necessary  angular  momentum  are discussed, with emphasis on a
          new  single  star  model whose rapid rotation leads to complete
          mixing  on  the  main  sequence and avoids red giant formation.
          This channel of progenitor evolution also gives a broader range
          of   masses  than  previous  models,  and  allows  the  copious
          production of bursts outside of binaries and at high redshifts.
          However,  even  the  production  of a bare helium core rotating
          nearly at break up is not, by itself, a sufficient condition to
          make  a  gamma-ray burst. Wolf-Rayet mass loss must be low, and
          will  be  low in regions of low metallicity. This suggests that
          bursts at high redshift (low metallicity) will, on the average,
          be  more  energetic,  have more time structure, and last longer
          than bursts nearby. Every burst consists of three components: a
          polar  jet  (~0.1  radian),  high  energy, subrelativistic mass
          ejection (~1 radian), and low velocity equatorial mass that can
          fall back after the initial explosion. The relative proportions
          of  these  three  components  can  give a diverse assortment of
          supernovae and high energy transients whose properties may vary
          with redshift.

          Diagnostics  of  Galaxy  Evolution", held in Pasadena, November
          2005
          One  of  the main questions of galaxy formation is how and when
          galaxies  assembled  their mass. Observations suggest that most
          mass assembly and star formation occured at 1 < z < 3. However,
          in  the  same  redshift  range, fully assembled old and massive
          galaxies  co-exist  with  star-bursting  systems still in their
          assembling  stage. In order to explore galaxy evolution in this
          critical  redshift  range,  we  started  a project called GMASS
          (Galaxy Mass Assembly ultra-deep Spectroscopic Survey) based on
          an  145  hours  ESO  Large Program and aimed at doing ultradeep
          spectroscopy with the VLT of a sample of high redshift galaxies
          slected  with  IRAC/Spitzer  m(4.5mu) < 23, z(phot) > 1.4) from
          the  GOODS-South/HUDF  region.  The  selection at 4.5 micron is
          crucial  to  select high redshift galaxies based on the stellar
          mass  or  objects  affected  by  strong  dust  extinction.  The
          spectroscopic deep integration times (15 - 50 hours) are needed
          to  identify  unambiguously  the  redshift  and nature of these
          galaxies,  which  redshifts  are  mostly  in the "desert" where
          spectroscopy  is  traditionally difficult due to the absence of
          strong  emission  lines  at  optical wavelengths. The survey is
          almost  complete  and  some  preliminary  results are presented
          here.

          It  has  been previously noted that the outermost open clusters
          in  the  Milky  Way  seem to lie in a string-like configuration
          that is coincident with, and may be associated to, the Galactic
          anticenter  stellar structure (GASS) or the ``Monoceros Ring''.
          Among  the  clusters  that have been suggested to be associated
          with GASS are Berkeley 29 (Be29) and BH176, which have recently
          had  their  proper  motion  determined. Matching the new proper
          motion    determinations   to   previously   published   radial
          velocities, we attempt to derive orbits for Be29 and BH176. The
          preliminary  orbit for Be29 provides tantalizing evidence for a
          non-standard  formation,  however  better  proper  motions  are
          needed  to  determine  whether  its  origin  is  due  to normal
          formation or accretion.

          Title:  The  Impact  of  Starbursts  and Post-Starbursts on the
          Photometric Evolution of High Redshift Galaxies

          2005
          We  present  evolutionary  synthesis  models  for  galaxies  of
          spectral  types  Sa  through  Sd  with  starbursts  of  various
          strengths  triggered  at  various  redshifts  and  study  their
          photometric evolution before, during, and after their bursts in
          a  cosmological  context. We find that bursts at high redshift,
          even  very  strong  ones,  only  cause a small blueing of their
          intrinsically  blue  young  parent galaxies. At lower redshift,
          even   small  bursts  cause  a  significant  blueing  of  their
          intrinsically   redder  galaxies.  While  the  burst  phase  is
          generally  short,  typically  a  few hundred Myr in normal-mass
          galaxies,  the  postburst  stage  with  its  red colors and, in
          particular the very red ones for early bursts at high redshift,
          is  much  longer, of the order of several Gyr. Even without any
          dust,  which  in the postburst stage is not expected to play an
          important  role  anyway, models easily reach the colors of EROs
          in  the  redshift  range  z=2 through z=0.5 after starbursts at
          redshifts  between  2  and  4.  We  therefore  propose  a third
          alternative  for  the  ERO  galaxies beyond the two established
          ones  of  passive  galaxies vs. dusty starbursts: the dust-free
          post-(strong-)starbursts. A very first comparison of our models
          to HDF data with photometric redshifts shows that almost all of
          the  outliers  that  could not be described with our chemically
          consistent models for undisturbed normal galaxy types E through
          Sd  can  now  be  explained very well. Galaxies in the redshift
          range  from  z=2.5  to z=0.5 that are redder, and in some cases
          much   redder,   than  our  reddest  undisturbed  model  for  a
          high-metallicity  classical  elliptical  are  well described by
          post-starburst  models  after starbursts at redshifts between 2
          and 4. Galaxies bluer than our bluest low metallicity Sd model,
          most  of  which have redshifts lower than 1, are well explained
          by ongoing starbursts.

          The  Laser  Interferometric  Space  Antenna (LISA) will observe
          supermassive   black   hole   binary   mergers  with  amplitude
          signal-to-noise  ratio of several thousands. We investigate the
          extent  to  which such observations afford high-precision tests
          of  Einstein's  gravity.  We  show  that LISA provides a unique
          opportunity to probe the non-linear structure of post-Newtonian
          theory  both  in  the  context  of  general  relativity and its
          alternatives.

          (Abridged)  In  the  first  part  of  this  thesis,  a  general
          methodology  for applying image deconvolution to wide-field CCD
          imagery.  Results  show  that  wavelet-based  deconvolution can
          increase  limiting magnitude up to 0.6 mag and improve limiting
          resolution  1  pixel  with  respect  to  original image with no
          astrometric accuracy degradation.
          In  the second part, a new observational technique based on CCD
          fast  drift  scanning  has been proposed for lunar occultations
          (LO)  and  speckle  interferometry.  This  enables  all kind of
          professional and high-end amateur observatories to perform such
          kind of observations.
          For LO, 16 new binaries up to 2mas of projected separation were
          detected and stellar diameters measurements in the 7 mas regime
          were obtained with that CCD and IR subarray based techniques. A
          new wavelet-based LO reduction pipeline was implemented.
          For  speckle,  CCD  fast drift scanning technique was validated
          with   the   observation  of  four  binary  systems  with  well
          determined  orbits.  The  results of separation, position angle
          and  magnitude  difference  are  in  accordance  with published
          measurements.  A  new approach for calibrating speckle transfer
          function  from  the  binary  power  spectrum  itself  has  been
          introduced.  It  does  not  require  point source observations,
          which gives a more effective use of observation time.

          PG  1115+080 is a quadruply lensed quasar at z=1.72 whose image
          positions  are well fit by simple models of the lens galaxy (at
          z=0.31).  At  optical  wavelengths,  the  bright  close pair of
          images  exhibits  a  modest  flux  ratio  anomaly  (factors  of
          ~1.2-1.4  over  the  past  22 years) with respect to these same
          models.  We  show here that as observed in X-rays with Chandra,
          the flux ratio anomaly is far more extreme, roughly a factor of
          6.  The  contrasting  flux  ratio  anomalies in the optical and
          X-ray  band confirm the microlensing hypothesis and set a lower
          limit on the size of the optical continuum emission region that
          is  \~10-100  times  larger than expected from a thin accretion
          disk model.

          From  the  small  sample  of  afterglow  lightcurves  of  short
          duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the decays are rapid, roughly
          following  a  power-law  in  time. It has been assumed that the
          afterglow  emission  in short GRBs is collimated in jets in the
          same  way  as  in long GRBs. An achromatic break in a short GRB
          afterglow  lightcurve  would  therefore  be  strong evidence in
          favour  of  collimation  in  short GRBs. We examine the optical
          lightcurve  of  the  afterglow of the short GRB050709, the only
          short  GRB where a jet break has been claimed. We show that (1)
          the  decay follows a single power-law from 1.4 to 19 days after
          the  burst  and  has a decay index alpha = 1.76 (-0.04, +0.11),
          (2)  that an optical flare at ~10 days is required by the data,
          roughly contemporaneous with a flare in the X-ray data, and (3)
          that  there  is no evidence for a break in the lightcurve. This
          means  that  so far there is no direct evidence for collimation
          in  the  outflows  of  short  GRBs. The available limits on the
          collimation  angles  in  short  GRBs  now strongly suggest much
          wider opening angles than found in long GRBs.

          Astrophysics Symposia"
          In  the hierarchical structure formation model cosmic halos are
          supposed   to   form   by  accretion  of  smaller  units  along
          anisotropic   direction,  defined  by  large-scale  filamentary
          structures.  After the epoch of primary mass aggregation (which
          depend on the cosmological model), violent relaxation processes
          will tend to alter the halo phase-space configuration producing
          quasi-spherical   halos   with   a  relatively  smooth  density
          profiles.
          Here  we  attempt  to  investigate  the  relation between halos
          shapes,  their  environment  and their dynamical state. To this
          end  we  have  run  a  large ($L=500 h^{-1}$ Mpc, $N_{p}=512^3$
          particles)  N-body  simulation  of a flat low-density cold dark
          matter    model    with    a    matter   density   $\Omega_{\rm
          m}=1-\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.3$,  Hubble  constant $H_{\circ}=70$ km
          s$^{-1}$   Mpc$^{-1}$   and   a   normalization   parameter  of
          $\sigma_{8}=0.9$.  The particle mass is $m_{\rm p}\ge 7.7\times
          10^{10}  h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ comparable to the mass of one single
          galaxy.   The  halos  are  defined  using  a  friends-of-friend
          algorithm  with  a  linking  length  given by $l=0.17\bar{\nu}$
          where  $\bar{\nu}$  is  the  mean  density. This linking length
          corresponds  to an overdensity $\rho/\rho_{\rm mean}\simeq 200$
          at the present epoch ($z=0$) and the total number of halos with
          more than 130 particles ($M>3 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$)
          is 57524.

          Astrophysics
          Extending  the  work  of  Czerny  et  al.  (2004), we model the
          fractional  variability  amplitude  due to distributions of hot
          spots  co-orbiting  on the accretion disk around a supermassive
          black hole. From defined radial distributions, our code samples
          random  positions  for the hot spots across the disk. The local
          spot  emission is computed as reprocessed radiation coming from
          a  compact  primary source above the disk. The structure of the
          hot  spot  and the anisotropy of the re-emission are taken into
          account. We compute the fractional variability spectra expected
          from  such  spot  ensembles and investigate dependencies on the
          parameters describing the radial spot distribution. We consider
          the  fractional  variability F_var with respect to the spectral
          mean  and  also  the  so-called point-to-point F_pp. Our method
          includes  relativistic  corrections  for the curved space-time;
          the black hole angular momentum is a free parameter and subject
          to  the  fitting procedure. We confirm that the rms-variability
          spectra  involve  intrinsic  randomness  at a significant level
          when   the   number   of  flares  appearing  during  the  total
          observation time is too small. Furthermore, F_var is not always
          compatible  with  F_pp.  For MCG -6-30-15, we can reproduce the
          short-timescale    variability   and   model   the   suppressed
          variability  in the energy range of the Kalpha line without any
          need to postulate reprocessing farther away from the center. An
          increasing  rate  of energy production by the flares toward the
          center  of the disk, a fast rotation of the central black hole,
          and  considerable suppression of the primary flare emission are
          required. The modeled line remains consistent with the measured
          equivalent width of the iron Kalpha line complex.

          photometry technique, in observations spanning a timescale of 1
          month,  we  found no long term variability in our observations.
          This  is  compatible, and we suggest here, that the source is a
          HMXB.

          Title:   Resonant   Tidal  Excitations  of  Inertial  Modes  in
          Coalescing Neutron Star Binaries
          Authors: Dong Lai (Cornell), Yanqin Wu (Toronto)
          Comments: 6 pages. Phys. Rev. D. submitted 3/23/06
          We  study  the  effect of resonant tidal excitation of inertial
          modes  in  neutron  stars  during  binary  inspiral.  For  spin
          frequencies   less   than  100  Hz,  the  phase  shift  in  the
          gravitational  waveform  associated with the resonance is small
          and   does   not   affect  the  matched  filtering  scheme  for
          gravitational  wave detection. For higher spin frequencies, the
          phase shift can become significant. Most of the resonances take
          place  at orbital frequencies comparable to the spin frequency,
          and  thus  significant  phase  shift  may  occur  only  in  the
          high-frequency  band (hundreds of Hertz) of gravitational wave.
          The  exception  is  a single odd-paity $m=1$ mode, which can be
          resonantly  excited for misaligned spin-orbit inclinations, and
          may  occur  in  the  low-frequency  band  (tens  of  Hertz)  of
          gravitational  wave  and induce significant (>> 1 radian) phase
          shift.

          Title: Binary post-AGB stars and their Keplerian discs
          Authors:  Hans  Van Winckel, Tom Lloyd Evans, Maarten Reyniers,

          Comments:  to  be included in the conference proceedings of the
          8th Torino Workshop held in Granada
          In   this  contribution  we  give  a  progress  report  on  our
          systematic  study  of  a  large  sample  of post-AGB stars. The
          sample  stars  were  selected  on  the  basis of their infrared
          colours  and  the  selection  criteria  were  tuned to discover
          objects  with  hot  dust  in  the  system.  We  started  a very
          extensive,   multi-wavelength   programme  which  includes  the
          analysis   of  our  radial  velocity  monitoring;  our  optical
          high-resolution  spectra;  our groundbased N-band spectral data
          as  well as the Spitzer full spectral scans; the broad-band SED
          and  the  high  spatial-resolution  interferometric experiments
          with  the  VLTI.  In  this  contribution  we highlight the main
          results  obtained  so  far  and  argue  that all systems in our
          sample  are  indeed  binaries,  which  are  surrounded by dusty
          Keplerian circumbinary discs. The discs play a lead role in the
          evolution of the systems.

          Title:  Mapping  Large-Scale  Gaseous Outflows in Ultraluminous
          Infrared  Galaxies  with Keck II ESI Spectra: Spatial Extent of
          the Outflow
          Authors: Crystal L. Martin (UCSB)
          Comments:  Accepted  to  ApJ.  Text  and figures available as a
          single document at this http URL
          The  kinematics  of  neutral gas and warm ionized gas have been
          mapped in one-dimension across ultraluminous starburst galaxies
          using  interstellar  absorption  and emission lines, in Keck II
          ESI spectra. Blue-shifted absorption is found along more of the
          slit  than  anticipated,  exceeding  scales  of  15  kpc across
          several  systems.  The  large velocity gradient measured across
          some  of  these  outflows is inconsistent with a flow diverging
          from  the  central  starburst  -- angular momentum conservation
          reduces  the  rotational  velocity of an outflow as it expands.
          More widespread star formation, likely triggered by the merger,
          probably  drives  these  outflows, although some models suggest
          the  collision  itself  could  generate a wind by shock heating
          interstellar  gas  throughout  the  disk.  Young  mergers  with
          separated nuclei present the highest outflow masses, due mainly
          to  the larger area over which the cool gas can be detected. In
          a  typical  ULIG,  the  mass  carried  by the cool phase of the
          outflow  is  around  10^8Msun,  or  a  few percent of the total
          dynamical  mass.  Assuming the starburst activity has proceeded
          at the observed rate for the past 10 Myr, the kinetic energy of
          the  cool  outflows  is  a few percent of the supernova energy,
          consistent with starbursts powering the outflows. The cool wind
          is  expected to be accelerated by momentum deposition, possibly
          from  radiation  pressure  as  well  as supernovae. Such models
          imply turn-around radii for the cool outflows of at least 30 to
          90   kpc.   This   cross-section  presents  a  significant  NaI
          absorption  cross  section.  If  most  L  > 0.1L* galaxies pass
          through  a  luminous  starburst  phase,  then  relics  of  cool
          outflows  will  create  a  significant  redshift-path  density.
          Galaxy  formation  models should include this cool phase of the
          outflow in addition to a hot wind in feedback models.

          Title:  Magnetic  draping of merging cores and radio bubbles in
          clusters of galaxies
          Authors: Maxim Lyutikov (UBC)
          Comments: 16 pages, 2 figures
          Sharp  fronts  observed by Chandra satellite between dense cool
          cluster  cores  moving  with  near-sonic  velocity  through the
          hotter intergalactic gas, require strong suppression of thermal
          conductivity  across  the boundary. This may be due to magnetic
          fields  tangential to the contact surface separating two plasma
          components.  We  point  out  that  a super-Alfvenic motion of a
          plasma  cloud  (a  core  of  a merging galaxy) through a weakly
          magnetized  intercluster  medium  leads  to "magnetic draping",
          formation  of a thin, strongly magnetized boundary layer with a
          tangential  magnetic  field. For supersonic cloud motion, M_s >
          1,  magnetic  field inside the layer reaches near-equipartition
          values with thermal pressure. Typical thickness of the layer is
          L  /M_A^2  <<  L,  where  L is the size of the obstacle (plasma
          cloud)  moving  with  Alfven Mach number M_A >> 1. To a various
          degree,  magnetic  draping  occurs both for sub- and supersonic
          flows,  random  and  ordered  magnetic  fields  and it does not
          require  plasma  compressibility. The strongly magnetized layer
          will  thermally isolate the two media and may contribute to the
          Kelvin-Helmholtz  stability  of  the interface. Similar effects
          occur  for  radio  bubbles,  quasi-spherical expanding cavities
          blown  up  by  AGN  jets;  in  this  case  the thickness of the
          external magnetized layer is smaller, L /M_A^3 << L.

          Comments:  4  pages including figures, accepted for publication
          in ApJL
          We  carried  out  a  one-night  optical V and near-infrared JHK
          monitoring  observation of the least luminous Seyfert 1 galaxy,
          NGC4395,  on  2004  May  1, and detected for the first time the
          intraday  flux  variations  in  the  J  and H bands, while such
          variation  was  not clearly seen for the K band. The detected J
          and  H  variations  are synchronized with the flux variation in
          the   V   band,  which  indicates  that  the  intraday-variable
          component  of  near-infrared  continuum emission of the NGC4395
          nucleus  is an extension of power-law continuum emission to the
          near-infrared  and originates in an outer region of the central
          accretion  disk. On the other hand, from our regular program of
          long-term   optical   BVI   and  near-infrared  JHK  monitoring
          observation of NGC4395 from 2004 February 12 until 2005 January
          22,  we  found  large  flux variations in all the bands on time
          scales of days to months. The optical BVI variations are almost
          synchronized  with  each  other,  but  not  completely with the
          near-infrared  JHK  variations.  The  color  temperature of the
          near-infrared variable component is estimated to be T=1320-1710
          K,  in  agreement  with  thermal emission from hot dust tori in
          active  galactic  nuclei (AGNs). We therefore conclude that the
          near-infrared  variation  consists  of  two  components  having
          different  time  scales,  so that a small K-flux variation on a
          time  scale  of  a  few hours would possibly be veiled by large
          variation of thermal dust emission on a time scale of days.

          We  present  new  X-ray  and  optical  spectroscopy of a Type 2
          quasar  candidate  selected  from  a follow-up program of hard,
          optically-dim,  serendipitous  Chandra  sources.  The source is
          confirmed  to  be  a Type 2 quasar at z=0.536 with an intrinsic
          2-10  keV  luminosity L_{2-10}=5x10^{44} h_{0.7}^{-2} erg/s, an
          absorbing column density N_H=8x10^{23} cm^{-2} and a neutral Fe
          K  alpha  line  detected  by  XMM-Newton  EPIC-MOS1  as well as
          Chandra  ACIS-S.  An  extended  optical forbidden emission line
          cloud  is detected at the same redshift, and at about 15 kpc in
          projected separation. This cloud lies in close proximity to the
          peak of the compact steep spectrum radio source 4C+39.29, which
          has  previously been identified with a foreground galaxy in the
          cluster Abell 963. We present evidence to show that 4C+39.29 is
          associated  with  the background X-ray Type 2 quasar. The radio
          luminosity is dominated by lobes with complex structure and the
          radio  core is weak in comparison to narrow-line radio galaxies
          at  the same X-ray luminosity. The morphology and emission line
          properties  of  the  extended  region  are  consistent  with an
          on-going    jet-cloud   interaction.   4C+39.29   possesses   a
          combination  of  high  power  and high absorbing column density
          compared  with  other  X-ray  Type 2 quasars in the literature.
          These  observations  highlight  the efficacy of using X-rays to
          identify the primary energy source of complex radio sources and
          distant obscured AGN.

          in favour of millisecond proto-neutron stars
          Authors:  Jacco  Vink  (1),  Lucien  Kuiper  (2)  ((1)  Utrecht
          University, The Netherlands, (2) SRON Netherlands Institute for
          Space Research, Utrecht, The Netherlands)
          Comments:  Accepted  for publication in MNRAS Letters. 5 pages,
          one color figure
          It  is  generally  accepted that Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs)
          and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) are magnetars, i.e. neutron
          stars  with extremely high surface magnetic fields (B > 10^{14}
          G).  The origin of these high magnetic fields is uncertain, but
          a popular hypothesis is that magnetars are born with an initial
          spin  period close to the break-up limit (~1 ms), which results
          in a powerful dynamo action, amplifying the seed magnetic field
          to  >  10^{15}  G. A neutron star spinning at such a rate has a
          rotational  energy  in  excess of 10^{52} erg, and part of that
          energy will power the supernova through rapid magnetic braking.
          It  is  therefore  expected  that  if  magnetars  are born with
          periods  <  3 ms their supernova remnants should be an order of
          magnitude  more  energetic  than  ordinary  supernova remnants.
          However,  we  list here evidence that the explosion energies of
          these  supernova  remnants associated with AXPs and SGRs -- Kes
          73  (AXP  1E  1841-045),  CTB 109 (AXP 1E2259+586) and N49 (SGR
          0526-66)  --  are  close  to  the canonical supernova explosion
          energy of 10^{51} erg.
          We  therefore  do  not  find evidence that magnetars are formed
          from  rapidly  rotating  proto-neutron  stars, allowing for the
          possibility that they descend from stellar progenitor with high
          magnetic  field cores, and discuss the merits of both formation
          scenarios.
          In   an   appendix  we  describe  the  analysis  of  XMM-Newton
          observations  of  Kes  73  and N49 used to derive the explosion
          energies for these remnants.

          MNRAS. Part I is currently with the referee
          Applications  of the phase space approach to the calculation of
          the  microlensing  autocorrelation  function are presented. The
          continuous  propagation equation for a random star field with a
          Gaussian   velocity  distribution  is  solved  in  the  leading
          non-trivial  approximation using the perturbation technique. It
          is  shown that microlensing modulations can be important in the
          interpretation  of  optical and shorter-wavelength light curves
          of  pulsars,  power  spectra  of  active  galactic  nuclei  and
          coherence  estimates  for  quasi-periodic oscillations of dwarf
          novae  and  low-mass  X-ray  binaries.  Extra  scatter  in  the
          brightness   of   type   Ia  supernovae  due  to  gravitational
          microlensing  is  shown  to  be  of  order  up  to  0.2 stellar
          magnitudes depending on the extent of the light curves.

          We  report on the XMM-Newton observation of the Be/neutron star
          X-ray  binary  system  RX  J0146.9+6121, a long period (~ 23 m)
          pulsar  in  the  NGC  663  open  cluster.  The X-ray luminosity
          decreased  by  a  factor  two  compared to the last observation
          carried  out  in  1998,  reaching a level of ~ 10^34 erg/s, the
          lowest  ever  observed  in  this  source. The spectral analysis
          reveals  the  presence  of a significant excess at low energies
          over the main power-law spectral component. The soft excess can
          be  described  by  a  black-body spectrum with a temperature of
          about  1  keV  and an emitting region with a radius of ~ 140 m.
          Although  the  current  data do not permit to ascertain whether
          the soft excess is pulsed or not, its properties are consistent
          with  emission  from  the  neutron  star polar cap. This is the
          third  detection  of a soft excess in a low luminosity (~ 10^34
          erg/s)   pulsar,  the  other  being  X  Per  and  3A  0535+262,
          suggesting that such spectral component, observed up to date in
          higher  luminosity  systems,  is  a  rather  common  feature of
          accreting  X-ray  pulsars.  The  results on these three sources
          indicate that, in low luminosity systems, the soft excess tends
          to have a higher temperature and a smaller surface area than in
          the high luminosity ones.

          from Spectro-Photometry
          Authors: J.-J. Fleck, C. M. Boily, A. Lanon, S. Deiters
          Comments:  20  pages,  16  figures, accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          The  mass  of  unresolved  young  star  clusters  derived  from
          spectro-photometric  data  may  well be off by a factor of 2 or
          more  once  the  migration  of  massive  stars  driven  by mass
          segregation  is  accounted  for.  We quantify this effect for a
          large  set  of  cluster parameters, including variations in the
          stellar IMF, the intrinsic cluster mass, and mean mass density.
          Gas-dynamical   models   coupled  with  the  Cambridge  stellar
          evolution  tracks  allow  us  to derive a scheme to recover the
          real   cluster   mass   given   measured   half-light   radius,
          one-dimensional  velocity  dispersion  and  age. We monitor the
          evolution  with  time  of  the  ratio  of real to apparent mass
          through  the  parameter  eta. When we compute eta for rich star
          clusters,  we find non-monotonic evolution in time when the IMF
          stretches  beyond a critical cutoff mass of 25.5 solar mass. We
          also  monitor the rise of color gradients between the inner and
          outer volume of clusters: we find trends in time of the stellar
          IMF  power  indices overlapping well with those derived for the
          LMC  cluster  NGC  1818  at an age of 30 Myr. We argue that the
          core  region  of massive Antennae clusters should have suffered
          from  much  segregation  despite their low ages. We apply these
          results  to  a cluster mass function, and find that the peak of
          the  mass  distribution  would  appear  to observers shifted to
          lower  masses  by  as  much as 0.2 dex. The star formation rate
          (SFR) derived for the cluster population is then underestimated
          by from 20 to 50 per cent.

          Title:  The  $\dot{M}  -  M$  relationship in pre-main sequence
          stars
          Authors: C.J.Clarke, J.E.Pringle
          Comments: accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  examine  the  recent  data  and  analysis  of  Natta et al.
          concerning  the  accretion rate on to young stars as a function
          of  stellar  mass,  and  conclude  that  the  apparently  steep
          dependence  of  accretion  rate  on  mass is strongly driven by
          selection/detection  thresholds.  We  argue  that  a convincing
          demonstration  of a physical relationship between accretion and
          stellar mass requires further studies which, as is the case for
          Natta  et  al.,  include information on upper limits, and which
          quantify the possible incompleteness of the sample, at both low
          and high accretion rates. We point out that the distribution of
          detections  in  the  ($M,  \dot{M}$)-plane  is  consistent with
          conventional accretion disc models, and that higher sensitivity
          observations   might   be   able  to  test  the  hypothesis  of
          accelerated disc clearing at late times.

          The  observational  data  on  CMB  radiation  revealed that our
          Universe can be an ordinary physical object moving with respect
          to  the  Earth  observer  with the occasional initial data. The
          simplest  fit  of  the  observational  CMB data is given in the
          framework of the fundamental operator quantization of GR and SM
          that  includes  occasional  gauge-invariant and frame-covariant
          initial data and their units of measurement.

          Title:  Determining the H+ Region/PDR Equation of State in Star
          Forming Regions
          Authors: N. P. Abel, G. J. Ferland
          Comments: 21 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          The  emission  line  regions  of  starburst galaxies and active
          nuclei  reveal a wealth of spectroscopic information. A unified
          picture  of  the  relationship  between  ionized,  atomic,  and
          molecular  gas  makes  it  possible  to better understand these
          observations. We performed a series of calculations designed to
          determine  the  equation  of  state,  the  relationship between
          density,   temperature,  and  pressure,  through  emission-line
          diagnostic  ratios  that  form  in  the  H+  region and PDR. We
          consider  a wide range of physical conditions in the H+ region.
          We connect the H+ region to the PDR by considering two constant
          pressure  cases,  one  with no magnetic field and one where the
          magnetic  field  overwhelms  the thermal pressure. We show that
          diagnostic ratios can yield the equation of state for single H+
          regions  adjacent  to  single PDRs, with the results being more
          ambiguous  when considering observations of entire galaxies. As
          a  test,  we  apply our calculations to the Orion H+/PDR region
          behind  the Trapezium. We find the ratio of thermal to magnetic
          pressure  in  the  PDR  to  be \~1.2. If magnetic and turbulent
          energy  are  in  equipartition,  our  results mean the magnetic
          field  is  not the cause of the unexplained broadening in M 42,
          but  may significantly affect line broadening in the PDR. Since
          Orion  is  often  used  to  understand  physical  processes  in
          extragalactic  environments,  our calculations suggest magnetic
          pressure should be considered in modeling such regions.

          Title:  SiO  in  C-rich  circumstellar  envelopes of AGB stars:
          effects of non-LTE chemistry and grain adsorption
          Authors: F. L. Schoeier, H. Olofsson, A. A. Lundgren
          Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A, 11 pages, 7 figures
          New  SiO  multi-transition  millimetre  line  observations of a
          sample  of  carbon stars, including J=8-7 observations with the
          APEX  telescope,  are used to probe the role of non-equilibrium
          chemistry   and   the  influence  of  grains  in  circumstellar
          envelopes  of  carbon  stars.  A  detailed  radiative  transfer
          modelling,  including  the  effect  of  dust  emission  in  the
          excitation  analysis,  of  the  observed  SiO  line emission is
          performed.  A  combination  of  low-  and high-energy lines are
          important  in  constraining  the  abundance distribution. It is
          found  that  the  fractional  abundance  of SiO in these C-rich
          environments  can  be  several  orders of magnitude higher than
          predicted by equilibrium stellar atmosphere chemistry. In fact,
          the  SiO  abundance  distribution of carbon stars closely mimic
          that  of  M-type (O-rich) AGB stars. A possible explanation for
          this  behaviour  is  a  shock-induced  chemistry,  but also the
          influence  of  dust  grains,  both as a source for depletion as
          well as production of SiO, needs to be further investigated. As
          observed  for  M-type  AGB  stars,  a  clear trend that the SiO
          fractional  abundance  decreases  as  the mass-loss rate of the
          star  increases  is  found for the carbon stars. This indicates
          that  SiO  is  accreted  onto  dust grains in the circumstellar
          envelopes.

          We  present  a systematic search for disks in 476 Virgo cluster
          early-type  dwarf  (dE)  galaxies.  Disk features (spiral arms,
          edge-on  disks,  or  bars)  were identified by applying unsharp
          masks  to  a combined image from three bands (g, r, i), as well
          as  by  subtracting the axisymmetric light distribution of each
          galaxy   from   that   image.   14   objects   are  unambiguous
          identifications  of  disks,  10  objects  show  'probable disk'
          features,  and  17  objects  show 'possible disk' features. The
          number  fraction  of these galaxies, for which we introduce the
          term  dEdi,  reaches  more than 50% at the bright end of the dE
          population,  and decreases to less than 5% for magnitudes B>16.
          The  luminosity function of our full dE sample can be explained
          by   a  superposition  of  dEdis  and  ordinary  dEs,  strongly
          suggesting  that  dEdis  are a distinct type of galaxy. This is
          supported  by  the  projected  spatial distribution: dEdis show
          basically   no   clustering  and  roughly  follow  the  spatial
          distribution  of  spirals  and irregulars, whereas ordinary dEs
          are  distributed  similarly  to  the  strongly  clustered  E/S0
          galaxies.  While the flattening distribution of ordinary dEs is
          typical  for  spheroidal  objects, the distribution of dEdis is
          significantly different and agrees with their being flat oblate
          objects.   We   therefore  conclude  that  the  dEdis  are  not
          spheroidal  galaxies that just have an embedded disk component,
          but  are instead a population of genuine disk galaxies. Several
          dEdis  display  well-defined  spiral  arms  with  grand  design
          features  that  clearly  differ  from the flocculent, open arms
          typical   for  late-type  spirals  that  have  frequently  been
          proposed  as  progenitors of early-type dwarfs. This raises the
          question  of  what process is able to create such spiral arms -
          with  pitch angles like those of Sab/Sb galaxies - in bulgeless
          dwarf galaxies. (Abridged)

          (projected)
          Seyfert  galaxies commonly host compact jets spanning 10-100 pc
          scales,  but  larger structures (KSRs) are resolved out in long
          baseline,  aperture  synthesis  surveys. We report a new, short
          baseline  Very Large Array (VLA) survey of a complete sample of
          Seyfert  and  LINER  galaxies.  Out  of  all  of  the  surveyed
          radio-quiet  sources,  we find that 44% (19 / 43) show extended
          radio  structures  at  least  1 kpc in total extent that do not
          match the morphology of the disk or its associated star-forming
          regions.  The KSR Seyferts stand out by deviating significantly
          from  the  far-infrared  -  radio  correlation for star-forming
          galaxies,  and  they  are  more  likely  to  have  a relatively
          luminous,  compact  radio  source in the nucleus; these results
          argue  that  KSRs are powered by the AGN rather than starburst.
          KSRs   probably   originate  from  jet  plasma  that  has  been
          decelerated by interaction with the nuclear ISM. We demonstrate
          the  jet loses virtually all of its power to the ISM within the
          inner kiloparsec to form the slow KSRs.

          Title:  Laboratory  Plasma  Dynamos, Astrophysical Dynamos, and
          Magnetic Helicity Evolution
          Authors: Eric G. Blackman, Hantao Ji
          Comments: accepted by MNRAS
          The  term  ``dynamo''  means different things to the laboratory
          fusion   plasma   and   astrophysical  plasma  communities.  To
          alleviate   the   resulting   confusion   and   to   facilitate
          interdisciplinary  progress, we pinpoint conceptual differences
          and   similarities   between   laboratory  plasma  dynamos  and
          astrophysical  dynamos. We can divide dynamos into three types:
          1. magnetically dominated helical dynamos which sustain a large
          scale  magnetic  field  against  resistive  decay and drive the
          magnetic   geometry   toward   the   lowest  energy  state,  2.
          flow-driven  helical  dynamos  which  amplify  or sustain large
          scale  magnetic  fields  in an otherwise turbulent flow, and 3.
          flow-driven  nonhelical  dynamos which amplify fields on scales
          at  or  below  the driving turbulence. We discuss how all three
          types  occur  in astrophysics whereas plasma confinement device
          dynamos  are  of  the  first  type.  Type 3 dynamos requires no
          magnetic  or  kinetic  helicity of any kind. Focusing on type 1
          and 2 dynamos, we show how different limits of a unified set of
          equations for magnetic helicity evolution reveal both types. We
          explicitly  describe a steady-state example of a type 1 dynamo,
          and  three  examples  of  type 2 dynamos: (i) closed volume and
          time  dependent;  (ii) steady-state with open boundaries; (iii)
          time dependent with open boundaries.

          We  are  conducting  a large observing program with the Spitzer
          Space  Telescope  to determine the mid-to-far infrared spectral
          energy  distributions of a well-defined sample of 87 nearby, 12
          micron-selected  Seyfert galaxies. In this paper we present the
          results  of  IRS low-resolution spectroscopy of a statistically
          representative  subsample  of 51 of the galaxies (59%), with an
          analysis  of  the  continuum  shapes  and  a  comparison of the
          Seyfert  types.  We  find  that the spectra clearly divide into
          groups  based  on their continuum shapes and spectral features.
          Some  spectral  features  are  clearly  related  to a starburst
          contribution to the IR spectrum, while the mechanisms producing
          observed  power-law  continuum  shapes,  attributed  to  an AGN
          component,  may  be  dust or non-thermal emission. The infrared
          spectral  types  appear  to  be  related  to the Seyfert types.
          Principal  component analysis results suggest that the relative
          contribution of starburst emission may be the dominant cause of
          variance  in  the  observed  spectra.  We find that Sy 1's have
          higher ratios of IR/radio emission than Sy 2's, as predicted by
          the  unified  model  if  the  torus  is  optically thick in the
          mid-IR.  However,  smooth-density  torus  models predict a much
          larger difference between type 1's and 2's than observed in our
          sample.  Our  observations  may be consistent with clumpy torus
          models  containing  a  steep  radial  distribution of optically
          thick dense clumps. (Abridged)

          We  present  new radio observations of 9 members of a sample of
          29  nearby  (z  <  0.2)  BL Lac objects. The new data have been
          obtained  with  the  European VLBI Network and/or the MERLIN at
          1.6  and  5  GHz  and complement previous observations. For one
          object,   the   TeV  source  Mrk  421,  we  also  present  deep
          multi-epoch  VLBA and Global VLBI data, which reveal a resolved
          diffuse  jet, with clear signatures of limb brightening. We use
          the  new  and  old  data to estimate physical parameters of the
          jets of the sample from which the subset with new radio data is
          drawn.  We derive Doppler factors in the parsec scale radio jet
          in  the  range ~2 < delta < ~9. Using HST data, we separate the
          contribution  of  the host galaxy from that of the active core.
          From  the  measured  and  de-beamed observables, we find a weak
          correlation  between  radio  power  and  black hole mass, and a
          tight  correlation between radio and optical core luminosities.
          We  interpret  this  result  in  terms  of a common synchrotron
          origin,  with  little contribution from a radiatively efficient
          accretion  disk.  The  BL  Lacs  in  our  sample have de-beamed
          properties  similar  to low power radio galaxies, including the
          fundamental plane of black hole activity.

          Title:  Non-existence  of  self-similar  solutions containing a
          black  hole in a universe with a stiff fluid or scalar field or
          quintessence
          Authors: Tomohiro Harada, Hideki Maeda, B. J. Carr
          Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. D
          We  consider  the  possible existence of self-similar solutions
          containing  black  holes in a Friedmann background with a stiff
          fluid  or  a  scalar field. We carefully study the relationship
          between  the  self-similar  equations  in  these  two cases and
          emphasize  the  crucial role of the similarity horizon. We show
          that there is no self-similar black hole solution surrounded by
          an exact or asymptotically flat Friedmann background containing
          a massless scalar field. This applies even if there is a scalar
          potential,  as  in  the quintessence scenario. This extends the
          result  previously  found  in the stiff fluid case and strongly
          suggests   that   accretion  onto  primordial  black  holes  is
          ineffective  even  during  scalar  field  domination.  It  also
          contradicts  recent  claims  that  such  black  holes  can grow
          appreciably by accreting quintessence. Appreciable growth might
          be  possible  with very special matter fields but this requires
          {\it ad hoc} and probably unphysical conditions.

          radio galaxies across 1<z<5.2. Using IRAC, IRS and MIPS imaging
          we  determine  the  rest-frame  AGN contribution to the stellar
          emission  peak  at 1.6um. The stellar luminosities are found to
          be  consistent  with  that of a giant elliptical with a stellar
          mass of 10^11-12Msun. The mean stellar mass remains constant at
          \~10^11.5Msun  up  to  z=3 indicating that the upper end of the
          mass  function is already in place by this redshift. The mid-IR
          luminosities   imply  bolometric  IR  luminosities  that  would
          classify  all sources as ULIRGs. The mid-IR to radio luminosity
          generally   correlate   implying  a  common  origin  for  these
          emissions.  The  ratio  is  higher  than  that  found for lower
          redshift, ie z<1, radio galaxies.

          We  investigate the role of the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG)

          evolution of Ks-selected galaxies and, in particular, Extremely
          Red  Galaxies  (ERGs). With this aim, we compare the properties

          GOODS/CDFS  with  the sub-sample of those 696 sources which are
          detected  at  24  microns. We find that LIRGs constitute 30% of
          the  galaxies  with  stellar mass M>1x10^{11} Msun assembled at
          redshift   z=0.5.  A  minimum  of  65%  of  the  galaxies  with
          M>2.5x10^{11}  Msun at z~2-3 are ULIRGs at those redshifts. 60%
          of  the ULIRGs in our sample have the characteristic colours of
          ERGs.   Conversely,   40%   of   the  ERGs  with  stellar  mass
          M>1.3x10^{11}  Msun  at 1.5<z<2.0 and a minimum of 52% of those

          basically  no  difference,  suggesting  that  both  populations
          contain  the  same kind of objects in different phases of their
          lives.
          LIRGs and ULIRGs have an important role in galaxy evolution and
          mass  assembly,  and,  although  they  are only able to trace a
          fraction  of the massive (M>1x10^{11} Msun) galaxies present in
          the  Universe  at  a  given  time,  this  fraction becomes very
          significant (>50%) at redshifts z>~2.

          Title: X-ray number counts of normal galaxies

          We  use  the number counts of X-ray selected normal galaxies to
          explore their evolution by combining the most recent wide-angle
          shallow   and   pencil-beam   deep   samples   available.   The
          differential   X-ray   number  counts,  dN/dS,  for  early  and
          late-type  normal  galaxies are constructed separately and then
          compared  with  the  predictions  of the local X-ray luminosity
          function  under  different  evolution  scenarios.  The dN/dS of
          early  type  galaxies  is  consistent  with no evolution out to
          z~0.5.  For late-type galaxies our analysis suggests that it is
          the  sources  with  X-ray--to--optical flux ratio logfx/fopt>-2
          that  are  evolving the fastest. Including these systems in the
          late-type   galaxy   sample   yields   evolution  of  the  form
          ~(1+z)^{2.7}  out  to  z~0.4. On the contrary late-type sources
          with  logfx/fopt<-2  are  consistent  with  no  evolution. This
          suggests  that  the logfx/fopt>-2 population comprises the most
          powerful  and  fast evolving starbursts at moderate and high-z.
          We    argue   that   although   residual   low-luminosity   AGN
          contamination  may  bias our results toward stronger evolution,
          this is unlikely to modify our main conclusions.

          Title:  ACIS-I  observations  of  NGC2264. Membership and X-ray
          properties of PMS stars

          13 is available at this http URL)
          We  analyze  a deep, 100 ksec long, Chandra ACIS observation of
          NGC2264.  We  detect  420  sources, 85% of which are associated
          with known optical and NIR counterparts. More than 90% of these
          counterparts are NGC2264 members, thus significantly increasing
          the  known  low  mass  cluster population by about 100 objects.
          Among the sources without counterpart, ~50% are likely members,
          several   of   which   we   expect  to  be  previously  unknown
          protostellar  objects.  We confirm several previous findings on
          the  X-ray  activity of low mass PMS stars: X-ray luminosity is
          related  to  stellar  mass,  although  with  a  large  scatter;
          L_X/L_bol   is   close  to  but  almost  invariably  below  the
          saturation  level,  1e-3.  A  comparison  between CTTS and WTTS
          shows several differences: CTTS are on average less active than
          WTTS;  their  emission may also be more time variable and is on
          average slightly harder. However, we find evidence in some CTTS
          of  extremely  cool, ~0.1-0.2 keV, plasma which we speculate is
          heated  by  accretion  shocks. We conclude that activity in low
          mass PMS stars, while generally similar to that of saturated MS
          stars,  may  be  affected  by  mass  accretion in several ways:
          accretion  is  likely  responsible for very soft X-ray emission
          directly  produced  in  the  accretion shock; it may reduce the
          average  energy  output of solar-like coronae, at the same time
          making them hotter and more dynamic.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ: 20 pages, 5 figures
          We  present  new  results  from  a  study  of high quality, red
          spectra  of  the  massive binary star system HD 1383 (B0.5 Ib +
          B0.5  Ib).  We determined radial velocities and revised orbital
          elements   (P  =  20.28184  +/-  0.0002  d)  and  made  Doppler
          tomographic   reconstructions   of  the  component  spectra.  A
          comparison  of  these  with  model  spectra  from non-LTE, line
          blanketed  atmospheres  indicates  that  both stars have almost
          identical  masses  (M_2/M_1  =  1.020  +/- 0.014), temperatures
          (T_eff  = 28000 +/- 1000 K), gravities (log g = 3.25 +/- 0.25),
          and  projected  rotational  velocities  (V sin i < 30 km/s). We
          investigate  a number of constraints on the radii and masses of
          the  stars based upon the absence of eclipses, surface gravity,
          stellar  wind  terminal  velocity, and probable location in the
          Perseus spiral arm of the Galaxy, and these indicate a range in
          probable  radius and mass of R/R_sun = 14 - 20 and M/M_sun = 16
          -  35,  respectively.  These  values  are consistent with model
          evolutionary  masses  for  single stars of this temperature and
          gravity.  Both  stars  are  much  smaller than their respective
          Roche  radii,  so the system is probably in a pre-contact stage
          of   evolution.   A   fit   of  the  system's  spectral  energy
          distribution  yields  a reddening of E(B-V)=0.55 +/- 0.05 and a
          ratio  of  total-to-selective extinction of R=2.97 +/- 0.15. We
          find  no  evidence  of  H-alpha emission from colliding stellar
          winds,  which  is  probably  the  consequence  of  the  low gas
          densities in the colliding winds zone.

          Title: Acceleration from M theory and Fine-tuning

          Comments:  9  pages,  3  figures,  use  iopart,  v2; references
          updated, accepted for publication in Class. Quantum Grav
          The compactification of M theory with time dependent hyperbolic
          internal space gives an effective scalar field with exponential
          potential  which  provides a transient acceleration in Einstein
          frame  in  four  dimensions.  Ordinary matter and radiation are
          present   in   addition   to   the  scalar  field  coming  from
          compactification. We find that we have to fine-tune the initial
          conditions of the scalar field so that our Universe experiences
          acceleration  now.  During  the  evolution of our Universe, the
          volume of the internal space increases about 12 times. The time
          variation  of  the  internal  space  results  in  a  large time
          variation  of  the  fine  structure constant which violates the
          observational constraint on the variation of the fine structure
          constant. The large variation of the fine structure constant is
          a generic feature of transient acceleration models.

          gravitational wave searches
          Authors: Chris Van Den Broeck
          Comments: 9 pages, 1 figure
          The   signal-to-noise  ratios  (SNRs)  for  binary  black  hole
          inspirals computed from restricted post-Newtonian waveforms are
          compared  with  those  attained by more complete post-Newtonian
          signals,   which   are  superpositions  of  amplitude-corrected
          harmonics  of  the  orbital  phase.  It  is shown that modeling
          signals   as   restricted   waveforms   can  lead  to  a  large
          overestimation  of  SNRs,  and  hence  of  detection rates. The
          effect   results   entirely   from  the  absence  of  amplitude
          corrections  to the dominant harmonic. By reinstating these, it
          is  possible  to  construct  reliable  waveforms  for simulated
          signals without having to include higher harmonics.

          accretion  disk  due  to  the collision of a star with the disk
          near the black hole
          Authors: Orhan Donmez
          Comments:  20pages,  8  figures,  accepted  for  publication in
          Astrophysics and Space Science
          In  this  paper,  perturbations  of an accretion disk by a star
          orbiting  around  a  black  hole  are  studied.  We report on a
          numerical  experiment,  which  has  been carried out by using a
          parallel-machine   code   originally  developed  by  D\"{o}nmez
          (2004).  An  initially  steady  state  accretion  disk  near  a
          non-rotating   (Schwarzschild)  black  hole  interacts  with  a
          "star",  modeled  as  an initially circular region of increased
          density.  Part  of  the disk is affected by the interaction. In
          some  cases,  a  gap develops and shock wave propagates through
          the  disk.  We  follow the evolution for order of one dynamical
          period and we show how the non-axisymetric density perturbation
          further  evolves  and moves downwards where the material of the
          disk  and  the star become eventually accreted onto the central
          body.
          When  the  star  perturbs  the steady state accretion disk, the
          disk  around  the  black  hole  is  destroyed  by the effect of
          perturbation. The perturbed accretion disk creates a shock wave
          during the evolution and it loses angular momentum when the gas
          hits  on  the shock waves. Colliding gas with the shock wave is
          the  one of the basic mechanism of emitting the $X-$rays in the
          accretion disk. The series of supernovae occurring in the inner
          disk  could  entirely  destroy  the  disk  in that region which
          leaves  a  more  massive  black  hole  behind, at the center of
          galaxies.

          I discuss constraints on star formation and AGN in massive, red
          galaxies at z~1-3 using Spitzer observations at 3-24 micron. In
          particular  I  focus on a sample of distant red galaxies (DRGs)
          with  J  -  K > 2.3 in the southern Great Observatories Origins
          Deep  Survey  (GOODS-S)  field.  The  DRGs have typical stellar
          masses  >10^11 solar masses. Interestingly, the majority (>50%)
          of these objects have 24 micron flux densities >50 micro-Jy. At
          these  redshifts massive galaxies undergo intense (and possibly
          frequent)   IR-active   phases,   which   is  in  constrast  to
          lower-redshift  massive  galaxies. If the 24 micron emission in
          these  z~1-3  galaxies is attributed to star formation, then it
          implies  star  formation  rates  (SFRs) in excess of ~100 solar
          masses  per year. These galaxies have specific SFRs equal to or
          exceeding the global average value at that epoch. Thus, this is
          an  active  period  in  their  assembly.  Based  on their X-ray
          luminosities  and near-IR colors, as many as 25% of the massive
          galaxies  at  z>1.5  host  AGN,  suggesting  that the growth of
          supermassive   black   holes   coincides   with  massive-galaxy
          assembly.

          Title:  Bringing  VY  Canis  Majoris  Down to Size: An Improved
          Determination of Its Effective Tempeature
          Authors: Philip Massey, Emily M. Levesque, Bertrand Plez
          Comments: Accepted by the Astrophysical Journal
          The  star  VY  CMa  is  a  late-type  M  supergiant  with  many
          peculiarities,  mostly  related  to  the  intense circumstellar
          environment  due to the star's high mass-loss rate. Claims have
          been  made  that  would  suggest this star is considerably more
          luminous  (L  =  5 x 10^5 Lo) and larger (R=2800 Ro) than other
          Galactic red supergiants (RSGs). Indeed, such a location in the
          H-R diagram would be well in the "Hayashi forbidden zone" where
          stars cannot be in hydrostatic equilibrium. These extraordinary
          properties, however, rest upon an assumed effective temperature
          of  2800-3000 K, far cooler than recent work have shown RSGs to
          be.  To  obtain  a  better  estimate,  we  fit  newly  obtained
          spectrophotometry  in  the  optical and NIR with the same MARCS
          models  used  for  our  recent  determination  of  the physical
          properties  of other RSGs; we also use $V-K$ and $V-J$ from the
          literature  to  derive  an effective temperatures. We find that
          the star likely has a temperature of 3650 K, a luminosity L = 6
          x  10^4  Lo, and a radius of 600Ro. These values are consistent
          with VY CMa being an ordinary evolved 15 Mo RSG, and agree well
          with   the   Geneva  evolutionary  tracks.  We  find  that  the
          circumstellar  dust  region  has a temperature of 760 K, and an
          effective radius of approximately 130 AU, if spherical geometry
          is assumed for the latter. What causes this star to have such a
          high  mass-loss,  and  large variations in brightness (but with
          little change in color), remains a mystery at present, although
          we  speculate  that  perhaps this star (and NML Cyg) are simply
          normal RSGs caught during an unusually unstable time.

          Title:  A Survey for Spectroscopic Binaries Among Very Low-Mass
          Stars
          Authors: Gibor Basri, Ansgar Reiners
          Comments:  36  pages,  accepted for publication in AJ, abstract
          shortened for arXiv.org
          We  report  on  the  results  of  a  survey for radial velocity
          variability  in  a  heterogeneous sample of very low-mass stars
          and  brown  dwarfs.  One  distinguishing  characteristic of the
          survey  is  its  timespan,  which  allows  an  overlap  between
          spectroscopic  binaries  and  those  which can be found by high
          angular-resolution   imaging.  We  are  able  to  place  a  new
          constraint on the total binary fraction in these objects, which
          suggests  that they are more likely the result of extending the
          same  processes  at work at higher masses into this mass range,
          rather  than  a distinct mode of formation. Our basic result is
          that  there  are  $6 \pm 2$ out of 53, or $11^{+0.07}_{-0.04}$%
          spectroscopic  binaries  in the separation range 0-6 AU, nearly
          as  many  as resolved binaries. This leads to an estimate of an
          upper  limit  of  $26  \pm  10$% for the binary fraction of VLM
          objects  (it  is an upper limit because of the possible overlap
          between   the   spectroscopic   and  resolved  populations).  A
          reasonable  estimate  for  the very low-mass binary fraction is
          $20  -  25$%.  We  consider  several  possible  separation  and
          frequency distributions, including the same one as found for GK
          stars,   a  compressed  version  of  that,  a  version  of  the
          compressed  distribution  truncated at 15 AU, and a theoretical
          distribution   which   considers  the  evaporation  of  small-N
          clusters.   We   conclude  that  the  latter  two  bracket  the
          observations,  which  may  mean  that  these  systems form with
          intrinsically  smaller  separations  due to their smaller mass,
          and  then are truncated due to their smaller binding energy. We
          do  not  find  support for the ``ejection hypothesis'' as their
          dominant  mode  of  formation,  particularly  in  view  of  the
          similarity  in the total binary fraction compared with slightly
          more  massive  stars,  and the difficulty this mechanism has in
          producing numerous binary systems.

          2 tables + 14 figures
          We  analyze extensive data on NGC1377 from the Spitzer Infrared
          Nearby  Galaxies Survey (SINGS). Within the category of nascent
          starbursts,  that  we  previously selected by their infrared to
          radio continuum ratios in large excess of the average and their
          hot dust, NGC1377 has the largest infrared excess yet measured.
          Optical  imaging  reveals a morphological distortion suggestive
          of  a  recent  accretion event. Infrared spectroscopy reveals a
          compact  and  opaque  source  dominated by a hot, self-absorbed
          continuum (tau ~ 20 in the 10 micron silicate band). We provide
          physical   evidence  against  non-stellar  activity  being  the
          heating  source.  HII  regions  are detected through the single
          [NeII] line, probing <1% of the ionizing radiation. Not only is
          the  optical  depth very high, but >85% of ionizing photons are
          suppressed  by  dust. The only other detected emission features
          are  molecular  hydrogen  lines,  arguably  excited  mainly  by
          shocks,  besides  photodissociation  regions, and weak aromatic
          bands. The new observations support our interpretation in terms
          of  an  extremely  young  starburst  (<1  Myr). More generally,
          galaxies  deficient  in  radio  synchrotron are likely observed
          within  a  few Myr of the onset of a starburst and after a long
          quiescence,  prior  to the replenishment of the ISM with cosmic
          rays. The similar infrared-radio properties of NGC1377 and some
          infrared-luminous  galaxies suggest that NGC1377 constitutes an
          archetype  to  better  understand starburst evolution. Although
          rare  locally  because  observed in a brief evolutionary stage,
          nascent  starbursts  may represent a non-negligible fraction of
          merger-induced  starbursts  dominating  deep  infrared  counts.
          Since  they differ dramatically from usual starburst templates,
          they bear important consequences for the interpretation of deep

          Title:  Accretion  column  structure  of  magnetic  cataclysmic
          variables from X-ray spectroscopy
          Authors: R. Hoogerwerf, N.S. Brickhouse, C.W. Mauche
          Comments:  12 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in the
          ApJ Letters
          Using  Chandra HETG data we present light curves for individual
          spectral  lines  of  Mg  XI  and  Mg  XII  for  EX  Hydrae,  an
          intermediate-polar  type  cataclysmic variable. The Mg XI light
          curve,  folded on the white dwarf spin period, shows two spikes
          that  are  not  seen  in the Mg XII or broad-band light curves.
          Occultation  of  the  accretion column by the body of the white
          dwarf  would  produce  such  spikes  for  an  angle between the
          rotation  axis  and the accretion columns of alpha = 18 degrees
          and  a  height  of  the  Mg  XI  emission above the white dwarf
          surface of < 0.0004 white dwarf radii or < 4 km. The absence of
          spikes  in the Mg XII and broad-band light curves could then be
          explained  if  the  bulk  of  its emission forms at much larger
          height,  >  0.004 white dwarf radii or > 40 km, above the white
          dwarf  surface,  although  this  is  not  consistent  with  the
          predictions of the standard Aizu model of the accretion column.

          Title:  Millimagnitude  Optical  Photometry  for the Transiting
          Planetary Candidate OGLE-TR-109
          Authors:   Jose   Miguel  Fernandez,  Dante  Minniti,  Grzegorz

          We  present  precise  V-band  photometry  for the low-amplitude
          transit  candidate  star  OGLE-TR-109.  This is an extreme case
          among the transiting candidates found by the OGLE group because
          of  the  early  spectral  type  of  the  star (F0V), of the low
          transit amplitude (A_I=0.008 mag), and of the very short period
          (P=0.58909  days)  of  the orbiting companion. Using difference
          image  photometry, we are able to achieve millimagnitude errors
          in the individual data points. One transit of this star is well
          defined  in  our  light curve. This confirms the OGLE detection
          and  rules  out  the  possibility  of  a  false  positive.  The
          measurement  of  this  transit  allows  to  refine  the transit
          amplitude  (A_V=0.006  +/-  0.001 mag), and the ephemerides for
          this  interesting system, as well as the radius of the possible
          orbiting   companion   (R_P=0.90   +/-   0.09  ~R_J),  and  the
          inclination  of  the orbit (i=77 +/- 5 deg). Two other transits
          observed  at  lower  S/N  confirm  the  period  of  this system
          measured  by  OGLE.  There  is  no  evidence for a blend of the
          F-type  main  sequence  star with a redder eclipsing binary, or
          for secondary transits in the present observations. The absence
          of  ellipsoidal  modulation  in  the light curve of the primary
          rules  out  a  low mass star companion or brown dwarf with M>14
          +/-  8  M_J.  The remaining possibilities for OGLE-TR-109 are a
          blend between the F-type star and a binary with a bluer primary
          star, or a new transiting extrasolar planet.

          Title: Dynamical Masses in Luminous Infrared Galaxies
          Authors:  Joannah  L.  Hinz,  George  H.  Rieke  (University of
          Arizona)
          Comments: 14 pages, 2 figures, accepted to ApJ
          We  have  studied  the  dynamics  and masses of a sample of ten
          nearby  luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGS and
          ULIRGs),  using  2.3 micron CO absorption line spectroscopy and
          near-infrared  H-  and  Ks-band  imaging. By combining velocity
          dispersions  derived  from the spectroscopy, disk scale-lengths
          obtained  from  the  imaging, and a set of likely model density
          profiles,  we calculate dynamical masses for each LIRG. For the
          majority  of  the sample, it is difficult to reconcile our mass
          estimates with the large amounts of gas derived from millimeter
          observations and from a standard conversion between CO emission
          and  H_2  mass.  Our  results imply that LIRGs do not have huge
          amounts of molecular gas (10^10-10^11 Msolar) at their centers,
          and  support  previous indications that the standard conversion
          of  CO  to H_2 probably overestimates the gas masses and cannot
          be  used in these environments. This in turn suggests much more
          modest levels of extinction in the near-infrared for LIRGs than
          previously predicted (A_V~10-20 versus A_V~100-1000). The lower
          gas mass estimates indicated by our observations imply that the
          star  formation efficiency in these systems is very high and is
          triggered  by  cloud-cloud collisions, shocks, and winds rather
          than by gravitational instabilities in circumnuclear gas disks.

          Title: The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array
          Authors: R N Manchester
          Comments: 10 pages, in press ChJAA
          Given  sufficient  sensitivity,  pulsar timing observations can
          make a direct detection of gravitational waves passing over the
          Earth.  Pulsar  timing is most sensitive to gravitational waves
          with  frequencies in the nanoHertz region, with the most likely
          astronomical  sources being binary super-massive black holes in
          galaxy  cores.  The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project uses the
          Parkes   64-m   radio   telescope   to  make  precision  timing
          observations of a sample of about 20 millisecond pulsars with a
          principal  goal  of  making a direct detection of gravitational
          waves.  Observations  commenced  about  one year ago and so far
          sub-microsecond  timing  residuals  have been achieved for more
          than  half  of these pulsars. New receiver and software systems
          are being developed with the aim of reducing these residuals to
          the  level  believed  necessary  for  a  positive  detection of
          gravitational waves.

          Title: The blue stragglers formed via mass transfer in old open
          clusters
          Authors: B. Tian, L. Deng, Z. Han, X.B. Zhang
          Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures, A&A accepted
          In  this  paper,  we present the simulations for the primordial
          blue  stragglers  in the old open cluster M67 based on detailed
          modelling  of  the evolutionary processes. The principal aim is
          to discuss the contribution to the blue straggler population in
          M67   from  mass  transfer  between  the  components  of  close
          binaries.  Firstly,  we  follow  the  evolution  of a binary of
          1.4M$_\odot$+0.9M$_\odot$.  The synthetic evolutionary track of
          the  binary system reveals that a primordial blue straggler can
          stay  at  the observed blue straggler region in Color-Magnitude
          diagram  with a long lifetime to secure observable probability.
          Secondly, a grid of models of close binary systems experiencing
          mass  exchanging  are  computed  from  1Gyr to 6Gyr in order to
          account  for  primordial  blue  straggler  formation  in a time
          sequence.  Based  on  such  a grid, Monte-Carlo simulations are
          applied  for  the  old  open  cluster M67. Adopting appropriate
          orbital  parameters, 4 primordial blue stragglers are predicted
          by  our  simulations. This is consistent with the observational
          fact  that  only a few blue stragglers in M67 are binaries with
          short orbital periods. An upper boundary of the primordial blue
          stragglers in the Color-Magnitude diagram is defined and can be
          used  to  distinguish  blue  stragglers that are not formed via
          mass  exchange.  Using  the  grid of binary models, the orbital
          periods  of  the primordial BSs can be predicted. Compared with
          the  observations,  the  predicted  blue  stragglers  via  mass
          exchange  from  the simulations is insufficient to fit the blue
          stragglers population in M67. There should be several processes
          to form the observed blue stragglers in M67.

          Title:  Host  Galaxies  of  Hard  X-ray  Selected Type-2 Active
          Galactic Nuclei at Intermediate Redshifts

          Comments: 21 pages, 8 figures, ApJ accepted
          We  study  properties  of  the  host  galaxies of 15 hard X-ray
          selected  type-2  active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at intermediate
          redshifts   (0.05$<z<$0.6)  detected  in  $ASCA$  surveys.  The
          absorption corrected hard X-ray luminosities $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}$
          range from 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We
          took  the  $R$-band  image of these AGNs with the University of
          Hawaii  2.2m  telescope. Thanks to the intrinsic obscuration of
          nuclear  light,  we  can decompose the galaxies with a spheroid
          component   and   a  disk  component.  The  resulting  spheroid
          luminosities  correlate with $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}$; higher (lower)
          X-ray   luminosity  AGNs  tend  to  reside  in  luminous  (less
          luminous)  spheroids.  It  is  also  found  that  the  hosts of
          luminous  AGNs  show  a large spheroid-to-disk luminosity ratio
          ($\sim$1),  while  those of less luminous AGNs spread between 0
          and  1.  The correlation between $L_{\rm 2-10keV}$ and spheroid
          luminosity  indicates  that  the  relation  between  mass  of a
          supermassive   black   hole   (SMBH)  and  spheroid  luminosity
          (BS-relation)  agrees  with  that  in the local universe if the
          Eddington  ratio  of  0.24  is  adopted,  which is a mean value
          determined  from  our  $ASCA$  type-1  AGN  sample  at  similar
          redshifts   through   the   broad-line   width   and  continuum
          luminosity. The present study demonstrates the effectiveness of
          using  type-  2  AGNs  at  high  redshifts  to study their host
          properties.

          We  describe  a  simple  computer  package  which illustrates a
          method  of  combining  stellar dynamics with stellar evolution.
          Though  the  method  is  intended  for  elaborate  applications
          (especially  the  dynamical evolution of rich star clusters) it
          is  illustrated  here  in the context of three-body scattering,
          i.e.  interactions  between a binary star and a field of single
          stars.  We  describe the interface between the dynamics and the
          two  independent packages which describe the internal evolution
          of   single  stars  and  binaries.  We  also  give  an  example
          application, and introduce a stand alone utility for the visual
          presentation of simulation results.

          We  used  the  photometric  database  of  the Sloan Digital Sky
          Survey  (SDSS)  to  estimate  the  reddening of 13 SDSS quasars
          selected  on the basis of the presence of zinc absorption lines
          in  an  intervening Damped Ly alpha (DLA) system. In 5 of these
          quasars  the reddening is detected at ~2 sigma confidence level
          in  two independent color indices of the SDSS ugriz photometric
          system.  A  detailed analysis of the data supports an origin of
          the  reddening in the intervening absorbers. We used these rare
          measurements of extinction in DLA systems to probe the relation
          between  extinction and metal column density in the interval of
          absorption  redshift  0.7  </~ z </~ 2.0. We find that the mean
          extinction  in  the  V  band  per  atom  of iron in the dust is
          remarkably  similar to that found in interstellar clouds of the
          Milky  Way.  This result lends support to previous estimates of
          the dust obscuration effect in DLA systems based on a Milky Way
          extinction/metal  column  density relation. We propose a simple
          mechanism,    based   on   dust   grain   destruction/accretion
          properties,  which may explain the approximate constancy of the
          extinction per atom of iron in the dust.

          Comments: 9 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  use  full  three-body  scattering  experiments to study the
          ejection  of  hypervelocity  stars (HVSs) by massive black hole
          binaries (MBHBs) at the center of galaxies. Ambient stars drawn
          from  a  Maxwellian  distribution  unbound  to  the  binary are
          expelled  by the gravitational slingshot. Accurate measurements
          of   thermally   averaged   hardening,   mass   ejection,   and
          eccentricity  growth  rates  (H, J, and K) for MBHBs in a fixed
          stellar  background are obtained by numerical orbit integration
          from  initial  conditions determined by Monte Carlo techniques.
          Three-body  interactions  create  a  subpopulation  of  HVSs on
          nearly  radial,  corotating orbits, with a spatial distribution
          that is initially highly flattened in the inspiral plane of the
          MBHB,   but  becomes  more  isotropic  with  decreasing  binary
          separation.  The  degree  of  anisotropy is smaller for unequal
          mass binaries and larger for stars with higher kick velocities.
          Eccentric  MBHBs produce a more prominent tail of high-velocity
          stars  and  break  planar symmetry, ejecting HVSs along a broad
          jet  perpendicular to the semimajor axis. The jet two-sidedness
          decreases  with  increasing  binary  mass  ratio, while the jet
          opening-angle  increases  with  decreasing  kick  velocity  and
          orbital  separation.  The detection of a numerous population of
          HVSs  in  the  halo  of the Milky Way by the next generation of
          large  astrometric  surveys  like  GAIA  may  provide  a unique
          signature of the history, nature, and environment of the MBH at
          the Galactic center.

          We  investigate  the  flow  field  in  the sunspot canopy using
          simultaneous Stokes vector spectropolarimetry of three sunspots
          ($\theta$  =  27, 50, 75 deg) and their surroundings in visible
          (630.15 and 630.25 nm) and near infrared (1564.8 and 1565.2 nm)
          neutral  iron  lines.}  {To  calibrate  the  Doppler shifts, we
          compare  an  absolute  velocity  calibration using the telluric
          $O_2$-line  at  630.20  nm  and a relative velocity calibration
          using the Doppler shift of Stokes V profiles in the umbra under
          the  assumption  that  the umbra is at rest. Both methods yield
          the  same  result  within  the  calibration uncertainties (~150
          m/s).  We  study  the radial dependence of Stokes V profiles in
          the  directions  of disk center and limb side. Maps of Stokes V
          profile  shifts,  polarity, amplitude asymmetry, field strength
          and  magnetic  field  azimuth  provide  strong evidence for the
          presence of a magnetic canopy and for the existence of a radial
          outflow  in the canopy. Our findings indicate that the Evershed
          flow  does not cease abruptly at the white-light spot boundary,
          but  that  at  least  a  part  of  the  penumbral Evershed flow
          continues into the magnetic canopy.

          the  discovery  of  the  Sagittarius  Dwarf  Elliptical  Galaxy

          We  present  the first optical circular and linear polarization
          measurements   of   two   polar  candidates  from  ROSAT:  1RXS
          J161008.0+035222  and  1RXS J231603.9-052713. We also present H
          band  near-infrared photometry of the last object. The presence
          of  strong  circular  polarization  confirms  them  as  AM  Her
          systems.  1RXS  J231603.9-052713  was observed in two different
          brightness states. The orbital phase dependence of the flux and
          polarization of 1RXS J161008.0+035222 is reasonably fitted with
          a  simple  model  in  which  the  binary is observed at a small
          inclination  and  the magnetic field axis is almost parallel to
          the white-dwarf rotation axis resulting in the accretion column
          axis  being  seen from top during the whole orbital revolution.
          The  magnetic  field  is probably in the 10 to 20 MG range. The
          circular  polarization  of 1RXS J231603.9-052713 is complex and
          highly  variable.  The  light-curves  of  that object have been
          fitted  using  a model which includes the white-dwarf, a heated
          secondary  and  a  point-like  accretion  region. The secondary
          emission contributes significantly even in optical wavelengths.
          This  model  also  reproduces  the main features of the optical
          polarization  of  1RXS  J231603.9-052713.  We estimate the main
          parameters  of  the  binary,  of  the  accretion region and the
          distance  to the system. However, a more precise interpretation
          of   this  system  should  take  in  account  an  extended  and
          inhomogeneous accreting region as well as non-radial accretion.

          Title: AGN Outflows and the Matter Power Spectrum
          Authors: Robyn Levine, Nickolay Y. Gnedin
          Comments: submitted to ApJL
          We  have  investigated  the  effects  of  AGN  outflows  on the
          amplitude  of  the  matter  power spectrum in a simple model of
          spherically  symmetric  outflows around realistically clustered
          AGN  population.  We  find that two competing effects influence
          the  matter  power  spectrum in two opposite directions. First,
          AGN  outflows  move  baryons  from high to low density regions,
          decreasing  the amplitude of the matter power spectrum by up to
          20%.  Second,  high  clustering  of the AGN transfers the power
          from  small  to  larger scales. The exact balance between these
          two effects depends on the details of outflows on small scales,
          and quantitative estimates will require much more sophisticated
          modeling than presented here.

          Taking  advantage  of  the very precise de Jager et al. optical
          white dwarf orbit and spin ephemerides; ASCA, XMMN, and Chandra
          X-ray  observations  spread over 10 yrs; and a cumulative 27 yr
          baseline, we have found that in recent years the white dwarf in
          AE  Aqr is spinning down at a rate that is slightly faster than
          predicted by the de Jager et al. spin ephemeris. At the present
          time, the observed period evolution is consistent with either a
          cubic   term   in   the   spin  ephemeris  with  Pdouble_dot  =
          3.46(56)E-19 per d, which is inconsistent in sign and magnitude
          with   magnetic-dipole   radiation  losses,  or  an  additional
          quadratic   term   with  Pdot  =  2.0(1.0)E-15  d/d,  which  is
          consistent  with  a  modest  increase  in the accretion torques
          spinning  down  the  white  dwarf.  Regular  monitoring, in the
          optical,  ultraviolet,  and/or X-rays, is required to track the
          evolution of the spin period of the white dwarf in AE Aqr.

          Aims.  To  investigate  the star formation activity and the gas
          and  stellar dynamics on scales of a few parsecs in the nucleus
          of  the Circinus Galaxy. Methods.Using the adaptive optics near
          infrared  integral  field  spectrometer  SINFONI on the VLT, we
          have  obtained observations of the Circinus galaxy on scales of
          a  few  parsecs  and  at  a spectral resolution of 70 km s^{-1}
          FWHM.  The  physical  properties of the nucleus are analyzed by
          means  of  line  and  velocity  maps extracted from the SINFONI
          datacube.  Starburst  models are constrained using the Br-gamma
          flux,  stellar  continuum  (as  traced  via  the  CO absorption
          bandheads longward of 2.3um), and radio continuum. Results. The
          similarity  of the morphologies of the H_2 (1-0)S(1) 2.12um and
          Br-gamma  2.17um  lines to the stellar continuum and also their
          kinematics, suggest a common origin in star formation. Within 8
          pc  of the AGN we find there has been a recent starburst in the
          last 100 Myr, which currently accounts for 1.4% of the galaxy's
          bolometric  luminosity.  The  similarity  of the spatial scales
          over  which  the  stars  and gas exist indicates that this star
          formation  is  occuring within the torus; and comparison of the
          gas  column  density  through the torus to the maximum possible
          optical  depth  to  the  stars  implies  the  torus is a clumpy
          medium.  The  coronal  lines  show  asymmetric  profiles with a
          spatially  compact  narrow  component  and a spatially extended
          blue  wing.  These  characteristics are consistent with some of
          the  emission  arising  in  clouds gravitationally bound to the
          AGN,  and  some  outflowing in cloudlets which have been eroded
          away from the bound clouds.

          We  present spectral and long-timescale variability analyses of
          \textit{Chandra}  ACIS-S  observations  of  the  19 millisecond
          pulsars  (MSPs)  with precisely known positions in the globular
          cluster 47 Tucanae. The X-ray emission of the majority of these
          MSPs  is well described by a thermal (blackbody or neutron star
          hydrogen   atmosphere)  spectrum  with  a  temperature  $T_{\rm
          eff}\sim(1-3)\times10^6$    K,    emission    radius    $R_{\rm
          eff}\sim0.1-3$  km,  and  luminosity $L_{X}\sim10^{30-31}$ ergs
          s$^{-1}$.  For  several MSPs, there is indication that a second
          thermal  component is required, similar to what is seen in some
          nearby field MSPs. The radio-eclipsing binary MSPs 47 Tuc J, O,
          and  W  show  a  significant non-thermal component, with photon
          index  $\Gamma\sim  1-1.5$,  which  may  originate  in an shock
          formed  due to interaction between the relativistic pulsar wind
          and  matter  from  the  stellar  companion.  We  re-examine the
          X-ray--spindown  luminosity relation ($L_{X}-\dot{E}$) and find
          that  due  to  the  large  uncertainties in both parameters the
          result  is  consistent  with  both  the  linear $L_{X}-\dot{E}$
          relation and the flatter $L_X\propto\dot{E}^{0.5}$ predicted by
          polar cap heating models. In terms of X-ray properties, we find
          no  clear  systematic  differences  between  MSPs  in  globular
          clusters and in the field of the Galaxy.

          Title: Pulsational Instabilities in Accreting White Dwarfs
          Authors: Phil Arras, Dean M. Townsley, Lars Bildsten
          Comments: submitted to ApJL. 3 figures
          (Abridged)  The  Cataclysmic Variable (CV) population harbors a
          diverse  range of donor stars and accreting white dwarfs (WDs).
          A  range  of  WD  masses is expected, from low mass Helium core
          WDs,  to  massive  WDs  which have previously accreted at rates
          high  enough for Hydrogen to burn steadily. Furthermore, a wide
          range of Helium enrichment is expected in the accreted material
          depending  on the degree to which the donor star is evolved. We
          investigate  the  impact  of  this  diversity  on  the range of
          effective  temperatures  ($T_{\rm  eff}$) for which g-modes are
          unstable.  The  critical  $T_{\rm  eff}$  below which modes are
          unstable  ("blue  edge")  depends on both surface gravity, $g$,
          and  He  abundance,  $Y$.  The Hydrogen/first Helium ionization
          instability  strip  is  more sensitive to $g$ than $Y$. We find
          that  (for solar composition envelopes), relative to a fiducial
          WD  mass  $0.6  M_\odot$,  the blue edge for a $0.4 M_\odot$ He
          core  WD  shifts downward by $\approx 1000 {\rm K}$, while that
          for  a  massive  $\approx  1.2  M_\odot$  WD  shifts  upward by
          $\approx   2000   {\rm   K}$.   The  second  Helium  ionization
          instability  strip  exhibits strong dependences on both $g$ and
          $Y$. Surprisingly, increasing $Y$ by only 10% relative to solar
          creates  an instability strip near $15,000 {\rm K}$. Hence CV's
          below the period gap with evolved donor stars of $Y\ga 0.4$ may
          have  an  "intermediate"  instability strip well outside of the
          isolated  DA  and DB variables. This "intermediate" instability
          strip  also  occurs  for  low mass He WD with solar composition
          envelopes. The lack of pulsations in CV's with $T_{\rm eff}$ in
          the  pure  Hydrogen  ZZ  Ceti  instability strip is also easily
          explained.

          We  detect  high-velocity  absorbing  gas  using  Hubble  Space
          Telescope  and  Far  Ultraviolet  Spectroscopic Explorer medium
          resolution spectroscopy along two high-latitude AGN sight lines
          (Mrk 1383 and PKS 2005-489) above and below the Galactic Center
          (GC).  These absorptions are most straightforwardly interpreted
          as  a wind emanating from the GC which does not escape from the
          Galaxy's  gravitational potential. Spectra of four comparison B
          stars  are  used  to  identify  and  remove foreground velocity
          components  from  the  absorption-line profiles of O VI, N V, C
          II,  C  III,  C IV, Si II, Si III, and Si IV. Two high-velocity
          (HV)  absorption  components  are detected along each AGN sight
          line,  three  redshifted and one blueshifted. Assuming that the
          four  HV  features  trace a large-scale Galactic wind emanating
          from  the GC, the blueshifted absorber is falling toward the GC
          at  a  velocity  of  250 +/- 20 km/s, which can be explained by
          "Galactic   fountain"  material  that  originated  in  a  bound
          Galactic  wind.  The other three absorbers represent outflowing
          material;  the  largest derived outflow velocity is +250 +/- 20
          km/s,  which  is  only  45%  of  the velocity necessary for the
          absorber  to  escape  from its current position in the Galactic
          gravitational  potential.  All  four  HV absorbers are found to
          reach the same maximum height above the Galactic plane (|z_max|
          =  12  +/- 1 kpc), implying that they were all ejected from the
          GC  with  the  same  initial  velocity. The derived metallicity
          limits  of  >10-20%  Solar are lower than expected for material
          recently  ejected  from  the  GC  unless  these  absorbers also
          contain  significant amounts of hotter gas in unseen ionization
          stages.

          NGC  7538 IRS1 is a high-mass (approx. 30 M_sun) protostar with
          a CO outflow, an associated UCHII region, and a linear methanol
          maser   structure,   which  might  trace  a  Keplerian-rotating
          circumstellar  disk.  The  directions of the various associated
          axes  are  misaligned  with  each  other.  We  investigate  the
          near-infrared morphology of the source to clarify the relations
          among    the   various   axes.   K'-band   bispectrum   speckle
          interferometry was performed at two 6-meter-class telescopes --
          the  BTA  6m  telescope  and  the  6.5m MMT. Complementary IRAC
          images  from  the  Spitzer Space Telescope Archive were used to
          relate  the  structures  detected  with  the  outflow at larger
          scales.  High-dynamic  range  images  show  fan-shaped  outflow
          structure  in  which  we  detect  18 stars and several blobs of
          diffuse  emission.  We  interpret  the  misalignment of various
          outflow  axes  in  the  context  of  a  disk  precession model,
          including  numerical  hydrodynamic simulations of the molecular
          emission.  The  precession  period is approx. 280 years and its
          half-opening   angle  is  40  degrees.  A  possible  triggering
          mechanism    is    non-coplanar   tidal   interaction   of   an
          (undiscovered)    close   companion   with   the   circumbinary
          protostellar  disk. Our observations resolve the nearby massive
          protostar  NGC  7538  IRS2 as a close binary with separation of
          195  mas. We find indications for shock interaction between the
          outflow  activities  in  IRS1  and IRS2. Indications of outflow
          precession  have been discovered to date in a number of massive
          protostars,  all  with  large precession angles 20--45 degrees.
          This might explain the difference between the outflow widths in
          low-   and   high-mass  stars  and  add  support  to  a  common
          collimation mechanism.

          Title:  A  close  look  to quasar-triggered winds: is the black
          hole-bulge relation self-regulated?
          Authors: P. Monaco (DAUT - University of Trieste and INAF-OATs)

          Castel Gandolfo, Italy, 3-6 October 2005
          We  discuss  the role of feedback from AGNs on the formation of
          spheroidal  galaxies. The energy released by an accreting Black
          Hole  (BH)  may  be  injected  into the ISM through blast waves
          arising directly from the central engine, radiation pressure or
          radiative  heating.  A scenario is described in which radiative
          heating  perturbs  the  methabolism of a star-forming spheroid,
          leading  to  a  critical  stage where SNe form a cold expanding
          shell,  pushed out of the galaxy by radiation pressure from the
          AGN.  This mechanism can regulate the BH--bulge relation to the
          observed  value. However, this relation may be simply imprinted
          by  the  mechanism  responsible for the nearly complete loss of
          angular  momentum of the gas that accretes onto the BH. Using a
          novel  model  of  galaxy  formation that includes AGNs, we show
          that   models   without   self-regulation   have   problems  in
          reproducing  the  correct slope of the AGN luminosity function,
          while  models  with  winds give a much better fit; however, all
          these  models  are  almost  indistingishable  as  far  as their
          predicted  BH--bulge  relation  is  concerned. Finally, we show
          that  the  downsizing  of  the faint AGNs is most likely due to
          kinetic feedback in star-forming bulges.

          version of the preprint can be found at this http URL
          Based  on  deep  VLT/ISAAC  JHK photometry, we have derived the
          present-day  mass function of the central starburst cluster NGC
          3603  YC  (Young Cluster) in the giant HII region NGC 3603. The
          effects  of  field  contamination,  individual reddening, and a
          possible  binary  contribution  are investigated. The MF slopes
          resulting  from the different methods are compared, and lead to
          a  surprisingly  consistent  cluster MF with a slope of Gamma =
          -0.9  +/-  0.15.  Analyzing  different radial annuli around the
          cluster  core,  no significant change in the slope of the MF is
          observed. However, mass segregation in the cluster is evidenced
          by  the  increasing  depletion  of  the  high-mass  tail of the
          stellar  mass  distribution  with increasing radius. We discuss
          the indications of mass segregation with respect to the changes
          observed  in  the binned and cumulative stellar mass functions,
          and  argue that the cumulative function as well as the fraction
          of  high-  to low-mass stars provide better indicators for mass
          segregation than the MF slope alone. (abridged)

          Title: A Flare of AE Aquarii Observed with XMM-Newton
          Authors: Chul-Sung Choi (KASI), Tadayasu Dotani (ISAS/JAXA)
          Comments:   15   pages,  3  tables,  9  figures,  accepted  for
          publication in ApJ
          We  present  the  results  of  analyzing  the  XMM-Newton  data
          obtained   in  2001  November  7  -  8.  A  flare  is  observed
          simultaneously  in  X-ray and UV together with a quiescence. We
          find that during the flare event X-ray flux varies with UV with
          no significant time lag, indicating a close correlation of flux
          variation for X-ray and UV flares. An upper limit of the lag is
          estimated to be \~1 min. From a timing analysis for X-ray data,
          we  find that both pulsed and unpulsed flux increase clearly as
          the flare advances in the entire energy band 0.15 - 10 keV. The
          net  increase  of  pulsed  flux  to the quiescence is, however,
          small  and  corresponds  to  about  3  -  4% of the increase in
          unpulsed  flux, confirming that a flux variation of flare in AE
          Aqr  is  dominated  by  unpulsed  X-rays.  A  spectral analysis
          reveals  that  the  energy  spectrum  is similar to that of the
          quiescence  at  the  beginning  of  the flare, but the spectrum
          becomes  harder  as the flare advances. Based on these results,
          we  discuss the current issues that need to be clarified, e.g.,
          the possible flaring site and the mass accretion problem of the
          white  dwarf.  We also discuss the flare properties obtained in
          this study.

          V475   Sct  (Nova  Scuti  2003):  Discovery  of  an  Asymmetric

          Comments: 27 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in AJ
          We  present  low-resolution  ($R\sim 90$) and medium-resolution
          ($R\sim 2500$) spectropolarimetry of Nova V475 Sct with the HBS
          instrument,  mounted  on  the  0.91-m  telescope at the Okayama
          Astrophysical Observatory, and with FOCAS, mounted on the 8.2-m
          Subaru  telescope.  We  estimated the interstellar polarization
          toward   the   nova  from  the  steady  continuum  polarization
          components   and  H$\alpha$  line  emission  components.  After
          subtracting  the  interstellar  polarization component from the
          observations, we found that the H$\alpha$ emission seen on 2003
          October   7  was  clearly  polarized.  In  the  polarized  flux
          spectrum,  the  H$\alpha$  emission  had  a  distinct  red wing
          extending  to  $\sim  +4900$  km s$^{-1}$ and a shoulder around
          $+3500$  km  s$^{-1}$,  showing  a  constant  position angle of
          linear   polarization   $\theta_{\rm   *}\simeq   155\arcdeg\pm
          15\arcdeg$.  This  suggests  that  the  nova  had an asymmetric
          outflow  with  a  velocity  of  $v_{\rm  wind}\simeq  3500$  km
          s$^{-1}$  or more, which is six times higher than the expansion
          velocity  of  the  ionized  shell  at  the  same  epoch. Such a
          high-velocity  component has not previously been reported for a
          nova  in  the  `moderately  fast' speed class. Our observations
          suggest  the  occurrence  of  violent mass-loss activity in the
          nova  binary  system even during the common-envelope phase. The
          position  angle of the polarization in the H$\alpha$ wing is in
          good agreement with that of the continuum polarization found on
          2003   September  26  ($p_{\rm  *}\simeq  0.4$--0.6  %),  which
          disappeared  within the following 2 d. The uniformity of the PA
          between the continuum polarization and the wing polarization on
          October 7 suggests that the axis of the circumstellar asymmetry
          remained nearly constant during the period of our observations.

          Title: Accretion-powered Millisecond Pulsar Outbursts
          Authors: Duncan K. Galloway
          Comments:  5  pages,  2  figures,  to  be  published  in:  "The
          Transient Milky Way: a perspective for MIRAX", eds. F. D'Amico,
          J. Braga & R. Rothschild, AIP Conf. Proc
          The  population  of  accretion-powered  millisecond pulsars has
          grown  rapidly  over the last four years, with the discovery of
          six  new examples to bring the total sample to seven. While the
          first  six  discovered  are  transients  active for a few weeks
          every  two  or  more years, the most recently-discovered source
          HETE  J1900.1-2455,  has been active for more than 8 months. We
          summarise the transient behaviour of the population to estimate
          long-term  time-averaged fluxes, and equate these fluxes to the
          expected  mass  transfer rate driven by gravitational radiation
          in  order to constrain the distances. We also estimate an upper
          limit  of 6 kpc to the distance of IGR J00291+5934 based on the
          non-detection of bursts from this source.

          Journal-ref: Hines, D.C. et al. 2006, ApJ, 641, L85
          We  have  observed 13 z >= 4.5 QSOs using the Multiband Imaging
          Photometer  for  Spitzer, nine of which were also observed with
          the   Infrared   Array  Camera.  The  observations  probe  rest
          wavelengths  ~  0.6-4.3 micron, bracketing the local minimum in
          QSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs) between strong optical
          emission  associated  directly  with  accretion  processes  and
          thermal  emission  from  hot dust heated by the central engine.
          The  new Spitzer photometry combined with existing measurements
          at  other wavelengths shows that the SEDs of high redshift QSOs
          (z  >=  4.5)  do  not differ significantly from typical QSOs of
          similar  luminosity  at lower redshifts (z <~ 2). This behavior
          supports other indications that all the emission components and
          physical  structures  that  characterize  QSO  activity  can be
          established  by z = 6.4. The similarity also suggests that some
          QSOs  at  high  redshift  will  be  very  difficult to identify
          because they are viewed along dust-obscured sight lines.

          Comments:   Accepted   for  publication  in  The  Astrophysical
          Journal; 25 pages; 11 figures
          We  present  a detailed analysis of the XMM-Newton long-look of
          the  Seyfert galaxy IC 4329a. The Fe K bandpass is dominated by
          two  resolved  peaks  at  6.4  keV and 7.0 keV, consistent with
          neutral  or  near-neutral Fe K alpha and K beta emission. There
          is  a  prominent  redward  asymmetry in the 6.4 keV line, which
          could indicate emission from a Compton shoulder. Alternatively,
          models  using dual relativistic disklines are found to describe
          the     emission     profile     well.    A    low-inclination,
          moderately-relativistic  dual-diskline model is possible if the
          contribution  from  narrow components, due to distant material,
          is small or absent. A high-inclination, moderately relativistic
          profile  for  each  peak is possible if there are roughly equal
          contributions  from  both  the  broad  and  narrow  components.
          Combining  the  XMM-Newton  data  with RXTE monitoring data, we
          explore the time-resolved spectral behavior on time scales from
          hours to 2 years. We find no strong evidence for variability of
          the Fe K line flux on any time scale, likely due to the minimal
          level   of   continuum   variability.   We   detect,   at  high
          significance,  a  narrow  absorption  line  at  7.68  keV. This
          feature  is  most  likely  due  to  Fe  XXVI K alpha absorption
          blueshifted  to  about  0.1c relative to the systemic velocity,
          suggesting  a  high-velocity, highly-ionized outflow component.
          As   is   often   the   case  with  similar  outflows  seen  in
          high-luminosity  quasars, the power associated with the outflow
          represents  a substantial portion of the total energy budget of
          the AGN. The outflow could arise from a radiatively-driven disk
          wind, or it may be in the form of a discrete, transient blob of
          ejected material.

          Title:  The AGN Outflow in the HDFS Target QSO J2233-606 from a
          High-Resolution VLT/UVES Spectrum
          Authors: Jack R. Gabel, Nahum Arav, Tae-Sun Kim
          Comments:  12  pages,  10  figures,  emulateapj,  accepted  for
          publication in ApJ
          We  present  a detailed analysis of the intrinsic UV absorption
          in   the   central  HDFS  target  QSO  J2233-606,  based  on  a
          high-resolution,  high  S/N  (~25 -- 50) spectrum obtained with
          VLT/UVES.  This  spectrum  samples  the  cluster  of  intrinsic
          absorption systems outflowing from the AGN at radial velocities
          v  ~  -5000  -- -3800 km/s in the key far-UV diagnostic lines -
          the  lithium-like CNO doublets and H I Lyman series. We fit the
          absorption  troughs  using a global model of all detected lines
          to   solve  for  the  independent  velocity-dependent  covering
          factors  of  the  continuum and emission-line sources and ionic
          column  densities.  This reveals increasing covering factors in
          components  with  greater outflow velocity. Narrow substructure
          is  revealed  in  the  optical  depth  profiles, suggesting the
          relatively  broad  absorption  is  comprised  of  a  series  of
          multiple     components.    We    perform    velocity-dependent
          photoionization  modeling,  which allows a full solution to the
          C,  N,  and  O  abundances,  as  well  as the velocity resolved
          ionization  parameter  and  total column density. The absorbers
          are  found  to have supersolar abundances, with [C/H] and [O/H]
          ~0.5  --  0.9, and [N/H] ~ 1.1 -- 1.3, consistent with enhanced
          nitrogen  production  expected  from  secondary nucleosynthesis
          processes.  Independent  fits  to each kinematic component give
          consistent  results  for  the abundances. The lowest-ionization
          material  in  each  of  the  strong  absorbers  is modeled with
          similar  ionization parameters. Components of higher-ionization
          (indicated  by  stronger  O  VI  relative  to C IV and N V) are
          present  at  velocities  just  redward  of  each low-ionization
          absorber.  We explore the implications of these results for the
          kinematic-geometric-ionization structure of the outflow.

          We  summarize  masses and radii for a number of white dwarfs as
          deduced  from a combination of proper motion studies, Hipparcos
          parallax  distances,  effective  temperatures,  and  binary  or
          spectroscopic  masses. A puzzling feature of these data is that
          some stars appear to have radii which are significantly smaller
          than   that   expected   for   a  standard  electron-degenerate
          white-dwarf  equations  of  state. We construct a projection of
          white-dwarf  radii  for  fixed effective mass and conclude that
          there  is  at  least  marginal  evidence  for bimodality in the
          radius  distribution  forwhite  dwarfs.  We  argue that if such
          compact  white dwarfs exist it is unlikely that they contain an
          iron  core.  We  propose an alternative of strange-quark matter
          within  the white-dwarf core. We also discuss the impact of the
          so-called  color-flavor  locked  (CFL)  state in strange-matter
          core  associated with color superconductivity. We show that the
          data  exhibit  several  features  consistent  with the expected
          mass-radius  relation  of  strange  dwarfs.  We  identify eight
          nearby  white  dwarfs which are possible candidates for strange
          matter   cores   and   suggest   observational  tests  of  this
          hypothesis.

          Center   2005   Conference:   Infrared  Diagnostics  of  Galaxy
          Evolution", held in Pasadena, November 2005
          In  a sample of thirty normal elliptical galaxies observed with
          the   Spitzer  IRS,  one  galaxy,  NGC4697,  shows  strong  PAH
          emission,  but  with  an apparently weak 7.7 micron feature. We
          find  that  the PAH emission is confined to the central regions
          of  the  galaxy  and  that  once  a quiescent elliptical galaxy
          spectrum  is  subtracted, the PAH feature ratios are normal. We
          show  that  the  PAH  spectrum resembles the diffuse ISM of our
          galaxy  rather  than  an HII region, and is not indicative of a
          starburst  galaxy.  We  suggest  that  the  PAHs in NGC4697 are
          consistent with a recent but now past burst of star formation.

          Comments: 11 pages, 3 figures, accepted by ApJ Letters
          We  first  refine  the fixed concept in the literature that the
          usage  of  the  Newtonian  potential  in  studies of black hole
          accretion  is  invalid and the general relativistic effect must
          be  considered.  As  our  main  results,  we then show that the
          energy  released by neutrino annihilation in neutrino-dominated
          accretion  flows  is  sufficient  for gamma-ray bursts when the
          contribution  from  the  optically  thick region of the flow is
          included, and that in the optically thick region advection does
          not  necessarily  dominate  over  neutrino  cooling because the
          advection  factor  is  relevant to the geometrical depth rather
          than the optical depth of the flow.

          We  have performed a deep spectroscopic survey of extremely red
          galaxies  on the GOODS-South field, using GMOS on Gemini South.
          We   present   here  spectra  and  redshifts  for  16  ERGs  at
          0.87<z<2.02,  to  a  limit  K=20.2.  The  ERHs are a mixture of
          spheroidals, mergers and spirals, with one AGN. For at least 10
          of  these  galaxies we observe [OII] emission lines. We perform
          an  age-dating  analysis  by  fitting  the  spectra  and 9-band
          photometry  of  the  ERGs  with  models  of  passively evolving
          stellar   populations  combined  with  a  younger  star-forming
          component. The best-fitting ages for the old stellar components
          range  from  0.6  to 4.5 Gyr, with a mean 2.1 Gyr. Masses range
          from  3  to  20  times  10^10  solar  masses.  The star-forming
          component  typically  forms  a  few per cent of the total mass,
          with  dust reddening averaging E(B-V)=0.35. Its timescale tends
          to  be short for mergers (<50 Myr) and longer (200-800 Myr) for
          spiral ERGs.

          Observations  of  the  inspiral  of  massive binary black holes

          stellar    mass    binary   black   holes   in   the   European
          Gravitational-Wave    Observatory   (EGO)   offer   an   unique
          opportunity   to  test  the  non-linear  structure  of  general
          relativity.  For  a  binary  composed of two non-spinning black
          holes,  the non-linear general relativistic effects depend only
          on  the  masses  of  the  constituents.  In a recent letter, we
          explored  the  possibility  of  a  test  to  determine  all the
          post-Newtonian  coefficients in the gravitational wave-phasing.
          However,  mutual covariances dilute the effectiveness of such a
          test. In this communication, we propose a more powerful test in
          which   the   various   post-Newtonian   coefficients   in  the
          gravitational  wave  phasing  are  systematically  measured  by
          treating  three of them as independent parameters and demanding
          their mutual consistency. LISA (EGO) will observe BBH inspirals
          with  a  signal-to-noise  ratio  of  more  than  1000 (100) and
          thereby   test   the  self-consistency  of  each  of  the  nine
          post-Newtonian  coefficients that have so-far been computed, by
          measuring  the  lower order coefficients to a relative accuracy
          of $\sim 10^{-5}$ (respectively, $\sim 10^{-4}$) and the higher
          order   coefficients  to  a  relative  accuracy  in  the  range

          Braneworld models typically predict gravity to grow stronger at

          two  types  of  additional  curvature couplings, a Gauss-Bonnet
          term in the bulk, and an Einstein-Hilbert term on the brane. In
          the  regime  where  these  terms  are dominant over the bulk EH
          term,  linearized  gravity becomes weaker at short distances on
          the  brane. In both models, the weakening of gravity is tied to
          the  presence  of ghosts in the graviton mass spectrum. We find
          that the ordinary coupling of matter to gravity is recovered at
          low  energies/long  wavelengths  on  the  brane.  We  give some
          implications  for  cosmology  and  show  its compatibility with
          observations. We also discuss the stability of compact stars.

          Using H-alpha spectra of 114 rest-frame UV-selected galaxies at
          z~2, we compare inferred star formation rates (SFRs) with those
          determined  from  the UV continuum luminosity. After correcting
          for  extinction  using  standard  techniques  based  on  the UV
          continuum  slope,  we  find  excellent  agreement  between  the
          indicators,  with  <SFR_Ha>  =  31  Msun/yr  and  <SFR_UV> = 29
          Msun/yr. The agreement between the indicators suggests that the
          UV  luminosity is attenuated by an typical factor of ~4.5 (with
          a  range  from  no attenuation to a factor of ~100 for the most
          obscured   object  in  the  sample),  in  good  agreement  with
          estimates of obscuration from X-ray, radio and mid-IR data. The
          H-alpha  luminosity  is  attenuated  by  a  factor  of  ~1.7 on
          average, and the maximum H-alpha attenuation is a factor of ~5.
          In  agreement  with  X-ray and mid-IR studies, we find that the
          SFR  increases  with  increasing stellar mass and at brighter K
          magnitudes,  to  <SFR_Ha>  ~ 60 Msun/yr for galaxies with K<20;
          the  correlation  between  K magnitude and SFR is much stronger
          than the correlation between stellar mass and SFR. All galaxies
          in  the  sample  have SFRs per unit area Sigma_SFR in the range
          observed in local starbursts. We compare the instantaneous SFRs
          and the past average SFRs as inferred from the ages and stellar
          masses, finding that for most of the sample, the current SFR is
          an  adequate  representation of the past average. There is some
          evidence  that  the  most massive galaxies (M_star >10^11 Msun)
          have had higher SFRs in the past.

          Over the last decade, long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and
          X-ray flashes (XRFs) have been revealed to be a rare variety of
          Type Ibc supernova (SN). While all these events result from the
          death  of  massive  stars,  the electromagnetic luminosities of
          GRBs  and  XRFs  exceed  those of ordinary Type Ibc SNe by many
          orders of magnitude. The essential physical process that causes
          a  dying  star  to  produce  a  GRB or XRF, and not just an SN,
          remains  the  crucial  open question. Here we present radio and
          X-ray  observations  of XRF 060218 (associated with SN 2006aj),
          the  second  nearest  GRB identified to-date, which allow us to
          measure  its total energy and place it in the larger context of
          cosmic  explosions.  We  show that this event is 100 times less
          energetic  but  ten  times  more common than cosmological GRBs.
          Moreover, it is distinguished from ordinary Type Ibc SNe by the
          presence of 10^48 erg of mildly-relativistic ejecta, along with
          a  central  engine  which  produces  X-rays for weeks after the
          explosion.  This  suggests  that  the  presence of relativistic
          ejecta  is  the  key physical distinction between GRBs/XRFs and
          ordinary  SNe,  while  the  nature of the central engine (black
          hole  or  magnetar)  may distinguish cosmological GRBs from the
          low-luminosity and spherical events like XRF 060218.

          Symposium, ChJAA in press
          The  recently  started  Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) pulsar
          survey aims to find ~1000 new pulsars. Due to its high time and
          frequency  resolution  the  survey  is  especially sensitive to
          millisecond   pulsars,   which   have  the  potential  to  test
          gravitational  theories,  detect  gravitational waves and probe
          the  neutron-star equation of state. Here we report the results
          of  our  preliminary  analysis:  in  the  first  months we have
          discovered  21  new pulsars. One of these, PSR J1906+0746, is a
          young   144-ms   pulsar   in   a  highly  relativistic  3.98-hr
          low-eccentricity  orbit.  The 2.61 +- 0.02 solar-mass system is
          expected  to coalesce in ~300 Myr and contributes significantly
          to the computed cosmic inspiral rate of compact binary systems.

          Title: Optical spectroscopy of the dwarf nova U Geminorum
          Authors: Unda-Sanzana, E. Marsh, T. R. Morales-Rueda, L
          U Gem is unique in having a direct measurement of K1 = 107 +- 2
          km/s,  Long  et  al.  1999). We present high-resolution optical
          spectra of the dwarf nova U Gem in quiescence taken to test the
          accuracy  to  which the HST value can be recovered from optical
          data.  We  find that, even with data of very high S/N we cannot
          recover  Long  et  al.'s  value to better than about 20% by any
          method.  Contamination  by  neighbouring emission lines seems a
          likely  culprit.  Our  data  reveal  a  number of new features:
          Doppler  tomograms  show emission at low velocity, close to the
          centre  of  mass, and a transient, narrow absorption feature is
          seen  in  the Balmer lines near the line centres at the time of
          eclipse.  We  suggest  that  stellar prominences, as previously
          invoked  for the dwarf novae IP Peg and SS Cyg in outburst, may
          explain  both  of  these  features.  The  He  II 4686.75 A line
          emission is dominated by the gas stream/disc impact region. Two
          distinct  spots  are seen in Doppler maps, the first being very
          narrow  and  showing  a velocity close to that of the accretion
          disc  in  the  impact  region,  and the second much broader and
          located  between  the  velocities of the (ballistic) stream and
          the  (Keplerian)  disc.  We  present tentative evidence of weak
          spiral  structure.  We find no evidence of stream-disc overflow
          in  the  system.  Our  data  suggests an inclination angle > 70
          degrees,  adding  to  the evidence of a puzzle in the mass of U
          Gem's  white  dwarf.  The  mass  donor  is  clearly seen in the
          Doppler maps, with emission concentrated towards its poles, and
          mainly  on  the  side  facing  the  white  dwarf. This suggests
          irradiation  with  shielding by the disc from which we estimate
          an H/R ratio between 0.15 and 0.25.

          Title:  Variability  of the NGC 1333 IRAS 4A Outflow: Molecular
          Hydrogen and Silicon Monoxide Images
          Authors: Minho Choi, Klaus W. Hodapp, Masahiko Hayashi, Kentaro
          Motohara, Soojong Pak, Tae-Soo Pyo
          The  NGC  1333 region was observed in the H2 1-0 S(1) line. The
          H2  images  cover  a  5' x 7' region around IRAS 4. Numerous H2
          emission   features   were  detected.  The  northeast-southwest
          bipolar  outflow driven by IRAS 4A was studied by combining the
          H2  images  with  SiO  maps  published  previously.  The SiO-H2
          outflows are continuous on the southwestern side but show a gap
          on  the northeastern side. The southwestern outflow lobe curves
          smoothly,  and  the  position angle increases with the distance
          from  the  driving  source.  The  base and the outer tip of the
          northeastern  outflow lobe are located at positions opposite to
          the   corresponding   parts  of  the  southwestern  lobe.  This
          point-symmetry  suggests  that the outflow axis may be drifting
          or  precessing  clockwise  in the plane of the sky and that the
          cause of the axis drift may be intrinsic to the outflow engine.
          The  axis  drift  model  is supported by the asymmetric lateral
          intensity  profile  of  the SiO outflow. The axis drift rate is
          about  0.011  deg  yr-1.  The  middle  part of the northeastern
          outflow  does  not exactly follow the point symmetry because of
          the   superposition  of  two  different  kinds  of  directional
          variability:  the  axis  drift  of  the  driving source and the
          deflection  by  a  dense  core. The axis drift model provides a
          good   explanation  for  the  large  deflection  angle  of  the
          northeastern  outflow.  Other  H2  emission features around the
          IRAS  4  region  are  discussed briefly. Some of them are newly
          found  outflows,  and some are associated with outflows already
          known before.

          We  use  a 54.4 ks Chandra observation to study nuclear outflow
          activity  in  NGC4552  (M89), an elliptical galaxy in the Virgo
          Cluster.  Chandra  images  in  the  0.5-2  keV  band  show  two
          ring-like features ~1.7 kpc in diameter in the core of NGC4552,
          as  reported  previously  by  Filho  et  al. We use spherically
          symmetric  point explosion shock models to argue that the shape
          of  the surface brightness profile across the rims of the rings
          and the temperature of hot gas in the rings are consistent with
          a  Mach  1.7 shock carrying mean mechanical power L_shock ~ 3 x
          10^{41}  ergs/s  produced  by  a  ~1.4  x  10^{55} ergs nuclear
          outburst  \~1  -  2 Myr ago. We find the gas temperature in the
          central  ~100  pc  of  the galaxy to be 1.0 +/- 0.2 keV, hotter
          than  elsewhere  in  the  galaxy,  suggesting  that  we  may be
          observing  directly  the  reheating  of  the  galaxy ISM by the
          outburst.

          Title: Escaping from the black hole?
          Authors: E. Babichev, V. Mukhanov, A. Vikman
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures
          We show that if there exists a special kind of Born-Infeld type
          scalar field, then one can send information from inside a black
          hole. This information is encoded in perturbations of the field
          propagating  in  non-trivial  scalar  field  backgrounds, which
          serves   as   a   "new   ether".   Although   the   theory   is
          Lorentz-invariant  it  allows,  nevertheless,  the superluminal
          propagation  of  perturbations with respect to the "new ether".
          We   found   the  stationary  solution  for  background,  which
          describes  the accretion of the scalar field onto a black hole.
          Examining  the  propagation  of small perturbations around this
          solution  we  show  the  signals emitted inside the horizon can
          reach  an  observer  located outside the black hole. We discuss
          possible physical consequences of this result.

          Authors: D. Lynden-Bell
          Comments: 23 pages, 7 figures. To be published in MNRAS
          A broad swathe of astrophysical phenomena, ranging from tubular
          planetary nebulae through Herbig-Haro objects, radio-galaxy and
          quasar  emissions  to  gamma-ray bursts and perhaps high-energy
          cosmic  rays,  may  be  driven  by  magnetically-dominated jets
          emanating  from  accretion  disks.  We  give  a  self-contained
          account of the analytic theory of non-relativistic magnetically
          dominated  jets  wound  up  by  a  swirling  disk  and making a
          magnetic  cavity  in  a  background  medium  of  any prescribed
          pressure,  p(z).  We  solve  the time-dependent problem for any

          the  disk  at  z=0,  with  any  specified disk angular velocity
          Omega_d(R).  The  physics required to do this involves only the
          freezing of the lines of force to the conducting medium and the

          publication in the Astronomical Journal
          We   fit   a   parametric   model   comprising   a  mixture  of
          multi-dimensional  Gaussian  functions to the 3.6 to 8um colour
          and  optical  photo-z distribution of galaxy populations in the
          ELAIS-N1  and  Lockman  Fields  of SWIRE. For 16,698 sources in
          ELAIS-N1  we  find  our data are best modelled (in the sense of
          the Bayesian Information Criterion) by the sum of four Gaussian
          distributions  or modes (C_a, C_b, C_c and C_d). We compare the
          fit  of  our  empirical  model  with  predictions from existing
          semi-analytic  and  phenomological  models.  We  infer that our
          empirical   model   provides   a   better  description  of  the
          mid-infrared colour distribution of the SWIRE survey than these
          existing  models.  This  colour  distribution  test  is  thus a
          powerful  model  discriminator and complementary to comparisons
          of  number  counts.  We  use  our  model  to  provide  a galaxy
          classification scheme and explore the nature of the galaxies in
          the  different  modes  of  the  model.  C_a  consists  of dusty
          star-forming  systems  such  as ULIRG's. Low redshift late-type
          spirals  are found in C_b, where PAH emission dominates at 8um.
          C_c   consists  of  dusty  starburst  systems  at  intermediate
          redshifts.  Low  redshift  early-type  spirals  and ellipticals
          dominate  C_d.  We  thus find a greater variety of galaxy types
          than  one can with optical photometry alone. Finally we develop
          a  new  technique  to  identify  unusual  objects,  and  find a
          selection of outliers with very red IRAC colours. These objects
          are   not  detected  in  the  optical,  but  have  very  strong
          detections  in  the mid-infrared. These sources are modelled as
          dust-enshrouded,   strongly   obscured   AGN,  where  the  high
          mid-infrared  emission  may either be attributed to dust heated
          by  the  AGN  or substantial star-formation. These sources have
          z_ph  ~  2-4,  making them incredibly infrared luminous, with a
          L_IR ~ 10^(12.6-14.1) L_sun.

          Title:  The  Environments  around Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Burst
          Progenitors
          Authors: Chris L. Fryer, Gabriel Rockefeller, Patrick A. Young
          Comments: 44 pages including 11 figures
          Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observations have allowed us to
          significantly  constrain  the engines producing these energetic
          explosions.  Te  redshift  and position information provided by
          these   afterglows   have  already  allowed  us  to  limit  the
          progenitors  of  GRBs  to only a few models. The afterglows may
          also   provide  another  observation  that  can  place  further
          constraints  on  the  GRB  progenitor:  measurements telling us
          about  the  environments  surrounding GRBs. Current analyses of
          GRB  afterglows  suggest  that  roughly  half  of long-duration
          gamma-ray  bursts  occur  in surroundings with density profiles
          that  are  uniform.  We  study  the  constraints placed by this
          observation  on  both  the  classic  ``collapsar'' massive star
          progenitor  and its relative, the ``helium-merger'' progenitor.
          We  study  several  aspects of wind mass-loss and find that our
          modifications to the standard Wolf-Rayet mass-loss paradigm are
          not  sufficient  to produce constant density profiles. Although
          this  does  not rule out the standard ``collapsar'' progenitor,
          it  does suggest a deficiency with this model. We then focus on
          the  He-merger  models  and  find that such progenitors can fit

          observations  can not only determine the correct progenitor for
          GRBs, but also allow us to study binary evolution physics.

          Title:  The origin and fate of short-period low-mass black-hole
          binaries

          We   present  results  of  a  population  synthesis  study  for
          semidetached   short  orbital  period  binaries  which  contain
          low-mass(<1.5  Msun) donors and black hole (>4 Msun) accretors.
          Evolution  of these binaries is determined by nuclear evolution
          of  the  donors  and/or  orbital  angular  momentum loss due to
          magnetic  braking  by  the  stellar  wind  of  the  donors  and
          gravitational  wave  radiation.  According  to  our  model, the
          estimated  total  number of this type of black-hole binaries in
          the Galaxy is about 10000. If the magnetic braking is described
          by  the Verbunt & Zwaan formula, the model predicts around 3000
          transient systems with periods >2 hours and around 300 luminous
          stable  systems  with  periods  between  3 and 8 hours. Several
          dozens  of  these  bright  systems should be above the RXTE ASM
          sensitivity  limit.  The  absence  of such systems implies that
          angular  momentum  losses  are  reduced by a factor more than 2
          with  respect to the Verbunt & Zwaan prescription. We show that
          it  is  unlikely  that  the  transient  behaviour of black-hole
          short-period  X-ray binaries is explained by the evolved nature
          of  the stellar companion. A substantial fraction of black-hole
          binaries  with  periods >3 hours could be faint with truncated,
          stable cold accretion discs as proposed by Menou et al. Most of
          the  semidetached  black-hole  binaries  are  expected  to have
          periods  shorter than ~2 hours. Properties of such, still to be
          observed, very small mass-ratio (q<0.02) binaries are different
          from those of their longer period cousins.

          Title:  Nova  V4743  Sagittarii  2002:  An  Intermediate  Polar
          Candidate
          Authors: Tae W. Kang, Alon Retter, Alex Liu, Mercedes Richards
          Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures, AJ accepted
          We   present  the  results  of  11  nights  of  CCD  unfiltered
          photometry of V4743 Sgr (Nova Sgr 2002 # 3) from 2003 and 2005.
          We  find two periods of 0.2799 d ~ 6.7 h and 0.01642 d ~ 24 min
          in  the  2005 data. The long period is also present in the 2003
          data,  but only weak evidence of the shorter period is found in
          this year. The 24-min period is somewhat longer than the 22-min
          period,  which was detected from X-ray observations. We suggest
          that the 6.7-h periodicity represents the orbital period of the
          underlying binary system and that the 24-min period is the beat
          periodicity  between  the  orbital period and the X-ray period,
          which  is  presumably the spin period of the white dwarf. Thus,
          V4743 Sgr should be classified as an intermediate polar (DQ Her
          star).  About  six  months after the nova outburst, the optical
          light   curve  of  V4743  Sgr  seemed  to  show  quasi-periodic
          oscillations,  which  are  typical  of  the  transient phase in
          classical  nova.  Therefore,  our  results support the previous
          suggestion  that  the trans ition phase in novae may be related
          to intermediate polars.

          Authors: D. Lynden-Bell
          Comments: 23 pages, 7 figures. To be published in MNRAS
          A broad swathe of astrophysical phenomena, ranging from tubular
          planetary nebulae through Herbig-Haro objects, radio-galaxy and
          quasar  emissions  to  gamma-ray bursts and perhaps high-energy
          cosmic  rays,  may  be  driven  by  magnetically-dominated jets
          emanating  from  accretion  disks.  We  give  a  self-contained
          account of the analytic theory of non-relativistic magnetically
          dominated  jets  wound  up  by  a  swirling  disk  and making a
          magnetic  cavity  in  a  background  medium  of  any prescribed
          pressure,  p(z).  We  solve  the time-dependent problem for any
          specified  distribution  of  magnetic flux P(R,0) emerging from
          the  disk  at  z=0,  with  any  specified disk angular velocity
          Omega_d(R).  The  physics required to do this involves only the
          freezing of the lines of force to the conducting medium and the
          principle of minimum energy.

          We   fit   a   parametric   model   comprising   a  mixture  of
          multi-dimensional  Gaussian  functions to the 3.6 to 8um colour
          and  optical  photo-z distribution of galaxy populations in the
          ELAIS-N1  and  Lockman  Fields  of SWIRE. For 16,698 sources in
          ELAIS-N1  we  find  our data are best modelled (in the sense of
          the Bayesian Information Criterion) by the sum of four Gaussian
          distributions  or modes (C_a, C_b, C_c and C_d). We compare the
          fit  of  our  empirical  model  with  predictions from existing
          semi-analytic  and  phenomological  models.  We  infer that our
          empirical   model   provides   a   better  description  of  the
          mid-infrared colour distribution of the SWIRE survey than these
          existing  models.  This  colour  distribution  test  is  thus a
          powerful  model  discriminator and complementary to comparisons
          of  number  counts.  We  use  our  model  to  provide  a galaxy
          classification scheme and explore the nature of the galaxies in
          the  different  modes  of  the  model.  C_a  consists  of dusty
          star-forming  systems  such  as ULIRG's. Low redshift late-type
          spirals  are found in C_b, where PAH emission dominates at 8um.
          C_c   consists  of  dusty  starburst  systems  at  intermediate
          redshifts.  Low  redshift  early-type  spirals  and ellipticals
          dominate  C_d.  We  thus find a greater variety of galaxy types
          than  one can with optical photometry alone. Finally we develop
          a  new  technique  to  identify  unusual  objects,  and  find a
          selection of outliers with very red IRAC colours. These objects
          are   not  detected  in  the  optical,  but  have  very  strong
          detections  in  the mid-infrared. These sources are modelled as
          dust-enshrouded,   strongly   obscured   AGN,  where  the  high
          mid-infrared  emission  may either be attributed to dust heated
          by  the  AGN  or substantial star-formation. These sources have
          z_ph  ~  2-4,  making them incredibly infrared luminous, with a
          L_IR ~ 10^(12.6-14.1) L_sun.

          Comments: 44 pages including 11 figures
          Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observations have allowed us to
          significantly  constrain  the engines producing these energetic
          explosions.  Te  redshift  and position information provided by
          these   afterglows   have  already  allowed  us  to  limit  the
          progenitors  of  GRBs  to only a few models. The afterglows may
          also   provide  another  observation  that  can  place  further
          constraints  on  the  GRB  progenitor:  measurements telling us
          about  the  environments  surrounding GRBs. Current analyses of
          GRB  afterglows  suggest  that  roughly  half  of long-duration
          gamma-ray  bursts  occur  in surroundings with density profiles
          that  are  uniform.  We  study  the  constraints placed by this
          observation  on  both  the  classic  ``collapsar'' massive star
          progenitor  and its relative, the ``helium-merger'' progenitor.
          We  study  several  aspects of wind mass-loss and find that our
          modifications to the standard Wolf-Rayet mass-loss paradigm are
          not  sufficient  to produce constant density profiles. Although
          this  does  not rule out the standard ``collapsar'' progenitor,
          it  does suggest a deficiency with this model. We then focus on
          the  He-merger  models  and  find that such progenitors can fit
          this   particular   constraint   well.  We  show  how  detailed
          observations  can not only determine the correct progenitor for
          GRBs, but also allow us to study binary evolution physics.

          We  introduce the Survey for Ionization in Neutral Gas Galaxies
          (SINGG),  a  census  of star formation in HI-selected galaxies.
          The  survey  consists of H-alpha and R-band imaging of a sample
          of  468  galaxies  selected  from  the HI Parkes All Sky Survey
          (HIPASS). The sample spans three decades in HI mass and is free
          of  many  of  the  biases that affect other star forming galaxy
          samples. We present the criteria for sample selection, list the
          entire   sample,  discuss  our  observational  techniques,  and
          describe the data reduction and calibration methods. This paper
          focuses  on 93 SINGG targets whose observations have been fully
          reduced  and  analyzed  to  date.  The majority of these show a
          single  Emission  Line Galaxy (ELG). We see multiple ELGs in 13
          fields,  with  up  to  four  ELGs in a single field. All of the
          targets  in this sample are detected in H-alpha indicating that
          dormant (non-star forming) galaxies with M(HI) > ~3e7 M_sun are
          very  rare. A database of the measured global properties of the
          ELGs  is  presented.  The  ELG  sample  spans  four  orders  of
          magnitude  in  luminosity  (H-alpha  and  R-band),  and H-alpha
          surface  brightness,  nearly  three  orders  of  magnitude in R
          surface  brightness  and  nearly  two  orders  of  magnitude in
          H-alpha   equivalent   width   (EW).   The  surface  brightness
          distribution  of  our  sample is broader than that of the Sloan
          Digital  Sky Survey spectroscopic sample, the (EW) distribution
          is  broader  than  prism-selected samples, and the morphologies
          found  include  all common types of star forming galaxies (e.g.
          irregular,  spiral, blue compact dwarf, starbursts, merging and
          colliding  systems,  and even residual star formation in S0 and
          Sa spirals). (abridged)

          Title:  Low-Mass  Binary Induced Outflows from Asymptotic Giant
          Branch Stars
          Authors:  J.  Nordhaus (Univ. Rochester), E. G. Blackman (Univ.
          Rochester)
          Comments: 24 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          A   significant   fraction   of  planetary  nebulae  (PNe)  and
          proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe) exhibit aspherical, axisymmetric
          structures,  many of which are highly collimated. The origin of
          these  structures  is  not  entirely understood, however recent
          evidence suggests that many observed PNe harbor binary systems,
          which  may  play  a  role  in  their  shaping.  In an effort to
          understand  how binaries may produce such asymmetries, we study
          the effect of low-mass (< 0.3 M_sun) companions (planets, brown
          dwarfs  and  low-mass  main  sequence  stars) embedded into the
          envelope  of  a  3.0  M_sun  star  during  three  epochs of its
          evolution  (Red  Giant  Branch,  Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB),
          interpulse  AGB).  We  find  that common envelope evolution can
          lead  to three qualitatively different consequences: (i) direct
          ejection  of  envelope  material  resulting  in a predominately
          equatorial  outflow,  (ii) spin-up of the envelope resulting in
          the  possibility of powering an explosive dynamo driven jet and
          (iii)  tidal  shredding  of  the  companion  into  a disc which
          facilitates  a  disc  driven  jet.  We study how these features
          depend  on  the  secondary's  mass  and  discuss  observational

          Title: Radial Kinematics of Isolated Elliptical Galaxies
          Authors: George Hau, Duncan Forbes
          Comments: 11 pages, 6 figures, MNRAS accepted
          Ellipticals in very low density environments are extremely rare
          but  hold important clues about galaxy formation and evolution.
          In  this  paper  we  continue  our study of isolated elliptical
          galaxies,  presenting  results on the radial stellar kinematics
          for  13 isolated early-type galaxies. We derive radial rotation
          velocity, velocity dispersion and hermite terms to ~1 effective
          radius.  We observe a dichotomy in kinematic properties similar
          to  that  in  the  elliptical  population as a whole, where low
          luminosity  ellipticals  tend to be rotationally supported. For
          all  galaxies  the V/sigma ratio increases with radius. We find
          kinematically  distinct cores (KDCs), or velocity substructure,
          in  ~40%  of the galaxies for which we have major axis spectra.
          Such  a fraction is similar to that observed for ellipticals in
          higher density environments. Most galaxies in the sample reveal
          kinematic   evidence   for  a  nuclear  disk.  The  non-relaxed
          kinematics   in   several  galaxies  suggests  that  they  have
          undergone  a  merger  or  accretion event. Isolated ellipticals
          generally  follow  the  fundamental  plane  defined  by cluster
          ellipticals  --  exceptions  being those galaxies with evidence
          for  young  stellar  populations.  Overall,  we  find  isolated
          ellipticals   have   similar   kinematic  properties  to  their
          counterparts in higher density environments.

          Title:  Detection  of  Wolf-Rayet  stars  in  host  galaxies of

          We  have  obtained  deep  spectroscopic observations of several
          nearby  gamma-ray  burst  (GRB) host galaxies revealing for the
          first time the presence of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars and numerous O
          stars  located  in  rich  and  compact clusters or star forming
          regions.  Surprisingly,  high  spatial resolution imaging shows
          that  the  GRBs  and the associated supernovae did not occur in
          these regions, but several hundreds of parsec away. Considering
          various  scenarios  for  GRB  progenitors,  we  do not find any
          simple explanation of why they should be preferentially born in
          regions  with  low stellar densities. All the examined GRBs and
          associated  SNe  have  occurred  400  to  800 pc from very high
          density  stellar  environments  including  large  numbers of WR
          stars. Such distances can be travelled through at velocities of
          100  km/s or larger, assuming the travel time to be the typical
          life  time  of  WR  stars.  It  leads  us  to  suggest that GRB
          progenitors  may  be runaway massive stars ejected from compact
          massive  star  clusters.  The  ejection  from  such  super star
          clusters  may  lead  to a spin-up of these stars, producing the
          loss  of  the  hydrogen  and/or helium envelopes leading to the
          origin of the type Ibc supernovae associated with GRBs. If this
          scenario  applies  tocd text/Sc all GRBs, it provides a natural
          explanation  of  the  very small fraction of massive stars that
          emit  a  GRB  at  the end of their life. An alternative to this
          scenario  could  be  a  binary  origin for GRBs, but this still
          requires an explanation of why it would preferentially occur in
          low stellar density regions.

          Title: Magnetic Field Seeding by Galactic Winds
          Authors:  Serena  Bertone  (University  of Sussex), Corina Vogt
          (ASTRON), Torsten Ensslin (MPA Garching)
          Comments:  14  pages,  5  figures. Accepted for publications by
          MNRAS.  A  high resolution version of the paper is available at
          this http URL
          The  origin of intergalactic magnetic fields is still a mystery
          and  several  scenarios  have been proposed so far: among them,
          primordial  phase  transitions,  structure formation shocks and
          galactic  outflows. In this work we investigate how efficiently
          galactic  winds  can  provide  an intense and widespread "seed"
          magnetisation.  This may be used to explain the magnetic fields
          observed today in clusters of galaxies and in the intergalactic
          medium  (IGM).  We  use semi-analytic simulations of magnetised
          galactic winds coupled to high resolution N-body simulations of
          structure  formation to estimate lower and upper limits for the
          fraction  of  the IGM which can be magnetised up to a specified
          level.  We  find  that  galactic  winds  are  able  to  seed  a
          substantial fraction of the cosmic volume with magnetic fields.
          Most  regions  affected  by  winds  have magnetic fields in the
          range  -12  <  Log  B  <  -8 G, while higher seed fields can be
          obtained  only  rarely  and  in close proximity to wind-blowing
          galaxies.  These  seed  fields  are  sufficiently intense for a
          moderately  efficient  turbulent  dynamo to amplify them to the
          observed  values.  The  volume filling factor of the magnetised
          regions  strongly  depends  on  the efficiency of winds to load
          mass  from  the ambient medium. However, winds never completely
          fill the whole Universe and pristine gas can be found in cosmic
          voids  and  regions  unaffected  by  feedback even at z=0. This
          means  that,  in  principle,  there might be the possibility to
          probe  the  existence  of  primordial  magnetic  fields in such
          regions.

          Title: Discovery of a 3.6-hr Eclipsing Luminous X-Ray Binary in
          the Galaxy NGC 4214
          Authors:  Kajal  K.  Ghosh,  Saul  Rappaport, Allyn F. Tennant,
          Douglas A. Swartz, David Pooley, N. Madhusudhan
          Comments: 7 pages, submitted to ApJ
          We  report  the  discovery  of an eclipsing X-ray binary with a
          3.62-hr period within 24'' of the center of the dwarf starburst
          galaxy   NGC   4214.  The  orbital  period  places  interesting
          constraints  on  the nature of the binary, and allows for a few
          very  different interpretations. The most likely possibility is
          that  the  source  lies  within  NGC  4214  and  has  an  X-ray
          luminosity   of   up   to   0.7e39  erg/s  or  just  below  the
          ultraluminous  X-ray  source range. In this case the binary may
          well  be  comprised  of  a  naked  He-burning donor star with a
          neutron-star   accretor,   though   a  stellar-mass  black-hole
          accretor  cannot  be  completely  excluded. There is no obvious
          evidence  for  a strong stellar wind in the X-ray orbital light
          curve  that would be expected from a massive He star; thus, the
          mass  of  the He star should be < 3-4 solar masses. If correct,
          this  would represent a new class of very luminous X-ray binary
          --  perhaps related to Cyg X-3. Other less likely possibilities
          include  a  conventional  low-mass  X-ray  binary  that somehow
          manages  to  produce  such  a  high  X-ray  luminosity  and  is
          apparently   persistent   over  an  interval  of  years;  or  a
          foreground   AM  Her  binary  of  much  lower  luminosity  that
          fortuitously  lies  in the direction of NGC 4214. Any model for
          this system must accommodate the lack of an optical counterpart
          down to a limiting magnitude of 22.6 in the visible.

          Title: Spectral line variability amplitudes in AGNs
          Authors: W. Kollatschny, M. Zetzl, M. Dietrich
          Comments:  17  pages,  21 figures. Astronomy & Astrophysics, in
          press
          We  present  the results of a long-term variability campaign of
          very  broad-line  AGNs  with  line widths broader than FWHM $>$
          5000  kms$^{-1}$.  The  main  goal  of our investigation was to
          study  whether  the  widths of the optical broad emission lines
          are   correlated  with  the  optical  intensity  variations  on
          timescales of years. Our AGN sample consisted of 10 objects. We
          detected  a  significant  correlation between optical continuum
          variability amplitudes and H$\beta$ emission line widths (FWHM)
          and,  to  a  lesser  degree,  between  H$\beta$  line intensity
          variations   and   H$\beta$   equivalent  widths.  We  add  the
          spectroscopic  data  of  variable  AGNs  from the literature to
          supplement  our sample. The AGNs from other optical variability
          campaigns  with  different  line-widths  helped  to improve the
          statistical  significance  of  our  very broad-line AGN sample.
          After  including  the  data  on  35  additional  galaxies,  the
          correlation  between  optical  continuum variability amplitudes
          and H$\beta$ emission line widths becomes even more significant
          and  the probability that this is a random correlation drops to
          0.7 percent.

          Progenitors: Direct Collapse versus Fallback

          The  collapsar  engine  behind  long-duration  gamma-ray bursts
          extracts  the  energy  released  from  the rapid accretion of a
          collapsing   star  onto  a  stellar-massed  black  hole.  In  a
          collapsing  star,  this  black  hole  can form in two ways: the
          direct  collapse  of the stellar core into a black hole and the
          delayed  collapse  of a black hole caused by fallback in a weak
          supernova  explosion.  In  the case of a delayed-collapse black
          hole,  the strong collapsar-driven explosion overtakes the weak
          supernova  explosion  before  shock  breakout,  and  it is very
          difficult  to  distinguish  this  black hole formation scenario
          from    the    direct    collapse    scenario.   However,   the
          delayed-collapse mechanism, with its double explosion, produces
          explosive  nucleosynthetic  yields that are very different from
          the  direct collapse scenario. We present 1-dimensional studies
          of  the  nucleosynthetic  yields from both black hole formation
          scenarios,   deriving   differences   and   trends   in   their
          nucleosynthetic yields.

          In  this  article  we  present different aspects of AGN studies
          demonstrating  the  importance  of  the UV spectral range. Most
          important  diagnostic  lines  for studying the general physical
          conditions  as  well  as  the metalicities in the central broad
          line  region in AGN are emitted in the UV. The UV/FUV continuum
          in  AGN  excites  not  only the emission lines in the immediate
          surrounding  but  it  is  responsible for the ionization of the
          intergalactic  medium  in  the  early  stages  of the universe.
          Variability studies of the emission line profiles of AGN in the
          UV  give  us information on the structure and kinematics of the
          immediate surrounding of the central supermassive black hole as
          well as on its mass itself.

          We  formulate  and  solve the equations governing the transonic
          behaviour  of  a general relativistic black-hole accretion disc
          with   non-zero  advection  velocity.  We  demonstrate  that  a
          relativistic  Rankine-Hugoniot  shock  may  form leading to the
          formation  of  accretion  powered  outflow.  We  show  that the
          critical  points  of  transonic discs generally do not coincide
          with  the  corresponding  sonic  points. The collection of such
          sonic  points forms an axisymmetric hypersurface, generators of
          which   are  the  acoustic  null  geodesics,  i.e.  the  phonon
          trajectories.  Such  a surface is shown to be identical with an
          acoustic  event  horizon.  The acoustic surface gravity and the
          corresponding  analogue  horizon  temperature  $T_{AH}$  at the
          acoustic  horizon  are  then  computed  in terms of fundamental
          accretion  parameters.  Physically, the analogue temperature is
          associated  with  the thermal phonon radiation analogous to the
          Hawking   radiation   of   the   black-hole   horizon.Thus,  an
          axisymmetric  black-hole  accretion  disc  is  established as a
          natural  example  of  the classical analogue gravity model, for
          which  two kinds of horizon exist simultaneously. We have shown
          that  for  some  values  of  astrophysically relevant accretion
          parameters,  the analogue temperature exceeds the corresponding
          Hawking  temperature.  We  point  out  that acoustic {\it white
          holes}  can  also be generated for a multi-transonic black-hole
          accretion  with  a  shock.  Such  a white hole, produced at the
          shock,  is always flanked by two acoustic black holes generated
          at  the  inner  and the outer sonic points. Finally, we discuss
          possible applications of our work to other astrophysical events
          which may exhibit analogue effects.

          This  is  the  fourth  in  our  series  of papers investigating
          radio-excess  galaxies,  which  have  radio emission associated
          with   an  active  nucleus  but  which  do  not  fit  into  the
          traditional  categories  of  either  radio-loud  or radio-quiet
          active  galaxies.  In this paper, we present optical spectra of
          our  sample  of  FIR-luminous  radio-excess  galaxies.  Optical
          emission  line  diagnostics  are used to determine the dominant
          source  of the ionizing radiation. We find that radio excess is
          an  excellent  indicator  of the presence of an active nucleus:
          the  radio-excess sample contains a much higher fraction of AGN
          than  samples  selected on FIR luminosity alone, or using other
          criteria   such  as  warm  FIR  colors.  Several  objects  have
          ambiguous  classifications  and  are  likely  to  be  composite
          objects  with  mixed  excitation.  The type of optical spectrum
          appears  to  be  associated with the radio-loudness: radio-loud
          objects may be more `pure' AGN than radio-intermediate objects.
          We  find  strong  evidence  for  interaction  between the radio
          plasma  and  the  surrounding gas. The jet energy fluxes of the
          radio-excess  objects,  inferred from the [O III] luminosities,
          are  lower  than in powerful radio sources, consistent with our
          previous    results.    We    conclude   that   the   jets   of
          radio-intermediate  sources are intrinsically weaker than those
          in  sources  with  more  powerful radio emission. A significant
          fraction  of  the  sample  spectra  show post-starburst stellar
          continuum,  with  A-star  absorption lines, consistent with the
          large  fraction  of  merging  or disturbed host galaxies in the
          sample.  The  ages  of the radio sources are significantly less
          than those of A stars indicating that, if the radio sources are
          associated  with merging activity, there is a delay between the
          interaction   and   the   initiation  of  the  radio  activity.

          We  present further results from our optical spectrophotometric
          campaign  ongoing at the Astronomical Observatory of Bologna in
          Loiano  (Italy)  on unidentified hard X-ray sources detected by
          INTEGRAL.  We  observed  spectroscopically the putative optical
          counterparts  of  the  INTEGRAL  sources  IGR  J00234+6141, IGR
          J01583+6713,   IGR   J06074+2205,   IGR   J13091+1137  and  IGR
          J20286+2544.  We  find that the first two are Galactic objects,
          namely a Cataclysmic Variable at a distance of about 300 pc and
          a Be/X transient High-Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) located at about
          6.4  kpc, respectively, whereas the last one is identified with
          MCG  +04-48-002,  a  Starburst/HII galaxy at redshift z = 0.013
          hiding  a Seyfert 2 nucleus. We identify IGR J13091+1137 as the
          (likely  Seyfert  2  type)  active  nucleus of galaxy NGC 4992,
          which  we classify as an X-ray Bright, Optically Normal Galaxy;
          this is the first example of this type of object to be detected
          by  INTEGRAL, and one of the closest of this class. We moreover
          confirm  the  possible  Be/X  nature of IGR J06074+2205, and we
          estimate  it  to  be  at  a  distance  of  about 1 kpc. We also

          PKS  0352-686,  the possible counterpart of the INTEGRAL source

          Using archival Chandra observations of 19 LINERs we explore the
          X-ray  properties  of  their  inner kiloparsec to determine the
          origin  of  their  nuclear  X-ray  emission, to investigate the
          presence  of  an  AGN,  and to identify the power source of the
          optical  emission lines. The relative numbers of LINER types in
          our  sample  are  similar  to  those  in  optical spectroscopic
          surveys.  We find that diffuse, thermal emission is very common
          and  is concentrated within the central few hundred parsec. The
          average  spectra  of the hot gas in spirals and ellipticals are
          very  similar  to  those of normal galaxies. They can be fitted
          with  a  thermal  plasma  (kT~0.5 keV) plus a power law (photon
          index  of 1.3-1.5) model. There are on average 3 detected point
          sources    in    their    inner    kiloparsec   with   L(0.5-10
          keV)~10^37-10^40   erg/s.  The  average  cumulative  luminosity
          functions  for sources in spirals and ellipticals are identical
          to  those  of  normal galaxies. In the innermost circle of 2.5"
          radius  in each galaxy we find an AGN in 12 of the 19 galaxies.
          The  AGNs  contribute  a  median  of  60%  of  the  0.5-10  keV
          luminosity  of  the central 2.5" region, they have luminosities
          of  10^37-10^39  erg/s  (Eddington  ratios 10^-8 to 10^-5). The
          ionizing  luminosity  of  the  AGNs  is not enough to power the
          observed  optical  emission  lines  in  this particular sample.
          Thus,  we  suggest  that  the  lines  are powered either by the
          mechanical  interaction  of  an  AGN  jet  (or  wind)  with the
          circumnuclear    gas,    or    by   stellar   processes,   e.g.
          photoionization by post-AGB stars or young stars.

          Title:   Molecular  outflows  around  high-mass  young  stellar
          objects

          Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures, To appear in AJ (July 2006)
          We  present a study of molecular outflows using high-resolution
          mapping  of  the CO (1-0) line emission toward eight relatively
          nearby  6.7  GHz  methanol  masers,  which  are associated with
          massive  star  forming regions. Outflows were detected in seven
          out  of eight sources, and five of them clearly show bipolar or
          multiple  outflow  morphologies.  These  outflows  have typical
          masses of a few solar masses, momenta of tens of $M_{\odot}$ km
          s$^{-1}$,  kinetic  energies  of $\sim$ 10$^{45}$ ergs, and the
          mass  entrainment  rate of a few $10^{-5} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.
          They have significantly more mass and kinetic energy than their
          low-mass  counterparts.  In  some  of  the sources, the massive
          outflow  is obviously associated with a particular massive star
          in  the  cluster, while in others the origin remains uncertain.
          The  high  detection  rate  of  outflows toward methanol masers
          suggests   that   the   outflow  phase  of  massive  protostars
          encompasses the methanol maser phase.

          Comments: 7 figures, accepted to Astrophysical Journal
          We  present the properties of a group of young stars associated
          with  the  well-studied  T Tauri star system AS 353, located in
          the  Aquila  star-forming region. The association is identified
          using  radial  velocity measurements of sample objects selected
          from  the  Herbig  and  Bell  Catalog  based  on  their spatial
          proximity  to  AS  353.  Radial velocities of nine objects were
          measured  from  multi-epoch  high-resolution  (R~30,000) H-band
          spectra  obtained  with  NIRSPEC  on  Keck  II. High-resolution
          K-band  spectra  were  also  obtained  for  most  of the sample
          objects.   Spectral   types   and   rotational  velocities  are
          determined  for  all  objects  in  the  sample. The multi-epoch
          H-band  spectra were examined for radial velocity variations in
          order  to  detect possible spectroscopic binaries. Eight of the
          nine  objects have radial velocities that are consistent within
          the 1-sigma scatter of the sample. From their mean of -8.6 km/s
          these  eight objects have a standard deviation of 2 km/s, which
          suggests  that  the  sample stars are related. The ninth object
          shows  significant  radial  velocity variations between epochs,
          characteristic   of   a   spectroscopic   binary.  The  overall
          multiplicity  of  the  sample  is high; we observed 13 stars in
          seven   systems,   identifying   three   new  candidate  binary
          components in this project. Many of the spectra reveal hydrogen
          emission   lines   typical   of   strong  accretion  processes,
          indicating  that  most  of  these  objects harbor circumstellar
          disks  and  are  less  than a few million years old. We discuss
          possible  interpretations  of  the enigmatic pure emission line
          spectrum  of HBC 684. This work represents the highest spectral
          resolution  infrared  observations to date of these intriguing,
          nearby young stars.

          Title: The Nature of SS433 and the Ultraluminous X-ray Sources
          Authors: M.C. Begelman, A.R. King, J.E. Pringle
          Comments: MNRAS, in press. 7 pages, no figures
          The  periodic  precession  (162--day)  and  nodding  (6.3--day)
          motions of the jets in SS433 are driven in the outer regions of
          the  disc, whereas the jets themselves, being relativistic, are
          launched near the black hole at the disc centre. Given that the
          nutation period is comparable to the dynamical timescale in the
          outer regions of the disc, it seems unlikely that these periods
          can  be  communicated  efficiently  to the disc centre. Here we
          propose  that the massive outflow observed in SS433 is launched
          at  large radii in the disc, about 1/10 of the outer disc edge,
          and  that it is this outflow which responds to the oscillations
          of the outer disc and determines the direction of the jets. The
          massive  outflow  is  launched at large radius because the mass
          transfer  rate  is  hyper-Eddington. This implies not only that
          the  total  luminosity of SS433 exceeds $\le$ by a considerable
          factor,  but also that the radiative output is collimated along
          the  outflow.  We  thus  suggest that SS433 is an ultraluminous
          X-ray source (ULX) viewed `from the side'. We also suggest that
          the obscured {\it INTEGRAL} sources may be SS433--like objects,
          but with slightly lower mass transfer rates.

          Astrophysical     Plasmas:     Exact     Solutions    Including
          Momentum-Dependent Escape
          Authors: P. A. Becker, T. Le, C. D. Dermer
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          Stochastic   acceleration   of   charged   particles   due   to
          interactions with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma waves is the
          dominant  process  leading  to the formation of the high-energy
          electron  and  ion  distributions in a variety of astrophysical
          systems.   Collisions   with   the  waves  influence  both  the
          energization  and  the  spatial transport of the particles, and
          therefore  it  is  important  to treat these two aspects of the
          problem   in   a   self-consistent   manner.   We   solve   the
          representative   Fokker-Planck   equation   to  obtain  a  new,
          closed-form  solution  for  the time-dependent Green's function
          describing  the  acceleration  and  escape of relativistic ions
          interacting  with  Alfven  or  fast-mode waves characterized by
          momentum  diffusion  coefficient  $D(p)\propto  p^q$  and  mean
          particle escape timescale $t_esc(p) \propto p^{q-2}$, where $p$
          is  the particle momentum and $q$ is the power-law index of the
          MHD  wave  spectrum. In particular, we obtain solutions for the
          momentum  distribution  of  the ions in the plasma and also for
          the  momentum distribution of the escaping particles, which may
          form   an  energetic  outflow.  The  general  features  of  the
          solutions  are  illustrated  via  examples  based  on  either a
          Kolmogorov  or  Kraichnan  wave  spectrum.  The new expressions
          complement  the  results  obtained  by  Park and Petrosian, who
          presented  exact  solutions for the hard-sphere scattering case
          ($q=2$)  in  addition  to  other  scenarios in which the escape
          timescale  has  a  power-law  dependence  on  the momentum. Our
          results   have  direct  relevance  for  models  of  high-energy
          radiation    and   cosmic-ray   production   in   astrophysical
          environments  such as $\gamma$-ray bursts, active galaxies, and
          magnetized coronae around black holes.

          Standard   LCDM   predicts   that  the  major  merger  rate  of
          galaxy-size  dark matter halos rises rapidly with redshift. The
          average  number  of  close  companions per galaxy, Nc, is often
          used   to   infer  the  galaxy  merger  rate,  however,  recent
          observational  studies suggest that Nc evolves very little with
          redshift.  Here  we  use  a  "hybrid"  N-  body simulation plus
          analytic substructure model to predict Nc directly. We identify
          dark  matter  subhalos with galaxies and show that the observed
          lack  of  close  pair  count  evolution arises because the high
          merger  rate  per  halo  at  early  times  is counteracted by a
          decrease in the number of halos massive enough to host a galaxy
          pair.  We  compare our results to data compiled from the DEEP2,
          SSRS2, and the UZC redshift surveys. Observed pair counts match
          our predictions if we assume a monotonic mapping between galaxy
          luminosity  and the maximum circular velocity that each subhalo
          had  when  it  was  first  accreted  onto  its  host halo. This
          suggests   that   satellite  galaxies  are  significantly  more
          resilient  to  destruction than are dissipationless dark matter
          subhalos.  We  argue  that  while  Nc does not provide a direct
          measure  of the halo merger rate, it offers a powerful means to
          constrain  the  Halo  Occupation  Distribution  and the spatial
          distribution of galaxies within halos. Interpreted in this way,
          close  pair  counts  provide  a useful test of galaxy formation
          processes on < 100 kpc scales.

          Title:  Hot  Accretion  With  Conduction:  Spontaneous  Thermal
          Outflows
          Authors: Takamitsu Tanaka, Kristen Menou (Columbia)
          Comments: 38 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ
          Motivated  by the low-collisionality of gas accreted onto black
          holes  in  Sgr  A* and other nearby galactic nuclei, we study a
          family   of  2D  advective  accretion  solutions  with  thermal
          conduction.  While  we only impose global inflow, the accretion
          flow  spontaneously  develops  bipolar  outflows.  The  role of
          conduction  is  key  in  providing  the extra degree of freedom
          (latitudinal   energy  transport)  necessary  to  launch  these
          rotating  thermal  outflows. The sign of the Bernoulli constant
          does not discriminate between inflowing and outflowing regions.
          Our  parameter survey covers mass outflow rates from ~ 0 to 13%
          of  the  net  inflow rate, outflow velocities from ~0 to 11% of
          the  local Keplerian velocity and outflow opening angles from ~
          0  to  60  degs.  As  the magnitude of conduction is increased,
          outflows  can  adopt  a conical geometry, pure inflow solutions
          emerge,  and  the limit of 2D non-rotating Bondi-like solutions
          is    eventually    reached.   These   results   confirm   that
          radiatively-inefficient,    hot    accretion   flows   have   a
          hydrodynamical propensity to generate bipolar thermal outflows.

          Inverse-Compton Scattering of Shock Breakout Thermal Photons
          Authors: Z. G. Dai, Bing Zhang, E. W. Liang
          Comments: 10 pages, 1 figure
          The gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060218/SN 2006aj is a peculiar event,
          with the second lowest redshift, low luminosity, long duration,
          chromatic  lightcurve features, and in particular, the presence
          of  a  thermal  component  in the X-ray and UV-optical spectra.
          Thanks  to  detailed temporal and spectral coverage of the {\em
          Swift}  observatory,  the  abundant  data  allow the GRB prompt
          emission to be modelled in great detail for the first time. The
          low   flux   of   prompt   UV/optical  emission  disfavors  the
          conventional internal shock/synchrotron radiation models, which
          generally predict strong UV/optical emission. Here we show that
          the  unusual  prompt  emission of GRB 060218 can be produced by
          inverse-Compton  scattering  of  shock-accelerated relativistic
          electrons  off the detected thermal photons. A pair of (forward
          plus reverse) shocks form when a relativistic outflow interacts
          with   a  preexisting  slower  shell.  The  observed  gamma-ray
          emission  and X-ray emission arise from the reverse-shocked and
          forward-shocked  regions,  respectively.  A  fit  to  the  data
          requires  an  initially increasing outflow luminosity, which is
          consistent with the prediction of the popular collapsar model.

          Title: The pattern of accretion flow onto Sgr A*
          Authors: Monika Moscibrodzka Tapas K. Das Bozena Czerny
          Comments: 10 pages,7 figures, accepted to MNRAS
          The material accreting onto Sgr A* most probably comes from the
          nearby  stars. We analyze the pattern of this flow at distances
          of  a  fraction  of  a parsec and we argue that the net angular
          momentum  of  this  material is low but non-negligible, and the
          initially  supersonic disk accretion changes into subsonic flow
          with  constant  angular  momentum.  Next  we  estimate the flow
          parameters  at  a distance $R_{BHL}$ from the black hole and we
          argue that for the plausible parameter range the accretion flow
          is non-stationary. The inflow becomes supersonic at distance of
          $\sim  10^4  R_g$  but the solution does not continue below the
          horizon  and  the material piles up forming a torus, or a ring,
          at a distance of a few up to tens of Schwarzchild radii. Such a
          torus   is   known  to  be  unstable  and  may  explain  strong
          variability of the flow in Sgr A*. Our considerations show that
          the   temporary   formation   of  such  a  torus  seems  to  be
          unavoidable.
          Our  best  fitting model predicts a rather large accretion rate
          of around $4 \cdot 10^{-6} M_{\odot}/yr$ directly on Sgr A*. We
          argue  that  magnetic  fields  in the flow are tangled and this
          allows  our model to overcome the disagreement with the Faraday
          rotation limits.

          Comments: 14 pages, 4 figures, sequel of Phys. Rev. D 73 023520
          (2006), submitted to Physical Review
          We investigate the possibility that dark energy does not couple
          to gravitation in the same way than ordinary matter, yielding a
          violation  of  the  weak  and  strong equivalence principles on
          cosmological  scales.  We  build a transient mechanism in which
          gravitation  is  pushed  away  from  general  relativity  by  a
          Born-Infeld   gauge   interaction   acting  as  an  "Abnormally
          Weighting"  (dark)  Energy.  This  mechanism  accounts  for the
          Hubble  diagram  of  far-away supernovae by cosmic acceleration
          and   time   variation  of  the  gravitational  constant  while
          accounting   naturally   for   the  present  tests  on  general
          relativity.

          simulations  -  II.  A  multiphase  model with supernova energy
          feedback
          Authors:  Cecilia  Scannapieco, Patricia B. Tissera, Simon D.M.

          Comments: MNRAS submitted
          We   have   developed  a  new  scheme  to  treat  a  multiphase
          interstellar   medium   in   smoothed   particle  hydrodynamics
          simulations  of  galaxy  formation. This scheme can represent a
          co-spatial  mixture  of  cold  and  hot  ISM components, and is
          formulated  without  scale-dependent  parameters.  It  is  thus
          particularly   suited  to  studies  of  cosmological  structure
          formation  where  galaxies  with  a  wide  range of masses form
          simultaneously.  We  also present new algorithms for energy and
          heavy  element  injection by supernovae, and show that together
          these  schemes can reproduce several important observed effects
          in   galaxy  evolution.  Both  in  collapsing  systems  and  in
          quiescent  galaxies  our  codes  can  reproduce  the  Kennicutt
          relation  between  the  surface  densities  of  gas and of star
          formation.  Strongly metal-enhanced winds are generated in both
          cases  with  ratios  of  mass-loss  to star formation which are
          similar to those observed. This leads to a self-regulated cycle
          for  star  formation  activity.  The overall impact of feedback
          depends on galaxy mass. Star formation is suppressed at most by
          a  factor of a few in massive galaxies, but in low-mass systems
          the  effects  can  be  much  larger,  giving  star formation an
          episodic,  bursty  character.  The  larger  the energy fraction
          assumed  available  in  feedback, the more massive the outflows
          and  the  lower  the  final  stellar masses. Winds from forming
          disks  are  collimated  perpendicular  to the disk plane, reach
          velocities  up  to  1000 km/s, and efficiently transport metals
          out of the galaxies. The asymptotically unbound baryon fraction
          drops  from  >95% to ~30% from the least to the most massive of
          our  idealised galaxies, but the fraction of all metals ejected
          with  this  component  exceeds  60 per cent regardless of mass.
          Such  winds  could plausibly enrich the intergalactic medium to
          observed levels.

          The   total   extragalactic  background  radiation  can  be  an
          important  test  of  the  global  star formation history (SFH).
          Using  direct  observational  estimates  of the SFH, along with
          standard  assumptions about the initial mass function (IMF), we
          calculate  the total extragalactic background radiation and the
          observed  stellar  density  today.  We show that plausible SFHs
          allow  a  significant  range  in  each quantity, but that their
          ratio  is  very  tightly  constrained. Current estimates of the
          stellar  mass  and  extragalactic  background  are difficult to
          reconcile,  as  long  as the IMF is fixed to the Salpeter slope
          above  1  Msun.  The  joint  confidence  interval  of these two
          quantities  only  agrees  with that determined from the allowed
          range  of  SFH  fits at the 3-sigma level, and for our best-fit
          values  the  discrepancy  is about a factor of two. Alternative
          energy  sources  that  contribute  to  the  background, such as
          active galactic nuclei (AGN), Population III stars, or decaying
          particles, appear unlikely to resolve the discrepancy. However,
          changes  to the IMF allow plausible solutions to the background
          problem.  The  simplest  is  an  average  IMF with an increased
          contribution  from  stars around 1.5--4 Msun. A ``paunchy'' IMF
          of  this sort could emerge as a global average if low mass star
          formation   is   suppressed   in  galaxies  experiencing  rapid
          starbursts.  Such  an  IMF  is  consistent with observations of
          star-forming  regions,  and  would help to reconcile the fossil
          record of star formation with the directly observed SFH.

          Thermal-gravitational  instability  (TGI)  is  studied  in  the
          protogalactic  environment.  We extend our previous work, where
          we found that dense clumps first form out of hot background gas
          by  thermal instability and later a small fraction of them grow
          to   virialized   clouds   of  mass  M_c  >~  6X10^6  M_sun  by
          gravitational  infall  and merging. But these clouds have large
          angular   momentum,   so   they  would  be  difficult,  if  not
          impossible,  to  further evolve into globular clusters. In this
          paper,  through three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in a
          uniformly  rotating frame, we explore if the Coriolis force due
          to  rotation  in  protogalactic  disk regions can hinder binary
          merging  and reduce angular momentum of the clouds formed. With
          rotation  comparable  to  the  Galactic  rotation  at the Solar
          circle,  the  Coriolis force is smaller than the pressure force
          during  the  early thermal instability stage. So the properties
          of  clumps  formed  by  thermal  instability  are  not affected
          noticeably  by  rotation,  except  increased  angular momentum.
          However, during later stage the Coriolis force becomes dominant
          over   the   gravity,   and   hence   the   further  growth  to
          gravitationally   bound  clouds  by  gravitational  infall  and
          merging is prohibited. Our results show that the Coriolis force
          effectively  destroys  the  picture of cloud formation via TGI,
          rather than alleviate the problem of large angular momentum.

          Title:  An  unified  model  for  superluminal  motion and state
          transition on microquasars and quasars
          Authors: Biping Gong
          Comments: 15 pages, 5 figures. submitted
          Superluminal  motion  has  been interpreted as relativistically
          moving  out  flow.  The increasing observations of such sources
          provide  chance  to investigate their mechanism in detail. This
          paper  proposes  that superluminal motion may be jet precession
          induced  blob  motion.  This  model  can  interpret a number of
          observational phenomena which are not well understood under the
          scenario  of  bulk  motion, such as the absence of the receding
          blob  after the outburst and the receding blob becomes brighter
          than  the  approaching  one  in  XTE  J1550-564  . Moreover the
          compton  scattering  of photos from a warped accretion disk may
          form a structured jet. And the precession of the structured jet
          may  lead  to  the  complicated  state  transitions observed in
          microquasars like GRS 1915+105. Applying to AGNs, the model may
          explain  the  scales  of  length  and  time  of  the  phenomena
          proportioning  to the mass of the black hole. The new model can
          be tested easily on microquasars, i.e., XTE J1550-564, on which
          the previous receding blob should move towards the core instead
          of  away  from it after 2002, and the previous approaching blob
          shall  disappear.  %For  GRS  1915+105 the vibration of the two
          blobs  should  be observed in both %the time scales of year and
          days.

          We present low-resolution turbulence profiles of the atmosphere
          above  Dome  C,  Antarctica,  measured with the MASS instrument
          during  25  nights  in  March-May  2004.  Except for the lowest
          layer,  Dome  C  has  significantly  less turbulence than Cerro
          Tololo   and   Cerro  Pachon.  In  particular,  the  integrated
          turbulence  at  16  km is always less than the median values at
          the  two  Chilean  sites.  From  these profiles we evaluate the
          photometric   noise   produced   by   scintillation,   and  the
          atmospheric  contribution  to  the error budget in narrow-angle
          differential   astrometry.   In   comparison   with   the   two
          mid-latitude  sites in Chile, Dome C offers a potential gain of
          about 3.6 in both photometric precision (for long integrations)
          and narrow-angle astrometry precision. These gain estimates are
          preliminary,  being  computed with average wind-speed profiles,
          but  the  validity  of our approach is confirmed by independent
          data. Although the data from Dome C cover a fairly limited time
          frame,  they  lend  strong  support to expectations that Dome C
          will   offer   significant   advantages   for  photometric  and
          astrometric studies.

          Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL
          We  present  new  Spitzer  Space  Telescope data on the nearby,
          low-metallicity  starburst  galaxy  NGC 5253, from the Infrared
          Array Camera IRAC and the Infrared Spectrograph IRS. The mid-IR
          luminosity  profile  of  NGC  5253  is  clearly dominated by an
          unresolved cluster near the center, which outshines the rest of
          the   galaxy   at   longer   wavelengths.   We  find  that  the
          [NeIII]/[NeII]  ratio decreases from $\sim8.5$ at the center to
          $\sim2.5$  at  a  distance  of  $\sim250$  pc. The [SIV]/[SIII]
          follows  the  [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio remarkably well, being about
          4-5  times  lower  at all distances. Our spectra reveal for the
          first   time   PAH  emission  feature  at  11.3$\mu$m  and  its
          equivalent width increases significantly with distance from the
          center.  The good anti-correlation between the PAH strength and
          the product between hardness and luminosity of the UV radiation
          field  suggests  photo-destruction  of the PAH molecules in the
          central  region.  The high-excitation [OIV]25.91$\mu$m line was
          detected   at   $0.42\times10^{-20}$W  cm$^{-2}$.  Our  results
          demonstrate   the   importance  of  spatially  resolved  mid-IR
          spectroscopy.

          MNRAS
          Ram  pressure stripping of galactic gas is generally assumed to
          be  inefficient  in  galaxy  groups  due  to the relatively low
          density  of  the  intragroup  medium  and  the  small  velocity
          dispersions  of  groups.  To  test this assumption, we obtained
          Chandra  X-ray  data of the starbursting spiral NGC 2276 in the
          NGC  2300  group  of  galaxies, a candidate for a strong galaxy
          interaction   with  hot  intragroup  gas.  The  data  reveal  a
          shock-like  feature  along the western edge of the galaxy and a
          low-surface-brightness  tail  extending to the east, similar to
          the  morphology  seen  in  other  wavebands. Spatially resolved
          spectroscopy shows that the data are consistent with intragroup
          gas  being  pressurized at the leading western edge of NGC 2276
          due  to the galaxy moving supersonically through the intragroup
          medium  at  a  velocity  ~850  km/s.  Detailed modelling of the
          gravitational  potential  of  NGC 2276 shows that the resulting
          ram-pressure  could  significantly affect the morphology of the
          outer  gas  disc  but  is  probably insufficient to strip large
          amounts  of  cold  gas from the disc. We estimate the mass loss
          rates due to turbulent viscous stripping and starburst outflows
          being  swept back by ram pressure, showing that both mechanisms
          could  plausibly  explain  the  presence  of  the  X-ray  tail.
          Comparison  to  existing HI measurements shows that most of the
          gas  escaping  the  galaxy is in a hot phase. With a total mass
          loss rate of roughly 5 M_Sun/yr, the galaxy could be losing its
          entire  present  HI supply within a Gyr. This demonstrates that
          the  removal  of  galactic  gas through interactions with a hot
          intragroup  medium  can  occur  rapidly enough to transform the
          morphology  of  galaxies  in  groups.  Implications of this for
          galaxy evolution in groups and clusters are briefly discussed.

          Globally  symmetric spinor condensates in free space are argued
          not  to  support  stable  topological  defects in either two or
          three  dimensions.  In the latter case, however, we show that a
          topological  skyrmion  can be stabilized by forcing it to adopt
          certain  density  profiles.  A  sufficient  condition  for  the
          existence   of   a  stable  skyrmion  in  three  dimensions  is
          formulated  and  illustrated  in  simple  examples. Our results
          pertain to Bose-Einstein condensation in Rb.

          The   total   extragalactic  background  radiation  can  be  an

          stellar  mass  and  extragalactic  background  are difficult to
          reconcile,  as  long  as the IMF is fixed to the Salpeter slope
          above  1  Msun.  The  joint  confidence  interval  of these two
          quantities  only  agrees  with that determined from the allowed
          range  of  SFH  fits at the 3-sigma level, and for our best-fit
          values  the  discrepancy  is about a factor of two. Alternative
          energy  sources  that  contribute  to  the  background, such as
          active galactic nuclei (AGN), Population III stars, or decaying
          particles, appear unlikely to resolve the discrepancy. However,
          changes  to the IMF allow plausible solutions to the background
          problem.  The  simplest  is  an  average  IMF with an increased
          contribution  from  stars around 1.5--4 Msun. A ``paunchy'' IMF
          of  this sort could emerge as a global average if low mass star
          formation   is   suppressed   in  galaxies  experiencing  rapid
          starbursts.  Such  an  IMF  is  consistent with observations of
          star-forming  regions,  and  would help to reconcile the fossil
          record of star formation with the directly observed SFH.

          Thermal-gravitational  instability  (TGI)  is  studied  in  the
          protogalactic  environment.  We extend our previous work, where
          we found that dense clumps first form out of hot background gas
          by  thermal instability and later a small fraction of them grow
          to   virialized   clouds   of  mass  M_c  >~  6X10^6  M_sun  by
          gravitational  infall  and merging. But these clouds have large
          angular   momentum,   so   they  would  be  difficult,  if  not
          impossible,  to  further evolve into globular clusters. In this
          paper,  through three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in a
          uniformly  rotating frame, we explore if the Coriolis force due
          to  rotation  in  protogalactic  disk regions can hinder binary
          merging  and reduce angular momentum of the clouds formed. With
          rotation  comparable  to  the  Galactic  rotation  at the Solar
          circle,  the  Coriolis force is smaller than the pressure force
          during  the  early thermal instability stage. So the properties
          of  clumps  formed  by  thermal  instability  are  not affected
          noticeably  by  rotation,  except  increased  angular momentum.
          However, during later stage the Coriolis force becomes dominant
          over   the   gravity,   and   hence   the   further  growth  to
          gravitationally   bound  clouds  by  gravitational  infall  and
          merging is prohibited. Our results show that the Coriolis force
          effectively  destroys  the  picture of cloud formation via TGI,
          rather than alleviate the problem of large angular momentum.

          Title:  An  unified  model  for  superluminal  motion and state
          transition on microquasars and quasars
          Authors: Biping Gong
          Comments: 15 pages, 5 figures. submitted
          Superluminal  motion  has  been interpreted as relativistically
          moving  out  flow.  The increasing observations of such sources
          provide  chance  to investigate their mechanism in detail. This
          paper  proposes  that superluminal motion may be jet precession
          induced  blob  motion.  This  model  can  interpret a number of
          observational phenomena which are not well understood under the
          scenario  of  bulk  motion, such as the absence of the receding
          blob  after the outburst and the receding blob becomes brighter
          than  the  approaching  one  in  XTE  J1550-564  . Moreover the
          compton  scattering  of photos from a warped accretion disk may
          form a structured jet. And the precession of the structured jet
          may  lead  to  the  complicated  state  transitions observed in
          microquasars like GRS 1915+105. Applying to AGNs, the model may
          explain  the  scales  of  length  and  time  of  the  phenomena
          proportioning  to the mass of the black hole. The new model can
          be tested easily on microquasars, i.e., XTE J1550-564, on which
          the previous receding blob should move towards the core instead
          of  away  from it after 2002, and the previous approaching blob
          shall  disappear.  %For  GRS  1915+105 the vibration of the two
          blobs  should  be observed in both %the time scales of year and
          days.

          We present low-resolution turbulence profiles of the atmosphere
          above  Dome  C,  Antarctica,  measured with the MASS instrument
          during  25  nights  in  March-May  2004.  Except for the lowest
          layer,  Dome  C  has  significantly  less turbulence than Cerro
          Tololo   and   Cerro  Pachon.  In  particular,  the  integrated
          turbulence  at  16  km is always less than the median values at
          the  two  Chilean  sites.  From  these profiles we evaluate the
          photometric   noise   produced   by   scintillation,   and  the
          atmospheric  contribution  to  the error budget in narrow-angle
          differential   astrometry.   In   comparison   with   the   two
          mid-latitude  sites in Chile, Dome C offers a potential gain of
          about 3.6 in both photometric precision (for long integrations)
          and narrow-angle astrometry precision. These gain estimates are
          preliminary,  being  computed with average wind-speed profiles,
          but  the  validity  of our approach is confirmed by independent
          data. Although the data from Dome C cover a fairly limited time
          frame,  they  lend  strong  support to expectations that Dome C
          will   offer   significant   advantages   for  photometric  and
          astrometric studies.

          Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL
          We  present  new  Spitzer  Space  Telescope data on the nearby,
          low-metallicity  starburst  galaxy  NGC 5253, from the Infrared
          Array Camera IRAC and the Infrared Spectrograph IRS. The mid-IR
          luminosity  profile  of  NGC  5253  is  clearly dominated by an
          unresolved cluster near the center, which outshines the rest of
          the   galaxy   at   longer   wavelengths.   We  find  that  the
          [NeIII]/[NeII]  ratio decreases from $\sim8.5$ at the center to
          $\sim2.5$  at  a  distance  of  $\sim250$  pc. The [SIV]/[SIII]
          follows  the  [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio remarkably well, being about
          4-5  times  lower  at all distances. Our spectra reveal for the
          first   time   PAH  emission  feature  at  11.3$\mu$m  and  its
          equivalent width increases significantly with distance from the
          center.  The good anti-correlation between the PAH strength and
          the product between hardness and luminosity of the UV radiation
          field  suggests  photo-destruction  of the PAH molecules in the
          central  region.  The high-excitation [OIV]25.91$\mu$m line was
          detected   at   $0.42\times10^{-20}$W  cm$^{-2}$.  Our  results
          demonstrate   the   importance  of  spatially  resolved  mid-IR
          spectroscopy.

          A  scalable  line  of  liquid argon TPC detectors is described,
          based  on  a  three dimensional cubic frame array immersed on a

          required  preliminary  R&D  activities  for the construction of
          detectors  with  active  mass ranging from 200 ton to 100 kTon.
          Such detectors appear as unique for supernova detection, proton

          Title:  Gas  stripping  in  galaxy  groups  -  the  case of the
          starburst spiral NGC 2276

          Comments:  16  pages,  8  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          Ram  pressure stripping of galactic gas is generally assumed to
          be  inefficient  in  galaxy  groups  due  to the relatively low
          density  of  the  intragroup  medium  and  the  small  velocity
          dispersions  of  groups.  To  test this assumption, we obtained
          Chandra  X-ray  data of the starbursting spiral NGC 2276 in the
          NGC  2300  group  of  galaxies, a candidate for a strong galaxy
          interaction   with  hot  intragroup  gas.  The  data  reveal  a
          shock-like  feature  along the western edge of the galaxy and a
          low-surface-brightness  tail  extending to the east, similar to
          the  morphology  seen  in  other  wavebands. Spatially resolved
          spectroscopy shows that the data are consistent with intragroup
          gas  being  pressurized at the leading western edge of NGC 2276
          due  to the galaxy moving supersonically through the intragroup
          medium  at  a  velocity  ~850  km/s.  Detailed modelling of the
          gravitational  potential  of  NGC 2276 shows that the resulting
          ram-pressure  could  significantly affect the morphology of the
          outer  gas  disc  but  is  probably insufficient to strip large
          amounts  of  cold  gas from the disc. We estimate the mass loss
          rates due to turbulent viscous stripping and starburst outflows
          being  swept back by ram pressure, showing that both mechanisms
          could  plausibly  explain  the  presence  of  the  X-ray  tail.
          Comparison  to  existing HI measurements shows that most of the
          gas  escaping  the  galaxy is in a hot phase. With a total mass
          loss rate of roughly 5 M_Sun/yr, the galaxy could be losing its
          entire  present  HI supply within a Gyr. This demonstrates that
          the  removal  of  galactic  gas through interactions with a hot
          intragroup  medium  can  occur  rapidly enough to transform the
          morphology  of  galaxies  in  groups.  Implications of this for
          galaxy evolution in groups and clusters are briefly discussed.

          Globally  symmetric spinor condensates in free space are argued
          not  to  support  stable  topological  defects in either two or
          three  dimensions.  In the latter case, however, we show that a
          topological  skyrmion  can be stabilized by forcing it to adopt
          certain  density  profiles.  A  sufficient  condition  for  the
          existence   of   a  stable  skyrmion  in  three  dimensions  is
          formulated  and  illustrated  in  simple  examples. Our results
          pertain to Bose-Einstein condensation in Rb.

          We  present  the  first  results from a 500 ksec Chandra ACIS-I
          observation of M87. At soft energies (0.5-1.0 keV), we detect a
          complex  filamentary  structure associated with the eastern and
          southwestern  arms.  Many  filaments are spatially resolved and
          have   widths   of  ~300  pc.  This  filamentary  structure  is
          particularly  striking  in the eastern arm where we suggest the
          filaments are outer edges of a series of buoyant bubbles filled
          with  relativistic plasma, produced by the central supermassive
          black  hole, in a succession of small outbursts occurring every
          ~6  x  10^6  years.  The  X-ray structures may be influenced by
          magnetic  filamentation.  At  hard  energies  (3.5-7.5 keV), we
          detect  a  nearly circular shell of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc).
          This  ring  of  hard  X-ray  emission  provides  an unambiguous
          signature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the SMBH,
          traversing  the M87 atmosphere. The observed spectral hardening
          corresponds  to  a  temperature rise from 2.0 to 2.4 keV, which
          translates  to  a  Mach  number  M~1.2  for monoatomic gas with
          gamma=5/3.  In  addition,  we  detect  two  additional  surface
          brightness  edges  (at  radii  of  ~0.6'  and ~1.2'). The ~0.6'
          feature  may be the gas just outside the ``piston'' driving the
          2.8'  shock,  while the ~1.2' feature is probably produced by a
          secondary outburst.

          Title: AGN Jet Mass Loading and Truncation by Stellar Winds
          Authors: Alexander Hubbard, Eric G. Blackman
          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures
          Active  Galactic  Nuclei  can  produce extremely powerful jets.
          While  tightly  collimated,  the  scale  of  these jets and the
          stellar  density at galactic centers implies that there will be
          many jet/star interactions, which can mass-load the jet through
          stellar  winds. Previous work employed modest wind mass outflow
          rates, but this does not apply when mass loading is provided by
          a  small  number  of  high  mass-loss  stars.  We  construct  a
          framework  for  jet mass-loading by stellar winds for a broader
          spectrum  of  wind  mass-loss  rates  than  has been previously
          considered.  Given  the  observed stellar mass distributions in
          galactic  centers,  we  find  that  even  highly efficient (0.1
          Eddington  luminosity)  jets  from  supermassive black holes of
          masses  $M_{BH}  \la 10^4M_{\odot}$ are rapidly mass loaded and
          quenched  by  stellar  winds.  For  $10^4 M_{\odot}<M_{BH}<10^8
          M_{\odot}$,  the  quenching  length of highly efficient jets is
          independent  of  the  jet's mechanical luminosity. Stellar wind
          mass-loading  is  unable  to  quench  efficient  jets from more
          massive engines, but can account for the observed truncation of
          the  inefficient  M87  jet,  and  implies  a  baryon  dominated
          composition  on  scales  $\ga 2$ kpc therein even if the jet is
          initially pair plasma dominated.

          Title: Dark matter halo response to the disk growth
          Authors: Jun-Hwan Choi, Yu Lu, H. J. Mo, Martin D. Weinberg
          Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  consider  the  sensitivity  of the circular-orbit adiabatic
          contraction  approximation  \citep{bw84,  blumenthal86}  to the
          timing of baryon condensation and the orbital structure of dark
          matter    halos    in    the   $\Lambda$CDM   paradigm.   Using
          one-dimensional  hydrodynamic  simulations  including  the dark
          matter   halo  mass  accretion  history  and  gas  cooling,  we
          demonstrate  that  the adiabatic approximation is approximately
          valid  even though halos and disks may assemble simultaneously.
          We further demonstrate the validity of the simple approximation
          for  $\Lambda$CDM halos \citep[e.g.][hereafter NFW]{NFW97} with
          isotropic velocity distributions using three-dimensional N-body
          simulations.  This  result  is  easily understood: an isotropic
          velocity  distribution  in  a cuspy halo requires more circular
          orbits   than  radial  orbits.  Conversely,  the  approximation
          considerably  differs  in  the  extreme  case of a radial orbit
          halo.  The approximation overestimates the response a core dark
          matter  halo, where radial orbit fraction is larger. Because no
          astronomically  relevant  models  are  dominated by low-angular
          momentum orbits in the vicinity of the disk and the growth time
          scale  is never shorter than a dynamical time, we conclude that
          the adiabatic contraction approximation is generally acceptable
          in the CDM cosmology.

          Title: The X-ray properties of the dwarf Magellanic-type galaxy
          NGC 55

          MNRAS
          We   present  an  analysis  of  the  X-ray  properties  of  the
          Magellanic-type   galaxy   NGC   55  based  on  two  contiguous
          XMM-Newton observations. We detect a total of 137 X-ray sources
          in  the  field  of  view,  42  of  which are located within the
          optical  confines  of  the galaxy. On the basis of X-ray colour
          classification  and after correcting for background objects, we
          conclude that our source sample includes ~ 20 X-ray binaries, 5
          supernova  remnants  and  7 very soft sources (including 2 good
          candidate  supersoft  sources) associated with NGC 55. Detailed
          spectral  and  timing  analysis  was  carried  out  on 4 of the
          brightest  X-ray  sources.  One  of these objects is identified
          with  a  Galactic  foreground star and is a possible new RS CVn
          system.  The  other  three  are consistent with accreting X-ray
          binaries,  though further evidence of short term variability is
          required   to  confirm  this.  We  also  find  evidence  of  an
          underlying  component,  which is concentrated on the bar region
          but  has  an  extent of at least 6' (3 kpc) in the plane of the
          galaxy  and  +/-  1'  (+/-  500  pc)  perpendicular to it. This
          emission  is  best  fitted  by  a thermal plasma plus power-law
          model  but  with  high intrinsic absorption consistent with its
          location  in  the  central disc of the galaxy. We interpret the
          soft component as diffuse thermal emission linked to regions of
          current star formation, whilst the hard power-law component may
          originate  in  unresolved  X-ray  binary sources. The intrinsic
          luminosity  of this residual disc emission may exceed Lx ~ 6e38
          ergs/s  (0.3-6 keV). A comparison with other Magellanic systems
          confirms  that,  in  terms  of  both  its discrete X-ray source
          population   and  its  extended  emission,  NGC  55  has  X-ray
          properties which are typical of its class.

          Title: SHARC-2 350 Micron Observations of Distant Submillimeter
          Selected Galaxies

          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  present  350um  observations  of  15  Chapman et al. (2005)
          submillimeter  galaxies  (SMGs)  with  radio  counterparts  and
          optical  redshifts.  We  detect  12  and obtain sensitive upper
          limits  for  3, providing direct, precise measurements of their
          far-infrared luminosities and characteristic dust temperatures.
          With   these,   we   verify   the   linear  radio--far-infrared
          correlation  at  redshifts  of  z  ~  1-3  and  luminosities of
          10^11-10^13  L_sun,  with  a power-law index of 1.02+-0.12, and
          rms  scatter  of  0.12 dex. However, either the the correlation
          constant  'q'  or  the  dust  emissivity  'beta'  is lower than
          measured  locally. The best fitting q ~ 2.14 is consistent with
          SMGs being predominantly starbust galaxies, without significant
          AGN contribution, at far-infrared wavelengths. Gas-to-dust mass
          ratios  are  estimated  at 54+-13 kappa(850um)/0.15 m^2 kg^-1],
          depending  on  the absoption efficiency 'kappa', with intrinsic
          dispersion  ~  40%  around  the  mean  value. Dust temperatures
          consistent  with  34.6+-3K  [beta/1.5]^-0.71,  at  z ~ 1.5-3.5,
          suggest  that far-infrared photometric redshifts may be viable,
          and  perhaps  accurate to 10% <~ dz/(1+z), for up to 80% of the
          SMG   population  in  this  range,  if  the  above  temperature
          characterizes   the  full  range  of  SMGs.  However,  observed
          temperature  evolution  of  T_d  ~ (1+z) is also plausible, and
          could   result   from  selection  effects.  From  the  observed
          luminosity--temperature (L-T) relation, L ~ T_obs^(2.82+-0.29),
          we derive scaling relations for dust mass vs. dust temperature,
          and   identify   expressions   to   inter-relate  the  observed
          quantities.   These  suggest  that  measurements  at  a  single
          wavelength,   in   the  far-infrared,  submillimeter  or  radio
          wavebands,  might  constrain dust temperatures and far-infrared
          luminosities for most SMGs with redshifts at z ~ 0.5-4.

          resolution figures see this http URL
          We  investigate  outflows  driven  by a giant protoplanet using
          three-dimensional  MHD  nested  grid simulations. We consider a
          local region around the protoplanet in the protoplanetary disk,
          and  calculate  three  models: (a) unmagnetized disk model, (b)
          magnetized   disk   model  having  magnetic  field  azimuthally
          parallel  to  the disk, and (c) magnetic field perpendicular to
          the  disk.  Outflows  with  velocities,  at  least, 10 km/s are
          driven  by  the  protoplanets  in  both magnetized disk models,
          while  outflow  does  not  appear  in  unmagnetized disk model.
          Tube-like   outflows  along  the  azimuthal  direction  of  the
          protoplanetary  disk  appear in model with magnetic field being
          parallel to the disk. In this model, the magnetically dominated
          regions  (i.e.,  density gap) are clearly contrasted from other
          regions  and  spiral  waves appear near the protoplanet. On the
          other hand, in model with magnetic field being perpendicular to
          the  disk,  outflows are driven by a protoplanet with cone-like
          structure  just  as  seen in the outflow driven by a protostar.
          Magnetic  field lines are strongly twisted near the protoplanet
          and  the  outflows  have  well-collimated  structures  in  this
          model.These   outflows   can   be   landmarks   for   searching
          exo-protoplanets   in   their  formation  stages.  Our  results
          indicate  that  the accretion rate onto the protoplanet tend to
          have   a   larger   value  than  that  expected  from  previous
          hydrodynamical  calculations,  since  a fraction of the angular
          momentum  of  circum-planetary  disk  is  removed  by outflows,
          enhanced  non-axisymmetric  patterns  caused by magnetic field,
          and magnetic braking. Possible implications for observation are
          also briefly discussed.

          several  objects  are  consistent  with  those  of star-forming
          galaxies.

          Title:  Optical spectroscopy of (candidate) ultra-compact X-ray
          binaries: constraints on the composition of the donor stars
          Authors: G. Nelemans, P.G. Jonker, D. Steeghs
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We   present   optical   spectroscopy  of  several  (candidate)
          ultra-compact  X-ray binaries (UCXBs) obtained with the ESO VLT
          and  Gemini-North telescopes. In only one of five observed UCXB
          candidates  did  we  find  evidence  for  H in its spectrum (4U
          1556-60).  For  XB  1905+00  the  optical  counterpart  is  not
          detected. For the known UCXBs 4U 1626-67 and XB 1916-05 we find
          spectra  consistent  with  a  C/O  and  a  He/N  accretion disc
          respectively,  the  latter  is  the first optical spectrum of a
          He-rich donor in an UCXB. Interestingly, the C/O spectrum of 4U
          1626-67  shows  both similarities as well as marked differences
          from  the optical C/O spectrum of 4U 0614+09. We obtained phase
          resolved  spectroscopy  of  4U 0614+09 and the 44 min transient
          XTE  J0929-314.  In neither object were we able to detect clear
          orbital  periodicities, highlighting the difficulties of period
          determinations  in  UCXBs.  We  reanalysed  the  spectra of XTE
          J0929-314  that  were taken close to the peak of its 2003 X-ray
          outburst and do not confirm the detection of Halpha emission as
          was  claimed in the literature. The peak spectra do show strong
          C  or  N  emission  around  4640A, as has also been detected in
          other  UCXBs.  We  discuss the implications of our findings for
          our  understanding  of  the formation of UCXBs and the Galactic
          population  of  UCXBs.  At  the  moment all studied systems are
          consistent  with  having white dwarf donors, the majority being
          C/O rich.

          Title: A detailed modelling of the chemically rich clumps along

          Comments: 11 pages, 9 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          In order to investigate the origin and the structure of the low
          velocity,  chemically  rich  clumps observed along the lobes of
          low-  and  intermediate-mass  outflows, we construct a detailed
          model  of  the  S1  clump  along  the  CB3  outflow.  We  use a
          time-dependent chemical model coupled with a radiative transfer
          model  to  reproduce  the  observed  line  profile for a direct
          comparison  with  previous  observations of this clump. We find
          that   the   simultaneous   fitting  of  multiple  species  and
          transitions  is  a  powerful  tool in constraining the physical
          parameters  of  the  gas.  Different  scenarios  for  the clump
          formation  have  been  investigated.  The  models  that  better
          reproduce  all  the observed lines are those where the clump is
          formed,  at  least partially, before the advent of the outflow;
          with  the  advent  of  the  outflow the clump undergoes a short
          period  of non-dissociative shock and the consequent release of
          the  icy  mantle  together  with the high temperature chemistry
          leads  to  the  observed  chemical enrichment. Our results also
          suggest  the  presence of substructure within the clump: a more
          extended  component  traced  by  CS,  SO  and  the lower energy
          transitions (3_k-2_k and 2_k-1_k) of CH_3OH, and a more compact
          component   traced   by  H_2CO,  SO_2  and  the  higher  energy
          transitions (5_k-4_k) of CH_3OH.

          We  present  Spitzer observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy
          NGC  1705  obtained  as part of SINGS. The galaxy morphology is
          very   different   shortward   and   longward  of  ~5  microns:
          short-wavelength   imaging  shows  an  underlying  red  stellar
          population,   with   the   central  super  star  cluster  (SSC)
          dominating  the luminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm
          dust  emission  arising  from two off-nuclear regions offset by
          ~250  pc  from the SSC. These regions show little extinction at
          optical  wavelengths.  The  galaxy  has a relatively low global
          dust  mass  (~2E5  solar  masses, implying a global dust-to-gas
          mass  ratio  ~2--4 times lower than the Milky Way average). The
          off-nuclear dust emission appears to be powered by photons from
          the  same  stellar population responsible for the excitation of
          the  observed  H Alpha emission; these photons are unassociated
          with  the  SSC  (though a contribution from embedded sources to
          the  IR  luminosity  of the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled
          out).  Low-resolution  IRS spectroscopy shows moderate-strength
          PAH  emission  in  the 11.3 micron band in the eastern peak; no
          PAH  emission  is  detected  in  the  SSC  or  the western dust
          emission   complex.  There  is  significant  diffuse  8  micron
          emission after scaling and subtracting shorter wavelength data;
          the  spatially  variable PAH emission strengths revealed by the
          IRS  data  suggest  caution  in the interpretation of diffuse 8
          micron  emission  as  arising  from  PAH  carriers  alone.  The
          metallicity  of  NGC  1705 falls at the transition level of 35%
          solar  found  by Engelbracht and collaborators; the fact that a
          system   at  this  metallicity  shows  spatially  variable  PAH
          emission  demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8
          micron  emission.  A  radio  continuum  non-detection, NGC 1705
          deviates  significantly  from  the  canonical  far-IR vs. radio
          correlation. (Abridged)

          PSR B1931+24 (J1933+2421) behaves as an ordinary isolated radio
          pulsar  during  active phases that are 5-10 days long. However,
          the  radio  emission  switches  off in less than 10 seconds and
          remains  undetectable for the next 25-35 days, then it switches
          on  again.  This pattern repeats quasi-periodically. The origin
          of  this behaviour is unclear. Even more remarkably, the pulsar
          rotation  slows  down  50% faster when it is on than when it is
          off.  This  indicates  a  massive  increase  in  magnetospheric
          currents  when the pulsar switches on, proving that pulsar wind
          plays  a  substantial role in pulsar spin-down. This allows us,
          for  the  first  time,  to  estimate  the  currents in a pulsar
          magnetospheric during the occurrence of radio emission.

          Title:   Star  formation  through  gravitational  collapse  and
          competitive accretion
          Authors: Ian A. Bonnell (St Andrews), Matthew R. Bate (Exeter)
          Comments: 7 pages, 1 figure, MNRAS, in press
          Competitive  accretion,  a process to explain the origin of the
          IMF,  occurs  when  stars  in  a common gravitational potential
          accrete  from  a  distributed  gaseous  component. We show that
          concerns  recently  raised  on  the  efficiency  of competitive
          accretion   are   incorrect   as  they  use  globally  averaged
          properties  which are inappropriate for the detailed physics of
          a   forming  stellar  cluster.  A  full  treatment  requires  a
          realistic  treatment of the cluster potential, the distribution
          of  turbulent  velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does
          not  travel  at the global virial velocity of the system due to
          the  velocity-sizescale  relation inherent in turbulent gas and
          due  to  the  lower  velocity dispersion of small-N clusters in
          which  much  of  the  accretion  occurs.  Stars  located in the
          gas-rich  centres  of  such  systems initially accrete from low
          relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to
          accrete  the  higher  velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of
          such  potentials,  or  that  enter  the  cluster later when the
          velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete significantly and
          thus  retain  their  low-masses. In competitive accretion, most
          stars  do not continue to accrete significantly such that their
          masses  are  set  from the fragmentation process. It is the few
          stars  which continue to accrete that become higher-mass stars.
          Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be responsible for
          the  formation  of  higher-mass  stars and can explain the mass
          distribution,  mass  segregation  and binary frequency of these
          stars.   Global  kinematics  of  competitive  accretion  models
          include large-scale mass infall, with mean inflow velocities of
          order  0.5  km/s at scales of 0.5 pc, but infall signatures are
          likely  to  be  confused by the large tangential velocities and
          the velocity dispersion present.

          was parameterized as a power law in the available main-sequence
          mass  range  of  each cluster, typically 0.9 <~ m/M_sun <~ 2.5;
          its  slope  was determined at different positions spanning from
          the  very  centre  out  to  several core radii. The CMDs in the
          central regions of the clusters were carefully studied earlier,
          resulting  in  accurate age, metallicity, distance modulus, and
          reddening  values. The slope alpha (where Salpeter is 2.35) was
          determined  in  annuli  by following two distinct methods: 1) a
          power law fit to the PDMF obtained from the systemic luminosity
          function (LF); 2) a statistical comparison between observed and
          model  CMDs.  In  all clusters, significant mass segregation is
          found  from  the positional dependence of the PDMF slope: alpha
          <~  1.8  for  R <= 1.0 R_core and alpha ~ Salpeter inside R=2~3
          R_core  (except  for Hodge 14, where alpha ~ Salpeter for R ~ 4
          R_core).  The  results  are  robust in the sense that they hold
          true  for  both  methods  used.  The  CMD  method  reveals that
          unresolved binaries flatten the PDMF obtained form the systemic
          LF,  but  this  effect is smaller than the uncertainties in the
          alpha  determination.  For  each cluster we estimated dynamical
          ages  inside  the core and for the entire system. In both cases
          we  found a trend in the sense that older clusters have flatter
          PDMF,  consistent with a dynamical mass segregation and stellar
          evaporation.

          Title: Strategies for observing extreme mass ratio inspirals
          Authors: Steve Drasco
          Comments: 16 pages, submitted to the proceedings of 10th Annual
          Gravitational Wave Data Analysis Workshop (GWDAW 10)
          I  review  the  status  of  research, conducted by a variety of
          independent  groups,  aimed  at  the  eventual  observation  of
          Extreme  Mass  Ratio  Inspirals (EMRIs) with gravitational wave
          detectors. EMRIs are binary systems in which one of the objects
          is  much  more massive than the other, and which are in a state
          of  dynamical  evolution  that  is  dominated by the effects of
          gravitational  radiation.  Although  these  systems  are highly
          relativistic,  with  the  smaller object moving relative to the
          larger  at  nearly  light-speed,  they  are  well  described by
          perturbative  calculations  which  exploit  the mass ratio as a
          natural   small   parameter.   I   review   the   use  of  such
          approximations  to  generate  waveforms needed by data analysis
          algorithms for observation. I also briefly review the status of
          developing the data analysis algorithms themselves.

          We  present  the  first  results from a 500 ksec Chandra ACIS-I
          observation of M87. At soft energies (0.5-1.0 keV), we detect a
          complex  filamentary  structure associated with the eastern and
          southwestern  arms.  Many  filaments are spatially resolved and
          have   widths   of  ~300  pc.  This  filamentary  structure  is
          particularly  striking  in the eastern arm where we suggest the
          filaments are outer edges of a series of buoyant bubbles filled
          with  relativistic plasma, produced by the central supermassive
          black  hole, in a succession of small outbursts occurring every
          ~6  x  10^6  years.  The  X-ray structures may be influenced by
          magnetic  filamentation.  At  hard  energies  (3.5-7.5 keV), we
          detect  a  nearly circular shell of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc).
          This  ring  of  hard  X-ray  emission  provides  an unambiguous
          signature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the SMBH,
          traversing  the M87 atmosphere. The observed spectral hardening
          corresponds  to  a  temperature rise from 2.0 to 2.4 keV, which
          translates  to  a  Mach  number  M~1.2  for monoatomic gas with
          gamma=5/3.  In  addition,  we  detect  two  additional  surface
          brightness  edges  (at  radii  of  ~0.6'  and ~1.2'). The ~0.6'
          feature  may be the gas just outside the ``piston'' driving the
          2.8'  shock,  while the ~1.2' feature is probably produced by a
          secondary outburst.

          Title: AGN Jet Mass Loading and Truncation by Stellar Winds
          Authors: Alexander Hubbard, Eric G. Blackman
          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures
          Active  Galactic  Nuclei  can  produce extremely powerful jets.
          While  tightly  collimated,  the  scale  of  these jets and the
          stellar  density at galactic centers implies that there will be
          many jet/star interactions, which can mass-load the jet through
          stellar  winds. Previous work employed modest wind mass outflow
          rates, but this does not apply when mass loading is provided by
          a  small  number  of  high  mass-loss  stars.  We  construct  a
          framework  for  jet mass-loading by stellar winds for a broader
          spectrum  of  wind  mass-loss  rates  than  has been previously
          considered.  Given  the  observed stellar mass distributions in
          galactic  centers,  we  find  that  even  highly efficient (0.1
          Eddington  luminosity)  jets  from  supermassive black holes of
          masses  $M_{BH}  \la 10^4M_{\odot}$ are rapidly mass loaded and
          quenched  by  stellar  winds.  For  $10^4 M_{\odot}<M_{BH}<10^8
          M_{\odot}$,  the  quenching  length of highly efficient jets is
          independent  of  the  jet's mechanical luminosity. Stellar wind
          mass-loading  is  unable  to  quench  efficient  jets from more
          massive engines, but can account for the observed truncation of
          the  inefficient  M87  jet,  and  implies  a  baryon  dominated
          composition  on  scales  $\ga 2$ kpc therein even if the jet is
          initially pair plasma dominated.

          Title: Dark matter halo response to the disk growth
          Authors: Jun-Hwan Choi, Yu Lu, H. J. Mo, Martin D. Weinberg
          Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  consider  the  sensitivity  of the circular-orbit adiabatic
          contraction  approximation  \citep{bw84,  blumenthal86}  to the
          timing of baryon condensation and the orbital structure of dark
          matter    halos    in    the   $\Lambda$CDM   paradigm.   Using
          one-dimensional  hydrodynamic  simulations  including  the dark
          matter   halo  mass  accretion  history  and  gas  cooling,  we
          demonstrate  that  the adiabatic approximation is approximately
          valid  even though halos and disks may assemble simultaneously.
          We further demonstrate the validity of the simple approximation
          for  $\Lambda$CDM halos \citep[e.g.][hereafter NFW]{NFW97} with
          isotropic velocity distributions using three-dimensional N-body
          simulations.  This  result  is  easily understood: an isotropic
          velocity  distribution  in  a cuspy halo requires more circular
          orbits   than  radial  orbits.  Conversely,  the  approximation
          considerably  differs  in  the  extreme  case of a radial orbit
          halo.  The approximation overestimates the response a core dark
          matter  halo, where radial orbit fraction is larger. Because no
          astronomically  relevant  models  are  dominated by low-angular
          momentum orbits in the vicinity of the disk and the growth time
          scale  is never shorter than a dynamical time, we conclude that
          the adiabatic contraction approximation is generally acceptable
          in the CDM cosmology.

          Comments:  17  pages,  8  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We   present  an  analysis  of  the  X-ray  properties  of  the
          Magellanic-type   galaxy   NGC   55  based  on  two  contiguous
          XMM-Newton observations. We detect a total of 137 X-ray sources
          in  the  field  of  view,  42  of  which are located within the
          optical  confines  of  the galaxy. On the basis of X-ray colour
          classification  and after correcting for background objects, we
          conclude that our source sample includes ~ 20 X-ray binaries, 5
          supernova  remnants  and  7 very soft sources (including 2 good
          candidate  supersoft  sources) associated with NGC 55. Detailed
          spectral  and  timing  analysis  was  carried  out  on 4 of the
          brightest  X-ray  sources.  One  of these objects is identified
          with  a  Galactic  foreground star and is a possible new RS CVn
          system.  The  other  three  are consistent with accreting X-ray
          binaries,  though further evidence of short term variability is
          required   to  confirm  this.  We  also  find  evidence  of  an
          underlying  component,  which is concentrated on the bar region
          but  has  an  extent of at least 6' (3 kpc) in the plane of the
          galaxy  and  +/-  1'  (+/-  500  pc)  perpendicular to it. This
          emission  is  best  fitted  by  a thermal plasma plus power-law
          model  but  with  high intrinsic absorption consistent with its
          location  in  the  central disc of the galaxy. We interpret the
          soft component as diffuse thermal emission linked to regions of
          current star formation, whilst the hard power-law component may
          originate  in  unresolved  X-ray  binary sources. The intrinsic
          luminosity  of this residual disc emission may exceed Lx ~ 6e38
          ergs/s  (0.3-6 keV). A comparison with other Magellanic systems
          confirms  that,  in  terms  of  both  its discrete X-ray source
          population   and  its  extended  emission,  NGC  55  has  X-ray
          properties which are typical of its class.

          Selected Galaxies

          R. J. Ivison, I. Smail, T. G. Phillips
          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  present  350um  observations  of  15  Chapman et al. (2005)
          submillimeter  galaxies  (SMGs)  with  radio  counterparts  and
          optical  redshifts.  We  detect  12  and obtain sensitive upper
          limits  for  3, providing direct, precise measurements of their
          far-infrared luminosities and characteristic dust temperatures.
          With   these,   we   verify   the   linear  radio--far-infrared
          correlation  at  redshifts  of  z  ~  1-3  and  luminosities of
          10^11-10^13  L_sun,  with  a power-law index of 1.02+-0.12, and
          rms  scatter  of  0.12 dex. However, either the the correlation
          constant  'q'  or  the  dust  emissivity  'beta'  is lower than
          measured  locally. The best fitting q ~ 2.14 is consistent with
          SMGs being predominantly starbust galaxies, without significant
          AGN contribution, at far-infrared wavelengths. Gas-to-dust mass
          ratios  are  estimated  at 54+-13 kappa(850um)/0.15 m^2 kg^-1],
          depending  on  the absoption efficiency 'kappa', with intrinsic
          dispersion  ~  40%  around  the  mean  value. Dust temperatures
          consistent  with  34.6+-3K  [beta/1.5]^-0.71,  at  z ~ 1.5-3.5,
          suggest  that far-infrared photometric redshifts may be viable,
          and  perhaps  accurate to 10% <~ dz/(1+z), for up to 80% of the
          SMG   population  in  this  range,  if  the  above  temperature
          characterizes   the  full  range  of  SMGs.  However,  observed
          temperature  evolution  of  T_d  ~ (1+z) is also plausible, and
          could   result   from  selection  effects.  From  the  observed
          luminosity--temperature (L-T) relation, L ~ T_obs^(2.82+-0.29),
          we derive scaling relations for dust mass vs. dust temperature,
          and   identify   expressions   to   inter-relate  the  observed
          quantities.   These  suggest  that  measurements  at  a  single
          wavelength,   in   the  far-infrared,  submillimeter  or  radio
          wavebands,  might  constrain dust temperatures and far-infrared
          luminosities for most SMGs with redshifts at z ~ 0.5-4.

          Comments:  12  pages,  3  figures,  Submitted to ApJL, For high
          resolution figures see this http URL
          We  investigate  outflows  driven  by a giant protoplanet using
          three-dimensional  MHD  nested  grid simulations. We consider a
          local region around the protoplanet in the protoplanetary disk,
          and  calculate  three  models: (a) unmagnetized disk model, (b)
          magnetized   disk   model  having  magnetic  field  azimuthally
          parallel  to  the disk, and (c) magnetic field perpendicular to
          the  disk.  Outflows  with  velocities,  at  least, 10 km/s are
          driven  by  the  protoplanets  in  both magnetized disk models,
          while  outflow  does  not  appear  in  unmagnetized disk model.
          Tube-like   outflows  along  the  azimuthal  direction  of  the
          protoplanetary  disk  appear in model with magnetic field being
          parallel to the disk. In this model, the magnetically dominated
          regions  (i.e.,  density gap) are clearly contrasted from other
          regions  and  spiral  waves appear near the protoplanet. On the
          other hand, in model with magnetic field being perpendicular to
          the  disk,  outflows are driven by a protoplanet with cone-like
          structure  just  as  seen in the outflow driven by a protostar.
          Magnetic  field lines are strongly twisted near the protoplanet
          and  the  outflows  have  well-collimated  structures  in  this
          model.These   outflows   can   be   landmarks   for   searching
          exo-protoplanets   in   their  formation  stages.  Our  results
          indicate  that  the accretion rate onto the protoplanet tend to
          have   a   larger   value  than  that  expected  from  previous
          hydrodynamical  calculations,  since  a fraction of the angular
          momentum  of  circum-planetary  disk  is  removed  by outflows,
          enhanced  non-axisymmetric  patterns  caused by magnetic field,
          and magnetic braking. Possible implications for observation are
          also briefly discussed.

          binaries: constraints on the composition of the donor stars
          Authors: G. Nelemans, P.G. Jonker, D. Steeghs
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We   present   optical   spectroscopy  of  several  (candidate)
          ultra-compact  X-ray binaries (UCXBs) obtained with the ESO VLT
          and  Gemini-North telescopes. In only one of five observed UCXB
          candidates  did  we  find  evidence  for  H in its spectrum (4U
          1556-60).  For  XB  1905+00  the  optical  counterpart  is  not
          detected. For the known UCXBs 4U 1626-67 and XB 1916-05 we find
          spectra  consistent  with  a  C/O  and  a  He/N  accretion disc
          respectively,  the  latter  is  the first optical spectrum of a
          He-rich donor in an UCXB. Interestingly, the C/O spectrum of 4U
          1626-67  shows  both similarities as well as marked differences
          from  the optical C/O spectrum of 4U 0614+09. We obtained phase
          resolved  spectroscopy  of  4U 0614+09 and the 44 min transient
          XTE  J0929-314.  In neither object were we able to detect clear
          orbital  periodicities, highlighting the difficulties of period
          determinations  in  UCXBs.  We  reanalysed  the  spectra of XTE
          J0929-314  that  were taken close to the peak of its 2003 X-ray
          outburst and do not confirm the detection of Halpha emission as
          was  claimed in the literature. The peak spectra do show strong
          C  or  N  emission  around  4640A, as has also been detected in
          other  UCXBs.  We  discuss the implications of our findings for
          our  understanding  of  the formation of UCXBs and the Galactic
          population  of  UCXBs.  At  the  moment all studied systems are
          consistent  with  having white dwarf donors, the majority being
          C/O rich.

          Comments: 11 pages, 9 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          In order to investigate the origin and the structure of the low
          velocity,  chemically  rich  clumps observed along the lobes of
          low-  and  intermediate-mass  outflows, we construct a detailed
          model  of  the  S1  clump  along  the  CB3  outflow.  We  use a
          time-dependent chemical model coupled with a radiative transfer
          model  to  reproduce  the  observed  line  profile for a direct
          comparison  with  previous  observations of this clump. We find
          that   the   simultaneous   fitting  of  multiple  species  and
          transitions  is  a  powerful  tool in constraining the physical
          parameters  of  the  gas.  Different  scenarios  for  the clump
          formation  have  been  investigated.  The  models  that  better
          reproduce  all  the observed lines are those where the clump is
          formed,  at  least partially, before the advent of the outflow;
          with  the  advent  of  the  outflow the clump undergoes a short
          period  of non-dissociative shock and the consequent release of
          the  icy  mantle  together  with the high temperature chemistry
          leads  to  the  observed  chemical enrichment. Our results also

          extended  component  traced  by  CS,  SO  and  the lower energy
          transitions (3_k-2_k and 2_k-1_k) of CH_3OH, and a more compact
          component   traced   by  H_2CO,  SO_2  and  the  higher  energy
          transitions (5_k-4_k) of CH_3OH.

          We  present  Spitzer observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy
          NGC  1705  obtained  as part of SINGS. The galaxy morphology is
          very   different   shortward   and   longward  of  ~5  microns:
          short-wavelength   imaging  shows  an  underlying  red  stellar
          population,   with   the   central  super  star  cluster  (SSC)
          dominating  the luminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm
          dust  emission  arising  from two off-nuclear regions offset by
          ~250  pc  from the SSC. These regions show little extinction at
          optical  wavelengths.  The  galaxy  has a relatively low global
          dust  mass  (~2E5  solar  masses, implying a global dust-to-gas
          mass  ratio  ~2--4 times lower than the Milky Way average). The
          off-nuclear dust emission appears to be powered by photons from
          the  same  stellar population responsible for the excitation of
          the  observed  H Alpha emission; these photons are unassociated
          with  the  SSC  (though a contribution from embedded sources to
          the  IR  luminosity  of the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled
          out).  Low-resolution  IRS spectroscopy shows moderate-strength
          PAH  emission  in  the 11.3 micron band in the eastern peak; no
          PAH  emission  is  detected  in  the  SSC  or  the western dust
          emission   complex.  There  is  significant  diffuse  8  micron
          emission after scaling and subtracting shorter wavelength data;
          the  spatially  variable PAH emission strengths revealed by the
          IRS  data  suggest  caution  in the interpretation of diffuse 8
          micron  emission  as  arising  from  PAH  carriers  alone.  The
          metallicity  of  NGC  1705 falls at the transition level of 35%
          solar  found  by Engelbracht and collaborators; the fact that a
          system   at  this  metallicity  shows  spatially  variable  PAH
          emission  demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8
          micron  emission.  A  radio  continuum  non-detection, NGC 1705
          deviates  significantly  from  the  canonical  far-IR vs. radio
          correlation. (Abridged)

          PSR B1931+24 (J1933+2421) behaves as an ordinary isolated radio
          pulsar  during  active phases that are 5-10 days long. However,
          the  radio  emission  switches  off in less than 10 seconds and
          remains  undetectable for the next 25-35 days, then it switches
          on  again.  This pattern repeats quasi-periodically. The origin
          of  this behaviour is unclear. Even more remarkably, the pulsar
          rotation  slows  down  50% faster when it is on than when it is
          off.  This  indicates  a  massive  increase  in  magnetospheric
          currents  when the pulsar switches on, proving that pulsar wind
          plays  a  substantial role in pulsar spin-down. This allows us,
          for  the  first  time,  to  estimate  the  currents in a pulsar
          magnetospheric during the occurrence of radio emission.

          Title:   Star  formation  through  gravitational  collapse  and
          competitive accretion
          Authors: Ian A. Bonnell (St Andrews), Matthew R. Bate (Exeter)
          Comments: 7 pages, 1 figure, MNRAS, in press
          Competitive  accretion,  a process to explain the origin of the
          IMF,  occurs  when  stars  in  a common gravitational potential
          accrete  from  a  distributed  gaseous  component. We show that
          concerns  recently  raised  on  the  efficiency  of competitive
          accretion   are   incorrect   as  they  use  globally  averaged
          properties  which are inappropriate for the detailed physics of
          a   forming  stellar  cluster.  A  full  treatment  requires  a
          realistic  treatment of the cluster potential, the distribution
          of  turbulent  velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does
          not  travel  at the global virial velocity of the system due to
          the  velocity-sizescale  relation inherent in turbulent gas and
          due  to  the  lower  velocity dispersion of small-N clusters in
          which  much  of  the  accretion  occurs.  Stars  located in the
          gas-rich  centres  of  such  systems initially accrete from low
          relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to
          accrete  the  higher  velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of
          such  potentials,  or  that  enter  the  cluster later when the
          velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete significantly and
          thus  retain  their  low-masses. In competitive accretion, most
          stars  do not continue to accrete significantly such that their
          masses  are  set  from the fragmentation process. It is the few
          stars  which continue to accrete that become higher-mass stars.
          Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be responsible for
          the  formation  of  higher-mass  stars and can explain the mass
          distribution,  mass  segregation  and binary frequency of these
          stars.   Global  kinematics  of  competitive  accretion  models
          include large-scale mass infall, with mean inflow velocities of
          order  0.5  km/s at scales of 0.5 pc, but infall signatures are
          likely  to  be  confused by the large tangential velocities and
          the velocity dispersion present.

          Title:  Mass segregation in rich LMC clusters from modelling of
          deep HST colour-magnitude diagrams

          Comments:   11   pages,  11  Postscript  figures,  Astronomy  &
          Astrophysics, accepted 10 January 2006
          We  used the deep colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of five rich
          LMC  clusters (NGC1805, 1818, 1831, 1868, and Hodge14) observed
          with HST/WFPC2 to derive their present day mass function (PDMF)
          and  its  variation  with position within the cluster. The PDMF
          was parameterized as a power law in the available main-sequence
          mass  range  of  each cluster, typically 0.9 <~ m/M_sun <~ 2.5;
          its  slope  was determined at different positions spanning from
          the  very  centre  out  to  several core radii. The CMDs in the
          central regions of the clusters were carefully studied earlier,
          resulting  in  accurate age, metallicity, distance modulus, and
          reddening  values. The slope alpha (where Salpeter is 2.35) was
          determined  in  annuli  by following two distinct methods: 1) a
          power law fit to the PDMF obtained from the systemic luminosity
          function (LF); 2) a statistical comparison between observed and
          model  CMDs.  In  all clusters, significant mass segregation is
          found  from  the positional dependence of the PDMF slope: alpha
          <~  1.8  for  R <= 1.0 R_core and alpha ~ Salpeter inside R=2~3
          R_core  (except  for Hodge 14, where alpha ~ Salpeter for R ~ 4
          R_core).  The  results  are  robust in the sense that they hold
          true  for  both  methods  used.  The  CMD  method  reveals that
          unresolved binaries flatten the PDMF obtained form the systemic
          LF,  but  this  effect is smaller than the uncertainties in the
          alpha  determination.  For  each cluster we estimated dynamical
          ages  inside  the core and for the entire system. In both cases
          we  found a trend in the sense that older clusters have flatter
          PDMF,  consistent with a dynamical mass segregation and stellar
          evaporation.

          Title: Strategies for observing extreme mass ratio inspirals
          Authors: Steve Drasco
          Comments: 16 pages, submitted to the proceedings of 10th Annual
          Gravitational Wave Data Analysis Workshop (GWDAW 10)
          I  review  the  status  of  research, conducted by a variety of
          independent  groups,  aimed  at  the  eventual  observation  of
          Extreme  Mass  Ratio  Inspirals (EMRIs) with gravitational wave
          detectors. EMRIs are binary systems in which one of the objects
          is  much  more massive than the other, and which are in a state
          of  dynamical  evolution  that  is  dominated by the effects of
          gravitational  radiation.  Although  these  systems  are highly
          relativistic,  with  the  smaller object moving relative to the
          larger  at  nearly  light-speed,  they  are  well  described by
          perturbative  calculations  which  exploit  the mass ratio as a
          natural   small   parameter.   I   review   the   use  of  such
          approximations  to  generate  waveforms needed by data analysis
          algorithms for observation. I also briefly review the status of
          developing the data analysis algorithms themselves.

          We  present  the  first  results from a 500 ksec Chandra ACIS-I
          observation of M87. At soft energies (0.5-1.0 keV), we detect a
          complex  filamentary  structure associated with the eastern and
          southwestern  arms.  Many  filaments are spatially resolved and
          have   widths   of  ~300  pc.  This  filamentary  structure  is
          particularly  striking  in the eastern arm where we suggest the
          filaments are outer edges of a series of buoyant bubbles filled
          with  relativistic plasma, produced by the central supermassive
          black  hole, in a succession of small outbursts occurring every
          ~6  x  10^6  years.  The  X-ray structures may be influenced by
          magnetic  filamentation.  At  hard  energies  (3.5-7.5 keV), we
          detect  a  nearly circular shell of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc).
          This  ring  of  hard  X-ray  emission  provides  an unambiguous
          signature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the SMBH,
          traversing  the M87 atmosphere. The observed spectral hardening
          corresponds  to  a  temperature rise from 2.0 to 2.4 keV, which
          translates  to  a  Mach  number  M~1.2  for monoatomic gas with
          gamma=5/3.  In  addition,  we  detect  two  additional  surface
          brightness  edges  (at  radii  of  ~0.6'  and ~1.2'). The ~0.6'
          feature  may be the gas just outside the ``piston'' driving the
          2.8'  shock,  while the ~1.2' feature is probably produced by a
          secondary outburst.

          Title: AGN Jet Mass Loading and Truncation by Stellar Winds
          Authors: Alexander Hubbard, Eric G. Blackman
          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures
          Active  Galactic  Nuclei  can  produce extremely powerful jets.
          While  tightly  collimated,  the  scale  of  these jets and the
          stellar  density at galactic centers implies that there will be
          many jet/star interactions, which can mass-load the jet through
          stellar  winds. Previous work employed modest wind mass outflow
          rates, but this does not apply when mass loading is provided by
          a  small  number  of  high  mass-loss  stars.  We  construct  a
          framework  for  jet mass-loading by stellar winds for a broader
          spectrum  of  wind  mass-loss  rates  than  has been previously
          considered.  Given  the  observed stellar mass distributions in
          galactic  centers,  we  find  that  even  highly efficient (0.1
          Eddington  luminosity)  jets  from  supermassive black holes of
          masses  $M_{BH}  \la 10^4M_{\odot}$ are rapidly mass loaded and
          quenched  by  stellar  winds.  For  $10^4 M_{\odot}<M_{BH}<10^8
          M_{\odot}$,  the  quenching  length of highly efficient jets is
          independent  of  the  jet's mechanical luminosity. Stellar wind
          mass-loading  is  unable  to  quench  efficient  jets from more
          massive engines, but can account for the observed truncation of
          the  inefficient  M87  jet,  and  implies  a  baryon  dominated
          composition  on  scales  $\ga 2$ kpc therein even if the jet is
          initially pair plasma dominated.

          Title: Dark matter halo response to the disk growth
          Authors: Jun-Hwan Choi, Yu Lu, H. J. Mo, Martin D. Weinberg
          Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  consider  the  sensitivity  of the circular-orbit adiabatic
          contraction  approximation  \citep{bw84,  blumenthal86}  to the
          timing of baryon condensation and the orbital structure of dark
          matter    halos    in    the   $\Lambda$CDM   paradigm.   Using
          one-dimensional  hydrodynamic  simulations  including  the dark
          matter   halo  mass  accretion  history  and  gas  cooling,  we
          demonstrate  that  the adiabatic approximation is approximately
          valid  even though halos and disks may assemble simultaneously.
          We further demonstrate the validity of the simple approximation
          for  $\Lambda$CDM halos \citep[e.g.][hereafter NFW]{NFW97} with
          isotropic velocity distributions using three-dimensional N-body
          simulations.  This  result  is  easily understood: an isotropic
          velocity  distribution  in  a cuspy halo requires more circular
          orbits   than  radial  orbits.  Conversely,  the  approximation
          considerably  differs  in  the  extreme  case of a radial orbit
          halo.  The approximation overestimates the response a core dark
          matter  halo, where radial orbit fraction is larger. Because no
          astronomically  relevant  models  are  dominated by low-angular
          momentum orbits in the vicinity of the disk and the growth time
          scale  is never shorter than a dynamical time, we conclude that
          the adiabatic contraction approximation is generally acceptable
          in the CDM cosmology.

          MNRAS
          We   present  an  analysis  of  the  X-ray  properties  of  the
          Magellanic-type   galaxy   NGC   55  based  on  two  contiguous
          XMM-Newton observations. We detect a total of 137 X-ray sources
          in  the  field  of  view,  42  of  which are located within the
          optical  confines  of  the galaxy. On the basis of X-ray colour
          classification  and after correcting for background objects, we
          conclude that our source sample includes ~ 20 X-ray binaries, 5
          supernova  remnants  and  7 very soft sources (including 2 good
          candidate  supersoft  sources) associated with NGC 55. Detailed
          spectral  and  timing  analysis  was  carried  out  on 4 of the
          brightest  X-ray  sources.  One  of these objects is identified
          with  a  Galactic  foreground star and is a possible new RS CVn
          system.  The  other  three  are consistent with accreting X-ray
          binaries,  though further evidence of short term variability is
          required   to  confirm  this.  We  also  find  evidence  of  an
          underlying  component,  which is concentrated on the bar region
          but  has  an  extent of at least 6' (3 kpc) in the plane of the
          galaxy  and  +/-  1'  (+/-  500  pc)  perpendicular to it. This
          emission  is  best  fitted  by  a thermal plasma plus power-law
          model  but  with  high intrinsic absorption consistent with its
          location  in  the  central disc of the galaxy. We interpret the
          soft component as diffuse thermal emission linked to regions of
          current star formation, whilst the hard power-law component may
          originate  in  unresolved  X-ray  binary sources. The intrinsic
          luminosity  of this residual disc emission may exceed Lx ~ 6e38
          ergs/s  (0.3-6 keV). A comparison with other Magellanic systems
          confirms  that,  in  terms  of  both  its discrete X-ray source
          population   and  its  extended  emission,  NGC  55  has  X-ray
          properties which are typical of its class.

          Selected Galaxies

          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  present  350um  observations  of  15  Chapman et al. (2005)
          submillimeter  galaxies  (SMGs)  with  radio  counterparts  and
          optical  redshifts.  We  detect  12  and obtain sensitive upper
          limits  for  3, providing direct, precise measurements of their
          far-infrared luminosities and characteristic dust temperatures.
          With   these,   we   verify   the   linear  radio--far-infrared
          correlation  at  redshifts  of  z  ~  1-3  and  luminosities of
          10^11-10^13  L_sun,  with  a power-law index of 1.02+-0.12, and
          rms  scatter  of  0.12 dex. However, either the the correlation
          constant  'q'  or  the  dust  emissivity  'beta'  is lower than
          measured  locally. The best fitting q ~ 2.14 is consistent with
          SMGs being predominantly starbust galaxies, without significant
          AGN contribution, at far-infrared wavelengths. Gas-to-dust mass
          ratios  are  estimated  at 54+-13 kappa(850um)/0.15 m^2 kg^-1],
          depending  on  the absoption efficiency 'kappa', with intrinsic
          dispersion  ~  40%  around  the  mean  value. Dust temperatures
          consistent  with  34.6+-3K  [beta/1.5]^-0.71,  at  z ~ 1.5-3.5,
          suggest  that far-infrared photometric redshifts may be viable,
          and  perhaps  accurate to 10% <~ dz/(1+z), for up to 80% of the
          SMG   population  in  this  range,  if  the  above  temperature
          characterizes   the  full  range  of  SMGs.  However,  observed
          temperature  evolution  of  T_d  ~ (1+z) is also plausible, and
          could   result   from  selection  effects.  From  the  observed
          luminosity--temperature (L-T) relation, L ~ T_obs^(2.82+-0.29),
          we derive scaling relations for dust mass vs. dust temperature,
          and   identify   expressions   to   inter-relate  the  observed
          quantities.   These  suggest  that  measurements  at  a  single
          wavelength,   in   the  far-infrared,  submillimeter  or  radio
          wavebands,  might  constrain dust temperatures and far-infrared
          luminosities for most SMGs with redshifts at z ~ 0.5-4.

          Title: Outflows driven by Giant Protoplanets

          resolution figures see this http URL
          We  investigate  outflows  driven  by a giant protoplanet using
          three-dimensional  MHD  nested  grid simulations. We consider a
          local region around the protoplanet in the protoplanetary disk,
          and  calculate  three  models: (a) unmagnetized disk model, (b)
          magnetized   disk   model  having  magnetic  field  azimuthally
          parallel  to  the disk, and (c) magnetic field perpendicular to
          the  disk.  Outflows  with  velocities,  at  least, 10 km/s are
          driven  by  the  protoplanets  in  both magnetized disk models,
          while  outflow  does  not  appear  in  unmagnetized disk model.
          Tube-like   outflows  along  the  azimuthal  direction  of  the
          protoplanetary  disk  appear in model with magnetic field being
          parallel to the disk. In this model, the magnetically dominated
          regions  (i.e.,  density gap) are clearly contrasted from other
          regions  and  spiral  waves appear near the protoplanet. On the
          other hand, in model with magnetic field being perpendicular to
          the  disk,  outflows are driven by a protoplanet with cone-like
          structure  just  as  seen in the outflow driven by a protostar.
          Magnetic  field lines are strongly twisted near the protoplanet
          and  the  outflows  have  well-collimated  structures  in  this
          model.These   outflows   can   be   landmarks   for   searching
          exo-protoplanets   in   their  formation  stages.  Our  results
          indicate  that  the accretion rate onto the protoplanet tend to
          have   a   larger   value  than  that  expected  from  previous
          hydrodynamical  calculations,  since  a fraction of the angular
          momentum  of  circum-planetary  disk  is  removed  by outflows,
          enhanced  non-axisymmetric  patterns  caused by magnetic field,
          and magnetic braking. Possible implications for observation are
          also briefly discussed.

          Title:  Optical spectroscopy of (candidate) ultra-compact X-ray
          binaries: constraints on the composition of the donor stars
          Authors: G. Nelemans, P.G. Jonker, D. Steeghs
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We   present   optical   spectroscopy  of  several  (candidate)
          ultra-compact  X-ray binaries (UCXBs) obtained with the ESO VLT
          and  Gemini-North telescopes. In only one of five observed UCXB
          candidates  did  we  find  evidence  for  H in its spectrum (4U
          1556-60).  For  XB  1905+00  the  optical  counterpart  is  not
          detected. For the known UCXBs 4U 1626-67 and XB 1916-05 we find
          spectra  consistent  with  a  C/O  and  a  He/N  accretion disc
          respectively,  the  latter  is  the first optical spectrum of a
          He-rich donor in an UCXB. Interestingly, the C/O spectrum of 4U
          1626-67  shows  both similarities as well as marked differences
          from  the optical C/O spectrum of 4U 0614+09. We obtained phase
          resolved  spectroscopy  of  4U 0614+09 and the 44 min transient
          XTE  J0929-314.  In neither object were we able to detect clear
          orbital  periodicities, highlighting the difficulties of period
          determinations  in  UCXBs.  We  reanalysed  the  spectra of XTE
          J0929-314  that  were taken close to the peak of its 2003 X-ray
          outburst and do not confirm the detection of Halpha emission as
          was  claimed in the literature. The peak spectra do show strong
          C  or  N  emission  around  4640A, as has also been detected in
          other  UCXBs.  We  discuss the implications of our findings for
          our  understanding  of  the formation of UCXBs and the Galactic
          population  of  UCXBs.  At  the  moment all studied systems are
          consistent  with  having white dwarf donors, the majority being
          C/O rich.

          Title: A detailed modelling of the chemically rich clumps along
          the CB3 outflow

          Comments: 11 pages, 9 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          In order to investigate the origin and the structure of the low
          velocity,  chemically  rich  clumps observed along the lobes of
          low-  and  intermediate-mass  outflows, we construct a detailed
          model  of  the  S1  clump  along  the  CB3  outflow.  We  use a
          time-dependent chemical model coupled with a radiative transfer
          model  to  reproduce  the  observed  line  profile for a direct
          comparison  with  previous  observations of this clump. We find
          that   the   simultaneous   fitting  of  multiple  species  and
          transitions  is  a  powerful  tool in constraining the physical
          parameters  of  the  gas.  Different  scenarios  for  the clump
          formation  have  been  investigated.  The  models  that  better
          reproduce  all  the observed lines are those where the clump is
          formed,  at  least partially, before the advent of the outflow;
          with  the  advent  of  the  outflow the clump undergoes a short
          period  of non-dissociative shock and the consequent release of
          the  icy  mantle  together  with the high temperature chemistry
          leads  to  the  observed  chemical enrichment. Our results also
          suggest  the  presence of substructure within the clump: a more
          extended  component  traced  by  CS,  SO  and  the lower energy
          transitions (3_k-2_k and 2_k-1_k) of CH_3OH, and a more compact
          component   traced   by  H_2CO,  SO_2  and  the  higher  energy
          transitions (5_k-4_k) of CH_3OH.

          We  present  Spitzer observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy
          NGC  1705  obtained  as part of SINGS. The galaxy morphology is
          very   different   shortward   and   longward  of  ~5  microns:
          short-wavelength   imaging  shows  an  underlying  red  stellar
          population,   with   the   central  super  star  cluster  (SSC)
          dominating  the luminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm
          dust  emission  arising  from two off-nuclear regions offset by
          ~250  pc  from the SSC. These regions show little extinction at
          optical  wavelengths.  The  galaxy  has a relatively low global
          dust  mass  (~2E5  solar  masses, implying a global dust-to-gas
          mass  ratio  ~2--4 times lower than the Milky Way average). The
          off-nuclear dust emission appears to be powered by photons from
          the  same  stellar population responsible for the excitation of
          the  observed  H Alpha emission; these photons are unassociated
          with  the  SSC  (though a contribution from embedded sources to
          the  IR  luminosity  of the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled
          out).  Low-resolution  IRS spectroscopy shows moderate-strength
          PAH  emission  in  the 11.3 micron band in the eastern peak; no
          PAH  emission  is  detected  in  the  SSC  or  the western dust
          emission   complex.  There  is  significant  diffuse  8  micron
          emission after scaling and subtracting shorter wavelength data;
          the  spatially  variable PAH emission strengths revealed by the
          IRS  data  suggest  caution  in the interpretation of diffuse 8
          micron  emission  as  arising  from  PAH  carriers  alone.  The
          metallicity  of  NGC  1705 falls at the transition level of 35%
          solar  found  by Engelbracht and collaborators; the fact that a
          system   at  this  metallicity  shows  spatially  variable  PAH
          emission  demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8
          micron  emission.  A  radio  continuum  non-detection, NGC 1705
          deviates  significantly  from  the  canonical  far-IR vs. radio
          correlation. (Abridged)

          PSR B1931+24 (J1933+2421) behaves as an ordinary isolated radio
          pulsar  during  active phases that are 5-10 days long. However,
          the  radio  emission  switches  off in less than 10 seconds and
          remains  undetectable for the next 25-35 days, then it switches
          on  again.  This pattern repeats quasi-periodically. The origin
          of  this behaviour is unclear. Even more remarkably, the pulsar
          rotation  slows  down  50% faster when it is on than when it is
          off.  This  indicates  a  massive  increase  in  magnetospheric
          currents  when the pulsar switches on, proving that pulsar wind
          plays  a  substantial role in pulsar spin-down. This allows us,
          for  the  first  time,  to  estimate  the  currents in a pulsar
          magnetospheric during the occurrence of radio emission.

          Title:   Star  formation  through  gravitational  collapse  and
          competitive accretion
          Authors: Ian A. Bonnell (St Andrews), Matthew R. Bate (Exeter)
          Comments: 7 pages, 1 figure, MNRAS, in press
          Competitive  accretion,  a process to explain the origin of the
          IMF,  occurs  when  stars  in  a common gravitational potential
          accrete  from  a  distributed  gaseous  component. We show that
          concerns  recently  raised  on  the  efficiency  of competitive
          accretion   are   incorrect   as  they  use  globally  averaged
          properties  which are inappropriate for the detailed physics of
          a   forming  stellar  cluster.  A  full  treatment  requires  a
          realistic  treatment of the cluster potential, the distribution
          of  turbulent  velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does
          not  travel  at the global virial velocity of the system due to
          the  velocity-sizescale  relation inherent in turbulent gas and
          due  to  the  lower  velocity dispersion of small-N clusters in
          which  much  of  the  accretion  occurs.  Stars  located in the
          gas-rich  centres  of  such  systems initially accrete from low
          relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to
          accrete  the  higher  velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of
          such  potentials,  or  that  enter  the  cluster later when the
          velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete significantly and
          thus  retain  their  low-masses. In competitive accretion, most
          stars  do not continue to accrete significantly such that their
          masses  are  set  from the fragmentation process. It is the few
          stars  which continue to accrete that become higher-mass stars.
          Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be responsible for
          the  formation  of  higher-mass  stars and can explain the mass
          distribution,  mass  segregation  and binary frequency of these
          stars.   Global  kinematics  of  competitive  accretion  models
          include large-scale mass infall, with mean inflow velocities of
          order  0.5  km/s at scales of 0.5 pc, but infall signatures are
          likely  to  be  confused by the large tangential velocities and
          the velocity dispersion present.

          Astrophysics, accepted 10 January 2006
          We  used the deep colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of five rich
          LMC  clusters (NGC1805, 1818, 1831, 1868, and Hodge14) observed
          with HST/WFPC2 to derive their present day mass function (PDMF)
          and  its  variation  with position within the cluster. The PDMF
          was parameterized as a power law in the available main-sequence
          mass  range  of  each cluster, typically 0.9 <~ m/M_sun <~ 2.5;
          its  slope  was determined at different positions spanning from
          the  very  centre  out  to  several core radii. The CMDs in the
          central regions of the clusters were carefully studied earlier,
          resulting  in  accurate age, metallicity, distance modulus, and
          reddening  values. The slope alpha (where Salpeter is 2.35) was
          determined  in  annuli  by following two distinct methods: 1) a
          power law fit to the PDMF obtained from the systemic luminosity
          function (LF); 2) a statistical comparison between observed and
          model  CMDs.  In  all clusters, significant mass segregation is
          found  from  the positional dependence of the PDMF slope: alpha
          <~  1.8  for  R <= 1.0 R_core and alpha ~ Salpeter inside R=2~3
          R_core  (except  for Hodge 14, where alpha ~ Salpeter for R ~ 4
          R_core).  The  results  are  robust in the sense that they hold
          true  for  both  methods  used.  The  CMD  method  reveals that
          unresolved binaries flatten the PDMF obtained form the systemic
          LF,  but  this  effect is smaller than the uncertainties in the
          alpha  determination.  For  each cluster we estimated dynamical
          ages  inside  the core and for the entire system. In both cases
          we  found a trend in the sense that older clusters have flatter
          PDMF,  consistent with a dynamical mass segregation and stellar
          evaporation.

          Title: Strategies for observing extreme mass ratio inspirals
          Authors: Steve Drasco
          Comments: 16 pages, submitted to the proceedings of 10th Annual
          Gravitational Wave Data Analysis Workshop (GWDAW 10)
          I  review  the  status  of  research, conducted by a variety of
          independent  groups,  aimed  at  the  eventual  observation  of
          Extreme  Mass  Ratio  Inspirals (EMRIs) with gravitational wave
          detectors. EMRIs are binary systems in which one of the objects
          is  much  more massive than the other, and which are in a state
          of  dynamical  evolution  that  is  dominated by the effects of
          gravitational  radiation.  Although  these  systems  are highly
          relativistic,  with  the  smaller object moving relative to the
          larger  at  nearly  light-speed,  they  are  well  described by
          perturbative  calculations  which  exploit  the mass ratio as a
          natural   small   parameter.   I   review   the   use  of  such
          approximations  to  generate  waveforms needed by data analysis
          algorithms for observation. I also briefly review the status of
          developing the data analysis algorithms themselves.

          We  present  the  first  results from a 500 ksec Chandra ACIS-I
          observation of M87. At soft energies (0.5-1.0 keV), we detect a
          complex  filamentary  structure associated with the eastern and
          southwestern  arms.  Many  filaments are spatially resolved and
          have   widths   of  ~300  pc.  This  filamentary  structure  is
          particularly  striking  in the eastern arm where we suggest the
          filaments are outer edges of a series of buoyant bubbles filled
          with  relativistic plasma, produced by the central supermassive
          black  hole, in a succession of small outbursts occurring every
          ~6  x  10^6  years.  The  X-ray structures may be influenced by
          magnetic  filamentation.  At  hard  energies  (3.5-7.5 keV), we
          detect  a  nearly circular shell of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc).
          This  ring  of  hard  X-ray  emission  provides  an unambiguous
          signature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the SMBH,
          traversing  the M87 atmosphere. The observed spectral hardening
          corresponds  to  a  temperature rise from 2.0 to 2.4 keV, which
          translates  to  a  Mach  number  M~1.2  for monoatomic gas with
          gamma=5/3.  In  addition,  we  detect  two  additional  surface
          brightness  edges  (at  radii  of  ~0.6'  and ~1.2'). The ~0.6'
          feature  may be the gas just outside the ``piston'' driving the
          2.8'  shock,  while the ~1.2' feature is probably produced by a
          secondary outburst.

          Authors: Alexander Hubbard, Eric G. Blackman
          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures
          Active  Galactic  Nuclei  can  produce extremely powerful jets.
          While  tightly  collimated,  the  scale  of  these jets and the
          stellar  density at galactic centers implies that there will be
          many jet/star interactions, which can mass-load the jet through
          stellar  winds. Previous work employed modest wind mass outflow
          rates, but this does not apply when mass loading is provided by
          a  small  number  of  high  mass-loss  stars.  We  construct  a
          framework  for  jet mass-loading by stellar winds for a broader
          spectrum  of  wind  mass-loss  rates  than  has been previously
          considered.  Given  the  observed stellar mass distributions in
          galactic  centers,  we  find  that  even  highly efficient (0.1
          Eddington  luminosity)  jets  from  supermassive black holes of
          masses  $M_{BH}  \la 10^4M_{\odot}$ are rapidly mass loaded and
          quenched  by  stellar  winds.  For  $10^4 M_{\odot}<M_{BH}<10^8
          M_{\odot}$,  the  quenching  length of highly efficient jets is
          independent  of  the  jet's mechanical luminosity. Stellar wind
          mass-loading  is  unable  to  quench  efficient  jets from more
          massive engines, but can account for the observed truncation of
          the  inefficient  M87  jet,  and  implies  a  baryon  dominated
          composition  on  scales  $\ga 2$ kpc therein even if the jet is
          initially pair plasma dominated.

          Title: Dark matter halo response to the disk growth
          Authors: Jun-Hwan Choi, Yu Lu, H. J. Mo, Martin D. Weinberg
          Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  consider  the  sensitivity  of the circular-orbit adiabatic
          contraction  approximation  \citep{bw84,  blumenthal86}  to the
          timing of baryon condensation and the orbital structure of dark
          matter    halos    in    the   $\Lambda$CDM   paradigm.   Using
          one-dimensional  hydrodynamic  simulations  including  the dark
          matter   halo  mass  accretion  history  and  gas  cooling,  we
          demonstrate  that  the adiabatic approximation is approximately
          valid  even though halos and disks may assemble simultaneously.
          We further demonstrate the validity of the simple approximation
          for  $\Lambda$CDM halos \citep[e.g.][hereafter NFW]{NFW97} with
          isotropic velocity distributions using three-dimensional N-body
          simulations.  This  result  is  easily understood: an isotropic
          velocity  distribution  in  a cuspy halo requires more circular
          orbits   than  radial  orbits.  Conversely,  the  approximation
          considerably  differs  in  the  extreme  case of a radial orbit
          halo.  The approximation overestimates the response a core dark
          matter  halo, where radial orbit fraction is larger. Because no
          astronomically  relevant  models  are  dominated by low-angular
          momentum orbits in the vicinity of the disk and the growth time
          scale  is never shorter than a dynamical time, we conclude that
          the adiabatic contraction approximation is generally acceptable
          in the CDM cosmology.

          Title: The X-ray properties of the dwarf Magellanic-type galaxy
          NGC 55
          Authors:   A-M.   Stobbart,   T.  P.  Roberts,  R.  S.  Warwick

          Comments:  17  pages,  8  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We   present  an  analysis  of  the  X-ray  properties  of  the
          Magellanic-type   galaxy   NGC   55  based  on  two  contiguous
          XMM-Newton observations. We detect a total of 137 X-ray sources
          in  the  field  of  view,  42  of  which are located within the
          optical  confines  of  the galaxy. On the basis of X-ray colour
          classification  and after correcting for background objects, we
          conclude that our source sample includes ~ 20 X-ray binaries, 5
          supernova  remnants  and  7 very soft sources (including 2 good
          candidate  supersoft  sources) associated with NGC 55. Detailed
          spectral  and  timing  analysis  was  carried  out  on 4 of the
          brightest  X-ray  sources.  One  of these objects is identified
          with  a  Galactic  foreground star and is a possible new RS CVn
          system.  The  other  three  are consistent with accreting X-ray
          binaries,  though further evidence of short term variability is
          required   to  confirm  this.  We  also  find  evidence  of  an
          underlying  component,  which is concentrated on the bar region
          but  has  an  extent of at least 6' (3 kpc) in the plane of the
          galaxy  and  +/-  1'  (+/-  500  pc)  perpendicular to it. This
          emission  is  best  fitted  by  a thermal plasma plus power-law
          model  but  with  high intrinsic absorption consistent with its
          location  in  the  central disc of the galaxy. We interpret the
          soft component as diffuse thermal emission linked to regions of
          current star formation, whilst the hard power-law component may
          originate  in  unresolved  X-ray  binary sources. The intrinsic
          luminosity  of this residual disc emission may exceed Lx ~ 6e38
          ergs/s  (0.3-6 keV). A comparison with other Magellanic systems
          confirms  that,  in  terms  of  both  its discrete X-ray source
          population   and  its  extended  emission,  NGC  55  has  X-ray
          properties which are typical of its class.

          Title: SHARC-2 350 Micron Observations of Distant Submillimeter
          Selected Galaxies
          Authors:  A.  Kovacs, S. C. Chapman, C. D. Dowell, A. W. Blain,
          R. J. Ivison, I. Smail, T. G. Phillips
          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  present  350um  observations  of  15  Chapman et al. (2005)
          submillimeter  galaxies  (SMGs)  with  radio  counterparts  and
          optical  redshifts.  We  detect  12  and obtain sensitive upper
          limits  for  3, providing direct, precise measurements of their
          far-infrared luminosities and characteristic dust temperatures.
          With   these,   we   verify   the   linear  radio--far-infrared
          correlation  at  redshifts  of  z  ~  1-3  and  luminosities of
          10^11-10^13  L_sun,  with  a power-law index of 1.02+-0.12, and
          rms  scatter  of  0.12 dex. However, either the the correlation
          constant  'q'  or  the  dust  emissivity  'beta'  is lower than
          measured  locally. The best fitting q ~ 2.14 is consistent with
          SMGs being predominantly starbust galaxies, without significant
          AGN contribution, at far-infrared wavelengths. Gas-to-dust mass
          ratios  are  estimated  at 54+-13 kappa(850um)/0.15 m^2 kg^-1],
          depending  on  the absoption efficiency 'kappa', with intrinsic
          dispersion  ~  40%  around  the  mean  value. Dust temperatures
          consistent  with  34.6+-3K  [beta/1.5]^-0.71,  at  z ~ 1.5-3.5,
          suggest  that far-infrared photometric redshifts may be viable,
          and  perhaps  accurate to 10% <~ dz/(1+z), for up to 80% of the
          SMG   population  in  this  range,  if  the  above  temperature
          characterizes   the  full  range  of  SMGs.  However,  observed
          temperature  evolution  of  T_d  ~ (1+z) is also plausible, and
          could   result   from  selection  effects.  From  the  observed
          luminosity--temperature (L-T) relation, L ~ T_obs^(2.82+-0.29),
          we derive scaling relations for dust mass vs. dust temperature,
          and   identify   expressions   to   inter-relate  the  observed
          quantities.   These  suggest  that  measurements  at  a  single
          wavelength,   in   the  far-infrared,  submillimeter  or  radio
          wavebands,  might  constrain dust temperatures and far-infrared
          luminosities for most SMGs with redshifts at z ~ 0.5-4.

          Title: Outflows driven by Giant Protoplanets
          Authors:   Masahiro  N.  Machida  Shu-ichiro  Inutsuka  Tomoaki

          Comments:  12  pages,  3  figures,  Submitted to ApJL, For high
          resolution figures see this http URL
          We  investigate  outflows  driven  by a giant protoplanet using
          three-dimensional  MHD  nested  grid simulations. We consider a
          local region around the protoplanet in the protoplanetary disk,
          and  calculate  three  models: (a) unmagnetized disk model, (b)
          magnetized   disk   model  having  magnetic  field  azimuthally
          parallel  to  the disk, and (c) magnetic field perpendicular to
          the  disk.  Outflows  with  velocities,  at  least, 10 km/s are
          driven  by  the  protoplanets  in  both magnetized disk models,
          while  outflow  does  not  appear  in  unmagnetized disk model.
          Tube-like   outflows  along  the  azimuthal  direction  of  the
          protoplanetary  disk  appear in model with magnetic field being
          parallel to the disk. In this model, the magnetically dominated
          regions  (i.e.,  density gap) are clearly contrasted from other
          regions  and  spiral  waves appear near the protoplanet. On the
          other hand, in model with magnetic field being perpendicular to
          the  disk,  outflows are driven by a protoplanet with cone-like
          structure  just  as  seen in the outflow driven by a protostar.
          Magnetic  field lines are strongly twisted near the protoplanet
          and  the  outflows  have  well-collimated  structures  in  this
          model.These   outflows   can   be   landmarks   for   searching
          exo-protoplanets   in   their  formation  stages.  Our  results
          indicate  that  the accretion rate onto the protoplanet tend to
          have   a   larger   value  than  that  expected  from  previous
          hydrodynamical  calculations,  since  a fraction of the angular
          momentum  of  circum-planetary  disk  is  removed  by outflows,
          enhanced  non-axisymmetric  patterns  caused by magnetic field,
          and magnetic braking. Possible implications for observation are
          also briefly discussed.

          galaxies.

          Title:  Optical spectroscopy of (candidate) ultra-compact X-ray
          binaries: constraints on the composition of the donor stars
          Authors: G. Nelemans, P.G. Jonker, D. Steeghs
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We   present   optical   spectroscopy  of  several  (candidate)
          ultra-compact  X-ray binaries (UCXBs) obtained with the ESO VLT
          and  Gemini-North telescopes. In only one of five observed UCXB
          candidates  did  we  find  evidence  for  H in its spectrum (4U
          1556-60).  For  XB  1905+00  the  optical  counterpart  is  not
          detected. For the known UCXBs 4U 1626-67 and XB 1916-05 we find
          spectra  consistent  with  a  C/O  and  a  He/N  accretion disc
          respectively,  the  latter  is  the first optical spectrum of a
          He-rich donor in an UCXB. Interestingly, the C/O spectrum of 4U
          1626-67  shows  both similarities as well as marked differences
          from  the optical C/O spectrum of 4U 0614+09. We obtained phase
          resolved  spectroscopy  of  4U 0614+09 and the 44 min transient
          XTE  J0929-314.  In neither object were we able to detect clear
          orbital  periodicities, highlighting the difficulties of period
          determinations  in  UCXBs.  We  reanalysed  the  spectra of XTE
          J0929-314  that  were taken close to the peak of its 2003 X-ray
          outburst and do not confirm the detection of Halpha emission as
          was  claimed in the literature. The peak spectra do show strong
          C  or  N  emission  around  4640A, as has also been detected in
          other  UCXBs.  We  discuss the implications of our findings for
          our  understanding  of  the formation of UCXBs and the Galactic
          population  of  UCXBs.  At  the  moment all studied systems are
          consistent  with  having white dwarf donors, the majority being
          C/O rich.

          Comments: 11 pages, 9 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          In order to investigate the origin and the structure of the low
          velocity,  chemically  rich  clumps observed along the lobes of
          low-  and  intermediate-mass  outflows, we construct a detailed
          model  of  the  S1  clump  along  the  CB3  outflow.  We  use a
          time-dependent chemical model coupled with a radiative transfer
          model  to  reproduce  the  observed  line  profile for a direct
          comparison  with  previous  observations of this clump. We find
          that   the   simultaneous   fitting  of  multiple  species  and
          transitions  is  a  powerful  tool in constraining the physical
          parameters  of  the  gas.  Different  scenarios  for  the clump
          formation  have  been  investigated.  The  models  that  better
          reproduce  all  the observed lines are those where the clump is
          formed,  at  least partially, before the advent of the outflow;
          with  the  advent  of  the  outflow the clump undergoes a short
          period  of non-dissociative shock and the consequent release of
          the  icy  mantle  together  with the high temperature chemistry
          leads  to  the  observed  chemical enrichment. Our results also
          suggest  the  presence of substructure within the clump: a more
          extended  component  traced  by  CS,  SO  and  the lower energy
          transitions (3_k-2_k and 2_k-1_k) of CH_3OH, and a more compact
          component   traced   by  H_2CO,  SO_2  and  the  higher  energy
          transitions (5_k-4_k) of CH_3OH.

          We  present  Spitzer observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy
          NGC  1705  obtained  as part of SINGS. The galaxy morphology is
          very   different   shortward   and   longward  of  ~5  microns:
          short-wavelength   imaging  shows  an  underlying  red  stellar
          population,   with   the   central  super  star  cluster  (SSC)
          dominating  the luminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm
          dust  emission  arising  from two off-nuclear regions offset by
          ~250  pc  from the SSC. These regions show little extinction at
          optical  wavelengths.  The  galaxy  has a relatively low global
          dust  mass  (~2E5  solar  masses, implying a global dust-to-gas
          mass  ratio  ~2--4 times lower than the Milky Way average). The
          off-nuclear dust emission appears to be powered by photons from
          the  same  stellar population responsible for the excitation of
          the  observed  H Alpha emission; these photons are unassociated
          with  the  SSC  (though a contribution from embedded sources to
          the  IR  luminosity  of the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled
          out).  Low-resolution  IRS spectroscopy shows moderate-strength
          PAH  emission  in  the 11.3 micron band in the eastern peak; no
          PAH  emission  is  detected  in  the  SSC  or  the western dust
          emission   complex.  There  is  significant  diffuse  8  micron
          emission after scaling and subtracting shorter wavelength data;
          the  spatially  variable PAH emission strengths revealed by the
          IRS  data  suggest  caution  in the interpretation of diffuse 8
          micron  emission  as  arising  from  PAH  carriers  alone.  The
          metallicity  of  NGC  1705 falls at the transition level of 35%
          solar  found  by Engelbracht and collaborators; the fact that a
          system   at  this  metallicity  shows  spatially  variable  PAH
          emission  demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8
          micron  emission.  A  radio  continuum  non-detection, NGC 1705
          deviates  significantly  from  the  canonical  far-IR vs. radio
          correlation. (Abridged)

          PSR B1931+24 (J1933+2421) behaves as an ordinary isolated radio
          pulsar  during  active phases that are 5-10 days long. However,
          the  radio  emission  switches  off in less than 10 seconds and
          remains  undetectable for the next 25-35 days, then it switches
          on  again.  This pattern repeats quasi-periodically. The origin
          of  this behaviour is unclear. Even more remarkably, the pulsar
          rotation  slows  down  50% faster when it is on than when it is
          off.  This  indicates  a  massive  increase  in  magnetospheric
          currents  when the pulsar switches on, proving that pulsar wind
          plays  a  substantial role in pulsar spin-down. This allows us,
          for  the  first  time,  to  estimate  the  currents in a pulsar
          magnetospheric during the occurrence of radio emission.

          Competitive  accretion,  a process to explain the origin of the
          IMF,  occurs  when  stars  in  a common gravitational potential
          accrete  from  a  distributed  gaseous  component. We show that
          concerns  recently  raised  on  the  efficiency  of competitive
          accretion   are   incorrect   as  they  use  globally  averaged
          properties  which are inappropriate for the detailed physics of
          a   forming  stellar  cluster.  A  full  treatment  requires  a
          realistic  treatment of the cluster potential, the distribution
          of  turbulent  velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does
          not  travel  at the global virial velocity of the system due to
          the  velocity-sizescale  relation inherent in turbulent gas and
          due  to  the  lower  velocity dispersion of small-N clusters in
          which  much  of  the  accretion  occurs.  Stars  located in the
          gas-rich  centres  of  such  systems initially accrete from low
          relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to
          accrete  the  higher  velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of
          such  potentials,  or  that  enter  the  cluster later when the
          velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete significantly and
          thus  retain  their  low-masses. In competitive accretion, most
          stars  do not continue to accrete significantly such that their
          masses  are  set  from the fragmentation process. It is the few
          stars  which continue to accrete that become higher-mass stars.
          Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be responsible for
          the  formation  of  higher-mass  stars and can explain the mass
          distribution,  mass  segregation  and binary frequency of these
          stars.   Global  kinematics  of  competitive  accretion  models
          include large-scale mass infall, with mean inflow velocities of
          order  0.5  km/s at scales of 0.5 pc, but infall signatures are
          likely  to  be  confused by the large tangential velocities and
          the velocity dispersion present.

          Title:  Mass segregation in rich LMC clusters from modelling of
          deep HST colour-magnitude diagrams
          Authors:  L. O. Kerber (1,2), B. X. Santiago (1) ((1) Instituto

          Astrophysics, accepted 10 January 2006
          We  used the deep colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of five rich
          LMC  clusters (NGC1805, 1818, 1831, 1868, and Hodge14) observed
          with HST/WFPC2 to derive their present day mass function (PDMF)
          and  its  variation  with position within the cluster. The PDMF
          was parameterized as a power law in the available main-sequence
          mass  range  of  each cluster, typically 0.9 <~ m/M_sun <~ 2.5;
          its  slope  was determined at different positions spanning from
          the  very  centre  out  to  several core radii. The CMDs in the
          central regions of the clusters were carefully studied earlier,
          resulting  in  accurate age, metallicity, distance modulus, and
          reddening  values. The slope alpha (where Salpeter is 2.35) was
          determined  in  annuli  by following two distinct methods: 1) a
          power law fit to the PDMF obtained from the systemic luminosity
          function (LF); 2) a statistical comparison between observed and
          model  CMDs.  In  all clusters, significant mass segregation is
          found  from  the positional dependence of the PDMF slope: alpha
          <~  1.8  for  R <= 1.0 R_core and alpha ~ Salpeter inside R=2~3
          R_core  (except  for Hodge 14, where alpha ~ Salpeter for R ~ 4
          R_core).  The  results  are  robust in the sense that they hold
          true  for  both  methods  used.  The  CMD  method  reveals that
          unresolved binaries flatten the PDMF obtained form the systemic
          LF,  but  this  effect is smaller than the uncertainties in the
          alpha  determination.  For  each cluster we estimated dynamical
          ages  inside  the core and for the entire system. In both cases
          we  found a trend in the sense that older clusters have flatter
          PDMF,  consistent with a dynamical mass segregation and stellar
          evaporation.

          Title: Strategies for observing extreme mass ratio inspirals
          Authors: Steve Drasco
          Comments: 16 pages, submitted to the proceedings of 10th Annual
          Gravitational Wave Data Analysis Workshop (GWDAW 10)
          I  review  the  status  of  research, conducted by a variety of
          independent  groups,  aimed  at  the  eventual  observation  of
          Extreme  Mass  Ratio  Inspirals (EMRIs) with gravitational wave
          detectors. EMRIs are binary systems in which one of the objects
          is  much  more massive than the other, and which are in a state
          of  dynamical  evolution  that  is  dominated by the effects of
          gravitational  radiation.  Although  these  systems  are highly
          relativistic,  with  the  smaller object moving relative to the
          larger  at  nearly  light-speed,  they  are  well  described by
          perturbative  calculations  which  exploit  the mass ratio as a
          natural   small   parameter.   I   review   the   use  of  such
          approximations  to  generate  waveforms needed by data analysis
          algorithms for observation. I also briefly review the status of
          developing the data analysis algorithms themselves.

          We  present  the  first  results from a 500 ksec Chandra ACIS-I
          observation of M87. At soft energies (0.5-1.0 keV), we detect a
          complex  filamentary  structure associated with the eastern and
          southwestern  arms.  Many  filaments are spatially resolved and
          have   widths   of  ~300  pc.  This  filamentary  structure  is
          particularly  striking  in the eastern arm where we suggest the
          filaments are outer edges of a series of buoyant bubbles filled
          with  relativistic plasma, produced by the central supermassive
          black  hole, in a succession of small outbursts occurring every
          ~6  x  10^6  years.  The  X-ray structures may be influenced by
          magnetic  filamentation.  At  hard  energies  (3.5-7.5 keV), we
          detect  a  nearly circular shell of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc).
          This  ring  of  hard  X-ray  emission  provides  an unambiguous
          signature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the SMBH,
          traversing  the M87 atmosphere. The observed spectral hardening
          corresponds  to  a  temperature rise from 2.0 to 2.4 keV, which
          translates  to  a  Mach  number  M~1.2  for monoatomic gas with
          gamma=5/3.  In  addition,  we  detect  two  additional  surface
          brightness  edges  (at  radii  of  ~0.6'  and ~1.2'). The ~0.6'
          feature  may be the gas just outside the ``piston'' driving the
          2.8'  shock,  while the ~1.2' feature is probably produced by a
          secondary outburst.

          Title: AGN Jet Mass Loading and Truncation by Stellar Winds
          Authors: Alexander Hubbard, Eric G. Blackman
          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures
          Active  Galactic  Nuclei  can  produce extremely powerful jets.
          While  tightly  collimated,  the  scale  of  these jets and the
          stellar  density at galactic centers implies that there will be
          many jet/star interactions, which can mass-load the jet through
          stellar  winds. Previous work employed modest wind mass outflow
          rates, but this does not apply when mass loading is provided by
          a  small  number  of  high  mass-loss  stars.  We  construct  a
          framework  for  jet mass-loading by stellar winds for a broader
          spectrum  of  wind  mass-loss  rates  than  has been previously
          considered.  Given  the  observed stellar mass distributions in
          galactic  centers,  we  find  that  even  highly efficient (0.1
          Eddington  luminosity)  jets  from  supermassive black holes of
          masses  $M_{BH}  \la 10^4M_{\odot}$ are rapidly mass loaded and
          quenched  by  stellar  winds.  For  $10^4 M_{\odot}<M_{BH}<10^8
          M_{\odot}$,  the  quenching  length of highly efficient jets is
          independent  of  the  jet's mechanical luminosity. Stellar wind
          mass-loading  is  unable  to  quench  efficient  jets from more
          massive engines, but can account for the observed truncation of
          the  inefficient  M87  jet,  and  implies  a  baryon  dominated
          composition  on  scales  $\ga 2$ kpc therein even if the jet is
          initially pair plasma dominated.

          Title: Dark matter halo response to the disk growth
          Authors: Jun-Hwan Choi, Yu Lu, H. J. Mo, Martin D. Weinberg
          Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  consider  the  sensitivity  of the circular-orbit adiabatic
          contraction  approximation  \citep{bw84,  blumenthal86}  to the
          timing of baryon condensation and the orbital structure of dark
          matter    halos    in    the   $\Lambda$CDM   paradigm.   Using
          one-dimensional  hydrodynamic  simulations  including  the dark
          matter   halo  mass  accretion  history  and  gas  cooling,  we
          demonstrate  that  the adiabatic approximation is approximately
          valid  even though halos and disks may assemble simultaneously.
          We further demonstrate the validity of the simple approximation
          for  $\Lambda$CDM halos \citep[e.g.][hereafter NFW]{NFW97} with
          isotropic velocity distributions using three-dimensional N-body
          simulations.  This  result  is  easily understood: an isotropic
          velocity  distribution  in  a cuspy halo requires more circular
          orbits   than  radial  orbits.  Conversely,  the  approximation
          considerably  differs  in  the  extreme  case of a radial orbit
          halo.  The approximation overestimates the response a core dark
          matter  halo, where radial orbit fraction is larger. Because no
          astronomically  relevant  models  are  dominated by low-angular
          momentum orbits in the vicinity of the disk and the growth time
          scale  is never shorter than a dynamical time, we conclude that
          the adiabatic contraction approximation is generally acceptable
          in the CDM cosmology.

          Title: The X-ray properties of the dwarf Magellanic-type galaxy

          Comments:  17  pages,  8  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We   present  an  analysis  of  the  X-ray  properties  of  the
          Magellanic-type   galaxy   NGC   55  based  on  two  contiguous
          XMM-Newton observations. We detect a total of 137 X-ray sources
          in  the  field  of  view,  42  of  which are located within the
          optical  confines  of  the galaxy. On the basis of X-ray colour
          classification  and after correcting for background objects, we
          conclude that our source sample includes ~ 20 X-ray binaries, 5
          supernova  remnants  and  7 very soft sources (including 2 good
          candidate  supersoft  sources) associated with NGC 55. Detailed
          spectral  and  timing  analysis  was  carried  out  on 4 of the
          brightest  X-ray  sources.  One  of these objects is identified
          with  a  Galactic  foreground star and is a possible new RS CVn
          system.  The  other  three  are consistent with accreting X-ray
          binaries,  though further evidence of short term variability is
          required   to  confirm  this.  We  also  find  evidence  of  an
          underlying  component,  which is concentrated on the bar region
          but  has  an  extent of at least 6' (3 kpc) in the plane of the
          galaxy  and  +/-  1'  (+/-  500  pc)  perpendicular to it. This
          emission  is  best  fitted  by  a thermal plasma plus power-law
          model  but  with  high intrinsic absorption consistent with its
          location  in  the  central disc of the galaxy. We interpret the
          soft component as diffuse thermal emission linked to regions of
          current star formation, whilst the hard power-law component may
          originate  in  unresolved  X-ray  binary sources. The intrinsic
          luminosity  of this residual disc emission may exceed Lx ~ 6e38
          ergs/s  (0.3-6 keV). A comparison with other Magellanic systems
          confirms  that,  in  terms  of  both  its discrete X-ray source
          population   and  its  extended  emission,  NGC  55  has  X-ray
          properties which are typical of its class.

          Selected Galaxies

          R. J. Ivison, I. Smail, T. G. Phillips
          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  present  350um  observations  of  15  Chapman et al. (2005)
          submillimeter  galaxies  (SMGs)  with  radio  counterparts  and
          optical  redshifts.  We  detect  12  and obtain sensitive upper
          limits  for  3, providing direct, precise measurements of their
          far-infrared luminosities and characteristic dust temperatures.
          With   these,   we   verify   the   linear  radio--far-infrared
          correlation  at  redshifts  of  z  ~  1-3  and  luminosities of
          10^11-10^13  L_sun,  with  a power-law index of 1.02+-0.12, and
          rms  scatter  of  0.12 dex. However, either the the correlation
          constant  'q'  or  the  dust  emissivity  'beta'  is lower than
          measured  locally. The best fitting q ~ 2.14 is consistent with
          SMGs being predominantly starbust galaxies, without significant
          AGN contribution, at far-infrared wavelengths. Gas-to-dust mass
          ratios  are  estimated  at 54+-13 kappa(850um)/0.15 m^2 kg^-1],
          depending  on  the absoption efficiency 'kappa', with intrinsic
          dispersion  ~  40%  around  the  mean  value. Dust temperatures
          consistent  with  34.6+-3K  [beta/1.5]^-0.71,  at  z ~ 1.5-3.5,
          suggest  that far-infrared photometric redshifts may be viable,
          and  perhaps  accurate to 10% <~ dz/(1+z), for up to 80% of the
          SMG   population  in  this  range,  if  the  above  temperature
          characterizes   the  full  range  of  SMGs.  However,  observed
          temperature  evolution  of  T_d  ~ (1+z) is also plausible, and
          could   result   from  selection  effects.  From  the  observed
          luminosity--temperature (L-T) relation, L ~ T_obs^(2.82+-0.29),
          we derive scaling relations for dust mass vs. dust temperature,
          and   identify   expressions   to   inter-relate  the  observed
          quantities.   These  suggest  that  measurements  at  a  single
          wavelength,   in   the  far-infrared,  submillimeter  or  radio
          wavebands,  might  constrain dust temperatures and far-infrared
          luminosities for most SMGs with redshifts at z ~ 0.5-4.

          Comments:  12  pages,  3  figures,  Submitted to ApJL, For high
          resolution figures see this http URL
          We  investigate  outflows  driven  by a giant protoplanet using
          three-dimensional  MHD  nested  grid simulations. We consider a
          local region around the protoplanet in the protoplanetary disk,
          and  calculate  three  models: (a) unmagnetized disk model, (b)
          magnetized   disk   model  having  magnetic  field  azimuthally
          parallel  to  the disk, and (c) magnetic field perpendicular to
          the  disk.  Outflows  with  velocities,  at  least, 10 km/s are
          driven  by  the  protoplanets  in  both magnetized disk models,
          while  outflow  does  not  appear  in  unmagnetized disk model.
          Tube-like   outflows  along  the  azimuthal  direction  of  the
          protoplanetary  disk  appear in model with magnetic field being
          parallel to the disk. In this model, the magnetically dominated
          regions  (i.e.,  density gap) are clearly contrasted from other
          regions  and  spiral  waves appear near the protoplanet. On the
          other hand, in model with magnetic field being perpendicular to
          the  disk,  outflows are driven by a protoplanet with cone-like
          structure  just  as  seen in the outflow driven by a protostar.
          Magnetic  field lines are strongly twisted near the protoplanet
          and  the  outflows  have  well-collimated  structures  in  this
          model.These   outflows   can   be   landmarks   for   searching
          exo-protoplanets   in   their  formation  stages.  Our  results
          indicate  that  the accretion rate onto the protoplanet tend to
          have   a   larger   value  than  that  expected  from  previous
          hydrodynamical  calculations,  since  a fraction of the angular
          momentum  of  circum-planetary  disk  is  removed  by outflows,
          enhanced  non-axisymmetric  patterns  caused by magnetic field,
          and magnetic braking. Possible implications for observation are
          also briefly discussed.

          binaries: constraints on the composition of the donor stars
          Authors: G. Nelemans, P.G. Jonker, D. Steeghs
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We   present   optical   spectroscopy  of  several  (candidate)
          ultra-compact  X-ray binaries (UCXBs) obtained with the ESO VLT
          and  Gemini-North telescopes. In only one of five observed UCXB
          candidates  did  we  find  evidence  for  H in its spectrum (4U
          1556-60).  For  XB  1905+00  the  optical  counterpart  is  not
          detected. For the known UCXBs 4U 1626-67 and XB 1916-05 we find
          spectra  consistent  with  a  C/O  and  a  He/N  accretion disc
          respectively,  the  latter  is  the first optical spectrum of a
          He-rich donor in an UCXB. Interestingly, the C/O spectrum of 4U
          1626-67  shows  both similarities as well as marked differences
          from  the optical C/O spectrum of 4U 0614+09. We obtained phase
          resolved  spectroscopy  of  4U 0614+09 and the 44 min transient
          XTE  J0929-314.  In neither object were we able to detect clear
          orbital  periodicities, highlighting the difficulties of period
          determinations  in  UCXBs.  We  reanalysed  the  spectra of XTE
          J0929-314  that  were taken close to the peak of its 2003 X-ray
          outburst and do not confirm the detection of Halpha emission as
          was  claimed in the literature. The peak spectra do show strong
          C  or  N  emission  around  4640A, as has also been detected in
          other  UCXBs.  We  discuss the implications of our findings for
          our  understanding  of  the formation of UCXBs and the Galactic
          population  of  UCXBs.  At  the  moment all studied systems are
          consistent  with  having white dwarf donors, the majority being
          C/O rich.

          Title: A detailed modelling of the chemically rich clumps along
          the CB3 outflow

          In order to investigate the origin and the structure of the low
          velocity,  chemically  rich  clumps observed along the lobes of
          low-  and  intermediate-mass  outflows, we construct a detailed
          model  of  the  S1  clump  along  the  CB3  outflow.  We  use a
          time-dependent chemical model coupled with a radiative transfer
          model  to  reproduce  the  observed  line  profile for a direct
          comparison  with  previous  observations of this clump. We find
          that   the   simultaneous   fitting  of  multiple  species  and
          transitions  is  a  powerful  tool in constraining the physical
          parameters  of  the  gas.  Different  scenarios  for  the clump
          formation  have  been  investigated.  The  models  that  better
          reproduce  all  the observed lines are those where the clump is
          formed,  at  least partially, before the advent of the outflow;
          with  the  advent  of  the  outflow the clump undergoes a short
          period  of non-dissociative shock and the consequent release of
          the  icy  mantle  together  with the high temperature chemistry
          leads  to  the  observed  chemical enrichment. Our results also
          suggest  the  presence of substructure within the clump: a more
          extended  component  traced  by  CS,  SO  and  the lower energy
          transitions (3_k-2_k and 2_k-1_k) of CH_3OH, and a more compact
          component   traced   by  H_2CO,  SO_2  and  the  higher  energy
          transitions (5_k-4_k) of CH_3OH.

          We  present  Spitzer observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy
          NGC  1705  obtained  as part of SINGS. The galaxy morphology is
          very   different   shortward   and   longward  of  ~5  microns:
          short-wavelength   imaging  shows  an  underlying  red  stellar
          population,   with   the   central  super  star  cluster  (SSC)
          dominating  the luminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm
          dust  emission  arising  from two off-nuclear regions offset by
          ~250  pc  from the SSC. These regions show little extinction at
          optical  wavelengths.  The  galaxy  has a relatively low global
          dust  mass  (~2E5  solar  masses, implying a global dust-to-gas
          mass  ratio  ~2--4 times lower than the Milky Way average). The
          off-nuclear dust emission appears to be powered by photons from
          the  same  stellar population responsible for the excitation of
          the  observed  H Alpha emission; these photons are unassociated
          with  the  SSC  (though a contribution from embedded sources to
          the  IR  luminosity  of the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled
          out).  Low-resolution  IRS spectroscopy shows moderate-strength
          PAH  emission  in  the 11.3 micron band in the eastern peak; no
          PAH  emission  is  detected  in  the  SSC  or  the western dust
          emission   complex.  There  is  significant  diffuse  8  micron
          emission after scaling and subtracting shorter wavelength data;
          the  spatially  variable PAH emission strengths revealed by the
          IRS  data  suggest  caution  in the interpretation of diffuse 8
          micron  emission  as  arising  from  PAH  carriers  alone.  The
          metallicity  of  NGC  1705 falls at the transition level of 35%
          solar  found  by Engelbracht and collaborators; the fact that a
          system   at  this  metallicity  shows  spatially  variable  PAH
          emission  demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8
          micron  emission.  A  radio  continuum  non-detection, NGC 1705
          deviates  significantly  from  the  canonical  far-IR vs. radio
          correlation. (Abridged)

          PSR B1931+24 (J1933+2421) behaves as an ordinary isolated radio
          pulsar  during  active phases that are 5-10 days long. However,
          the  radio  emission  switches  off in less than 10 seconds and
          remains  undetectable for the next 25-35 days, then it switches
          on  again.  This pattern repeats quasi-periodically. The origin
          of  this behaviour is unclear. Even more remarkably, the pulsar
          rotation  slows  down  50% faster when it is on than when it is
          off.  This  indicates  a  massive  increase  in  magnetospheric
          currents  when the pulsar switches on, proving that pulsar wind
          plays  a  substantial role in pulsar spin-down. This allows us,
          for  the  first  time,  to  estimate  the  currents in a pulsar
          magnetospheric during the occurrence of radio emission.

          Title:   Star  formation  through  gravitational  collapse  and
          competitive accretion
          Authors: Ian A. Bonnell (St Andrews), Matthew R. Bate (Exeter)
          Comments: 7 pages, 1 figure, MNRAS, in press
          Competitive  accretion,  a process to explain the origin of the
          IMF,  occurs  when  stars  in  a common gravitational potential
          accrete  from  a  distributed  gaseous  component. We show that
          concerns  recently  raised  on  the  efficiency  of competitive
          accretion   are   incorrect   as  they  use  globally  averaged
          properties  which are inappropriate for the detailed physics of
          a   forming  stellar  cluster.  A  full  treatment  requires  a
          realistic  treatment of the cluster potential, the distribution
          of  turbulent  velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does
          not  travel  at the global virial velocity of the system due to
          the  velocity-sizescale  relation inherent in turbulent gas and
          due  to  the  lower  velocity dispersion of small-N clusters in
          which  much  of  the  accretion  occurs.  Stars  located in the
          gas-rich  centres  of  such  systems initially accrete from low
          relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to
          accrete  the  higher  velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of
          such  potentials,  or  that  enter  the  cluster later when the
          velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete significantly and
          thus  retain  their  low-masses. In competitive accretion, most
          stars  do not continue to accrete significantly such that their
          masses  are  set  from the fragmentation process. It is the few
          stars  which continue to accrete that become higher-mass stars.
          Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be responsible for
          the  formation  of  higher-mass  stars and can explain the mass
          distribution,  mass  segregation  and binary frequency of these
          stars.   Global  kinematics  of  competitive  accretion  models
          include large-scale mass infall, with mean inflow velocities of
          order  0.5  km/s at scales of 0.5 pc, but infall signatures are
          likely  to  be  confused by the large tangential velocities and
          the velocity dispersion present.

          Title:  Mass segregation in rich LMC clusters from modelling of
          deep HST colour-magnitude diagrams

          Astrophysics, accepted 10 January 2006
          We  used the deep colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of five rich
          LMC  clusters (NGC1805, 1818, 1831, 1868, and Hodge14) observed
          with HST/WFPC2 to derive their present day mass function (PDMF)
          and  its  variation  with position within the cluster. The PDMF
          was parameterized as a power law in the available main-sequence
          mass  range  of  each cluster, typically 0.9 <~ m/M_sun <~ 2.5;
          its  slope  was determined at different positions spanning from
          the  very  centre  out  to  several core radii. The CMDs in the
          central regions of the clusters were carefully studied earlier,
          resulting  in  accurate age, metallicity, distance modulus, and
          reddening  values. The slope alpha (where Salpeter is 2.35) was
          determined  in  annuli  by following two distinct methods: 1) a
          power law fit to the PDMF obtained from the systemic luminosity
          function (LF); 2) a statistical comparison between observed and
          model  CMDs.  In  all clusters, significant mass segregation is
          found  from  the positional dependence of the PDMF slope: alpha
          <~  1.8  for  R <= 1.0 R_core and alpha ~ Salpeter inside R=2~3
          R_core  (except  for Hodge 14, where alpha ~ Salpeter for R ~ 4
          R_core).  The  results  are  robust in the sense that they hold
          true  for  both  methods  used.  The  CMD  method  reveals that
          unresolved binaries flatten the PDMF obtained form the systemic
          LF,  but  this  effect is smaller than the uncertainties in the
          alpha  determination.  For  each cluster we estimated dynamical
          ages  inside  the core and for the entire system. In both cases
          we  found a trend in the sense that older clusters have flatter
          PDMF,  consistent with a dynamical mass segregation and stellar
          evaporation.

          Title: Strategies for observing extreme mass ratio inspirals
          Authors: Steve Drasco
          Comments: 16 pages, submitted to the proceedings of 10th Annual
          Gravitational Wave Data Analysis Workshop (GWDAW 10)
          I  review  the  status  of  research, conducted by a variety of
          independent  groups,  aimed  at  the  eventual  observation  of
          Extreme  Mass  Ratio  Inspirals (EMRIs) with gravitational wave
          detectors. EMRIs are binary systems in which one of the objects
          is  much  more massive than the other, and which are in a state
          of  dynamical  evolution  that  is  dominated by the effects of
          gravitational  radiation.  Although  these  systems  are highly
          relativistic,  with  the  smaller object moving relative to the
          larger  at  nearly  light-speed,  they  are  well  described by
          perturbative  calculations  which  exploit  the mass ratio as a
          natural   small   parameter.   I   review   the   use  of  such
          approximations  to  generate  waveforms needed by data analysis
          algorithms for observation. I also briefly review the status of
          developing the data analysis algorithms themselves.

          Authors:  A.  Petric, C. L. Carilli, F. Bertoldi, A. Beelen, P.
          Cox, A. Omont
          Comments: accepted for publication in AJ
          We  present Very Large Array observations at 1.4 and 5 GHz of a
          sample  of 16 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) at z = 1.78 to 2.71.
          Half of the chosen quasars are bright at mm wavelengths (250 or
          350  GHz)  while  the  other  half  were  not  detected  at  mm
          wavelengths;  the former QSOs were detected at 1.4 GHz, in most
          cases  at  high  significance (S/N > ~7), but only three of the
          latter  sources were detected at radio frequencies, and only at
          lower  significance  (S/N  ~ 3). The data are consistent with a
          correlation  between  the  mm  and  radio  fluxes  indicating a
          physical  connection between the mechanisms responsible for the
          radio  and  mm  emission.  However, this conclusion is based on
          data  which includes many upper limits, and deeper observations
          are clearly needed to verify this correlation.
          All eight mm detected QSOs are detected in the radio continuum,
          with  radio  flux  densities  consistent  with the radio-to-FIR
          correlation  for  low z star forming galaxies. However, four of
          these  have  flatter  spectral indices than is typical for star
          forming  galaxies  (i.e.  greater  than  -0.5)  suggesting that
          radiation  from  the  central  AGN dominates the observed radio
          emission.  All  the  sources  detected at 1.4 GHz are spatially
          unresolved,  with the size limits typically < 1'' = 6 kpc. High
          star  formation  rate  galaxies  at  low redshift are typically
          nuclear  starbursts,  with  sizes  <  1 kpc. Hence, the current
          radio  size  limits  are insufficient to constrain the emission
          model (AGN or starburst).

          Title: Populating the Galaxy with low-mass X-ray binaries
          Authors: Paul D. Kiel, Jarrod R. Hurley
          Comments: 17 pages and 9 figures; accepted by MNRAS
          We   perform   binary   population  synthesis  calculations  to
          investigate  the incidence of low-mass X-ray binaries and their
          birth  rate  in the Galaxy. We use a binary evolution algorithm
          that   models   all  the  relevant  processes  including  tidal
          circularization   and   synchronization.   Parameters   in  the
          evolution  algorithm  that  are  uncertain and may affect X-ray
          binary  formation are allowed to vary during the investigation.
          We  agree with previous studies that under standard assumptions
          of binary evolution the formation rate and number of black-hole
          low-mass X-ray binaries predicted by the model are more than an
          order of magnitude less than what is indicated by observations.
          We  find that the common-envelope process cannot be manipulated
          to  produce  significant  numbers  of black-hole low-mass X-ray
          binaries.  However,  by simply reducing the mass-loss rate from
          helium  stars  adopted  in  the  standard model, to a rate that
          agrees  with  the  latest  data, we produce a good match to the
          observations.  Including  low-mass  X-ray  binaries that evolve
          from   intermediate-mass   systems  also  leads  to  favourable
          results.  We  stress  that  constraints  on  the  X-ray  binary
          population  provided  by observations are used here merely as a
          guide   as   surveys   suffer   from  incompleteness  and  much
          uncertainty is involved in the interpretation of results.

          CONTEXT.The  mass  assembly  is  believed  to  be  the dominant
          process  of  early  galaxy  formation. This mechanism of galaxy
          building  can  proceed  either  by  repeated major mergers with
          other  systems,  or  by  means  of accretion of matter from the
          surrounding   regions.   AIMS.In  this  paper  we  compare  the
          properties  of  local  disk galaxies that appear isolated, i.e.
          not  tidally affected by other galaxies during the last few Gyr
          within  the volume given by cz<= 5000 km/s, with those galaxies
          at z values from 0.25 to 5.
          METHODS.Effective  radii  for  203  isolated  galaxies and 1645
          galaxies  from  the RC3 have been collected and the two samples
          have been analyzed statistically. A similar comparison has been
          made  with  half  light  radii  studied  at  high  z  from  the
          literature.
          RESULTS.We  found that isolated galaxies are in general smaller
          than  other  present epoch galaxies from the RC3. We notice the
          lack  of  systems  larger  than  7  kpc  among them. Their size
          distribution  appears  to be similar to that of galaxies at 1.4
          <= z <= 2. The models of the merging history also indicate that
          the  isolated  galaxies did stop their merging process at about
          that  redshift,  evolving  passively  since  then.  The  galaxy
          density seems to have remained unchanged since that epoch.
          CONCLUSIONS.Isolated galaxies appears to be the end products of
          the  merging  process as proposed in the hierarchical accretion
          scenario  at  around z=1.4. For this class of galaxies this was
          the  last  significant  merging  event  in their lives and have
          evolved   passively  since  then.  This  is  confirmed  by  the
          analytical  estimate  of the merging fraction with z and by the
          comparison with sizes of distant galaxies.

          Title: Toroidal LNRF-velocity profiles in thick accretion discs
          orbiting rapidly rotating Kerr black holes
          Authors: Zdenek Stuchlik, Petr Slany, Gabriel Torok

          Proceedings; AIP style files included; 8 pages
          We show that in the equatorial plane of marginally stable thick
          discs (with uniformly distributed specific angular momentum the
          orbital  velocity  relative  to the locally non-rotating frames
          (LNRF)  has a positive radial gradient in the vicinity of black
          holes  with  spin a>0.99979. The change of sign of the velocity
          gradient  occurs  just  above  the center of the thick toroidal
          discs,  in  the  region  where stable circular geodesics of the
          Kerr  spacetime  are  allowed.  The  global  character  of  the
          phenomenon  is  given  in  terms of topology changes of the von
          Zeipel surfaces (equivalent to the equivelocity surfaces in the
          tori  with  constant  specific  angular momentum distribution).
          Toroidal   von   Zeipel   surfaces   exist  around  the  circle
          corresponding  to  the  minimum of the equatorial LNRF velocity
          profile,  indicating  a  possibility  of  development  of  some
          vertical instabilities in those parts of marginally stable tori
          with   positive   gradient   of  the  LNRF  velocity.  Eventual
          oscillatory frequencies connected with the phenomenon are given
          in a coordinate-independent form.

          Proceedings; AIP style files included; 8 pages
          Perfect  fluid  tori  with uniform distribution of the specific
          angular  momentum  orbiting  the  Kerr-de Sitter black holes or
          naked  singularities are studied. Closed equipotential surfaces
          corresponding  to stationary toroidal discs are allowed only in
          the  spacetimes  admitting  stable circular geodesics. The last
          closed   surface   crosses   itself  in  the  cusp(s)  enabling
          outflow(s)  of  matter  from  the torus due to the violation of
          hydrostatic  equilibrium.  The repulsive cosmological constant,
          $\Lambda  >0$,  implies the existence of the outer cusp (with a
          stabilizing  effect  on  the tori because of "excretion", i.e.,
          outflow  of matter from the torus into the outer space) and the
          strong  collimation  of  open  equipotential surfaces along the
          rotational  axis.  Both  the  effects  take  place  nearby  the
          so-called  static  radius where the gravitational attraction is
          just  balanced  by  the cosmic repulsion. The plus-family discs
          (which  are always corotating in the black-hole backgrounds but
          can  be counterrotating, even with negative energy of the fluid
          elements,  in  some  naked singularity backgrounds) are thicker
          and  more extended than the minus-family ones (which are always
          counterrotating  in  all  backgrounds).  If  the  parameters of
          naked-singularity  spacetimes  are very close to the parameters
          of  extreme  black-hole  spacetimes,  the  family  of  possible
          disc-like  configurations  includes  members  with two isolated
          discs where the inner one is always a counterrotating accretion
          disc.  Mass  estimates  for tori with nonrelativistic adiabatic
          equation  of  state  give limits on their central mass-density,
          for which the approximation of test fluid is adequate.

          Title: HST/STIS Spectroscopy of Five Super Star Clusters in the
          Starburst Galaxy M82
          Authors:  L. J. Smith, M. S. Westmoquette, J. S. Gallagher III,
          R. W. O'Connell, D. J. Rosario, R. de Grijs
          Comments: 17 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We   present  optical  spectroscopy  obtained  with  the  Space
          Telescope  Imaging  Spectrograph  (STIS)  of five young massive
          star  clusters in the starburst galaxy M82. A detailed analysis
          is  performed  for  one  cluster  `M82-A1'  and  its  immediate
          environment  in the starburst core. From HST archive images, we
          find  that  it  is  elliptical  with  an  effective  radius  of
          3.0+/-0.5  pc and is surrounded by a compact (r=4.5+/-0.5 pc) H
          II  region.  We determine the age and reddening of M82-A1 using
          synthetic  spectra  from population synthesis models by fitting
          both  the  continuum  energy  distribution and the depth of the
          Balmer  jump. We find an age of 6.4+/-0.5 Myr and a photometric
          mass  estimate  of M=7-13 x 10^5 solar masses. We associate its
          formation  with the most recent starburst event 4-6 Myr ago. We
          find  that  the oxygen abundance of the H II region surrounding
          M82-A1  is solar or slightly higher. The H II region has a high
          pressure  P/k = 1-2 x 10^7 cm^-3 K. The diffuse gas in region A
          has  a slightly lower pressure, which together with the broad H
          alpha  emission  line width, suggests that both the thermal and
          turbulent  pressures  in  the  M82 starburst core are unusually
          high.   We  discuss  how  this  environment  has  affected  the
          evolution of the cluster wind for M82-A1. We find that the high
          pressure  may  have caused the pressure-driven bubble to stall.
          We also obtain spectroscopic ages for clusters B1-2 and B2-1 in
          the  `fossil'  starburst  region  and  for the intermediate age
          clusters F and L. These are consistent with earlier studies and
          demonstrate  that star formation activity, sufficiently intense
          to produce super star clusters, has been going on in M82 during
          the past Gyr, perhaps in discrete and localized episodes.

          Title:  The  Massive  Star  Population  in the Giant HII Region
          Tol89 in NGC5398
          Authors: F. Sidoli, L. J. Smith, P. A. Crowther
          Comments:  22 pages, 15 figures and 8 tables. Accepted by MNRAS
          on 2006 April 28
          We  present  new high spectral resolution VLT/UVES spectroscopy
          and archival HST/STIS imaging and spectroscopy of the giant HII
          region Tol89 in NGC5398.
          From  optical  and UV HST images, we find that the star-forming
          complex  as  a  whole  contains  at  least  seven young compact
          massive clusters. We resolve the two brightest optical knots, A
          and  B,  into  five individual young massive clusters along our
          slit,  A1-4 and B1 respectively. From Starburst99 (Leitherer et
          al.)  UV  spectral  modelling,  and  nebular  H beta equivalent
          widths  in the optical, we derive ages that are consistent with
          the  formation  of two separate burst events, of ~4+/-1 Myr and
          <3  Myr  for  knots  A (A1-4) and B (B1). An LMC metallicity is
          measured for both knots, while nebular HeII 4686 is observed in
          knot  B and perhaps in knot A. We detect underlying broad wings
          on  the  strongest nebular emission lines indicating velocities
          up  to  600 km/s. We estimate that there are ~95 early WN stars
          and  ~35  early  WC  stars in Tol89-A, using empirical template
          spectra of LMC WR stars from Crowther and Hadfield. Remarkably,
          we  also  detect ~ three mid WNs in the smallest (mass) cluster
          in  Tol89-A, A4. From the strength of nebular H beta, we obtain
          N(O)  ~690  and  2800  for  knots  A  and  B.  We also employ a
          complementary approach using Starburst99 models, in which the O
          star content is inferred from the stellar continuum, and the WR
          population  is  obtained  from spectral synthesis of optical WR
          features  using  the grids from Smith et al. We find reasonable
          agreement  between  the  two methods for the O star content and
          the  N(WR)/N(O) ratio but find that the WR subtype distribution
          is  in  error  in  the  Starburst99 models, with far too few WN
          stars being predicted. We attribute this failure to the neglect
          of rotational mixing in evolutionary models. [abridged]

          We  present  medium-resolution optical spectra of the secondary
          star  in the high Galactic latitude black hole X-ray binary XTE
          J1118+480 and determine the abundance of Mg, Al, Ca, Fe, and Ni
          in  its  atmosphere.  For all the elements investigated we find
          supersolar  abundances; thus, we reject the hypothesis that the
          black  hole came from the direct collapse of an ancient massive
          halo  star.  The  compact  primary  most  likely  formed  in  a
          supernova   event  of  a  massive  star  whose  nucleosynthetic
          products  polluted  the  secondary  star.  The observed element
          abundances and their ratios can be explained using a variety of
          supernova  models  with a wide range of metallicities. While an
          explosive  origin  in the Galactic halo or thick disk cannot be
          discarded,  a  metal-rich  progenitor is clearly favored by the
          observed  abundance  pattern. This suggests that the black hole
          was  produced  in  the  Galactic thin disk with a violent natal
          kick,  propelling  the X-ray binary to its current location and
          orbit.

          Title:  Analytical  protostellar  disk  models 1: the effect of
          internal  dissipation  and surface irradiation on the structure
          of  disks  and  the  location  of the snow line around Sun-like
          stars
          Authors: Pascale Garaud, Douglas N. C. Lin
          Comments: 19 pages, 8 figures. Submitted to ApJ
          We  construct  a  new  set  of  self-consistent analytical disk
          models  by  taking  into  account  both  viscous  and radiative
          sources  of  thermal  energy.  We  analyze  the  non-isothermal
          structure  of the disk across the mid-plane for optically thick
          disks,  and  use the standard two-temperature model in the case
          of optically thin disks. We deduce a set of general formula for
          the  relationship  between  the  mass  accretion  rate  and the
          surface  density profile. Our results recover those of Chiang &
          Goldreich  in the optically thin regions, but extend their work
          for the opaque regions of the disk.
          For  the  purpose  of illustration, we apply our theory in this
          paper to determine the structure of protostellar disks around T
          Tauri  stars  under  a state of steady accretion and derive the
          corresponding  radial  distribution  function  of  various disk
          properties  such  as  surface  density and temperature near the
          mid-plane.  We calculate the position of the snow line around a
          sun-like  T Tauri star, and deduce that it can evolve from well
          outside 10 AU during FU Orionis outbursts, to about 4 AU during
          passive  accretion  phase, to the present-day orbital radius of
          Venus   and  finally  re-expand  to  over  2.2  AU  during  the
          protostellar-  to-debris  disk  transition. This non-monotonous
          evolution   of  the  snow  line  may  provide  some  novel  and
          deterministic  explanation  for the total water content and its
          isotopic  composition  of  both  Venus  and  the  Earth. In the
          optically  thin, outermost regions of the disk we find that the
          surface  density  profile  of  the  dust varies roughly as 1/r,
          which  is consistent with mm observations of spatially resolved
          disk of Mundy et al. (2000).

          observational manifestations
          Authors: A.G.Kuranov, K.A.Postnov
          Comments: LATEX, 21 pages, 8 gif figures, Astronomy Letters, in
          press
          Population  synthesis  is  used  to model the number of neutron
          stars  in  globular  clusters  that  are  observed as LMXBs and
          millisecond  PSRs. The dynamical interaction between binary and
          single  stars  in  a  GC  are  assumed  to  take  place  with a
          permanently  replenished  "background"  of  single  stars whose
          density  distribution keeps track with the cluster evolution as
          a  whole  and  evolution of single stars. We use the hypothesis
          (Podsiadlowski  et  al)  that NS forming in binary systems from
          components  with  initial  masses  \sim 8-12 M_\odot during the
          electron-capture collapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg core do not
          acquire  a  high  space  velocities  (kicks). The remaining NSs
          (i.e.  from  single  stars with M>8 M_\odot or binary comonents
          with  M>12  M_\odot) are assumed to be born with high kicks, as
          found  from obsrevations of single pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005).
          Under this assumption, a sizeable fraction of NSs remain in GCs
          (about  1000  NSs in a GC with a mass of 5\times 10^5 M_\odot).
          The  number  of  ms  PSRs  formed  in the cluster via accretion
          spin-up  in binaries is then about 10, which is consistent with
          observations.  Our  modelling  reproduces the observed shape of
          the  X-ray  luminosity  function  for accreting NSs in binaries
          with  normal  and degenerate components and the distribution of
          spin  periods  of  ms  PSRs  in  GCs  under  the  assumption of
          accretion-driven  magnetic  field  decay  of NSs up to a bottom
          value  of  10^8  G. The number of LMXBs and ms PSRs dynamically
          expelling from GCs is also calculated.

          Title: A Neutron Star in F-sharp
          Authors: Jonathan E. Grindlay
          Comments: Invited Perspective for Science; 3 pages, 3 figures
          Journal-ref: Science, 311, 1876 (2006)
          In  this short introductory commentary on the paper (Hessels et
          al  2006,  Science,  311,  1901) reporting the discovery of the
          shortest  spin  period  millisecond pulsar (MSP) Ter5-ad in the
          globular  cluster  Terzan 5, I also point out a new explanation
          for possible minimum spin periods, P, of MSPs without requiring
          gravitational  radiation  (or  other) slow-down torques. If the
          accretion  of  matter  required  to  spinup  a MSP also reduces
          (buries)  the  neutron star (NS) magnetic field, B, as commonly
          believed,  an inverse correlation between neutron star mass, M,
          and  B is expected together with a positive correlation between
          P  and  B.  Both  are  suggested  for  the  4 MSPs with NS mass
          measures reported (Latimer and Prakash 2004, Science, 304, 536)
          to have <~10% uncertainties. The correlations imply the Ter5-ad
          NS  has  ~2.5 Msun, B ~5 x 10^7 G and thus Pdot ~3 x 10^-21 s/s
          --  which  can  be  tested  when a timing solution is found. If
          confirmed,  the  highest spin frequency NSs do not pulse simply
          because their B fields are too low.

          Title: The Abundance of Distant and Extremely Red Galaxies: The
          Role of AGN Feedback in Hierarchical Models
          Authors:  N.  Menci,  A.  Fontana, E. Giallongo, A. Grazian, S.
          Salimbeni
          Comments: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal
          We  investigate  the  effect  of AGN feedback associated to the
          bright  QSO  phase onto the color distribution of galaxies from
          z=0 up to z=4. To this aim, we insert a blast-wave model of AGN
          feedback  in our semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, which
          includes  the  growth  of  supermassive black holes and the AGN
          activity  triggered  by  interactions of the host galaxies. The
          AGN  feedback  is  directly  related to the impulsive, luminous
          quasar  phase. We test our model by checking the consistency of
          its results against i) the QSO luminosity functions from z=0 to
          z=4;  ii)  the  observed  local relation between the black hole
          mass  m_{BH}  and  the mass of the host galaxy. At low redshift
          the inclusion of AGN feedback enhances the number of red bright
          galaxies,  so that the color distribution of M_r<-22 objects is
          entirely  dominated  by red (u-r>1.5) galaxies; at 0.5< z< 2 it
          yields  rest-frame  U-V  color  distribution  in agreement with
          existing observations. In the range z=1.5-2.5, we find that 31%
          of galaxies contribute to the EROs population with m_K<20 (Vega
          system);  at such a magnitude, the model yields an EROs surface
          density  of  6.3 10^3 /deg^2 matching existing data; about 80 %
          of  the  above  density is contributed by passive galaxies with
          old  stellar  populations.  Extending  our analysis to z=4, the
          model  matches  the observed surface density 1.5 10^3 /deg^2 of
          DRGs  at m_K=20; such a population is predicted to be dominated
          by galaxies with old stellar populations for z>2.5.

          Title:  Energy-dependent variability and the origin of the soft
          X-ray excess in AGN
          Authors: Marek Gierlinski, Chris Done
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS
          The  origin of the soft excess seen in many AGN below ~1 keV is
          still  an  unsolved problem. It is unlikely to represent a true
          continuum component as its characteristic 'temperature' shows a
          remarkable  constancy  over  a wide range of AGN luminosity and
          black  hole  mass.  This  instead  favours  an association with
          atomic  processes,  in  particular with the increase in opacity
          between  0.7-2  keV associated with partially ionized O and Fe.
          The  opacity jump can give rise to a soft excess either through
          reflection  or  transmission,  and  both  scenarios can fit the
          spectra  equally well as long as there is strong velocity shear
          to smear out the characteristic narrow atomic features. Here we
          use    orthogonal   constraints   from   the   energy-dependent
          variability.  The rms spectra seen in XMM-Newton AGN data often
          show  a  broad  peak  between  0.7-2  keV.  We  show  that  the
          absorption  model  can  explain the data well if the ionization
          state  of the smeared absorption responds to luminosity changes
          in the continuum.

          We  investigate the link between ionised Fe X-ray line emission
          and continuum emission in the bright nearby AGN, Mrk 766. A new
          long (433 ks) XMM-Newton observation is analysed, together with
          archival data from 2000 and 2001. The contribution from ionised
          line  emission  is  measured  and  its time variations on short
          (5-20   ks)   timescales  are  correlated  with  the  continuum
          emission.  The ionised line flux is found to be highly variable
          and   to  be  strongly  correlated  with  the  continuum  flux,
          demonstrating  an  origin for the ionised line emission that is
          co-located   with  the  continuum  emission.  Most  likely  the
          emission is ionised reflection from the accretion disc within a
          few A.U. of the central black hole, and its detection marks the
          first  time  that such an origin has been identified other than
          by  fitting  to spectral line profiles. Future observations may
          be  able  to measure a time lag and hence achieve reverberation
          mapping of AGN at X-ray energies.

          Title:  Compact  X-ray  Binaries  in  and out of Core Collapsed
          Globulars
          Authors: Jonathan E. Grindlay
          Comments:   12   pages,  6  figures,  invited  talk  at  COSPAR
          Colloquium  on  "Spectra and Timing of Compact X-ray Binaries",
          Mumbai, India (Jan. 2005), to be published in journal: Advances
          in Space Research (Elsevier)
          We  review  new  Chandra  and  HST  observations  of  the  core
          collapsed  cluster  NGC  6397  as  a guide to understanding the
          compact binary (CB) populations in core collapse globulars. New
          cataclysmic variables (CVs) and main sequence chromospherically
          active  binaries  (ABs) have been identified, enabling a larger
          sample  for  comparison  of the Lx, Fx/Fv and X-ray vs. optical
          color  distributions.  Comparison of the numbers of CBs with Lx
          >10^31  erg/s  in  4  core  collapse vs. 12 King model clusters
          reveals  that the specific frequency Sx (number of CBs per unit
          cluster  mass) is enhanced in core collapse clusters, even when
          normalized  for  their  stellar  encounter  rate. Although core
          collapse is halted by the dynamical heating due to stellar (and
          binary)  interaction  with  CBs  in  the core, we conclude that
          production  of the hardest CBs -- especially CVs -- is enhanced
          during  core  collapse.  NGC  6397  has  its  most luminous CVs
          nearest  the cluster center, with two newly discovered very low
          luminosity  (old,  quiescent) CVs far from the core. The active
          binaries  as  well  as  neutron  star  systems  (MSP and qLMXB)
          surround the central core. The overall CB population appears to
          be  asymmetric  about  the  cluster center, as in several other
          core  collapse clusters observed with Chandra, suggesting still
          poorly-understood scattering processes.

          Comments:  16  pages, 7 figures. To appear in the Classical and
          Quantum Gravity special issue on Numerical Relativity
          We  introduce  a  computational  framework which avoids solving
          explicitly  hydrodynamic equations and is suitable to study the
          pre-merger evolution of black hole-neutron star binary systems.
          The  essence  of  the method consists of constructing a neutron
          star  model  with  a  black  hole  companion  and  freezing the
          internal  degrees  of  freedom  of  the neutron star during the
          course  of the evolution of the space-time geometry. We present
          the  main ingredients of the framework, from the formulation of
          the  problem  to  the  appropriate  computational techniques to
          study  these  binary systems. In addition, we present numerical
          results of the construction of initial data sets and evolutions
          that demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.

          Title:  The Search for other Earths: limits on the giant planet
          orbits that allow habitable terrestrial planets to form
          Authors: Sean N. Raymond
          Comments: Accepted by ApJ Letters
          Gas  giant  planets  are far easier than terrestrial planets to
          detect  around  other  stars, and are thought to form much more
          quickly  than  terrestrial planets. Thus, in systems with giant
          planets,  the  late  stages of terrestrial planet formation are
          strongly  affected  by  the  giant planets' dynamical presence.
          Observations of giant planet orbits may therefore constrain the
          systems  that  can  harbor  potentially  habitable,  Earth-like
          planets.  We  present  results  of  460  N-body  simulations of
          terrestrial  accretion  from  a  disk  of  Moon-  to Mars-sized
          planetary embryos. We systematically vary the orbital semimajor
          axis  of  a Jupiter-mass giant planet between 1.6 and 6 AU, and
          eccentricity  between  0  and  0.4.  We  find that for Sun-like
          stars,  giant  planets inside roughly 2.5 AU inhibit the growth
          of  0.3  Earth-mass  planets  in the habitable zone. If planets
          accrete  water  from  volatile-rich embryos past 2-2.5 AU, then
          water-rich  habitable  planets  can  only  form in systems with
          giant  planets  beyond  3.5  AU. Giant planets with significant
          orbital   eccentricities   inhibit  both  accretion  and  water
          delivery.  The  majority  of  the current sample of extra-solar
          giant planets appears unlikely to form habitable planets.

          Title:   The  Evolution  of  Outflow-Envelope  Interactions  in
          Low-Mass Protostars
          Authors: Hector G. Arce, Anneila I. Sargent
          Comments: 36 pages of text and tables, 8 jpg figures
          We   present  multi-line  and  continuum  observations  of  the
          circumstellar  environment  within  10^4  AU  of  a  sample  of
          protostars  to investigate how the effects of outflows on their
          immediate  environment  changes  over  time. 12CO(1-0) emission
          probes the high-velocity molecular outflows near the protostars
          and  demonstrate  that  the outflow opening angle widens as the
          nascent  star  evolves.  Maps  of  the  13CO(1-0) and HCO+(1-0)
          outflow   emission  show  that  protostellar  winds  erode  the
          circumstellar  envelope  through  the  entrainment of the outer
          envelope  gas.  The  spatial  and  velocity distribution of the
          dense circumstellar envelope, as well as its mass, is traced by
          the  C18O(1-0) emission and also displays evolutionary changes.
          We  show  that  outflows  are  largely  responsible  for  these
          changes,  and  propose  an empirical model for the evolution of
          outflow-envelope   interactions.   In  addition,  some  of  the
          outflows   in   our   sample  appear  to  affect  the  chemical
          composition  of the surrounding environment, enhancing the HCO+
          abundance.  Overall,  our  results confirm that outflows play a
          major  role  in the star formation process through their strong
          physical  and chemical impacts on the environments of the young
          protostars.

          Authors: G. Burbidge, E.M. Burbidge, H.C. Arp, W.M. Napier
          Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table
          It  is  shown  that all of the 32 point X-ray sources which lie
          within  about  10'  of the centre of nearby galaxies, and which
          have so far been optically identified are high redshift objects
          - AGN or QSOs. Thus the surface density of these QSOs p similar
          or  equal  to  0.1  per  square  arc  minute. Some of them were
          originally  discovered  as  X-ray  sources  and  classified  as
          ultraluminous  X-ray  sources  (ULXs),  nearly all of which lie
          near  the  centers of active galaxies. We demonstrate that this
          concentration  around  galactic  nuclei  is of high statistical
          significance:  the  probabiliy  that p that they are accidental
          lies in the range one in a thousand to one in ten thousand, and
          apparently this excess cannot be accounted for by microlensing.

          Astrophysical Journal
          We  present  the first high time-resolution simultaneous X-ray,
          ultraviolet,  and  optical  observations  of X-ray bursts in UY
          Vol,  the  optical counterpart of the low mass X-ray binary EXO
          0748-676,   obtained  with  RXTE,  HST,  and  Gemini-S.  Strong
          reprocessed signals are present in the ultraviolet (a factor of
          4) and optical (a factor of 2.5). These signals are lagged with
          respect to the X-rays and appear significantly smeared as well.
          The   addition  of  far-ultraviolet  coverage  for  one  burst,
          together  with  the  high  quality  of  the dataset, allow much
          tighter  constraints  upon  the temperature and geometry of the
          reprocessing  region  than  previously  possible. A single-zone
          black body reprocessing model for this burst suggests a rise in
          temperatures  during  the  burst  from 18,000 to 35,000K and an
          emitting  area  comparable to that expected for the disk and/or
          irradiated  companion  star. The lags, a mean of 4.0s and range
          of  2.5s, are consistent with those expected within the binary.
          The  single-zone black body model cannot reproduce the ratio of
          optical  to  ultraviolet  flux  during  the burst, however. The
          discrepancy,  corresponding  to  underpredicting the optical by
          more  than  a  factor  of  two, seems too large to explain with
          deviations  from  a  local  black body spectrum and more likely
          indicates   that  a  range  of  reprocessing  temperatures  are
          required,  as  would  be  expected,  with  cooler  regions  not
          contributing  to  the  UV.  Comparable results are derived from
          other  bursts,  and  in  particular  the  lag and smearing both
          appear  shorter  when the companion star is on the near side of
          the disk as predicted. The burst observed by HST also yielded a
          spectrum of the reprocessed light. [Abridged]

          Authors: H. Tovmassian, M. Plionis, J.P. Torres-Papaqui
          Comments: accepted for publication in AA
          We  use  the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift catalogue
          to  look  for  galaxies  with accordant redshifts in the nearby
          environment  (up  to ~2 Mpc) of 15 Hickson Compact Groups (HCG)
          and  7  more HCG+environment from the literature. We find that:
          (a)   HCG's   tend  to  be  aligned  with  the  overall  galaxy
          distribution   in   their   ~1   Mpc   environment,   (b)   the
          well-established orientation effect by which the group velocity
          dispersion  correlates  with group axial ratio, is present also
          in   the  HCG+environment  systems,  (c)  the  radial  velocity
          dispersion  of the HCG+environment systems and of ordinary poor
          groups  only weakly depends on the group richness, (d) the mean
          absolute  K-band  magnitude of E/S0 galaxies in HCGs is similar
          to  that  in ordinary poor groups, and is brighter than that of
          isolated  E/S0's,  indicating  that  they  were  formed  by the
          merging of two galaxies of similar luminosity, (e) the fraction
          of E/S0 galaxies in these HCGs depends only weakly on the group
          richness  and  velocity dispersion, (f) the fraction of AGNs is
          similar  in the HCGs and their close environment, while that of
          starbursts  is  significantly  higher  in  the  HCGs,  (g)  the
          fraction  of  AGNs  and  starbursts is anti-correlated with the
          velocity    dispersion    of   the   HCG+environment   systems.
          Furthermore,  the  observed  fractions of early-type and active
          galaxies  as well as their correlations with the group velocity
          dispersion  suggests  a  picture  by which nuclear activity and
          galaxy  transformation  by  merging  is instigated by effective
          gravitational   interactions  in  the  low-velocity  dispersion
          groups,   which   then  dynamically  evolve  via  virialization
          processes to higher velocity dispersion groups, which thus have
          a higher fraction of early-type galaxies.

          The  protostellar  jets  driven  by  the formation of the first
          stars  are  studied  by  using  MHD  nested  grid  simulations.
          Starting  from  a  slowly rotating spherical cloud of 5.1 times
          10^4  Msun permeated by a uniform magnetic field, we follow the
          evolution  from  the central number density n = 10^3 cm^-3 to n
          simeq  10^23  cm^-3.  We  calculate  four models that differ in
          initial magnetic field strengths and angular velocities. In all
          models,  protostars  of  simeq 10^-3 Msun are formed at n simeq
          10^22 cm^-3 in accordance with one-dimensional calculations. By
          this epoch, the magnetic flux density is amplified by 10 orders
          of  magnitude  from the initial value. Consequently, the formed
          protostar  possesses  the magnetic field of \sim 10^6 G that is
          much  larger than the flux density of the present counterparts,
          reflecting the fact that the dissipation of a magnetic field is
          ineffective  in  primordial gas clouds. If the initial magnetic
          field  B  > 10^-9 (n/10^3 cm^-3)^2/3 G, the protostellar jet is
          launched and its velocities reaches \sim 70 km s^-1 by the time
          the  protostellar  mass  becomes  (4-6) times 10^-3 Msun, and a
          fraction  (3-10%) of the accreting matter is blown off from the
          central  region.  Owing to the interaction of these ejecta with
          surrounding  matter,  expanding  bow shocks are created at both
          heads  of  the  jet.  If  this  jet  continues to sweep out the
          surrounding  gas  that otherwise accretes onto the central star
          or  circumstellar disk, the final mass of the first star can be
          substantially  reduced.  In  addition, dense post-shock regions
          behind  the  bow  shocks  are  expected to promote the chemical
          reactions (formation of H_2 and HD), and this provides possible
          environments  for  subsequent  low-mass  star  formation in the
          early universe.

          Title:  The non-constant slope of the CIV Baldwin effect in NGC
          4151

          Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          The relationship between the emission line equivalent width and
          the  continuum  luminosity, so called the Baldwin effect, plays
          an  important role in studying the broad line region physics of
          AGNs.  Using  the archived ultraviolet spectra obtained by IUE,
          HST  and  HUT  in  1978-2002, we investigated the intrinsic CIV
          Baldwin  effect  of  a  best-studied Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151.
          Both its continuum flux and CIV emission line flux varied about
          two orders of magnitude in more than two decades, making it one
          of  the  best  targets  for studying the slope variation of the
          Baldwin  effect.  We  fitted  the  CIV  line profile of the 490
          archived UV spectra of NGC 4151 with a same model consisting of
          a few Gaussian components, and derived the slope in the log-log
          plot  for  the  total  flux of CIV emission line against the UV
          continuum  flux  in  different observation epochs.We found that
          the  slope  is  not constant for NGC 4151, varying from 0.58 in
          the  highest  flux  epoch to 0.83 in the lowest flux epoch. The
          slope  evidently  decreases  as  the  continuum flux increases,
          which  reinforces  the  previous  findings  of the non-constant
          slope  in  the  H_beta  Baldwin  effect of NGC 5548 and the CIV
          Baldwin  effect  of  Fairall 9. Our result suggests that such a
          non-constant  slope  may  not  be unusual for AGNs. Its physics
          origin   is   probably  related  to  the  different  non-linear
          responses  of  the  emission  line  to  the  variable  ionizing
          continuum  caused by the different accretion modes at different
          luminosity  levels.  We  briefly discuss the effects of various
          absorption  components  in the CIV line profile of NGC 4151 and
          argue  that  the  slope  variation  is not mainly driven by the
          absorption  effect.  Intensive,  long-term  and high resolution
          spectral  observations  of strongly variable AGNs in the future
          are needed to confirm our result.

          We  present  a  new  sample  of  bright  galaxy pairs extracted
          applying  an objective selection code to UZC catalog.The sample
          is  volume  limited  to  M$_{zw}$  = -18.9 +5 log ${\it h}$ and
          contains   89   galaxy   pairs.We   analyze   the  kinematical,
          morphological   and   photometrical   properties   of  galaxies
          belonging  to this sample. We show that velocity separation, $|
          \Delta v_{r} |$, between pair members is significantly lower in
          spiral  type  (S+S)  pairs  than  in early-type (E+E) and mixed
          (E+S) pairs.This indicates that truly isolated galaxy pairs are
          more  likely  to  be  found  among  S+S  pairs.  We  show  that
          ellipticals  are  rare  and  underluminous  in  B and that late
          spirals  (T  $\ge$  4)  are  overluminous.  We confirm that the
          formation  of  bright  ellipticals  is  a  phenomenon linked to
          group/cluster  environment, while galaxy-galaxy interaction may
          enhance  blue luminosity of disk galaxies through SF phenomena.
          This  last statement is supported by the presence of strong FIR
          emission  from  early  spirals  in  this sample and by the high
          frequency of AGN/SB phenomenon, revealed mainly in pairs of low
          relative  radial  velocity  separation  and  showing  signs  of
          interaction.

          The  determination of the central black hole mass is crucial to
          the  understanding  of  AGN  physics.  In this paper we briefly
          review  some  methods  that  are currently used to estimate the
          black  hole  mass  of  AGNs.  Particularly  we  demonstrate the
          importance of two correlations: one between the black hole mass
          and the stellar velocity dispersion and another one between the
          broad   line  region  (BLR)  size  and  the  optical  continuum
          luminosity.  Besides applying these relations in deriving black
          hole  masses  of  various  types  of AGNs, we also employed the
          fundamental  plane  of  elliptical  galaxies  to  estimate  the
          central velocity dispersions of AGN host galaxies, and then the
          black  hole  masses  of  AGNs  including  BL  Lac  objects.  In
          addition, we derived another empirical relation between the BLR
          size and H_beta emission line luminosity from AGNs with the BLR
          size measured by reverberation mapping studies, and argued that
          more  accurate  black  hole masses of extremely radio-loud AGNs
          could  be  obtained  with it than using the usual R-L_{5100\AA}
          relation  because  of  the  jet  contribution  to  the  optical
          continuum.   Finally  we  pointed  out  that  black  hole  mass
          estimation is very much helpful to determine the accretion rate
          and understand the accretion process in AGNs.

          Title: First evidence for molecular interfaces between outflows
          and ambient cloud in high-mass star forming regions?
          Authors: C. Codella, S. Viti, D.A. Williams, R. Bachiller
          Comments:   Accepted   for  publication  in  The  Astrophysical
          Journals Letters (8 pages, 3 figures)
          We  present new observations of the CepA-East region of massive
          star   formation  and  describe  an  extended  and  dynamically
          distinct  feature  not  previously  recognised. This feature is
          present  in  emission  from  H2CS,  OCS, CH3OH, and HDO at -5.5
          km/s, but is not traced by conventional tracers of star forming
          regions  H2S,  SO2,  SO,  CS.  The feature is extended up to at
          least  0.1  pc.  We show that the feature is neither a hot core
          nor a shocked outflow. However, the chemistry of the feature is
          consistent  with predictions of a model of an eroding interface
          between  a  fast  wind and a dense core; mixing between the two
          media occurs in the interface on a timescale of 10-50 years. If
          these  observations  are  confirmed  by  detailed  maps  and by
          detections in species also predicted to be abundant (e.g. HCO+,
          H2CO,  and  NH3)  this  feature would be the first detection of
          such  an  interface  in  regions  of massive star formation. An
          important  implication  of  the  model  is  that  a significant
          reservoir  of  sulfur in grain mantles is required to be in the
          form of OCS.

          In  order  to  show  the  importance of high spatial resolution
          observations   of   extra-galactic  sources  when  compared  to
          observations  obtained  with  larger  apertures such as ISO, we
          present  N-band  spectra  (8-13  um) of some locations in three
          starburst  galaxies.  In particular, the two galactic nuclei of
          the  spiral  galaxy  NGC3256, the compact IR supernebula in the
          dwarf  galaxy  IIZw40  and  the  two  brightest IR knots in the
          central  starburst  of  the  WR galaxy He2-10. The spectra have
          been  obtained  with  TIMMI2  on  the  ESO  3.6m  telescope. An
          inventory  of  the  spectra  in  terms of atomic fine-structure
          lines and molecular bands is presented. We show the great value
          of   these   high   spatial  resolution  data  at  constraining
          properties such as the extinction in the mid-IR, metallicity or
          stellar  content  (age,  IMF,  etc.).  Regarding  this, we have
          constrained  the  stellar  content  of  the  IR compact knot in
          IIZw40  by  using  the  mid-IR fine-structure lines and setting
          restrictions  on  the  nebular  geometry.  Considering  the PAH
          bands, we have constructed a new mid-/far-IR diagnostic diagram
          based   on  the  11.2  um  PAH  and  continuum,  accessible  to
          ground-based   observations.  Finally,  we  find  a  dependence
          between  the  presence or non-presence of PAHs and the hardness
          of  the  radiation field as measured by the [SIV]/[NeII] ratio.
          In  particular,  sources  with  PAH  emission have in general a
          [SIV]/[NeII]  ratio < 0.35. We investigate possible origins for
          this  relation  and conclude that it does not necessarily imply
          PAH  destruction,  but  could also be explained by the PAH-dust
          competition for FUV photons.

          We  present  the  detection  of  infall,  rotation  and outflow
          kinematic  signatures  towards  both a protostellar source, VLA
          1623  and  what  was initially thought to be a pre-protostellar
          core,  SM1N,  in  the  rho-Ophiuchus  A  region.  The kinematic
          signatures  of  early star formation were detected in the dense
          molecular  gas  surrounding  the  embedded  sources  using high
          signal-to-noise  millimeter  and  submillimeter  data. Centroid
          velocity  maps  made  with HCO+ J=4->3 and J=1->0 line emission
          exhibit  the blue bulge signature of infall, which is predicted
          to be seen when infall motion dominates over rotational motion.
          Further  evidence  for  infalling gas is found in the HCO+ blue
          asymmetric  line  profiles and red asymmetric opacity profiles.
          We   also  performed  CO  J=3->2  and  J=1->0  observations  to
          determine  the  direction, orientation, and extent of molecular
          outflows,  and  report  the  discovery of a new bipolar outflow
          possibly driven by SM1N.

          individually  to  constraining  the  physical parameters of the
          system  we  are  investigating.  To do this, we present a study
          involving  the  technique of Singular Value Decomposition using
          as  a  simple  example  a  detached eclipsing binary system. We
          intend to apply an extension of this technique to asteroseismic

          The structure and kinematics of ionized gas in the star-forming
          region  in the BCD galaxy VIIZw403 (UGC6456) are analyzed using
          observations  with the SCORPIO focal reducer on the 6-m Special
          Astrophysical  Observatory  telescope  in  three  modes: direct
          imaging  (in  the  H-alpha, [OIII], and [SII] lines), long-slit
          spectroscopy,  and  spectroscopy  with  a  scanning Fabry-Perot
          interferometer.  In addition to the previously known bright HII
          regions  and  the  faint  giant  ring that surrounds the entire
          star-forming  region, many new faint diffuse and arc structures
          have  been  detected. Fine structure of the giant ring has been
          revealed.  We  do not confirm the previously detected expansion
          of  the  bright shells around young stellar associations with a
          velocity  of  50-70  km/s.  We  have  estimated their expansion
          velocities  to  be no higher than 15-20 km/s; the corresponding
          kinematic  age,  no  younger than 3-4 Myr, agrees well with the
          age  of  the  compact  OB  associations  related  to  them.  We
          associate the faint extended filamentary and diffuse regions of
          ionized  gas  identified in nearly the entire central region of
          the  galaxy  and  the  giant  HII  ring with the older (10 Myr)
          stellar   population   of   the  most  recent  starburst.  Weak
          high-velocity  [OIII]  and  H-alpha  line wings (up to 300 km/s
          from  the  line center) have been detected in the brightest HII
          region.  Such  velocities  have been observed in the galaxy for
          the  first  time.  The  previously published H-alpha luminosity
          measurements for the galaxy are refined.

          Black Hole Candidate SWIFT J1753.5-0127

          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  report  on simultaneous XMM-Newton and RXTE observations of
          the  stellar-mass  black hole candidate SWIFT J1753.5-0127. The
          source was observed in the "low-hard" state, during the decline
          of a hard ouburst. The inner accretion disk is commonly assumed
          to  be  radially  truncated  in  this  state,  and  it has been
          suggested  that  this property may be tied to the production of
          steady,  compact  jets.  Fits  to  the  X-ray  spectra of SWIFT
          J1753.5-0127  with  a  number of simple models clearly reveal a
          cool  (kT  =  0.2  keV)  accretion  disk. The disk component is
          required at more than the 8 sigma level of confidence. Although
          estimates  of  inner disk radii based on continuum spectroscopy
          are  subject to considerable uncertainty, fits with a number of
          models  suggest  that  the  disk is observed at or close to the
          innermost stable circular orbit. Recently, an observation of GX
          339-4  revealed  a  disk  extending  to  the  innermost  stable
          circular  orbit  at  L_X  =  0.05 L_Edd; our results from SWIFT
          J1753.5-0127  extend  this  finding  down to L_X = 0.003 (d/8.5
          kpc)^2  (M/10  Msun)  L_Edd.  We discuss our results within the
          context  of  low-luminosity  accretion flow models and disk-jet
          connections.

          Comments:  11  pages,  7  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We  present  our  findings based on a detailed analysis for the
          binaries  of  the Hyades, in which the masses of the components
          are  well  known.  We  fit the models of components of a binary
          system  to  the observations so as to give the observed total V
          and   B-V  of  that  system  and  the  observed  slope  of  the
          main-sequence  in  the  corresponding  parts.  According to our
          findings,  there  is  a  very definite relationship between the
          mixing-length  parameter  and  the  stellar  mass.  The fitting
          formula  for  this  relationship  can be given as $alpha = 9.19
          (M/M_sun-0.74)^{0.053}-6.65$, which is valid for stellar masses
          greater  than  0.77  M_sun.  While  no  strict  information  is
          gathered  for  the  chemical  composition  of the cluster, as a
          result  of  degeneracy  in  the  colour-magnitude  diagram,  by
          adopting  Z=0.033 and using models for the components of 70 Tau
          and  theta^2  Tau  we find the hydrogen abundance to be X=0.676
          and  the  age  to  be  670 Myr. If we assume that Z=0.024, then
          X=0.718  and  the  age  is 720 Myr. Our findings concerning the
          mixing  length  parameter  are  valid  for  both  sets  of  the
          solution.  For both components of the active binary system V818
          Tau,  the  differences between radii of the models with Z=0.024
          and   the  observed  radii  are  only  about  4  percent.  More
          generally, the effective temperatures of the models of low mass
          stars  in the binary systems studied are in good agreement with
          those determined by spectroscopic methods.

          Predehl
          Comments: 10 pages, accepted by ApJ
          Using Chandra observations we have measured the energy-resolved
          dust-scattered  X-ray  halo  around  the  low-mass X-ray binary
          GX5-1, which shows signs of both singly- and multiply-scattered
          X-rays. We compared the observed X-ray halo at various energies
          to  predictions  from  a  range of dust models. These fits used
          both  smoothly-distributed  dust  as  well  as  dust in clumped
          clouds, with CO and 21 cm observations helping to determine the
          position  of  the clouds along the line of sight. We found that
          the BARE-GR-B model of Zubko, Dwek & Arendt (2004 generally led
          to  the best results, although inadequacies in both the overall
          model  and  the  data limit our conclusions. We also found that
          the  composite  dust  models  of  Zubko,  Dwek & Arendt (2004),
          especially  the  ``no  carbon''  models,  gave  uniformly  poor
          results.  Although  models  using cloud positions and densities
          derived  naively  from  CO  and  21 cm data gave generally poor
          results,  plausible  adjustments to the distance of the largest
          cloud  and  the mass of a cloud in the expanding 3 kpc Arm lead
          to significantly improved fits. We suggest that combining X-ray
          halo,  CO,  and 21 cm observations will be a fruitful method to
          improve  our  understanding  of both the gas and dust phases of
          the interstellar medium.

          Title: Transport on Adaptive Random Lattices
          Authors: Jelle Ritzerveld, Vincent Icke
          Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures, submitted to PRE
          Subj-class:   Statistical  Mechanics;  Mesoscopic  Systems  and
          Quantum Hall Effect; Computational Physics
          In  this  paper,  we  present  a new method for the solution of
          those  generic  transport  processes that may be described by a
          Master Equation. We base our algorithm on a Markov process on a
          Voronoi-Delaunay  grid,  a nonperiodic lattice which is derived
          from  a  random  point  process  that  is  chosen  to optimally
          represent  certain  properties  of the medium through which the
          transport  occurs. Our grid is locally translation and rotation
          invariant in the mean. We illustrate our approach by means of a
          particular  example,  in  which  the  expectation  value of the
          length  of a grid line corresponds to the local mean free path.
          In  this example, the lattice is a direct representation of the
          `free  path  space'  of  the medium. Subsequently, transport is
          defined  as  simply moving particles from one node to the next,
          interactions   taking  place  at  each  point.  We  derive  the
          statistical  properties of such lattices, describe the limiting
          behaviour, and show how interactions are incorporated as global
          coefficients.  Two elementary transport problems are discussed:
          that   of  free  ballistic  transport,  and  the  transport  of
          particles  through  a  scattering  medium.  We  also  mention a
          combination  of  these  two.  We  discuss the efficiency of our
          method, showing that it is much faster than most other methods,
          because  the  operation count does not scale with the number of
          sources.  We  test  our  method by focusing on the transport of
          ionizing  radiation  through a static medium, and show that the
          computed  results  for the classical test case of an ionization
          front  expanding  in  a homogeneous medium agree perfectly with
          the analytic solution. We finish by illustrating the efficiency
          and  flexibility of our method with the results of a simulation
          of  the  reionization  of  the  large  scale  structure  of the
          Universe.

          Title:   Post-starburst--AGN   Connection:  Spatially  Resolved
          Spectroscopy of Hdelta-Strong AGNs
          Authors: Tomotsugu Goto (JAXA)
          Comments: MNRAS in press
          Ever since the co-existence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN)
          and  a starburst was observationally discovered, there has been
          a  significant  controversy  over  whether  there is a physical
          connection between starbursts and AGNs. If yes, it is a subject
          of interest to reveal which one triggers another. Here we bring
          a  unique  insight onto the subject by identifying 840 galaxies
          with  both a post-starburst signature (strong Balmer absorption
          lines)  and  an  AGN  (based on the emission line ratio). These
          poststarburst-AGNs  account for the 4.2% of all the galaxies in
          a volume-limited sample. The presence of a post-starburst phase
          with  an  active  AGN  itself is of importance, suggesting that
          AGNs may outlive starbursts in the starburst-AGN connection. In
          addition,  we have performed spatially resolved spectroscopy of
          three   of  our  poststarbusrst-AGN  galaxies,  obtaining  some
          evidence  that  the post-starburst region is more extended, but
          sharply  centred  around  the central AGN, confirming a spatial
          connection between the post-starburst and the AGN.

          Authors: Duncan A. Forbes
          Comments:  8  pages,  6  figures, Globular Clusters - Guides to
          Galaxies conference
          We  first  discuss  recent  progress  in  using  the  Milky Way
          globular  cluster  (GC)  system  as a `test-bed' for properties
          derived  from integrated spectra and stellar population models.
          Standard   techniques   may   give   rise  to  spuriously  high
          alpha-element  ratios  at  low  metallicities.  We then discuss
          evidence  for  early  epoch  (z  > 2) formation for most GCs in
          galaxies  today.  Recent  accretions  of  GCs  (and  their host
          galaxy)  make  a small contribution but recent mergers form few
          if  any  new  GCs  in  today's  elliptical  galaxies. The early
          formation  of  metal-poor  GCs  and  the  bimodality seen in GC
          specific  frequency requires a `truncation' which may be due to
          reionization.

          Astrophysical Journal
          We  measure  Doppler shifts of interstellar absorption lines in
          HST/STIS   spectra   of  individual  star  clusters  in  nearby
          UV-selected galaxies. Values for systemic velocities, which are
          needed   to   quantify  outflow  speeds,  are  taken  from  the
          literature,   and   verified  with  stellar  lines.  We  detect
          outflowing gas in eight of 17 galaxies via low-ionization lines
          (e.g.,  CII, SiII, AlII), which trace cold and/or warm gas. The
          starbursts  in  our  sample are intermediate in luminosity (and
          mass) to dwarf galaxies and luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs),
          and  we  confirm  that  their outflow speeds (ranging from -100
          km/s  to  nearly  -520  km/s  with an accuracy of ~80 km/s) are
          intermediate  to  those previously measured in dwarf starbursts
          and  LIRGs.  We  do  not  detect the outflow in high-ionization
          lines (such as CIV or SiIV); higher quality data will be needed
          to   empirically   establish   how  velocities  vary  with  the
          ionization  state  of  the  outflow.  We  do  verify  that  the
          low-ionization  UV  lines  and optical NaI doublet give roughly
          consistent  outflow  velocities  solidifying  an important link
          between  studies of galactic winds at low and high redshift. To
          obtain  higher  signal-to-noise,  we  create  a  local  average
          composite  spectrum,  and  compare it to the high-z Lyman Break
          composite spectrum. Surprisingly, the low-ionization lines show
          similar  outflow  velocities  in  the two samples. We attribute
          this  to a combination of weighting towards higher luminosities
          in  the  local  composite,  as  well  as  both samples being on
          average  brighter than the ``turnover'' luminosity in the v-SFR
          relation.

          Comments: 12 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          We  present  methodology  to derive high-precision estimates of
          the   fundamental   parameters  of  double-lined  spectroscopic
          binaries.  We  apply  the  methods  to  the  case  study of the
          double-lined  beta Cephei star beta Centauri. We also present a
          detailed  analysis  of  beta Centauri's line-profile variations
          caused  by  its  oscillations.  We  point out that a systematic
          error  in  the  orbital  amplitudes, and any quantities derived
          from them, occurs if the radial velocities of blended component
          lines   are   computed  without  spectral  disentangling.  This
          technique  is  an essential ingredient in the derivation of the
          physical  parameters  if  the  goal is to obtain a precision of
          only a few percent. We have devised iteration schemes to obtain
          the  orbital  elements  for  systems  whose  lines  are blended
          throughout  the orbital cycle. We find the following parameters
          for  beta  Cen:  $M_1=10.7\pm 0.1 M_\odot$ and $M_2=10.3\pm 0.1
          M_\odot$, an age of $(14.1\pm 0.6)\times 10^6$ years. We deduce
          two oscillation frequencies for the broad-lined primary of beta
          Centauri  with  degrees  higher  than  2.  We  propose that our
          iteration  schemes  be  used  in  any future derivations of the
          spectroscopic  orbital parameters of double-lined binaries with
          blended   component   lines   to  which  disentangling  can  be
          successfully applied.

          Workshop. 10 pages, 3 Figures, 1 Table
          The  Laser  Interferometer  Space Antenna (LISA) guarantees the
          detection  of  gravitational  waves  by monitoring a handful of
          known   nearby   galactic   binary   systems,   the   so-called
          ``verification   binaries''.   We  consider  the  most  updated
          information  on  the  source  parameters  for  the  thirty more
          promising  verification  binaries. We investigate which of them
          are  indeed  guaranteed  sources  for  LISA  and  estimate  the
          accuracy  of  the  additional information that can be extracted
          during  the mission. Our analysis considers the two independent
          Michelson  outputs  that  can  be  synthesised  from  the  LISA
          constellation,  and  we  model the LISA transfer function using
          the rigid adiabatic approximation. We carry out extensive Monte
          Carlo  simulations  to explore the dependency of our results on
          unknown  or  poorly constrained source parameters. We find that
          four  sources -- RXJ0806.3+1527, V407 Vul, ES Cet and AM CVn --
          are   clearly   detectable   in   one   year   of  observation;
          RXJ0806.3+1527  should  actually  be  observable in less than a
          week.  For  these sources LISA will also provide information on
          yet  unknown  parameters  with an error between approximately 1
          percent  and  10  percent. Four additional binary systems -- HP
          Lib,  4U  1820-30,  WZ  Sge  and KPD 1930+2752 -- might also be
          marginally detectable.

          The   recent  completion  and  operation  of  the  High  Energy
          Stereoscopic System, an array of ground based imaging Cherenkov
          telescopes,   has   provided   a   survey   with  unprecedented
          sensitivity  of the inner part of the Galaxy and revealed a new
          population  of  very high energy gamma-rays sources emitting at
          E$>$100  GeV. Most of them were reported to have no known radio
          or X-ray counterpart and hypothesised to be representative of a
          new  class of dark nucleonic cosmic sources. In fact, very high
          energy gamma-rays with energies E $>$ 10$^{11}$ eV are the best
          proof  of  non-thermal  processes in the universe and provide a
          direct in-site view of matter-radiation interaction at energies
          by far greater than producible in ground accelerators. At lower
          energy  INTEGRAL  has  regularly  observed  the entire galactic
          plane  during the first 1000 day in orbit providing a survey in
          the 20-100 keV range resulted in a soft gamma-ray sky populated
          with  more  than  200  sources,  most  of  them  being galactic
          binaries,  either  BHC  or  NS. Very recently, the INTEGRAL new
          source   IGR  J18135-1751  has  been  identified  as  the  soft
          gamma-ray  counterpart  of HESS J1813-178 and AXJ1838.0-0655 as
          the X/gamma-ray counterpart of HESS J1837-069.
          Detection  of  non thermal radio, X and gamma-ray emission from
          these  TeV  sources  is  very important to discriminate between
          various  emitting  scenarios  and, in turn, to fully understand
          their nature.
          The  implications  of  these  new  findings  in the high energy
          Galactic population will be addressed.

          Comments: 18 pages, 17 figures. Accepted by MNRAS
          We  present  radiative  transfer  models  of  the circumstellar
          environment  of  classical  T Tauri stars, concentrating on the
          formation  of  the  H-alpha  emission. The wide variety of line
          profiles seen in observations are indicative of both inflow and
          outflow, and we therefore employ a circumstellar structure that
          includes  both  magnetospheric  accretion  and  a disc wind. We
          perform  systematic  investigations of the model parameters for
          the   wind   and  the  magnetosphere  to  search  for  possible
          geometrical  and physical conditions which lead to the types of
          profiles  seen  in observations. We find that the hybrid models
          can   reproduce  the  wide  range  of  profile  types  seen  in
          observations,  and  that the most common profile types observed
          occupy  a large volume of parameter space. Conversely, the most
          infrequently  observed  profile  morphologies  require  a  very
          specific  set  of models parameters. We find our model profiles
          are  consistent  with the canonical value of the mass-loss rate
          to   mass-accretion   rate  ratio  (mu=0.1)  found  in  earlier
          magneto-hydrodynamic  calculations  and  observations,  but the
          models  with  0.05<mu<0.2  are  still  in  accord with observed
          H-alpha  profiles.  We investigate the wind contribution to the
          line profile as a function of model parameters, and examine the
          reliability of H-alpha as a mass accretion diagnostic. Finally,
          we  examine  the  H-alpha  spectroscopic classification used by
          Reipurth et. al, and discuss the basic physical conditions that
          are required to reproduce the profiles in each classified type.

          We  investigate  the  relation  between X-ray nuclear emission,
          optical  emission line luminosities and black hole masses for a
          sample  of  47  Seyfert  galaxies.  The  sample, which has been
          selected  from  the  Palomar  optical  spectroscopic  survey of
          nearby  galaxies (Ho, Filippenko & Sargent 1997), covers a wide
          range of nuclear powers, from L_{2-10 keV} ~ 10^{43} erg/s down
          to  very  low luminosities (L_{2-10 keV} ~ 10^{38} erg/s). Best
          available  data  from  Chandra, XMM-Newton and, in a few cases,
          ASCA  observations  have  been  considered.  Thanks to the good
          spatial  resolution  available  from  these  observations and a
          proper modeling of the various spectral components, it has been
          possible  to  obtain  accurate  nuclear  X-ray luminosities not
          contaminated  by  off-nuclear  sources and/or diffuse emission.
          X-ray luminosities have then been corrected taking into account
          the  likely  candidate  Compton thick sources, which are a high
          fraction  (> 30%) among type 2 Seyferts in our sample. The main
          result   of  this  study  is  that  we  confirm  strong  linear
          correlations  between  2-10  keV,  [OIII]\lambda5007, H_{alpha}
          luminosities  which show the same slope as quasars and luminous
          Seyfert  galaxies, independent of the level of nuclear activity
          displayed. Moreover, despite the wide range of Eddington ratios
          (L/L_{Edd}) tested here (six orders of magnitude, from 0.1 down
          to  ~  10^{-7}),  no  correlation is found between the X-ray or
          optical emission line luminosities and the black hole mass. Our
          results   suggest   that  Seyfert  nuclei  in  our  sample  are
          consistent  with  being  a scaled-down version of more luminous
          AGN.

          alpha  to  iron  element ratio relative to solar abundances and
          follows  the  same  relation  as typical starbursts between its
          properties (luminosity, size, and temperature) and those of the
          starburst galaxy (star formation rate, dust temperature, galaxy
          mass).  These  results are consistent with the X-ray gas having
          been  produced  by  shocks  driven by a galactic superwind. The
          FUSE  observations  of  VV  114 show strong, broad interstellar
          absorption     lines     with    a    pronounced    blueshifted
          component(similar  to  what  is  seen in LBGs). This implies an
          outflow  of material moving at 300-400 km/s relative to VV 114.
          The properties of the strong OVI absorption line are consistent
          with  radiative  cooling  at  the  interface  between  the  hot
          outrushing  gas  seen in X-rays and the cooler material seen in
          the  other  outflowing  ions in the FUSE data. We show that the
          wind  in  VV114  has not created a ``tunnel'' that enables more
          than  a  small fraction (< few percent) of the ionizing photons
          from  VV114  to escape into the IGM. Taken together, these data
          provide  a  more  complete physical basis for understanding the
          outflows  that  seem  to  be generic in LBGs. This will lead to
          improved  insight  into the role that such outflows play in the
          evolution of galaxies and the inter-galactic medium.

          Title: New Analytical Formula for Supercritical Accretion Flows
          Authors: K. Watarai
          Comments:  14 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We  examine  a  new  family  of  global  analytic solutions for
          optically   thick   accretion   disks,   which   includes   the
          supercritical  accretion regime. We found that the ratio of the
          advection  cooling  rate, $Q_{\rm adv}$, to the viscous heating
          rate,  $Q_{\rm vis}$, i.e., $f=Q_{\rm adv}/Q_{\rm vis}$, can be
          represented  by  an analytical form dependent on the radius and
          the  mass  accretion  rate.  The  new analytic solutions can be
          characterized  by  the photon-trapping radius, $\rtrap$, inside
          which the accretion time is less than the photon diffusion time
          in  the vertical direction; the nature of the solutions changes
          significantly  as  this  radius is crossed. Inside the trapping
          radius,
          $f$  approaches  $f  \propto  r^0$,  which  corresponds  to the
          advection-dominated  limit  ($f  \sim  1$), whereas outside the
          trapping  radius,  the  radial  dependence of $f$ changes to $f
          \propto      r^{-2}$,      which     corresponds     to     the
          radiative-cooling-dominated  limit.  The analytical formula for
          $f$  derived  here smoothly connects these two regimes. The set
          of  new  analytic  solutions  reproduces  well  the global disk
          structure  obtained  by numerical integration over a wide range
          of  mass accretion rates, including the supercritical accretion
          regime.  In  particular, the effective temperature profiles for
          our  new  solutions  are  in good agreement with those obtained
          from  numerical  solutions.  Therefore,  the new solutions will
          provide a useful tool not only for evaluating the observational
          properties  of  accretion flows, but also for investigating the
          mass  evolution of black holes in the presence of supercritical
          accretion flows.

          Title:  Measurement  of  non-axisymmetry in centres of advanced
          mergers of galaxies
          Authors: Chanda J. Jog, Aparna Maybhate
          Comments:  14  pages,  3  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We  measure  the non-axisymmetry in the luminosity distribution
          in  the  inner  few  kpc of the remnants of advanced mergers of
          galaxies  with  a  view  to  understand  the  relaxation in the
          central regions. For this, we analyze the images from the 2MASS
          archival  data  for  a  selected sample of 12 merging galaxies,
          which  show signs of interaction but have a single nucleus. The
          central  regions  are  fitted  by  elliptical  isophotes  whose
          centres are allowed to vary to get the best fit. The centres of
          isophotes  show  a  striking  sloshing  pattern  with a spatial
          variation  of  up  to  20-30  %  within the central 1 kpc. This
          indicates mass asymmetry and a dynamically unrelaxed behaviour.
          Next,  we  Fourier-analyze  the galaxy images while keeping the
          centre  constant  and measure the deviation from axisymmetry in
          terms  of the fractional Fourier amplitudes (A_1, A_2 etc) as a
          function   of   radius.  All  mergers  show  a  high  value  of
          lopsidedness  (upto  A_1  ~  0.2) in the central 5 kpc. The m=2
          asymmetry  is even stronger, with values of A_2 upto ~ 0.3, and
          in   three  cases  these  are  shown  to  represent  bars.  The
          corresponding  values denoting non-axisymmetry in inner regions
          of  a  control sample of eight non-merger galaxies are found to
          be  several times smaller. Surprisingly, this central asymmetry
          is  seen  even  in mergers where the outer regions have relaxed
          into  a smooth elliptical-like r^{1/4} profile or a spiral-like
          exponential  profile. Thus the central asymmetry is long-lived,
          estimated  to  be  ~  1 Gyr, and hence lasts for over 100 local
          dynamical timescales. These central asymmetries are expected to
          play  a  key  role  in  the  future  dynamical evolution of the
          central  region  of a merger, and can help in feeding a central
          AGN.

          We  present  aperture-matched PSF-corrected BVi'z'JH photometry
          and  Bayesian  photometric redshifts (BPZ) for objects detected
          in  the  Hubble  Ultra  Deep  Field  (UDF),  8,042 of which are
          detected  at  the  10-sigma level (e.g., i'<29.01 or z'<28.43).
          Most  of  our  objects  are defined identically to those in the
          public     STScI     catalogs,     enabling     straightforward
          object-by-object  comparison.  We have combined detections from
          i',  z',  J+H, and B+V+i'+z' images into a single comprehensive
          segmentation map. Using a new program called SExSeg we are able
          to  force this segmentation map into SExtractor for photometric
          analysis.  The  resulting photometry is corrected for the wider
          NIC3  PSFs using our ColorPro software. We also correct for the
          ACS  z'-band  PSF halo. The NIC3 magnitudes are found to be too
          faint  relative  to  the  ACS  fluxes. Based on BPZ SED fits to
          objects  of know spectroscopic redshift, we derived corrections
          of  -0.30  +/-  0.03  mag in J and -0.18 +/- 0.04 mag in H. The
          offsets appear to be supported by a recent recalibration of the
          UDF  NIC3 images combined with non-linearity measured in NICMOS
          itself.  The  UDF  reveals  a  large  population  of faint blue
          galaxies   (presumably  young  starbursts),  bluer  than  those
          observed   in   the  original  Hubble  Deep  Fields  (HDF).  To
          accommodate  these  galaxies,  we  have added two new starburst
          templates  to  the SED library used in previous BPZ papers. The
          resulting  photometric  redshifts are accurate to within 0.04 *
          1+z_spec  out  to z < 6. Finally, we measure galaxy morphology,
          including   Sersic  index  and  asymmetry.  Our  full  catalog,

          Title:  The  N/O  Plateau of Blue Compact Galaxies: Monte Carlo
          Simulations of the Observed Scatter
          Authors:  R.B.C.  Henry  (U.  Oklahoma), A. Nava (U. Oklahoma),
          Jason X. Prochaska (Lick Observatory; UCSC)
          Comments: 41 pages, 15 figures; accepted by ApJ, to appear Aug.
          20, 2006
          Chemical evolution models and Monte Carlo simulation techniques
          have been combined for the first time to study the distribution
          of  blue  compact  galaxies on the N/O plateau. Each simulation
          comprises  70  individual  chemical  evolution models. For each
          model,  input  parameters relating to a galaxy's star formation
          history  (bursting or continuous star formation, star formation
          efficiency),  galaxy  age, and outflow rate are chosen randomly
          from  ranges  predetermined to be relevant. Predicted abundance
          ratios  from  each simulation are collectively overplotted onto
          the  data  to  test  its viability. We present our results both
          with  and  without  observational  scatter applied to the model
          points.  Our  study shows that most trial combinations of input
          parameters,  including  a  simulation  comprising  only  simple
          models   with   instantaneous   recycling,  are  successful  in
          reproducing  the  observed  morphology  of the N/O plateau once
          observational  scatter  is  added.  Therefore simulations which
          include  delay of nitrogen injection are no longer favored over
          those  which  propose that most nitrogen is produced by massive
          stars,  if only the plateau morphology is used as the principal
          constraint.  The  one  scenario  which  clearly  cannot explain
          plateau  morphology  is one in which galaxy ages are allowed to
          range  below 250 Myr. We conclude that the present data for the
          N/O  plateau are insufficient by themselves for identifying the
          portion  of  the  stellar  mass  spectrum  most responsible for
          cosmic nitrogen production.

          Title: FUSE Spectroscopy of the White Dwarf in U Geminorum
          Authors: Knox S. Long, Gabriel Brammer, Cynthia S. Froning
          Comments:   52  pages,  including  6  tables  and  12  figures.
          Acecepted for publication in ApJ, Vol 681 (Sept 2006)
          Observations  of  U Gem with FUSE confirm that the WD is heated
          by  the  outburst and cools during quiescence. At the end of an
          outburst,  the  best  uniform  temperature WD model fits to the
          data  indicate  a  temperature  of  41,000 - 47,000 K, while in
          mid-quiescence, the temperature is 28,000 - 31,000 K, depending
          on  the  gravity  assumed  for  the  WD. Photospheric abundance
          patterns  at the end of the outburst and in mid-quiescence show
          evidence of CNO processing. Improved fits to the spectra can be
          obtained  assuming there is a hotter, heated portion of the WD,
          presumably  an  accretion  belt, with a temperature of 60,000 -
          70,000  K  occupying  14-32%  of  the surface immediately after
          outburst.  However,  other  relatively  simple  models  for the
          second  component  fit  the  data  just as well and there is no
          obvious  signature that supports the hypothesis that the second
          component  arises  from  a  separate  region of the WD surface.
          Hence,  other physical explanations still must be considered to
          explain  the  time  evolution  of  the  spectrum  of  U  Gem in
          quiescence.  Strong  orbital  phase  dependent absorption, most
          likely  due  to  gas  above  the  disk, was observed during the
          mid-quiescence spectrum. This material, which can be modeled in
          terms  of  gas  with  a  temperature  of  10,000-11,000 K and a
          density  of  10**13  cm**-3,  has a column density of ~2 10**21
          cm**-2  at  orbital  phase  0.6-0.85,  and is probably the same
          material that has been observed to cause dips in the lightcurve
          at  X-ray wavelengths in the past. The discrepancy described by
          Naylor  et  al.  (2005) between the radius of the WD derived on
          the  one hand by the UV spectral analysis and the distance to U
          Gem,  and  on  the  other,  by  the  orbital  elements  and the
          gravitational redshift remains a serious problem.

          from SDSS to WFMOS
          Authors: Kazuhiro Yamamoto, Bruce A. Bassett, Robert C. Nichol,
          Yasushi Suto, Kazuhiro Yahata
          Comments: 16 pages, submitted to PRD
          We discuss how the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signatures
          in  galaxy  power  spectrum  can  distinguish the two different
          models to explain the cosmic acceleration, the modified gravity
          and  the cosmological constant. For this purpose, we consider a
          model  characterized by a parameter n, which corresponds to the
          Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati  (DGP)  model  if  n=2 and reduces to a
          spatially-flat  cosmological model with a cosmological constant
          for  n=\infty.  We find that the different expansion history of
          the  modified  gravity  model  systematically  shift  the  peak
          positions of BAO. A preliminary analysis using the current SDSS
          LRG  sample indicates that the original DGP model is disfavored
          unless   the   matter   density   parameter  exceeds  0.3.  The
          constraints    will   be   strongly   tightened   with   future
          spectroscopic  samples of galaxies at high redshifts. WFMOS, in
          collaboration   with   other   surveys  such  as  Planck,  will
          powerfully  constrain  modified  gravity  alternatives  to dark
          energy as the explanation of cosmic acceleration.

          available at this http URL
          Here we present an investigation of the properties of 16 nearby
          galaxy  groups  and  their constituent galaxies. The groups are
          selected from the Group Evolution Multi-wavelength Study (GEMS)
          and  all have X-ray as well as wide-field neutral hydrogen (HI)
          observations.   Group   membership   is   determined   using  a
          friends-of-friends  algorithm  on  the positions and velocities
          from  the  6-degree  Field  Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) and NASA/IPAC
          Extra-galactic  Database  (NED). For each group we derive their
          physical  properties using this membership, including: velocity
          dispersions   (sigma_v),  virial  masses  (M_V),  total  K-band
          luminosities  (L_K(Tot)) and early-type fractions (f_early) and
          present  these data for the individual groups. We find that the
          GEMS  X-ray  luminosity  is  proportional to the group velocity
          dispersions and virial masses:
          L_X(r_500)\propto\sigma_v^{3.11\pm0.59}  and  L_X(r_500)\propto
          M_V^{1.13\pm0.27},   consistent   with   the   predictions   of
          self-similarity  between  group and clusters. We also find that
          M_V\propto  L_K(Tot)^{2.0\pm0.9},  i.e.  mass grows faster than
          light  and  that  the  fraction  of  early-type galaxies in the
          groups  is  correlated  with  the  group X-ray luminosities and
          velocity  dispersions.  We examine the brightest group galaxies
          (BGGs),   finding   that,  while  the  luminosity  of  the  BGG
          correlates  with  its  total  group luminosity, the fraction of
          group luminosity contained in the BGG decreases with increasing
          total group luminosity. This suggests that BGGs grow by mergers
          at  early times in group evolution while the group continues to
          grow by accreting infalling galaxies. (Abridged)

          Title: Supernova Neutrinos: The Accretion Disk Scenario
          Authors: G. C. McLaughlin, R. Surman
          Neutrinos  from  core collapse supernovae can be emitted from a
          rapidly accreting disk surrounding a black hole, instead of the
          canonical  proto-neutron  star.  For  Galactic events, detector
          count  rates  are  considerable  and  in  fact  can  be  in the
          thousands for Super-Kamiokande. The rate of occurrence of these
          accreting  disks  in the Galaxy is predicted to be on the order
          of  10^-5  yr^-1, yet there is little observational evidence to
          provide  an  upper  limit  on  their  formation  rate. It would
          therefore  be  useful  to  discriminate between neutrinos which
          have been produced in a proto-neutron star and those which have
          been  produced accretion disks. In order to distinguish between
          the  two  scenarios,  either  the  time profile of the neutrino
          luminosity or the relative fluxes of different neutrino flavors
          may  be  considered.  There are some signals that would clearly
          point to one scenario or the other.

          Title: Gamma-ray binaries: pulsars in disguise ?
          Authors: Guillaume Dubus
          Comments: 20 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          LS  5039  and  LSI  +61  303 are unique amongst high-mass X-ray
          binaries (HMXB) for their spatially-resolved radio emission and
          their  counterpart  at  >GeV  gamma-ray  energies,  canonically
          attributed  to  non-thermal  particles  in an accretion-powered
          relativistic  jet.  The only other HMXB known to emit very high
          energy (VHE) gamma-rays, PSR B1259-63, harbours a non-accreting
          millisecond  pulsar.  I  investigate whether the interaction of
          the  relativistic  wind  from a young pulsar with the wind from
          its stellar companion, as in PSR B1259-63, constitutes a viable
          scenario  to  explain  the  observations of LS 5039 and LSI +61
          303.   Emission  would  arise  from  the  shocked  pulsar  wind
          material,  which  then  flows  away  to  large  distances  in a
          comet-shape  tail,  reproducing  on  a  smaller  scale  what is
          observed  in isolated, high motion pulsars interacting with the
          ISM.  Simple expectations for the SED are derived and are shown
          to  depend  on  few input parameters. Detailed modelling of the
          particle  evolution  is compared to the observations from radio
          to TeV energies. Acceleration at the shock provides high energy
          electrons  that steadily emit synchrotron in X-rays and inverse
          Compton   scatter   stellar   light  to  gamma-rays.  Electrons
          streaming  out  of the system emit at IR frequencies and below.
          The  overall  aspect  of  the SEDs is adequately reproduced for
          standard  values of the parameters. The morphology of the radio
          tail  can mimic a microquasar jet. Good agreement is found with
          the  published  VLBI map of LS 5039 and predictions are made on
          the  expected  change  in  appearance  with  orbital phase. The
          pulsar  wind scenario can provide a common, viable framework to
          interpret the emission from all three gamma-ray binaries.

          Title: Why Do T Tauri Disks Accrete?
          Authors:  Lee  Hartmann,  Paola  D'Alessio, Nuria Calvet, James
          Muzerolle
          Comments: 18 pages, 1 figure, ApJ, in press
          Observations  of  T  Tauri stars and young brown dwarfs suggest
          that the accretion rates of their disks scale strongly with the
          central  stellar  mass, approximately $\mdot \propto M_*^2$. No
          dependence  of  accretion  rate on stellar mass is predicted by
          the  simplest  version  of  the  layered  disk  model of Gammie
          (1996),  in  which  non-thermal ionization of upper disk layers
          allows   accretion   to   occur   via   the   magnetorotational
          instability.  We  show  that  a  minor modification of Gammie's
          model  to  include heating by irradiation from the central star
          yields  a  modest  dependence  of  $\mdot$ upon the mass of the
          central  star.  A  purely  viscous  disk  model could provide a
          strong  dependence  of  accretion  rate  on stellar mass if the
          initial   disk   radius  (before  much  viscous  evolution  has
          occurred)  has a strong dependence on stellar mass. However, it
          is  far  from  clear  that  at  least the most massive pre-main
          sequence  disks can be totally magnetically activated by X-rays
          or  cosmic  rays.  We suggest that a combination of effects are
          responsible  for  the observed dependence, with the lowest-mass
          stars  having  the  lowest  mass disks, which can be thoroughly
          magnetically  active,  while  the higher-mass stars have higher
          mass disks which have layered accretion and relatively inactive
          or ``dead'' central zones at some radii. In such dead zones, we
          suggest  that  gravitational  instabilities  may play a role in
          allowing accretion to proceed. In this connection, we emphasize
          the  uncertainty in disk masses derived from dust emission, and
          argue  that  T  Tauri  disk  masses  have  been  systematically
          underestimated  by  conventional  analyses.  Further  study  of
          accretion  rates,  especially  in  the lowest-mass stars, would
          help to clarify the mechanisms of accretion in T Tauri stars.

          Title:   Estimating  the  Radiative  Efficiency  of  Magnetized
          Accretion Disks Around Black Holes
          Authors: Kris Beckwith, John F. Hawley, Julian H. Krolik
          Comments: 28 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables. Submitted to ApJ
          Simulations  of  black  hole accretion have shown that magnetic
          stresses  are  present  near  and  inside  the innermost stable
          circular  orbit  (ISCO).  This finding suggests that such flows
          may  be  more luminous than predicted by the standard accretion
          disk  model.  Here we apply a prescription for heat dissipation
          within  the simulated accretion flows to estimate their implied
          radiative   efficiency.   We   assume   that   dissipation   is
          proportional  to the current density squared, and find that the
          resulting   azimuthally-averaged  and  shell-integrated  radial
          profile  is well-matched to the radial heat dissipation profile
          of  the  standard  disk  model for the region outside the ISCO,
          particularly  when  it  is  adjusted  to account for additional
          stress at the ISCO. In contrast to the standard model, however,
          the  dissipation  profile  derived  from  the  current  density
          continues  past  the  ISCO and through the plunging region. The
          total  predicted  dissipation  rate is between $\simeq 30%$ and
          $\simeq  100%$  greater  than  that  predicted  by the standard
          model, depending on the black hole spin. Most of the additional
          dissipation  takes  place  just  outside  the  ISCO. To predict
          luminosities,   we  assume  instantaneous  radiation  and  zero
          optical  depth, but allow for photon capture. The net radiative
          efficiency  seen by a distant observer is increased relative to
          the  standard  model  by  $\simeq  25%$--80%,  with the largest
          fractional  increase  for intermediate black hole spins because
          the  increase  in  dissipation from enhanced stress that occurs
          for  rapid spin is partially offset by the increased likelihood
          that the additional photons will be captured by the hole.

          candidate XTE J1720-318: from high-soft to low-hard state

          Aims:  To  gain  a better understanding of high-energy Galactic
          sources,  we  observed the Galactic X-ray binary and black hole
          candidate  XTE J1720-318 in the optical and near-infrared, just
          after  the  onset of its X-ray outburst in January, 2003. These
          observations  were  obtained  with the ESO/NTT as the Target of
          Opportunity,  in February and April 2003. Methods: We performed
          an   accurate   astrometry   and   analysed  photometrical  and
          spectroscopic observations. We then produced a colour-magnitude
          diagram,    looked    at   the   overall   evolution   of   the
          multi-wavelength  light curve, and analysed the spectral energy
          distribution. Results: We discovered the optical counterpart in
          the  R-band  (R  $\sim  21.5$)  and confirmed the near-infrared
          counterpart.  We  show  that, for an absorption between 6 and 8
          magnitudes,  XTE J1720-318 is likely to be an intermediate mass
          X-ray  binary  located  at  a  distance  between  3 and 10 kpc,
          hosting  a  main  sequence star of spectral type between late B
          and  early  G.  Our  second  set  of  observations  took  place
          simultaneously  with  the  third  secondary outburst present in
          X-ray  and  near-infrared  light  curves.  The evolution of its
          spectral energy distribution shows that XTE J1720-318 entered a
          transition  from a high-soft to a low-hard state in-between the
          two observations.

          Title:  Physical  viscosity  in smoothed particle hydrodynamics
          simulations of galaxy clusters
          Authors:  Debora Sijacki, Volker Springel (Max Planck Institute
          for Astrophysics, Garching, Germany)
          Comments:   23   pages,   13  figures,  MNRAS  submitted.  High
          resolution version of the paper is available at this http URL
          Most  hydrodynamical  simulations  of  galaxy cluster formation
          carried  out  to  date have tried to model the cosmic gas as an
          ideal,  inviscid fluid, where only a small amount of (unwanted)
          numerical   viscosity   is   present,  arising  from  practical
          limitations  of  the  numerical  method  employed,  and  with a
          strength  that  depends  on  numerical resolution. However, the
          physical  viscosity  of  the  gas in hot galaxy clusters may in
          fact  not  be  negligible,  suggesting  that  a self-consistent
          treatment  that accounts for the internal gas friction would be
          more  appropriate. To allow such simulations using the smoothed
          particle  hydrodynamics  (SPH)  method,  we  derive a novel SPH
          formulation  of  the  Navier-Stokes  and  general heat transfer
          equations  and  implement them in the GADGET-2 code. We include
          both  shear  and  bulk  viscosity  stress  tensors,  as well as
          saturation  criteria  that limit viscous stress transport where
          appropriate.  Adopting  Braginskii's  parameterization  for the
          shear  viscosity  of  hot  gaseous  plasmas,  we then study the
          influence  of  viscosity  on the interplay between AGN-inflated
          bubbles  and the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). We find
          that   certain   bubble  properties  like  morphology,  maximum
          clustercentric  radius  reached,  or survival time depend quite
          sensitively  on  the assumed level of viscosity. Interestingly,
          the  sound  waves launched into the ICM by the bubble injection
          are  damped  by  physical  viscosity,  establishing a non-local
          heating process. Finally, we carry out cosmological simulations
          of galaxy cluster formation with a viscous intracluster medium.
          Viscosity  modifies  the  dynamics of mergers and the motion of
          substructures through the cluster atmosphere. Substructures are
          generally  more  efficiently  stripped of their gas, leading to
          prominent long gaseous tails behind infalling massive halos.

          We  construct rest-frame luminosity functions at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8,
          8 and 24 microns over the redshift range 0<z<2 for galaxies and
          0<z<4  for  optical  QSOs, using optical and infrared data from
          the  Spitzer  Wide-area  InfraRed Extragalactic survey. The 3.6
          and  4.5  micron galaxy LFs show evidence for moderate positive
          luminosity  evolution  up to z~1.5, consistent with the passive
          ageing   of   evolved   stellar   populations.  Their  comoving
          luminosity  density  was  found  to evolve passively, gradually
          increasing out to z~0.5-1 but flattening, or even declining, at
          higher  redshift. Conversely, the 24 micron galaxy LF, which is
          more  sensitive to obscured star formation and/or AGN activity,
          undergoes strong positive evolution, with the derived IR energy
          density  and  SFR  density  proportional  to  (1+z)^gamma  with
          gamma=4.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6}  and  the  majority  of  this evolution
          occurring  since  z~1.  Optical  QSOs,  however,  show positive
          luminosity evolution in all bands, out to the highest redshifts
          (3<z<4).  Modelling  as  L*  proportional  to  (1+z)^gamma gave
          gamma=1.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1}  at 3.6 micron, gamma=1.0^{+0.1}_{-0.1}
          at  4.5 micron and stronger evolution at the longer wavelengths
          (5.8,  8  and  24 micron), of gamma~3. Comparison of the galaxy
          LFs  to  predictions  from  a  semi-analytic model based on CDM
          indicate  that an IMF skewed towards higher mass star formation
          in  bursts  compared  to  locally is preferred. As a result the
          currently  inferred  massive  star  formation  rates in distant
          sub-mm sources may require substantial downwards revision.

          The  Stellar  Planet  Survey  (STEPS) is an ongoing astrometric
          search  for  giant  planets and brown dwarfs around a sample of
          ~30 M-dwarfs. We have discovered several low-mass companions by
          measuring  the  motion  of  our  target stars relative to their
          reference  frames.  The  highest  mass  discovery thus far is G
          78-28B, a companion to the M-dwarf G 78-28A. The orbital period
          is  4.18 +/- 0.03 y, the system mass is 0.565 +/- 0.055 Msolar,
          and   the   semi-major  axis  is  2.19  +/-  0.10  AU.  Imaging
          observations  with  the  Keck  laser guide star adaptive optics
          (LGSAO)  and the Palomar AO instruments resolved the system and
          also  yielded  JHK-band  delta  magnitudes.  We use the orbital
          solution,  light  ratios,  and mass-luminosity relationships to
          derive component masses of MA = 0.370 +/- 0.034 Msolar and MB =
          0.195 +/- 0.021 Msolar. G 78-28B is of type M4 V based upon its
          colors  and  mass. We also discovered GJ 231.1C, a companion to
          GJ  231.1B,  with STEPS and imaged the companion with LGSAO and
          Palomar AO, but the orbital period is longer than our observing
          baseline;  thus  the system parameters are less constrained. In
          GJ  231.1BC  the  masses  are  MB = 0.25 +/- 0.06 Msolar and MC
          =0.12  +/- 0.02 Msolar. The inferred spectral type of GJ 231.1C
          is  M5  V.  We  demonstrate the results of the current state of
          mass estimation techniques with our data.

          Title: Reionisation scenarios and the temperature of the IGM
          Authors: Eric R. Tittley Avery Meiksin
          Comments:  Submitted  to  MNRAS.  Version  with high resolution
          colour figures available at this http URL
          We have explored reionisation of the universe using a radiative
          transfer (RT) code coupled to a particle-mesh (PM) N-body code.
          Multiple  simulations  were performed with different spectra of
          ionising  radiation:  a power law, miniquasar, starburst, and a
          time-varying spectrum that evolves from a starburst spectrum to
          a  power law. The RT is sufficiently resolved in time and space
          to   correctly   model   both  the  ionisation  state  and  the
          temperature across the ionisation front. The temperature of the
          ionised intergalactic medium (IGM) is sensitive to the spectrum
          of  the  source  of  ionising  radiation.  The  post-ionisation
          temperature  is fairly insensitive to the redshift at which the
          hydrogen  ionising  sources  turns  on  for expected scenarios.
          Hardening  of  the spectrum of the ionising radiation field due
          to  passage  through  the  high  HI  column  densities leads to
          fluctuations  in  the  f_HeII  /  f_HI  ratio  in  the shadowed
          regions.  These variations alone, however, do not reproduce the
          measured  fluctuations.  The post-ionisation temperature of the
          IGM provides strong constraints on the nature of the sources of
          reionisation.

          Authors:  J.S.  Sanders,  A.C.  Fabian (Institute of Astronomy,
          Cambridge)
          Comments: 5 pages, submitted to MNRAS
          We  report  on  a  partially  circular X-ray surface brightness
          discontinuity  found  at  about 55 kpc from the centre of Abell
          2199  with  Chandra X-ray observatory observations. Unlike cold
          fronts   found   in   other  clusters,  the  feature  shows  no
          temperature  change across it but has an apparent density jump.
          We  therefore identify it as a weak isothermal shock associated
          with the central AGN and the inflation of its radio bubbles, as
          found  in  the Perseus cluster. We examine a similar feature at
          40  kpc  radius  found  by  Mazzotta  et al in 2A 0335+096, and
          conclude  that  it  too  is  an isothermal shock. The change in
          density  across  these shocks implies a Mach number of 1.5. The
          implication of this discovery is that such shocks are common in
          clusters  of  galaxies,  and are an important mechanism for the
          transport of energy from a central supermassive black hole into
          the cluster core.

          through   Gas  Accretion  and  Starbursts  in  Cluster  Central

          Comments: 17 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  present  an  analysis  of the growth of black holes through
          accretion  and  bulges through star formation in 33 galaxies at
          the  centers  of  cooling  flows.  Most  of  these systems show
          evidence  of cavities in the intracluster medium (ICM) inflated
          by  radio  jets  emanating  from  their  active galactic nuclei
          (AGN).  We  present  a  new  and  extensive  analysis  of X-ray
          cavities  in  these systems. We find that AGN are energetically
          able to balance radiative losses (cooling) from the ICM in more
          than  half  of  our sample. Using a subsample of 17 systems, we
          examine the relationship between cooling and star formation. We
          find  that  the  star  formation  rates  are approaching or are
          comparable  to  X-ray  and  far  UV  limits on the rates of gas
          condensation  onto  the central galaxy. The remaining radiative
          losses  could  be offset by AGN feedback. The vast gulf between
          radiative  losses  and  the sink of cooling material, which has
          been  the primary objection to cooling flows, has narrowed and,
          in  some  cases, is no longer a serious issue. Using the cavity
          (jet)  powers,  we  place  strong  lower  limits on the rate of
          growth  of supermassive black holes in central galaxies, and we
          find  that  they  are growing at an average rate of ~ 0.1 solar
          masses  per  year,  with some systems growing as quickly as ~ 1
          solar mass per year. We find a trend between bulge growth (star
          formation)  and  black  hole  growth  that  is approximately in
          accordance  with  the  slope  of the local (Magorrian) relation
          between  black  hole and bulge mass. However, the large scatter
          in the trend suggests that bulges and black holes do not always
          grow in lock step. (Abridged)

          white  dwarf  in  a  binary  star  system is understood[1], the
          structure, dynamics, and mass of the ejecta are not well known.
          In  rare  cases, the white dwarf is embedded in the wind nebula
          of  a  red-giant companion; the explosion products plow through
          the  nebula  and  produce  X-ray  emission. Early this year, an
          eruption  of  the  recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi[2,3] provided the
          first  opportunity  to perform comprehensive X-ray observations
          of  such  an  event  and diagnose conditions within the ejecta.
          Here  we  show  that  the  hard X-ray emission from RS Ophiuchi
          early  in  the  eruption  emanates from behind a blast wave, or
          outward-moving shock wave, that expanded freely for less than 2
          days  and  then decelerated due to interaction with the nebula.
          The  X-rays  faded  rapidly,  suggesting  that  the  blast wave
          deviates  from the standard spherical shell structure[4-6]. The
          early  onset  of  deceleration indicates that the ejected shell
          had a low mass, the white dwarf has a high mass[7], and that RS
          Ophiuchi  is  a progenitor of the type of supernova integral to
          studies of the expansion of the universe.

          We  present  the  preliminary  results  from implementing a new
          software  tool  that  enables  inspection of time-tagged photon
          data  for  the astronomical sources contained within individual
          GALEX  ultraviolet  images  of  the  sky. We have inspected the
          photon data contained within 1802 GALEX images to reveal rapid,
          short-term  (<500  sec)  UV  source  variability in the form of
          stellar flares. The mean associated change in NUV magnitude due
          to  this flaring activity is 2.7+/-0.3 mag. A list of 49 new UV
          variable-star  candidates  is  presented,  together  with their
          associated   Sloan   Digital   Sky  Survey  (SDSS)  photometric
          magnitudes. From these data we can associate the main source of
          these  UV flare events with magnetic activity on M-dwarf stars.
          Photometric  parallaxes  have  been  determined for 32 of these
          sources,  placing  them at distances ranging from approximately
          25  to  1000pc.  The  average  UV  flare energy for these flare
          events  is 2.5E30 ergs, which is of a similar energy to that of
          U-band,  X-ray  and  EUV  flares observed on many local M-dwarf
          stars.  We have found that stars of classes M0 to M5 flare with
          energies  spanning  a  far  larger  range  and  with  an energy
          approximately  5  times  greater than those of later (M6 to M8)
          spectral type.

          In the era of high resolution submillimeter interferometers, it
          will  soon  be  possible  to  observe the neutral circumstellar
          medium directly involved in gas giant planet (GGP) formation at
          physical  scales  previously  unattainable. In order to explore
          possible  signatures  of  gas  giant  planet formation via disk
          instabilities,  we  have combined a 3D, non-local thermodynamic
          equilibrium  (LTE)  radiative  transfer  code with a 3D, finite
          differences  hydrodynamical  code  to  model molecular emission
          lines   from   the  vicinity  of  a  1.4  M_J  self-gravitating
          proto-GGP.  Here,  we  explore  the  properties  of  rotational
          transitions  of  the  commonly observed dense gas tracer, HCO+.
          Our  main  results  are  the following: 1. Very high lying HCO+
          transitions  (e.g.  HCO+  J=7-6) can trace dense planet forming
          clumps  around  circumstellar disks. Depending on the molecular
          abundance,  the  proto-GGP  may  be  directly  imageable by the
          Atacama  Large  Millimeter Array (ALMA). 2. HCO+ emission lines
          are   heavily   self-absorbed  through  the  proto-GGP's  dense
          molecular  core.  This signature is nearly ubiquitous, and only
          weakly    dependent    on    assumed   HCO+   abundances.   The
          self-absorption  features are most pronounced at higher angular
          resolutions.  Dense  clumps  that are not self-gravitating only
          show  minor  self-absorption features. 3. Line temperatures are
          highest  through  the  proto-GGP  at all assumed abundances and
          inclination  angles.  Conversely, due to self-absorption in the
          line,  the  velocity-integrated  intensity  may  not  be.  High
          angular  resolution  interferometers  such as the Submillimeter
          Array  (SMA)  and  ALMA  may  be  able to differentiate between
          competing theories of gas giant planet formation.

          We  construct rest-frame luminosity functions at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8,
          8 and 24 microns over the redshift range 0<z<2 for galaxies and
          0<z<4  for  optical  QSOs, using optical and infrared data from
          the  Spitzer  Wide-area  InfraRed Extragalactic survey. The 3.6
          and  4.5  micron galaxy LFs show evidence for moderate positive
          luminosity  evolution  up to z~1.5, consistent with the passive
          ageing   of   evolved   stellar   populations.  Their  comoving
          luminosity  density  was  found  to evolve passively, gradually
          increasing out to z~0.5-1 but flattening, or even declining, at
          higher  redshift. Conversely, the 24 micron galaxy LF, which is
          more  sensitive to obscured star formation and/or AGN activity,
          undergoes strong positive evolution, with the derived IR energy
          density  and  SFR  density  proportional  to  (1+z)^gamma  with
          gamma=4.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6}  and  the  majority  of  this evolution
          occurring  since  z~1.  Optical  QSOs,  however,  show positive
          luminosity evolution in all bands, out to the highest redshifts
          (3<z<4).  Modelling  as  L*  proportional  to  (1+z)^gamma gave
          gamma=1.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1}  at 3.6 micron, gamma=1.0^{+0.1}_{-0.1}
          at  4.5 micron and stronger evolution at the longer wavelengths
          (5.8,  8  and  24 micron), of gamma~3. Comparison of the galaxy
          LFs  to  predictions  from  a  semi-analytic model based on CDM
          indicate  that an IMF skewed towards higher mass star formation
          in  bursts  compared  to  locally is preferred. As a result the
          currently  inferred  massive  star  formation  rates in distant
          sub-mm sources may require substantial downwards revision.

          The  Stellar  Planet  Survey  (STEPS) is an ongoing astrometric
          search  for  giant  planets and brown dwarfs around a sample of
          ~30 M-dwarfs. We have discovered several low-mass companions by
          measuring  the  motion  of  our  target stars relative to their
          reference  frames.  The  highest  mass  discovery thus far is G
          78-28B, a companion to the M-dwarf G 78-28A. The orbital period
          is  4.18 +/- 0.03 y, the system mass is 0.565 +/- 0.055 Msolar,
          and   the   semi-major  axis  is  2.19  +/-  0.10  AU.  Imaging
          observations  with  the  Keck  laser guide star adaptive optics
          (LGSAO)  and the Palomar AO instruments resolved the system and
          also  yielded  JHK-band  delta  magnitudes.  We use the orbital
          solution,  light  ratios,  and mass-luminosity relationships to
          derive component masses of MA = 0.370 +/- 0.034 Msolar and MB =
          0.195 +/- 0.021 Msolar. G 78-28B is of type M4 V based upon its
          colors  and  mass. We also discovered GJ 231.1C, a companion to
          GJ  231.1B,  with STEPS and imaged the companion with LGSAO and
          Palomar AO, but the orbital period is longer than our observing
          baseline;  thus  the system parameters are less constrained. In
          GJ  231.1BC  the  masses  are  MB = 0.25 +/- 0.06 Msolar and MC
          =0.12  +/- 0.02 Msolar. The inferred spectral type of GJ 231.1C
          is  M5  V.  We  demonstrate the results of the current state of
          mass estimation techniques with our data.

          Title: Reionisation scenarios and the temperature of the IGM
          Authors: Eric R. Tittley Avery Meiksin
          Comments:  Submitted  to  MNRAS.  Version  with high resolution
          colour figures available at this http URL
          We have explored reionisation of the universe using a radiative
          transfer (RT) code coupled to a particle-mesh (PM) N-body code.
          Multiple  simulations  were performed with different spectra of
          ionising  radiation:  a power law, miniquasar, starburst, and a
          time-varying spectrum that evolves from a starburst spectrum to
          a  power law. The RT is sufficiently resolved in time and space
          to   correctly   model   both  the  ionisation  state  and  the
          temperature across the ionisation front. The temperature of the
          ionised intergalactic medium (IGM) is sensitive to the spectrum
          of  the  source  of  ionising  radiation.  The  post-ionisation
          temperature  is fairly insensitive to the redshift at which the
          hydrogen  ionising  sources  turns  on  for expected scenarios.
          Hardening  of  the spectrum of the ionising radiation field due
          to  passage  through  the  high  HI  column  densities leads to
          fluctuations  in  the  f_HeII  /  f_HI  ratio  in  the shadowed
          regions.  These variations alone, however, do not reproduce the
          measured  fluctuations.  The post-ionisation temperature of the
          IGM provides strong constraints on the nature of the sources of
          reionisation.

          Title: Isothermal shocks in Abell 2199 and 2A 0335+096?
          Authors:  J.S.  Sanders,  A.C.  Fabian (Institute of Astronomy,
          Cambridge)
          Comments: 5 pages, submitted to MNRAS
          We  report  on  a  partially  circular X-ray surface brightness
          discontinuity  found  at  about 55 kpc from the centre of Abell
          2199  with  Chandra X-ray observatory observations. Unlike cold
          fronts   found   in   other  clusters,  the  feature  shows  no
          temperature  change across it but has an apparent density jump.
          We  therefore identify it as a weak isothermal shock associated
          with the central AGN and the inflation of its radio bubbles, as
          found  in  the Perseus cluster. We examine a similar feature at
          40  kpc  radius  found  by  Mazzotta  et al in 2A 0335+096, and
          conclude  that  it  too  is  an isothermal shock. The change in
          density  across  these shocks implies a Mach number of 1.5. The
          implication of this discovery is that such shocks are common in
          clusters  of  galaxies,  and are an important mechanism for the
          transport of energy from a central supermassive black hole into
          the cluster core.

          Comments: 17 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  present  an  analysis  of the growth of black holes through
          accretion  and  bulges through star formation in 33 galaxies at
          the  centers  of  cooling  flows.  Most  of  these systems show
          evidence  of cavities in the intracluster medium (ICM) inflated
          by  radio  jets  emanating  from  their  active galactic nuclei
          (AGN).  We  present  a  new  and  extensive  analysis  of X-ray
          cavities  in  these systems. We find that AGN are energetically
          able to balance radiative losses (cooling) from the ICM in more
          than  half  of  our sample. Using a subsample of 17 systems, we
          examine the relationship between cooling and star formation. We
          find  that  the  star  formation  rates  are approaching or are
          comparable  to  X-ray  and  far  UV  limits on the rates of gas
          condensation  onto  the central galaxy. The remaining radiative
          losses  could  be offset by AGN feedback. The vast gulf between
          radiative  losses  and  the sink of cooling material, which has
          been  the primary objection to cooling flows, has narrowed and,
          in  some  cases, is no longer a serious issue. Using the cavity
          (jet)  powers,  we  place  strong  lower  limits on the rate of
          growth  of supermassive black holes in central galaxies, and we
          find  that  they  are growing at an average rate of ~ 0.1 solar
          masses  per  year,  with some systems growing as quickly as ~ 1
          solar mass per year. We find a trend between bulge growth (star
          formation)  and  black  hole  growth  that  is approximately in
          accordance  with  the  slope  of the local (Magorrian) relation
          between  black  hole and bulge mass. However, the large scatter
          in the trend suggests that bulges and black holes do not always
          grow in lock step. (Abridged)

          Stellar explosions such as novae and supernovae produce most of
          the heavy elements in the Universe. Although the onset of novae
          from runaway thermonuclear fusion reactions on the surface of a
          white  dwarf  in  a  binary  star  system is understood[1], the
          structure, dynamics, and mass of the ejecta are not well known.
          In  rare  cases, the white dwarf is embedded in the wind nebula
          of  a  red-giant companion; the explosion products plow through
          the  nebula  and  produce  X-ray  emission. Early this year, an
          eruption  of  the  recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi[2,3] provided the
          first  opportunity  to perform comprehensive X-ray observations
          of  such  an  event  and diagnose conditions within the ejecta.
          Here  we  show  that  the  hard X-ray emission from RS Ophiuchi
          early  in  the  eruption  emanates from behind a blast wave, or
          outward-moving shock wave, that expanded freely for less than 2
          days  and  then decelerated due to interaction with the nebula.
          The  X-rays  faded  rapidly,  suggesting  that  the  blast wave
          deviates  from the standard spherical shell structure[4-6]. The
          early  onset  of  deceleration indicates that the ejected shell
          had a low mass, the white dwarf has a high mass[7], and that RS
          Ophiuchi  is  a progenitor of the type of supernova integral to
          studies of the expansion of the universe.

          In the era of high resolution submillimeter interferometers, it
          will  soon  be  possible  to  observe the neutral circumstellar
          medium directly involved in gas giant planet (GGP) formation at
          physical  scales  previously  unattainable. In order to explore
          possible  signatures  of  gas  giant  planet formation via disk
          instabilities,  we  have combined a 3D, non-local thermodynamic
          equilibrium  (LTE)  radiative  transfer  code with a 3D, finite
          differences  hydrodynamical  code  to  model molecular emission
          lines   from   the  vicinity  of  a  1.4  M_J  self-gravitating
          proto-GGP.  Here,  we  explore  the  properties  of  rotational
          transitions  of  the  commonly observed dense gas tracer, HCO+.
          Our  main  results  are  the following: 1. Very high lying HCO+
          transitions  (e.g.  HCO+  J=7-6) can trace dense planet forming
          clumps  around  circumstellar disks. Depending on the molecular
          abundance,  the  proto-GGP  may  be  directly  imageable by the
          Atacama  Large  Millimeter Array (ALMA). 2. HCO+ emission lines
          are   heavily   self-absorbed  through  the  proto-GGP's  dense
          molecular  core.  This signature is nearly ubiquitous, and only
          weakly    dependent    on    assumed   HCO+   abundances.   The
          self-absorption  features are most pronounced at higher angular
          resolutions.  Dense  clumps  that are not self-gravitating only
          show  minor  self-absorption features. 3. Line temperatures are
          highest  through  the  proto-GGP  at all assumed abundances and
          inclination  angles.  Conversely, due to self-absorption in the
          line,  the  velocity-integrated  intensity  may  not  be.  High
          angular  resolution  interferometers  such as the Submillimeter
          Array  (SMA)  and  ALMA  may  be  able to differentiate between
          competing theories of gas giant planet formation.

          We  identify active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the Groth-Westphal
          Survey  Strip  (GSS)  using  the  independent and complementary
          selection  techniques  of  optical spectroscopy and photometric
          variability. We discuss the X-ray properties of these AGN using
          Chandra/XMM data for this region. From a sample of 576 galaxies
          with  high  quality  spectra  we  identify 31 galaxies with AGN
          signatures.  Seven  of  these have broad emission lines (Type 1
          AGNs).   We   also  identify  26  galaxies  displaying  nuclear
          variability  in  HST  WFPC2  images  of the GSS separated by ~7
          years.  The  primary overlap of the two selected AGN samples is
          the  set  of  broad-line AGNs, of which 80% appear as variable.
          Only a few narrow-line AGNs approach the variability threshold.
          The broad-line AGNs have an average redshift of z~1.1 while the
          other  spectroscopic  AGNs have redshifts closer to the mean of
          the  general  galaxy  population (z~0.7). Eighty percent of the
          identified broad-line AGNs are detected in X-rays and these are
          among  the  most  luminous  X-ray  sources in the GSS. Only one
          narrow-line  AGN  is  X-ray  detected.  Of  the variable nuclei
          galaxies  within  the  X-ray survey, 27% are X-ray detected. We
          find  that  1.9+/-0.6%  of  GSS galaxies to V=24 are broad-line
          AGNs,  1.4+/-0.5%  are narrow-line AGNs, and 4.5+/-1.4% contain
          variable  nuclei.  The fraction of spectroscopically identified
          BLAGNs  and  NLAGNs  at  z~1  reveals  a marginally significant
          increase of 1.3+/-0.9% when compared to the local population.

          We report the direct measurement of orbital period decay in the
          double neutron star pulsar system PSR B2127+11C in the globular
          cluster  M15 at the rate of $(-3.95 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-12}$,
          consistent  with  the  prediction  of general relativity at the
          $\sim  3  %$ level. We find the pulsar mass to be $m_p = (1.358
          \pm  0.010)  M_\odot$  and the companion mass $m_c = (1.354 \pm
          0.010)  M_\odot$. We also report long-term pulse timing results
          for  the  pulsars  PSR  B2127+11A  and PSR B2127+11B, including
          confirmation of the cluster proper motion.

          A0620-00:  implications for modelling low-luminosity black hole

          (Amsterdam)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Deep  observations  with  the  Very  Large  Array  of A0620-00,
          performed  in  2005  August, resulted in the first detection of
          radio  emission  from a black hole binary at X-ray luminosities
          as  low  as  10^{-8.5}  times the Eddington limit. The measured
          radio  flux  density,  of  51  \pm 7 microJy at 8.5 GHz, is the
          lowest  reported  for  an  X-ray  binary  system so far, and is
          interpreted  in  terms  of  partially self-absorbed synchrotron
          emission  from  outflowing  plasma. Making use of the estimated
          outer  accretion rate of A0620-00 in quiescence, we demonstrate
          that the outflow kinetic power must be energetically comparable
          to  the  total accretion power associated with such rate, if it
          was  to  reach  the  black  hole  with  the  standard radiative
          efficiency  of 10 per cent. This favours a model for quiescence
          in  which  a  radiatively  inefficient  outflow  accounts for a
          sizable   fraction   of  the  missing  energy,  and,  in  turn,
          substantially  affects  the  overall  dynamics of the accretion
          flow.   Simultaneous  observations  in  the  X-ray  band,  with
          Chandra,  confirm  the  validity  of  a  non-linear radio/X-ray
          correlation  for  hard  state  black  hole binaries down to low
          quiescent  luminosities, thereby contradicting some theoretical
          expectations.  Taking  the mass term into account, the A0620-00
          data  lie  on  the  extrapolation  of the so called Fundamental
          Plane  of  black hole activity, which has thus been extended by
          more  than 2 orders of magnitude in radio and X-ray luminosity.
          With  the  addition  of  the A0620-00 point, the plane relation
          provides  an  empirical  proof  for the scale-invariance of the
          jet-accretion coupling in accreting black holes over the entire
          parameter space observable with current instrumentation.

          A   Spectacular  N  arrow-Line  Seyfert  1  Galaxy  with  Young
          Post-starburst
          Authors: J. Wang, J. Y. Wei
          Comments: 20 pages, 5 figures, accepted by ApJ
          We  analyze  the physical properties of post-starburst AGN SDSS
          J085338.27+033246.1  according  to  its  optical  spectrum  and
          discuss  its  implications  on AGN's evolution. The spectra PCA
          method  is  developed  to extract emission lines and absorption
          features  from  the  total  light  spectrum.  The emission-line
          analysis  indicates that the object can be classified as a NLS1
          with  FeII/H$\beta_{\rm{B}}=2.4\pm0.2$,  large  Eddington ratio
          ($\sim0.34$), small black hole mass
          ($\sim1.1\times10^{7}M_{\odot}$)   and   intermediately  strong
          radio   emission.   A  simple  SSP  model  indicates  that  the
          absorption  features  are  reproduced  by  a  $\sim$100 Myr old
          starburst  with  a  mass of $\sim7\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$ rather
          well.  The  current SFR $\sim3.0M_{\odot}\rm{yr^{-1}}$ inferred
          from  the  [OII] emission is much smaller than the past average
          SFR$\sim70M_{\odot}\rm{yr^{-1}}$,   however.   The  line  ratio
          diagnosis  using  the  BPT  diagrams  indicates that the narrow
          emission lines are almost entirely emitted from HII regions. We
          further discuss a possible evolutionary path that links AGN and
          starburst phenomena.

          Title:  A  Library  of  Lick/IDS  Indices  for  Binary  Stellar
          Populations
          Authors: Fenghui Zhang, Lifang Li
          Comments: 16 pages, 2 figures, to be published in MNRAS
          Using  EPS  we  present  13  refined  Lick/IDS  absorption-line
          indices  for  an  extensive  set  of instantaneous-burst binary
          stellar  populations  (BSPs)  at  high  resolution (0.3 \AA) of
          various  age  and  metallicity  (1-15Gyr,  0.004-0.03),  and 38
          indices  at  intermediate resolution (3 \AA). These indices are
          obtained by two methods: (1) obtain them by using the empirical
          fitting  functions (FFs method); (2) measure them directly from
          the  synthetic  spectra (DC method). Together with our previous
          paper  a  database of Lick/IDS spectral absorption-line indices
          for BSPs at high and intermediate resolutions is provided. This
          set  of  indices  includes  21  indices of Worthey et al., four
          Balmer  indices  defined  by Worthey & Ottaviani and 13 indices
          with the new passband definitions of Trager et al. The full set
          of  synthetic  indices  and the integrated pseudo-continuum are
          listed  in the Appendix, which is only available online or from
          our  website (this http URL com/), or on request from the first
          author. Moreover, the ISEDs can be obtained from our website.
          We  compare  the  synthetic  Lick/IDS  indices  obtained by FFs
          method  and those by DC method, and find that the discrepancies
          are  significant:  Ca4455  (index  6),  Fe4668  (8), Mg_b (13),
          Fe5709  (17),  NaD  (19),  TiO_1 (20) and TiO_2 (21, except for
          Z=0.02)  in  the  W94 system, Ca4455^T (6^T), C_2 4668^T (8^T),
          NaD^T  (19^T),  TiO_1^T  (20^T)  and  TiO_2^T (21^T, except for
          Z=0.02)  in  the  T98  system  obtained  by  DC method are less
          (bluer)  than the corresponding ones obtained by FFs method for
          all metallicities. Ca4227 (index 3), Fe5782 (18),Ca4227^T (3^T)
          and  Fe5782^T  (18^T)  are  greater  at Z=0.03 and become to be
          bluer  at  Z=0.004, Fe5709^T (17^T) index is less at Z=0.03 and
          becomes  to  be  redder  at Z=0.004 than the corresponding ones
          obtained by FFs method.

          accepted by ApJ
          We  present the first mid-infrared interferometric measurements
          of  FU  Orionis.  We  clearly  resolve structures that are best
          explained  with  an  optically  thick  accretion disk. A simple
          accretion  disk  model  fits  the observed SED and visibilities
          reasonably  well  and  does  not  require  the  presence of any
          additional  structure such as a dusty envelope. The inclination
          and also the position angle of the disk can be constrained from
          the  multibaseline interferometric observations. Our disk model
          is  in  general  agreement  with  most  published near-infrared
          interferometric  measurements.  From  the shape and strength of
          the  8-13  micrometer  spectrum  the  dust  composition  of the
          accretion  disk is derived for the first time. We conclude that
          most  dust particles are amorphous and already much larger than
          those   typically  observed  in  the  ISM.  Although  the  high
          accretion  rate  of the system provides both, high temperatures
          out  to  large  radii  and  an effective transport mechanism to
          distribute  crystalline  grains, we do not see any evidence for
          crystalline  silicates neither in the total spectrum nor in the
          correlated  flux  spectra from the inner disk regions. Possible
          reasons  for  this non-detection are mentioned. All results are
          discussed   in   context  with  other  high-spatial  resolution
          observations  of  FU  Ori  and  other  FU  Ori objects. We also
          address   the   question   whether  FU  Ori  is  in  a  younger
          evolutionary stage than a classical TTauri star.

          Context  :  Highly-collimated  outflows  are believed to be the
          earliest   stage  in  outflow  evolution,  so  their  study  is
          essential for understanding the processes driving outflows. The
          BHR71  Bok globule is known to harbour such a highly-collimated
          outflow,  which  is  powered  by  a  protostar  belonging  to a
          protobinary  system.  Aims  :  We  aimed  at  investigating the
          interaction  of  collimated outflows with the ambient molecular
          cloud by using molecular tracers. Methods : We mapped the BHR71
          highly-collimated  outflow  in CO(3-2) with the APEX telescope,
          and  observed  several  bright  points  of  the  outflow in the
          molecular   transitions   CO(4-3),  13CO(3-2),  C18O(3-2),  and
          CH3OH(7-6).  We use an LVG code to characterise the temperature
          enhancements  in  these  regions. Results : In our CO(3-2) map,
          the  second  outflow driven by IRS2, which is the second source
          of  the  binary  system, is completely revealed and shown to be
          bipolar. We also measure temperature enhancements in the lobes.
          The  CO  and  methanol  LVG  modelling  points  to temperatures
          between  30 and 50K in the IRS1 outflow, while the IRS2 outflow
          seems to be warmer (up to 300K).

          Title:  Inflation  is  the generic feature of phantom field-not
          the big-rip
          Authors: Abhik Kumar Sanyal
          Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures
          A  class  of  solutions  for  phantom  field corresponding to a
          generalized  k-essence lagrangian has been presented, employing
          a  simple method which provides the scope to explore many such.
          All the solutions having dynamical state parameter are found to
          touch the magic line w = -1, asymptotically. The solutions with
          constant  equation  of state can represent phantom, quitessence
          or an ordinary scalar field cosmologies depending on the choice
          of  a  couple  of parameters of the theory. For w approximately
          equal    to   -1,   quintessence   and   phantom   models   are
          indistinguishable   through   the  Hubble  parameter.  Finally,
          inflation  rather than big-rip has been found to be the generic
          feature of phantom cosmology.

          Comments: 21 pages incluging 3 figures
          The  assumption  that short-period (SP) comets are fragments of
          massive  icy  envelopes  of  Ganymede-like  bodies saturated by
          products  of  ice electrolysis that underwent global explosions
          provides a plausible explanation of all known manifestations of
          comets,  including  the jet character of outflows, the presence
          of  ions  in  the  vicinity  of  the  nucleus,  the  bursts and
          splitting  of  cometary  nuclei,  etc.,  with  solar  radiation
          initiating  burning  of  the  products  of  electrolysis in the
          nucleus.  As shown persuasively by numerical simulation carried
          out  in hydrodynamic approximation, the shock wave initiated by
          the  Deep  Impact  (DI)  impactor in the cometary ice saturated
          originally  by the electrolysis products 2H2 + O2 is capable of
          activating  under  certain  conditions exothermal reactions (of
          the  type  O2 + H2 + organics = H2O + CO + HCN + other products
          of incomplete burning of organics including its light and heavy
          pyrolyzed  compounds,  soot,  etc.), which will slow down shock
          wave  damping  (forced  detonation) and increase many times the
          energy  release.  As  a  result,  the  measured  energetics  of
          ejections  and  outflows  from the crater have to exceed the DI
          energetics. Analysis of different clusters of the DI experiment
          data  confirms  these  conclusions and expectations and thus it
          favours the planetary origin of comets.

          Although  disk  accretion  onto compact objects - white dwarfs,
          neutron  stars,  and  black  holes - is central to much of high
          energy  astrophysics,  the mechanisms which enable this process
          have  remained  observationally  elusive.  Accretion disks must
          transfer  angular momentum for matter to travel radially inward
          onto  the  compact  object.  Internal  viscosity  from magnetic
          processes and disk winds can in principle both transfer angular
          momentum,  but  hitherto we lacked evidence that either occurs.
          Here  we  report  that an X-ray-absorbing wind discovered in an
          observation  of the stellar-mass black hole binary GRO J1655-40
          must  be  powered  by  a  magnetic  process that can also drive
          accretion  through  the  disk.  Detailed  spectral analysis and
          modeling  of  the  wind  shows  that  it can only be powered by
          pressure  generated  by magnetic viscosity internal to the disk
          or  magnetocentrifugal  forces.  This  result demonstrates that
          disk  accretion  onto  black  holes is a fundamentally magnetic
          process.

          Comments: 20 pages and 7 figures
          We have studied the photometric variability of ten SMC Be/X-ray
          pulsars using MACHO and OGLE-II data. For some of these systems
          we  have  found  periodic behavior, including orbital outbursts
          and/or nonradial pulsations (NRP) of the Be star. For others we
          were  unable  to  identify  any  clear photometric periodicity,
          although   their   longterm   light   curves  show  significant
          structure.    We   present   periodograms,   phase   dispersion
          minimization  (PDM)  variances, and folded light curves for the
          systems which exhibit periodic photometric variability.

          Title:  Statistics  of  Cosmological  Black  Hole  Jet Sources:
          Blazar Predictions for GLAST
          Authors: Charles D. Dermer (1) ((1) NRL)
          Comments: 30 pages, 17 figures, submitted to ApJ
          A  study  of  the  statistics  of  cosmological  black-hole jet
          sources  is  applied  to EGRET blazar data, and predictions are
          made   for   GLAST.  Black-hole  jet  sources  are  modeled  as
          collimated  relativistic  outflows  with radiation beamed along
          the  jet  axis  due  to  strong  Doppler boosting. The comoving
          density  dependence  of  the  blazar  formation  rate  (BFR) is
          assumed  to  follow the cosmic star formation history or cosmic
          evolution  of IR-luminous galaxies. A parameter study of blazar
          redshift  and size distributions is presented using synchrotron
          and  external  Compton (EC) beaming factors for different BFRs.
          The  redshift and luminosity distributions of gamma-ray blazars
          observed with EGRET, separated into BL Lac object (BL) and flat
          spectrum  radio  quasar  (FSRQ)  distributions,  are  fit  with
          monoparametric  functions  for  the  distributions  of  the jet
          Lorentz  factor  Gamma,  comoving  directional  power l'_e, and
          spectral  slope.  The  detection characteristics of a telescope
          are  approximated  by  its  vF_v  sensitivity threshold f_\e at
          photon  frequency  v  =  m_e c^2\e/h. Values of \Gamma and l'_e
          that fit the data for FSRQs and BLs are estimated. Based on the
          EGRET   observations,  predictions  for  the  detectability  of
          blazars  with  GLAST are made. GLAST would detect a much larger
          fraction of BLs in its sample than found with EGRET but that BL
          evolution  must  be  negative in order that BLs not overproduce
          the  gamma-ray  background.  The FSRQ contribution to the EGRET
          extragalactic gamma-ray background is estimated at the level of
          ~  30%.  EGRET  and  GLAST  sensitivities  to blazar flares are
          considered in the optimal case, and a GLAST analysis method for
          blazar flares is outlined.

          Comments: 19 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          High-quality K-band spectra of strongly reddened point sources,
          deeply  embedded in (ultra-) compact HII regions, have revealed
          a  population of 20 young massive stars showing no photospheric
          absorption  lines,  but sometimes strong Br-gamma emission. The
          Br-gamma equivalent widths occupy a wide range (from about 1 to
          over  100  A);  the  line  widths  of  100-200  km/s indicate a
          circumstellar  rather than a nebular origin. The K-band spectra
          exhibit  one  or more features commonly associated with massive
          young   stellar  objects  (YSOs)  surrounded  by  circumstellar
          material:  a  very  red colour (J-K) > 2, CO bandhead emission,
          hydrogen  emission  lines  (sometimes  doubly peaked), and FeII
          and/or MgII emission lines. The massive YSO distribution in the
          CMD  suggests  that  the majority of the objects are of similar
          spectral  type  as  the  Herbig  Be stars, but some of them are
          young O stars.
          The  CO  emission  must  come from a relatively dense (~10^{10}
          cm^{-3}) and hot (T~ 2000-5000 K) region, sufficiently shielded
          from  the intense UV radiation field of the young massive star.
          The  hydrogen emission is produced in an ionised medium exposed
          to  UV  radiation. The best geometrical solution is a dense and
          neutral  circumstellar  disk  causing the CO bandhead emission,
          and  an  ionised  upper  layer  where  the  hydrogen  lines are
          produced.  We  present arguments that the circumstellar disk is
          more  likely a remnant of the accretion process than the result
          of rapid rotation and mass loss such as in Be/B[e] stars.

          Comments: 9 pages, 10 figures
          We  present  the  first  results  from a study designed to test
          whether,  given  high-quality  spectrophotometry  spanning  the
          mid-UV--optical   wavelength   regime,   it   is   possible  to
          distinguish  the  metal  content (Z) and star-formation history
          (sfh)   of   individual  elliptical  galaxies  with  sufficient
          accuracy to establish whether their formation history is linked
          to  their  detailed  morphology and position on the Fundamental
          Plane. From a detailed analysis of UV-optical spectrophotometry
          of  the  `cuspy'  elliptical  galaxy  NGC  3605  and  the giant
          elliptical  NGC  5018 we find that: 1) optical spectra with l >
          3500  A may not contain sufficient data to robustly uncover all
          the stellar populations present in individual galaxies, even in
          such relatively passive objects as ellipticals, 2) the addition
          of  the  UV  data  approaching  l  =  2500  A  holds the key to
          establishing  well-constrained  sfhs, from which we can infer a
          formation  and evolution history which is consistent with their
          photometric  properties,  3) despite the superficial similarity
          of their spectra, the two galaxies have very different `recent'
          sfhs  --  the  smaller,  cuspy  elliptical  NGC 3605 contains a
          high-Z  population  of  age ~= 1 Gyr, and has a position on the
          fundamental  plane  typical  of the product of a low-z gas-rich
          merger  (most  likely  at z ~ 0.08), while the giant elliptical
          NGC  5018,  with  a  sub-solar secondary population, appears to
          have gained its more recent stars via mass transfer / accretion
          of  gas from its spiral companion, 4) despite these differences
          in  detailed history, more than 85% of the stellar mass of both
          galaxies   is   associated  with  an  old  (9-12  Gyr)  stellar
          population  of  near-solar  Z. This pilot study provides strong
          motivation  for  the  construction and analysis of high-quality
          UV-optical  spectra  for  a  substantial  sample of ellipticals
          spanning the Fundamental Plane.

          accepted for publication in A&A
          In  preparation  of  a  study  of the HeII/HI ratio towards the
          bright  QSO  HS1700+6416,  we predict the metal line content of
          the far-UV spectral range by modelling 18 metal absorption line
          systems  with redshifts 0.2<z<2.6 identified in the spectrum of
          this  quasar.  For  that  purpose,  we investigate the spectral
          energy  distribution  of  the  metagalactic  ionizing radiation
          field.  Simple  photoionization  models  based  on  8 different
          shapes  of  the ionizing background are tested for each system.
          The  adopted  energy  distributions comprise the Haardt & Madau
          (2001,  HM)  model  of  metagalactic  UV  background as well as
          typical  spectra  of AGN and starburst galaxies. The models are
          evaluated  and  the favoured one is estimated. We find that the
          majority  of  the  considered systems is best reproduced with a
          HM-like  ionizing  radiation,  where  the  HeII break, formally
          located  at  4  Ryd,  is  shifted  to  lower energies (~3 Ryd),
          probably  due  to  the  opacity of the higher HeII Lyman series
          lines.  The  remaining systems can be reasonably described with
          models  based on the unmodified HM background or the spectra of
          AGN  or starburst galaxies. This finding supports the idea that
          the UV background is spatially variable due to both IGM opacity
          variations and to local sources. In comparison to an unmodified
          HM  background, the resulting ionizing spectrum leads to carbon
          abundances  lower  by  ~0.5  dex.  Furthermore, if the ionizing
          radiation  field  as  determined  from  metal  line systems was
          typical for the IGM, the expected HeII/HI ratio would be 150 to
          190.

          We  present  results  of  a  study  of the Galactic ridge X-ray
          emission   (GRXE)  in  hard  X-rays  performed  with  the  IBIS
          telescope  aboard  INTEGRAL.  The  imaging capabilities of this
          coding  aperture  telescope make it possible to account for the
          flux  from bright Galactic point sources whereas the wide field
          of view permits to collect large flux from the underlying GRXE.
          Extensive  study  of the IBIS/ISGRI detector background allowed
          us  to  construct a model that predicts the detector count rate
          with  $\sim1-2$%  accuracy  in  the  energy band 17-60 keV. The
          derived  longitude  and latitude profiles of the ridge emission
          are  in  good agreement with the Galactic distribution of stars
          obtained  from  infrared  observations.  This,  along  with the
          measured  hard  X-ray  spectrum  of the Galactic ridge emission
          strongly indicates its stellar origin. The derived unit stellar
          mass  emissivity  of  the  ridge  in the energy band 17-60 keV,
          $(0.9  -  1.2)\times 10^{27}$\lummass (assuming a bulge mass of
          $1-1.3  \times  10^{10} M_\odot$) agrees with that of local (in
          the  Solar neigborhood) accreting magnetic white dwarf binaries
          -  dominant  contributors  to  the  GRXE  at these energies. In
          addition,  the  shape of the obtained GRXE spectrum can be used
          to  determine  the average mass of white dwarfs in such systems
          in  the  Galaxy  as  $\sim0.5  M_{\sun}$.  The total hard X-ray
          luminosity    of    the    GRXE    is    $L_{\rm   17-60   keV}
          =(3.7\pm0.2)\times10^{37}$\lum  in  the  17--60  keV  band.  At
          energies  70--200  keV  no additional contribution to the total
          emission of the Galaxy apart from the detected point sources is
          seen.

          Letters
          We report the detection of 21-cm HI absorption towards the core
          of  the  Fanaroff-Riley II radio galaxy 3C452 (J2245+3941). The
          absorption  profile is well resolved into three components; the
          strongest  and  narrowest  component  being coincident with the
          velocity  corresponding  to  [O  III]  emission lines while the
          other two components are blue-shifted with respect to it by ~30
          and  115  km\s.  If the systemic velocity of the host galaxy is
          determined  from  low-ionization  lines,  which are red-shifted
          with  respect  to  the [O III] doublet by about ~200 km\s, then
          both  the  [O  III]  emission  and  21-cm  absorption lines are
          associated  with  outflowing  material.  The  neutral  hydrogen
          column     density    is    estimated    to    be    N(HI)    =
          6.39X10^{20}(T_s/100)(1.0/f_c)  cm^{-2},  where T_s and f_c are
          the  spin  temperature  and  partial coverage of the background
          source  respectively. If the 21-cm absorber is also responsible
          for  the  nuclear  extinction at infrared wavelengths and x-ray
          absorption,  then  for  a  spin  temperature  of  ~8000  K, the
          absorber occults only ~10 per cent of the radio core.

          Anomalous   X-ray   pulsars  (AXPs)  are  neutron  stars  whose
          properties are best explained by the magnetar model. Their very
          large X-ray luminosities exceed those available from braking of
          the  stellar  rotation  by  magnetic  torque, and are generated
          instead   by   decay   of  ultra-strong  magnetic  fields.  The
          ubiquitous  radio  pulsars,  which  are  powered  by rotational
          energy  loss,  display no magnetar-like X-ray activity and have
          enduring  radio emission, while magnetars have lacked any radio
          emission.  XTE  J1810-197  was identified as a transient AXP in
          early  2003  when its X-ray luminosity increased by a factor of
          ~100 compared to the quiescent level, and X-ray pulsations were
          observed with period 5.54s. The detection from XTE J1810-197 of
          a  point-like radio source of unknown origin one year after the
          X-ray   outburst   further  distinguishes  it  from  all  other
          magnetars.  Here  we  show  that XTE J1810-197 emits remarkable
          radio  pulsations.  These are sharply modulated at the rotation
          period  with  peak  flux  density  >1Jy and are highly linearly
          polarised,  conclusively  establishing  the  first detection of
          magnetospheric  radio  emission from a magnetar. In contrast to
          ordinary  pulsars, there is no evidence of radio activity prior
          to  the  2003  X-ray outburst, and the intrinsic flux varies on
          short timescales with an approximately flat spectrum such that,
          at  >20GHz,  XTE  J1810-197  is currently the brightest neutron
          star  known.  This  discovery  provides a unique opportunity to
          probe  in  detail  the  dynamic magnetosphere of a neutron star
          with extreme properties.

          We  report  the  detection  of  HCO+(1-0)  emission towards the
          Cloverleaf  quasar  (z=2.56) through observations with the Very
          Large  Array.  This is the first detection of ionized molecular
          gas  emission  at  high redshift (z>2). HCO+ emission is a star
          formation  indicator  similar  to  HCN, tracing dense molecular
          hydrogen  gas  (n(H_2)  ~=  10^5  cm^{-3})  within star-forming
          molecular  clouds.  We  derive  a  lensing-corrected  HCO+ line
          luminosity  of L'(HCO+) = 3.5 x 10^9 K km/s pc^2. Combining our
          new  results  with CO and HCN measurements from the literature,
          we  find  a  HCO+/CO  luminosity  ratio  of 0.08 and a HCO+/HCN
          luminosity  ratio  of 0.8. These ratios fall within the scatter
          of   the   same  relationships  found  for  low-z  star-forming
          galaxies.  However,  a HCO+/HCN luminosity ratio close to unity
          would  not  be  expected  for  the  Cloverleaf  if the recently
          suggested  relation  between  this  ratio  and the far-infrared
          luminosity  were to hold. We conclude that a ratio between HCO+
          and  HCN  luminosity  close to 1 is likely due to the fact that
          the emission from both lines is optically thick and thermalized
          and  emerges from dense regions of similar volumes. The CO, HCN
          and   HCO+  luminosities  suggest  that  the  Cloverleaf  is  a
          composite AGN--starburst system, in agreement with the previous
          finding that about 20% of the total infrared luminosity in this
          system  results  from dust heated by star formation rather than
          heating by the AGN. We conclude that HCO+ is potentially a good
          tracer for dense molecular gas at high redshift.

          Title:  Penetrating  the  Deep  Cover  of  Compton Thick Active
          Galactic Nuclei
          Authors:  N.  A.  Levenson,  T. M. Heckman, J. H. Krolik, K. A.
          Weaver, P. T. Zycki
          Comments: To appear in ApJ, September 1, 2006
          We   analyze  observations  obtained  with  the  Chandra  X-ray
          Observatory  of  bright  Compton  thick  active galactic nuclei
          (AGNs),  those with column densities in excess of 1.5 x 10^{24}
          cm^{-2}  along  the  lines  of  sight.  We  therefore  view the
          powerful   central  engines  only  indirectly,  even  at  X-ray
          energies.  Using  high  spatial resolution and considering only
          galaxies  that  do  not  contain  circumnuclear  starbursts, we
          reveal   the  variety  of  emission  AGNs  alone  may  produce.
          Approximately  1% of the continuum's intrinsic flux is detected
          in  reflection in each case. The only hard X-ray feature is the
          prominent  Fe  K alpha fluorescence line, with equivalent width
          greater  than  1  keV  in  all  sources. The Fe line luminosity
          provides  the  best X-ray indicator of the unseen intrinsic AGN
          luminosity.  In  detail,  the morphologies of the extended soft
          X-ray  emission and optical line emission are similar, and line
          emission  dominates  the soft X-ray spectra. Thus, we attribute
          the  soft  X-ray  emission to material that the central engines
          photoionize.  Because  the resulting spectra are complex and do
          not reveal the AGNs directly, crude analysis techniques such as
          hardness  ratios  would mis-classify these galaxies as hosts of
          intrinsically  weak, unabsorbed AGNs and would fail to identify
          the  luminous, absorbed nuclei that are present. We demonstrate
          that  a  three-band  X-ray  diagnostic  can  correctly classify
          Compton  thick  AGNs,  even  when  significant  soft X-ray line
          emission  is  present.  The  active  nuclei produce most of the
          galaxies'  total observed emission over a broad spectral range,
          and  much  of  their light emerges at far-infrared wavelengths.
          Stellar  contamination  of the infrared emission can be severe,
          however,   making   long-wavelength   data   alone   unreliable
          indicators of the buried AGN luminosity.

          Title:   The   peculiar  sdB  NGC6121-V46:  A  low-mass  double
          degenerate ellipsoidal variable in a globular cluster

          S. Frandsen, F. Grundahl, H. Bruntt
          The  variable  sdB  known as V46 in the globular cluster M4 has
          remained  enigmatic since its discovery almost 10 years ago. We
          present   here   radial  velocity  measurements  obtained  from
          medium-resolution  VLT/FORS2  spectra  that  show variations at
          twice  the  period of the luminosity changes. This implies that
          the  system  is  an  ellipsoidal variable. Unlike the other sdB
          binaries  of  this  nature,  the fundamental parameters of this
          star  we derive suggest that it lies below the Zero Age Extreme
          Horizontal Branch. From the cluster distance and the gravity we
          determine  the  mass of V46 to be ~0.19Msun. This is too low to
          sustain core helium burning. From the mass function we derive a
          lower  limit for the companion of only 0.26Msun. We discuss the
          star's  origin  in the context of close binary evolution in the
          field and globular clusters.

          Title: The messy environment of Mrk 6
          Authors: N.J. Schurch, R.E. Griffiths, R.S. Warwick
          Comments:  11  pages,  8  figures.  Accepted for publication by
          MNRAS 05/2006
          In  recent  years  it  has  become clear that understanding the
          absorption  present  in  AGN  is essential given its bearing on
          unification  models.  We  present  the  most  recent XMM-Newton
          observation of Mrk 6, with the goal of understanding the nature
          and  origin of the complex absorption intrinsic to this source.
          X-ray  spectral  fitting  shows  that  a simple warm absorption
          model  provides  an  equally good statistical representation of
          the CCD data as a partial covering model. Furthermore, once the
          RGS  data are included in the spectral fitting, the simple warm
          absorber  model  provides  a very good fit to the data, without
          increasing  the  complexity  of the model, in contrast with the
          partial  covering model which requires the addition of either a
          low  metalicity (<0.03 solar) thermal plasma or low temperature
          blackbody  emission  in order to provide a similar quality fit.
          The  warm  absorber  is also a considerably more natural way to
          explain  the variability observed in the X-ray absorbing column
          density  between  the  previous XMM-Newton observation and this
          one,  requiring  only  a  second, higher column density, higher
          ionisation,   absorber   to  be  present  during  the  previous
          XMM-Newton  observation.  In  comparison,  the partial covering
          models which requires moving, clumpy, material relatively close
          to  the source that result in two distinct lines of sight, with
          separate  absorbing columns that each vary considerably without
          any  associated change in their covering fractions, in order to
          explain   the  observed  variability.  We  associate  the  warm
          absorber  either  with an accretion disk wind with densities of
          ~10^9  /cm^3,  or  with  an ionised `skin' or atmosphere of the
          molecular torus with densities of ~10^3 - 10^5 /cm^3.

          Comments:  Accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics as a letter, to
          appear in the special issue on the APEX first results
          Aims:  Our goal is to set constraints on the evolutionary state
          of the dense core Cha-MMS1 in the Chamaeleon I molecular cloud.
          Methods:  We  analyze  molecular  line observations carried out
          with  the new submillimeter telescope APEX. We look for outflow
          signatures  around  the  dense  core  and  probe  its  chemical
          structure,  which  we  compare  to  predictions  of  models  of
          gas-phase  chemistry.  We  also  use the public database of the
          Spitzer  Space Telescope (SST) to compare Cha-MMS1 with the two
          Class 0 protostars IRAM 04191 and L1521F, which are at the same
          distance.  Results:  We measure a large deuterium fractionation
          for N2H+ (11 +/- 3 %), intermediate between the prestellar core
          L1544 and the very young Class 0 protostar L1521F. It is larger
          than  for HCO+ (2.5 +/- 0.9 %), which is probably the result of
          depletion removing HCO+ from the high-density inner region. Our
          CO(3-2) map reveals the presence of a bipolar outflow driven by
          the Class I protostar Ced 110 IRS 4 but we do not find evidence
          for  an  outflow  powered  by  Cha-MMS1.  We  also  report  the
          detection  of  Cha-MMS1  at  24,  70  and  160  microns  by the
          instrument  MIPS  of  the  SST,  at  a level nearly an order of
          magnitude  lower  than  IRAM  04191  and  L1521F.  Conclusions:
          Cha-MMS1  appears  to  have  already  formed  a compact object,
          either  the  first  hydrostatic  core  at  the  very end of the
          prestellar  phase, or an extremely young protostar that has not
          yet  powered  any outflow, at the very beginning of the Class 0
          accretion phase.

          9C  J1503+4528 is a very young CSS radio galaxy, with an age of
          order  10^4 years. This source is therefore an ideal laboratory
          for  the  study  ofthe  intrinsic  host  galaxy/IGM properties,
          interactions  between  the  radio  source  and surrounding ISM,
          links  between  star  formation  and AGN activity and the radio
          source  triggering  mechanism. Here we present the results of a
          spectroscopic  analysis  of  this  source,  considering each of
          these aspects of radio source physics.
          We  find  that  shock  ionization  by the young radio source is
          important  in  the  central  regions  of  the  galaxy on scales
          similar to that of the radio source itself, whilst evidence for
          an  AGN  ionization cone is observed at greater distances. Line
          and  continuum features require the presence of a young stellar
          population,  the  best-fit  model  for  which implies an age of
          5x10^6 years, significantly older than the radio source.
          Most  interestingly,  the  relative  sizes  of radio source and
          extended  emission  line region suggest that both AGN and radio
          source are triggered at approximately the same time.
          If  both  the  triggering  of the radio source activity and the
          formation   of  the  young  stellar  population  had  the  same
          underlying  cause,  this  source  provides  a  sequence for the
          events  surrounding the triggering process. We propose that the
          AGN  activity  in 9C J1503+4528 was causedby a relatively minor
          interaction,  and  that a super-massive black hole powering the
          radio  jets  must  have  been  in  place  before  the  AGN  was
          triggered.

          Nuclei

          Astronomy and Astrophysics (15/05/2006)
          Aims:  Present  a  near-infrared  spectral  atlas  of 47 active
          galactic  nuclei  (AGN),  of  all  degrees  of activity, in the
          wavelength interval of 0.8-2.4 microns, including the fluxes of
          the   observed   emission  lines.  Analyze  the  espectroscopic
          properties  of  the  continuum and emission line spectra of the
          sources.
          Methods: In order to exclude aperture and seeing effects we use
          near-infrared  spectroscopy  in  the short cross-dispersed mode
          (SXD,  0.8-2.4  microns),  taking  simultaneously the JHK-bands
          spectra.
          Results:  We  present  the most extensive NIR spectral atlas of
          AGN  made  up  to date aimed at creating a suitable database to
          study  the  continuum  and  line  emission  properties of these
          objects  in  a  region full of interesting features. Overall we
          conclude  that  the  shape of the continuum of QSOs and Seyfert
          1's are similar, being essentially flat in H and K band, in the
          J band, a strong variation is found. In Seyfert 2 galaxies, the
          continuum  smoothly  decreases  from  1.2  microns  redwards in
          almost  all  sources. In J, it smoothly rises bluewards in some
          sources  while  in  others  a  small decreased is observed. The
          spectra are dominated by strong emission features of H I, He I,
          He  II, [S III] and conspicuous forbidden lines of low and high
          ionization  species.  Molecular lines of H2 are common features
          to  most objects. The absence of O I and Fe II lines in Seyfert
          2  galaxies  give  observational support to the fact that these
          lines  are  formated in the outermost portion of the broad line
          region. [P II] and coronal lines are detected in all degrees of
          activity.  The  [Fe  II] 12570A/16436\A line ratio becomes as a
          reliable reddening indicator for Seyfert galaxies.

          We  present  the  first Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS; The
          IRS  was a collaborative venture between Cornell University and

          Propulsion   Laboratory   and   the   Ames   Research  Center.)
          observations  of  the  disks  around  classical  T Tauri stars:
          spectra  in  the  5.2-30 micron range of six stars. The spectra
          are  dominated  by  emission  features  from amorphous silicate
          dust,  and  a  continuous component from 5 to 8 microns that in
          most cases comprises an excess above the photosphere throughout
          our  spectral  range.  There  is  considerable variation in the
          silicate  feature/continuum  ratio, which implies variations of
          inclination,  disk flaring, and stellar mass accretion rate. In
          most  of  our stars, structure in the silicate feature suggests
          the presence of a crystalline component. In one, CoKu Tau/4, no
          excess  above  the photosphere appears at wavelengths shortward
          of  the  silicate  features,  similar to 10 Myr old TW Hya, Hen
          3-600,  and  HR 4796A. This indicates the optically thick inner
          disk  is  largely  absent.  The silicate emission features with
          peaks  at  9.7  and  18  microns indicate small dust grains are
          present.  The  extremely  low 10-20 micron color temperature of
          the dust excess, 135 K, indicates these grains are located more
          than  10  AU  from  the  star. These features are suggestive of
          gravitational  influence by planets or close stellar companions
          and  grain  growth  in  the  region  within  10 AU of the star,
          somewhat surprising for a star this young (1 Myr).

          The  taxonomy  of optical emission detected during the critical
          first  few  minutes  after the onset of a gamma-ray burst (GRB)
          defines  two  broad classes: prompt optical emission correlated
          with  prompt  gamma-ray  emission,  and early optical afterglow
          emission uncorrelated with the gamma-ray emission. The standard
          theoretical   interpretation   attributes  prompt  emission  to
          internal  shocks in the ultra-relativistic outflow generated by
          the  internal engine; early afterglow emission is attributed to
          shocks  generated  by  interaction with the surrounding medium.
          Here  we  report  on observations of a bright GRB that, for the
          first time, clearly show the temporal relationship and relative
          strength  of  the  two  optical  components.  The  observations
          indicate  that  early  afterglow  emission can be understood as
          reverberation  of the energy input measured by prompt emission.
          Measurements  of  the  early afterglow reverberations therefore
          probe  the  structure  of  the  environment  around  the burst,
          whereas  the  subsequent response to late-time impulsive energy
          releases  reveals how earlier flaring episodes have altered the
          jet  and environment parameters. Many GRBs are generated by the
          death  of  massive  stars  that  were  born and died before the
          Universe  was ten per cent of its current age, so GRB afterglow
          reverberations provide clues about the environments around some
          of the first stars.

          Title:  On  the  dynamical  evolution  of hot spots in powerful
          radio loud AGNs
          Authors: N. Kawakatu, M. Kino
          Comments: 6 pages, 1 figure, accepted MNRAS
          We  describe  the  dynamical  evolution  of hot spots velocity,
          pressure  and mass density in radio loud active galactic nuclei
          (AGNs),  taking  proper account of (1) the conservations of the
          mass,  momentum,  and kinetic energy flux of the unshocked jet,
          (2)  the deceleration process of the jet by shocks, and (3) the
          cocoon  expansion without assuming the constant aspect ratio of
          the  cocoon.  By  the  detailed comparison with two dimensional
          relativistic  hydrodynamic  simulations, we show that our model
          well  reproduces  the whole evolution of relativistic jets. Our
          model   can  explain  also  the  observational  trends  of  the
          velocity, the pressure, the size, and mass density of hot spots
          in compact symmetric objects (CSOs) and FR II radio galaxies.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ, 9 pages, 9 figures
          New  interferometric  observations  of  SiO J=5-4 circumstellar
          line  emission  around  the  carbon  star  IRC+10216, using the
          Submillimeter    Array,    are   presented.   Complemented   by
          multi-transition  single-dish  observations, including infrared
          observations  of ro-vibrational transitions, detailed radiative
          transfer  modelling  suggests  that the fractional abundance of
          SiO  in  the  inner part of the envelope, between approximately
          3-8  stellar  radii, is as high as 1.5E-6. This is more than an
          order of magnitude higher than predicted by equilibrium stellar
          atmosphere   chemistry   in   a   carbon-rich  environment  and
          indicative  of the importance of non-LTE chemical processes. In
          addition  to  the  compact component, a spatially more extended
          (2.4E16   cm)   low-fractional-abundance   (1.7E-7)  region  is
          required  to  fit  the  observations.  This  suggests  that the
          majority  of  the  SiO  molecules are effectively accreted onto
          dust  grains  in  the  inner wind while the remaining gas-phase
          molecules  are eventually photodissociated at larger distances.
          Evidence  of  departure  from  a  smooth  wind  is found in the
          observed  visibilities,  indicative  of density variations of a
          factor 2 to 5 on an angular scale corresponding to a time scale
          of  about  200 years. Additionally, constraints on the velocity
          structure of the wind are obtained.

          X-rays from accreting neutron stars
          Authors:  Didier  Barret  (CESR, Toulouse), Jean-Francois Olive

          Comments:  Accepted  for  publication  in  MNRAS,  8  pages,  8
          figures, figure 1 in color
          We  study  in  a systematic way the quality factor of the lower
          and  upper  kHz QPOs in a sample of low luminosity neutron star
          X-ray binaries, showing both QPOs varying over a wide frequency
          range.  The  sample  includes  4U  1636-536,  4U  1608-522,  4U
          1735-44,  4U  1728-34, 4U 1820-303 and 4U 0614+09. We find that
          all  sources  except 4U 0614+091 show evidence of a drop in the
          quality  factor  of their lower kHz QPOs at high frequency. For
          4U  0614+091  only the rising part of the quality factor versus
          frequency  curve  has been sampled so far. At the same time, in
          all  sources  but  4U  1728-34, the quality factor of the upper
          kilo-Hz  QPO  increases  all  the way to the highest detectable
          frequencies. We show that the high-frequency behaviours of both
          the lower and upper kHz QPO quality factors are consistent with
          what  is expected if the drop is produced by the approach of an
          active  oscillating  region  to  the  innermost stable circular
          orbit:  the  existence  of  which  is  a key feature of General
          Relativity   in   the   strong   field   regime.   Within  this
          interpretation, our results imply gravitational masses around 2
          solar masses for the neutron stars in those systems.

          Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, submitted to MNRAS
          We  present  Chandra  and  XMM-Newton  X-ray  observations that
          monitor  the  neutron  star  cooling  of  the  quasi-persistent
          neutron  star  X-ray transients KS 1731-260 and MXB 1659-29 for
          approximately   4   years   after  these  sources  returned  to
          quiescence  from  prolonged  outbursts.  In  both  sources  the
          outbursts  were  long  enough to significantly heat the neutron
          star  crust  out  of  thermal  equilibrium  with  the core. The
          results  of our analysis strengthen the preliminary findings of
          Wijnands  et  al.  that  in both sources the neutron star crust
          cools   down  very  rapidly  suggesting  it  has  a  high  heat
          conductivity  and  that the neutron star core requires enhanced
          core   cooling   processes.  Importantly,  we  now  detect  the
          flattening  of the cooling in both sources as the crust returns
          to  thermal  equilibrium  with the core. We measure the thermal
          equilbrium  flux  and  temperature in both sources by fitting a
          curve  that  decays  exponentially  to  a  constant  level. The
          cooling  curves  cannot  be  fit with just a simple exponential
          decay  without  the  constant  offset.  We  find  the  constant
          bolometric flux and effective temperature components to be (9.6
          +/- 0.9)E-14 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 and 71.3 +/- 1.6 eV in KS 1731-260
          and  (1.8  +/-  0.3)E-14 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 and 52.1 +/- 1.6 eV in
          MXB 1659-29. In addition, we find that the crust of KS 1731-260
          cools faster than that of MXB 1659-29 by a factor of ~2, likely
          due  to  different  crustal  properties. This is the first time
          that   the  cooling  of  a  neutron  star  crust  into  thermal
          equilibrium with the core has been observed in such detail.

          Title:  Spectral  and  variability  properties  of LS 5039 from
          radio to very high-energy gamma-rays
          Authors: V. Bosch-Ramon, J. M. Paredes, G. E. Romero
          Comments:  3  pages,  3  figures,  1  Table. Proceedings of the
          conference: Relativistic Astrophysics and Cosmology: Einstein's
          Legacy
          Microquasars  are  X-ray  binaries  with relativistic jets. The
          microquasar  LS  5039  turned  out  to be the first high-energy
          gamma-ray  microquasar  candidate due to its likely association
          with  the  EGRET  source  3EG  J1824-1514.  Further theoretical
          studies  supported this association, which could be extended to
          other  EGRET  sources.  Very  recently, Aharonian et al. (2005)
          have  communicated  the detection of the microquasar LS 5039 at
          TeV  energies.  This fact confirms the EGRET source association
          and leaves no doubt about the gamma-ray emitting nature of this
          object. The aim of the present work is to show that, applying a
          cold-matter  dominated  jet  model to LS 5039, we can reproduce
          many  of the spectral and variability features observed in this
          source.  Jet  physics is explored, and some physical quantities
          are  estimated  as  a  by-product  of  the  performed modeling.
          Although  at  the  moment only LS 5039 has been detected on the
          entire electromagnetic spectrum, it does not seem unlikely that
          other  microquasars  will  show  similar  spectral  properties.
          Therefore,   an   in-depth   study   of   the  first  gamma-ray
          microquasar,  on theoretical grounds supported by observations,
          can render a useful knowledge applicable elsewhere.

          The  energy  range  above  60 keV is important for the study of
          many open problems in high energy astrophysics such as the role
          of  Inverse  Compton  with  respect  to  synchrotron or thermal
          processes  in GRBs, non thermal mechanisms in SNR, the study of
          the  high  energy cut-offs in AGN spectra, and the detection of
          nuclear  and  annihilation  lines.  Recently the development of
          high energy Laue lenses with broad energy bandpasses from 60 to
          600  keV have been proposed for a Hard X ray focusing Telescope
          (HAXTEL)  in  order  to  study the X-ray continuum of celestial
          sources.  The  required  focal  plane detector should have high
          detection efficiency over the entire operative range, a spatial
          resolution  of about 1 mm, an energy resolution of a few keV at
          500 keV and a sensitivity to linear polarization. We describe a
          possible  configuration  of  the  focal plane detector based on
          several  CdTe/CZT  pixelated layers stacked together to achieve
          the  required  detection  efficiency at high energy. Each layer
          can  operate both as a separate position sensitive detector and
          polarimeter  or  work with other layers to increase the overall
          photopeak efficiency. Each layer has a hexagonal shape in order
          to  minimize  the  detector  surface required to cover the lens
          field of view. The pixels would have the same geometry so as to
          provide  the  best coupling with the lens point spread function
          and to increase the symmetry for polarimetric studies.

          Title:  Detection  of  the  radial  velocity curve of the B5-A0
          supergiant companion star of Cir X-1?
          Authors: P.G. Jonker, G. Nelemans, C.G. Bassa
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          In  this  Paper  we  report  on  phase  resolved I-band optical
          spectroscopic  and photometric observations of Cir X-1 obtained
          with  the  Very  Large  Telescope. The spectra are dominated by
          Paschen  absorption  lines  at nearly all orbital phases except
          near  phase  zero  (coinciding  with  the  X-ray  dip) when the
          absorption lines are filled-in by broad Paschen emission lines.
          The  radial  velocity curve of the absorption lines corresponds
          to  an  eccentric  orbit  (e=0.45)  whose  period  and  time of
          periastron  passage  are  consistent  with the period and phase
          predicted by the most recent X-ray dip ephemeris. We found that
          the  I-band  magnitude  is  consistent  with  being constant at
          I=17.6    in   the   binary   phase   interval   0.1-0.6.   The
          source-brightness  peaks  at I=16.7-16.9 at phase 0.9-1.0. This
          I-band  brightening coincides in phase with the X-ray dip. Even
          though  it  is  likely  that  the  absorption  line spectrum is
          associated  with  the  companion  star  of  Cir  X-1, we cannot
          exclude  the  possibility  that  the spectrum originates in the
          accretion  disc. If the spectrum belongs to the companion star,
          it  must  be  a  supergiant  of  spectral type B5-A0. Under the
          assumption  that  the compact object is a 1.4 Msun neutron star
          and  that  it  does  not  move  through  the  companion star at
          periastron,  the companion star mass is constrained to ~<2 Msun
          and  the orbital inclination to i~< 27 degrees. In principle, a
          mass  of  ~2  Msun  is too low for a supergiant, although it is
          conceivable  that tidal effects have heated and enlarged a star
          of  lower mass to resemble a supergiant. Furthermore, mass loss
          will  have  reduced  the  companion  star  mass.  The stringent
          constraint on the companion star mass is alleviated if the mass
          of  the  compact  object is higher than 1.4 Msun. For a 10 Msun
          compact  object  the  companion  star mass is more in line with
          that expected for a B5-A0 supergiant (abridged).

          Context:  To  follow  the  early  evolution of stars we need to
          understand  how  young  stars  accrete  and  eject  mass. It is
          generally  assumed that the FU Orionis phenomenon is related to
          the variations in the disk accretion, but many questions remain
          still  open, in particular because of the rarity of FU Ori type
          stars.
          Aims:  We  explore here the characteristics of the outburst and
          of  the  environment  of one new object, discovered recently in
          the  in  the  active  star  formation region containing RNO127,
          within the Cygnus OB7 dark cloud complex.
          Methods:  We  present  an  extensive  optical and near-infrared
          study  of  a  new candidate of FU Orionis object, including its
          direct   imaging,   spectroscopy   and   scanning   Fabry-Perot
          interferometry.
          Results:  The  source,  associated with the variable reflection
          nebula,  underwent  prodigious  outburst.  The  "Braid" nebula,
          which  appeared  in 2000, as is indicated by its name, consists
          of  two  intertwined  features,  illuminated  by  the outburst.
          Subsequent  NIR  observations revealed the bright source, which
          was  not visible on 2MASS images, and its estimated brightening
          was  more than 4 magnitudes. Optical and infrared spectral data
          show  features,  which  are  necessary  for  the  system  to be
          referred to as a FUor object. The bipolar optical flow directed
          by  the  axis  of nebula also was found. Various estimates give
          the  November/December  1999  as the most probable date for the
          eruption.

          Aims:To  obtain insight into the physical structure of the warm
          gas  in  the  inner  envelope of protostars and the interaction
          with the outflow. Methods: Sub-millimeter observations of 12CO,
          13CO  and/or  C18O in J=3-2, J=4-3 and J=7-6 were obtained with
          the  APEX  Telescope  towards  IRAS 12496-7650, an intermediate
          mass  young  stellar  object.  The data are compared to ISO-LWS
          observations  of  CO  J=14-13  up  to J=19-18 lines to test the
          different  proposed  origins  of  the  CO  lines.  Results: The
          outflow  is  prominently detected in the 3-2 and 4-3 lines, but
          not  seen  at  similar velocities in the 7-6 line, constraining
          the  temperature  in  the  high-velocity  (>  5  km/s from line
          center)  gas  to  less than 50 K, much lower than inferred from
          the  analysis  of  the ISO-LWS data. In addition, no isothermal
          gas  model  can  reproduce the emission in both the 7-6 and the
          higher-J  ISO-LWS lines.The 7-6 line probably originates in the
          inner  (<250  AU)  region  of  the envelope at ~150 K. Detailed
          radiative  transfer calculations suggest that the ISO-LWS lines
          are  excited  by a different mechanism, possibly related to the
          larger-scale outflow. All possible mechanisms on scales smaller
          than  8  "  are  excluded. High-resolution continuum as well as
          high-J  12CO  and  isotopic  line  mapping are needed to better
          constrain  the  structure of the warm gas in the inner envelope
          and the interaction with the outflow.

          oscillations  at  the  frequency ~ 95 Hz during a thermonuclear
          X-ray  burst.  This is the first such finding from this source,
          which  suggests  that the spin frequency of the neutron star in
          XB  1254-690  is ~ 95 Hz. We discuss that, if confirmed, such a
          low spin frequency will be useful for the detection of spectral
          lines from the surface of the neutron star.

          Title:  Black Hole-Neutron Star Binary Merger Calculations: GRB
          Progenitors and the Stability of Mass Transfer

          We  have  calculated  the first dynamical evolutions of merging
          black  hole-neutron  star  binaries  that  treat  the  combined
          spacetime  in a nonperturbative general relativistic framework.
          Using the conformal flatness approximation, we have studied how
          the location of the tidal disruption radius with respect to the
          the  black  hole  horizon  and  innermost stable circular orbit
          (ISCO)  affects  the qualitative evolution of the system. Based
          on  simple  arguments,  we  show  that  for a binary mass ratio
          q>~0.24,  tidal  disruption  occurs outside the ISCO, while the
          opposite  is  true  for  q<~0.24.  When tidal disruption occurs
          sufficiently far outside the ISCO, mass is transferred unstably
          from  the  neutron  star  to  the  black hole, resulting in the
          complete  disruption of the neutron star. When tidal disruption
          occurs  slightly within the ISCO, we find that some of the mass
          forms  an  extremely  hot  disk  around  the  black  hole.  The
          resulting  configurations in this case are excellent candidates
          for the progenitors of short-hard gamma ray bursts.

          IC  2163  and  NGC 2207 are interacting galaxies that have been
          well  studied at optical and radio wavelengths and simulated in
          numerical  models  to  reproduce  the  observed  kinematics and
          morphological  features.  Spitzer  IRAC  and  MIPS observations
          reported  here  show  over  200  bright  clumps from young star
          complexes. The brightest IR clump is a morphologically peculiar
          region  of  star formation in the western arm of NGC 2207. This
          clump,  which dominates the Halpha and radio continuum emission
          from both galaxies, accounts for ~12% of the total 24mu m flux.
          Nearly  half  of  the  clumps  are  regularly spaced along some
          filamentary structure, whether in the starburst oval of IC 2163
          or in the thin spiral arms of NGC 2207. This regularity appears
          to influence the clump luminosity function, making it peaked at
          a  value  nearly  a  factor of 10 above the completeness limit,
          particularly  in the starburst oval. This is unlike the optical
          clusters  inside  the  clumps, which have a luminosity function
          consistent  with  the usual power law form. The giant IR clumps
          presumably   formed   by  gravitational  instabilities  in  the
          compressed  gas  of  the  oval and the spiral arms, whereas the
          individual  clusters  formed by more chaotic processes, such as
          turbulence compression, inside these larger-scale structures.

          Title:  Modelling  galaxy  spectra  in presence of interstellar
          dust. II. From the UV to the far infrared
          Authors: Lorenzo Piovan, Rosaria Tantalo, Cesare Chiosi
          Comments: 28 pages, 23 figures and 1 table. Accepted by MNRAS
          In   this  paper,  we  present  spectrophotometric  models  for
          galaxies  of different morphological type whose spectral energy
          distributions  (SEDs)  take  into account the effect of dust in
          absorbing  UV-optical  light and re-emitting it in the infrared
          (IR). The models contain three main components: (i) the diffuse
          interstellar  medium  (ISM)  composed of gas and dust, (ii) the
          large  complexes  of  molecular clouds (MCs) in which new stars
          are  formed  and  (iii)  the  stars  of  any  age  and chemical
          composition.  The  galaxy  models  stand  on  a robust model of
          chemical  evolution  taylored  in such a way to match the gross
          properties  of  galaxies  of  different  morphological  type. A
          simple  geometrical  model  is adopted for each type of galaxy.
          The  total gas and star mass provided by the chemical model are
          distributed  over the whole volume by means of suitable density
          profiles,  one  for  each component and depending on the galaxy
          type (spheroidal, disk and disk plus bulge). The galaxy is then
          split  in  suitable  volume  elements  to  each  of  which  the
          appropriate  amounts  of  stars,  MCs  and ISM are assigned. We
          derive  the  SEDs  of galaxies of different morphological type.
          First  the  the basic relations driving the interaction between
          the  physical  components  of the galaxy are presented. Second,
          the  main  parameters are examined and their effects on the SED
          of  three  prototype  galaxies  (a  disk,  an  elliptical and a
          starburster)  are  highlighted.  The final part of the paper is
          devoted   to  assess  the  ability  of  our  galaxy  models  in
          reproducing  the  SEDs  of  a  few  real  galaxies of the Local
          Universe.

          The  behavior  of  the  aromatic  features  as  a  function  of
          metallicity/radiation  field  hardness  in M101 HII regions and
          starburst  galaxies  is investigated using Spitzer/IRS spectra.
          These  spectra  reveal  that  the 6.2, 7.8+8.6, and 11.3 micron
          aromatics  have different dependencies on metallicity/radiation
          field  hardness.  Specifically,  the  6.2  and  7.8+8.6  micron
          aromatics  are weak or absent at a metallicity, 12+log(O/H), of
          approx.  8.0  while  the 11.3 micron feature remains relatively
          strong.  These  results  apply to both the M101 HII regions and
          starbursts showing that HII regions can indeed be thought of as
          ``mini-starbursts.''  Comparison  of  this  work  with  various
          candidate  materials results in a good match with the annealing
          behavior  in  Quenched Carbonaceous Composite (QCC) which is an
          amorphous, hydrogenated, carbonaceous solid.

          Comments: 31 pages, 8 figures, accepted by AJ
          We  present  the  results  of  our optical monitoring of the BL
          Lacertae  object  OJ  287  during  the  first half of 2005. The
          source  did  not  show  large-amplitude  variations during this
          period  and  was  in  a  relatively quiescent state. A possible
          period  of  40  days was derived from its light curves in three
          BATC    wavebands.   A   bluer-when-brighter   chromatism   was
          discovered,  which is different from the extremely stable color
          during  the outburst in 1994--96. The different color behaviors
          imply different variation mechanisms in the two states. We then
          re-visited  the  optical  data on OJ 287 from the OJ-94 project
          and  found  as well a probable period of 40 days in its optical
          variability  during the late-1994 outburst. The results suggest
          that  two  components  contribute  to the variability of OJ 287
          during  its  outburst  state. The first component is the normal
          {\sl blazar} variation. This component has an amplitude similar
          to  that  of  the  quiescent state and also may share a similar
          periodicity.   The   second   component   can  be  taken  as  a
          `low-frequency  modulation'  to  the first component. It may be
          induced by the interaction of the assumed binary black holes in
          the  center of this object. The 40-day period may be related to
          the  helical structure of the magnetic field at the base of the
          jet,  or  to  the  orbital  motion close to the central primary
          black hole.

          Authors: MAGIC Collaboration: J. Albert, et al
          Comments: 11 pages with 4 figures
          Microquasars   are   binary   star  systems  with  relativistic
          radio-emitting  jets. They are potential sources of cosmic rays
          and  laboratories  for  elucidating the physics of relativistic
          jets.  Here  we  report  the  detection  of  variable gamma-ray
          emission above 100 gigaelectron volts from the microquasar LS I
          +61  303.  Six orbital cycles were recorded. Several detections
          occur  at  a  similar orbital phase, suggesting the emission is
          periodic. The strongest gamma-ray emission is not observed when
          the  two  stars  are  closest to one another, implying a strong
          orbital modulation of the emission or the absorption processes.

          Title:   The   planets   capture  model  of  V838  Monocerotis:
          conclusions for the penetration depth of the planet/s
          Authors: Alon Retter, Bing Zhang, Lionel Siess, Amir Levinson
          Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures, MNRAS, accepted
          V838   Mon  is  the  prototype  of  a  new  class  of  objects.
          Understanding  the  nature  of  its  multi-stage  outburst  and
          similar  systems is challenging. So far, several scenarios have
          been  invoked to explain this group of stars. In this work, the
          planets-swallowing  model for V838 Mon is further investigated,
          taking  into  account  the findings that the progenitor is most
          likely  a massive B type star. We find that the super-Eddington
          luminosity  during  the  eruption  can  explain the fast rising
          times  of  the  three peaks in the optical light curve. We used
          two  different  methods  to  estimate  the  location  where the
          planets  were  consumed.  There is a nice agreement between the
          values  obtained  from  the  luminosities of the peaks and from
          their  rising  time  scale.  We  estimate that the planets were
          stopped  at  a  typical  distance  of one solar radius from the
          center  of  the  host  giant  star. The planets-devouring model
          seems  to  give  a satisfying explanation to the differences in
          the  luminosities  and  rising  times of the three peaks in the
          optical  light curve of V838 Mon. The peaks may be explained by
          the  consumption  of  three  planets  or alternatively by three
          steps  in  the  terminal falling process of a single planet. We
          argue  that  only  the binary merger and the planets-swallowing
          models  are consistent with the observations of the new type of
          stars defined by V838 Mon.

          Title:  Reconciling  optical and X-ray mass estimates: the case
          of the elliptical galaxy NGC3379
          Authors: S. Pellegrini, L. Ciotti
          Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          NGC3379  is  a well studied nearby elliptical for which optical
          investigations  have  claimed  a little dark matter content, or
          even  no dark matter. Recently, its total mass profile M(r) has
          been derived by exploiting Chandra observations of its extended
          and X-ray emitting interstellar medium, based on the hypothesis
          of hydrostatic equilibrium for the hot gas. The resulting total
          mass  within  the  effective radius Re has been claimed to be a
          few  times  larger  than found by optical studies. Here we show
          that  part of the discrepancy can be due to an underestimate of
          the  optically derived mass, and the remaining discrepancy of a
          factor  of  ~2  can be explained by deviations from hydrostatic
          equilibrium of the hot gas. By using hydrodynamical simulations
          tailored  to  reproduce  the  observed  hot  gas  properties of
          NGC3379, and by assuming as input for the simulations the total
          mass  profile derived optically, we show that i) the hot gas at
          the  present  time  has  X-ray properties consistent with those
          observed  only  if  it  is outflowing over most of the galactic
          body,  and  ii)  an overestimate of M of the same size found in
          the   recent   X-ray   analysis   is  recovered  when  assuming
          hydrostatic  equilibrium.  We  also  show  that  the hot gas is
          outflowing  even  for a dark matter fraction within Re as large
          as  derived  with  the  standard  X-ray  procedure based on the
          hydrostatic    equilibrium    assumption,   which   shows   the
          unapplicability of the method for this galaxy. Finally, we find
          that  the  whole  range  of  dark  mass amount and distribution
          allowed  for  by  optical  studies is compatible with a hot gas
          flow with the observed X-ray properties.

          One  of the most recent discoveries of the INTEGRAL observatory
          is  the  existence  of a previously unknown population of X-ray
          sources  in  the inner arms of the Galaxy. IGR J17544-2619, IGR
          J16465-4507 and XTE J1739-302 are among these sources. Although
          the   nature   of  these  systems  is  still  unexplained,  the
          investigations  of the optical/NIR counterparts of the two last
          sources, combined with high energy data, have provided evidence
          of  them  being  highly  absorbed high mass X-ray binaries with
          blue supergiant secondaries and displaying fast X-ray transient
          behaviour. In this work we present our optical/NIR observations
          of IGR J17544-2619, aimed at identifying and characterizing its
          counterpart.  We  show  that  the  source  is a high mass X-ray
          binary  at  a distance of 2-4 kpc with a strongly absorbed O9Ib
          secondary, and discuss the nature of the system.

          Radiative transfer in a clumped winds is used to describe X-ray
          emission  line profiles observed in the XMM-Newton RGS spectrum
          of  the  OI  star  Zeta  Puppis.  It  is  shown that this X-ray
          spectrum    can    be   explained   as   originating   from   a
          multi-temperature   collisional  plasma  located  in  the  wind
          acceleration  zone.  The  X-rays  are attenuated in the clumped
          stellar  wind,  which  gives  characteristic  profiles  to  the
          emergent  lines.  We specifically study the N VII emission line
          in the spectrum of Zeta Pup. Long RGS exposures reveal that the
          N  VII line profile is structured. On the basis of our Zeta Pup
          atmosphere model, we rule out the presence of N VII in the cool
          wind  component.  We  suggest  that  the  detailed  N  VII line
          structure  is  due  to  self-absorption in the hot plasma. Wind
          clumping  also  affects  the  transfer of ionizing radiation in
          high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). We derive analytical formulae
          for the ionisation parameter in dependence on the parameters of
          wind clumping.

          We   present  a  systematic  analysis  of  archival  HST  WFPC2
          ``Association''  data  sets  that  correlate  with  the Chandra
          positions of a set of 44 ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) of
          nearby  galaxies.  We  have  improved  the Chandra-HST relative
          astrometry  whenever  possible.  Disparate numbers of potential
          ULX  counterparts  are found, and in some cases none are found.
          The  lack of or low number of counterparts in some cases may be
          due  to insufficient depth in the WFPC2 images. Particularly in
          late-type  galaxies,  the HST image in the ULX region was often
          complex  or crowded. We therefore address various scenarios for
          the  nature  of the ULX since it is not known which, if any, of
          the   sources   found   are   true  counterparts.  The  optical
          luminosities  of  the sources are typically in the range 10^4-6
          L_sun.  In  several  cases color information is available, with
          the  colors  roughly  tending  to  be  more  red  in early-type
          galaxies.  This  suggests  that,  in  general,  the (potential)
          counterparts  found  in  early-type  galaxies  are likely to be
          older  stellar populations, and are probably globular clusters.
          Several  early-type galaxy counterparts have blue colors, which
          may be due to younger stellar populations in the host galaxies,
          however  these  could  also  be  background  sources. In spiral
          galaxies  the sources may also be due to localized structure in
          the disks rather than bound stellar systems. Alternatively some
          of  the  counterparts  in  late-type  galaxies  may be isolated
          supergiant  stars.  The  observed  X-ray/optical  flux ratio is
          diluted  by  the optical emission of the cluster in cases where
          the system is an X-ray binary in a cluster, particularly in the
          case of a low-mass X-ray binaries in old cluster. (abridged)

          The  mean  spectrum and burst statistics of gravitational waves
          produced  by  a  cosmological population of cosmic string loops
          are  estimated  using  analytic approximations, calibrated with
          earlier   simulations.   Formulas   are   derived  showing  the
          dependence  of observables on the string tension, in the regime
          where  newly-formed  loops  are relatively large, not very much
          smaller  than  the  horizon. Large loops form earlier, are more
          abundant, and generate a more intense stochastic background and
          more   frequent  bursts  than  assumed  in  earlier  background
          estimates, enabling experiments to probe lighter cosmic strings
          of  interest  to  string  theory. Predictions are compared with
          instrument  noise from current and future experiments, and with
          confusion  noise  from  known  astrophysical gravitational wave
          sources  such  as  stellar  and massive black hole binaries. In
          these  large-loop  models, current data from millisecond pulsar
          timing  already  suggests  that  the tension is less than about
          $10^{-10}$,  a  typical  value  expected  in strings from brane
          inflation.  LISA  will  be  sensitive to stochastic backgrounds
          created  by  strings  as  light  as  $G\mu\approx 10^{-15}$, at
          frequencies  where it is limited by confusion noise of Galactic
          stellar  populations;  however,  for  those lightest detectable
          strings, bursts are rarely detectable.

          Title: A warped m=2 water maser disc in V778 Cyg?
          Authors:   Natalia   Babkovskaia,  Juri  Poutanen,  Anita  M.S.

          publication in MNRAS
          The  silicate  carbon star V778 Cyg is a source of 22 GHz water
          maser   emission   which   was  recently  resolved  by  MERLIN.
          Observations revealed an elongated S-like structure along which
          the  velocities  of the maser features show a linear dependence
          on   the   impact   parameter.   This   is  consistent  with  a
          doubly-warped  m=2  disc  observed  edge-on.  Water  masers and
          silicate dust emission (detected by IRAS and ISO) have a common
          origin  in  O-rich  material and are likely to be co-located in
          the  disc.  We  propose  a  detailed self-consistent model of a
          masing gas-dust disc around a companion to the carbon star in a
          binary  system,  which allows us to estimate the companion mass
          of  1.7  +-  0.1  M_sun,  the  disc radius of 40 +-3 AU and the
          distance  between  companions  of about 80 AU. Using a dust-gas
          coupling  model  for water masing, we calculate the maser power
          self-consistently,  accounting  for  both  the gas and the dust
          energy  balances.  Comparing  the  simulation  results with the
          observational  data,  we deduce the main physical parameters of
          the  masing  disc,  such  as  the gas and dust temperatures and
          their  densities.  We also present an analysis of the stability
          of the disc.

          We  present  SEDs, Spitzer colours, and IR luminosities for 850
          micron  selected  galaxies in the GOODS-N field. Using the deep
          Spitzer  Legacy  images  and  new  data  and  reductions of the
          VLA-HDF  radio  data, we find statistically secure counterparts
          for  60  per  cent  (21/35)  of  our submm sample, and identify
          tentative  counterparts  for  another  12  objects. This is the
          largest  sample  of  submm  galaxies  with statistically secure
          counterparts  detected  in  the radio and with Spitzer. We find
          that  in  most  cases the 850 micron emission is dominated by a
          single  24 micron source. A composite rest-frame SED shows that
          the  submm  sources  peak  at  longer wavelengths than those of
          local  ULIRGs of the same luminosity and therefore appear to be
          cooler.  The  SEDs  of  submm  galaxies are also different from
          those  of  their high redshift neighbours, the near-IR selected
          BzK galaxies, whose mid-IR to radio SEDs are more like those of
          local   ULIRGs.  Using  24  micron.  850  micron  and  1.4  GHz
          observations,  we  fit  templates  that span the mid-IR through
          radio  to  derived  the  integrated  IR luminosity of the submm
          galaxies. By themselves, 24 micron and radio fluxes are able to
          predict   LIR  reasonably  well  because  they  are  relatively
          insensitive  to  temperature. However, the submm flux by itself
          consistently  overpredicts  LIR  when  using spectral templates
          which obey the local ULIRG temperature-luminosity relation. The
          shorter  Spitzer  wavelengths  sample  the  stellar bump at the
          redshifts  of  the  submm sources, and we find that the Spitzer
          photometry  alone  provides a model independent estimate of the
          redshift.  Using  X-ray and mid-IR data, only 5 per cent of our
          secure counterparts show strong evidence for an active galactic
          nucleus dominating the IR luminosity.

          We  test  the  physical  model  of the relativistic jets in the
          galactic  X-ray  binary  SS  433 proposed in our previous paper
          using  additional  observations  from  the  Chandra High Energy
          Transmission  Grating  Spectrometer.  These observations sample
          two   new   orbital/precessional  phase  combinations.  In  the
          observation  near  orbital  phase  zero,  the H- and He-like Fe
          lines  from  both  receding and approaching jets are comparably
          strong and unocculted while the He-like Si line of the receding
          jet  is  significantly weaker than that of the approaching jet.
          This  condition  may imply the cooler parts of the receding jet
          are  eclipsed  by  the  companion. The X-ray spectrum from this
          observation has broader emission lines than obtained in Paper I
          that may arise from the divergence of a conical outflow or from
          Doppler  shift  variations during the observation. Using recent
          optical  results,  along  with  the  length  of  the unobscured
          portion  of  the  receding  jet  assuming adiabatic cooling, we
          calculate  the  radius  of the companion to be 9.6+/-1.0 R_sun,
          about  one  third of the Roche lobe radius. For a main sequence
          star,  this  corresponds  to  a companion mass of 35+/-7 M_sun,
          giving  a  primary source mass of 20+/-5 M_sun. If our model is
          correct,  this  calculation  indicates  the compact object is a
          black  hole,  and accretion occurs through a wind process. In a
          subsequent paper, we will examine the validity of the adiabatic
          cooling model of the jets and test the mode of line broadening.

          We  present  the  results  of  a  Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS
          imaging  survey  of  22  T-type  field  brown  dwarfs. Five are
          resolved   as   binary  systems  with  angular  separations  of
          0"05-0"35,  and  companionship  is  established on the basis of
          component F110W-F170M colors (indicative of CH4 absorption) and
          low    probabilities   of   background   contamination.   Prior
          ground-based observations show 2MASS 1553+1532AB to be a common
          proper  motion  binary.  The  properties of these systems - low
          multiplicity  fraction  (11[+7][-3]% resolved, as corrected for
          sample  selection  baises),  close  projected  separations (a =
          1.8-5.0  AU)  and  near-unity mass ratios - are consistent with
          previous  results  for field brown dwarf binaries. Three of the
          binaries   have  components  that  span  the  poorly-understood
          transition   between   L   dwarfs   and   T   dwarfs.  Spectral
          decomposition  analysis  of  one  of  these,  SDSS 1021-0304AB,
          reveals a peculiar flux reversal between its components, as its
          T5  secondary is ~30% brighter at 1.05 and 1.27 micron than its
          T1 primary. This system, 2MASS 0518-2828AB and SDSS 1534+1615AB
          all  demonstrate  that  the J-band brightening observed between
          late-type  L  to  mid-type  T dwarfs is an intrinsic feature of
          this   spectral   transition,   albeit   less  pronounced  than
          previously  surmised.  We  also  find  that the resolved binary
          fraction  of  L7  to T3.5 dwarfs is twice that of other L and T
          dwarfs,  an anomaly that can be explained by a relatively rapid
          evolution  of  brown dwarfs through the L/T transition, perhaps
          driven  by  dynamic  (nonequilibrium) depletion of photospheric
          condensates.

          differences  of  about  an  order  of  magnitude. The molecular
          abundances  are  similar  to  those  typically  found  in other
          star-forming  regions in the Galaxy, such as the $\rho$~Oph and
          Perseus  molecular  clouds. There is a marked difference in the
          kinetic  temperatures  derived  for the protobinary source IRS7
          from  H2CO  (40-60  K)  and CH3OH (20 K), possibly indicating a
          difference in origin of the emission from these two molecules.

          AKARI   (formerly  ASTRO-F)  is  an  infrared  space  telescope
          designed  for  an  all-sky  survey  at  10-180  (mu)m, and deep
          pointed  surveys  of  selected  areas  at 2-180 (mu)m. The deep
          pointed  surveys  with  AKARI  will  significantly  advance our
          understanding  of  galaxy evolution, the structure formation of
          the  Universe,  the  nature  of the buried AGNs, and the cosmic
          infrared   background.   Here   we   describe   the   important
          characteristics  of  the  AKARI  mission:  the  orbit,  and the
          attitude  control  system,  and  investigate the optimum survey
          area  based  on  the updated pre-flight sensitivities of AKARI,
          taking  into  account the cirrus confusion noise as well as the
          surface  density of bright stars. The North Ecliptic Pole (NEP)
          is  concluded  to be the best area for 2-26 (mu)m deep surveys,
          while  the  low-cirrus  noise regions around the South Ecliptic
          Pole  (SEP)  are  worth  considering  for  50-180 (mu)m pointed
          surveys  to  high sensitivities limited by the galaxy confusion
          noise. Current observational plans of these pointed surveys are
          described  in  detail.  Comparing  these  surveys with the deep
          surveys  with  the  Spitzer  Space  Telescope,  the  AKARI deep
          surveys  are particularly unique in respect of their continuous
          wavelength  coverage  over  the  2-26 (mu)m range in broad-band
          deep  imaging,  and  their  slitless spectroscopy mode over the
          same wavelength range.

          (abridged)  NGC 1569 is an ideal test environment to understand
          the  impact of "feedback" from massive stars on the surrounding
          ISM.  We present HST WFPC2 narrowband imagery of NGC 1569 in an
          attempt   to   understand   the  underlying  ionizing  emission
          mechanisms  on  a 3 pc scale and to generate a H II region size
          distribution  and luminosity function. We use [O III]/Hbeta and
          [S   II]/Halpha  ratio  maps  to  find  that  non-photoionizing
          mechanisms  (e.g.  shocks)  are responsible for 10%+/-3% of the
          Halpha emission, 2.3-3.3 times larger than results from similar
          galaxies.   Our  results  for  NGC  1569  indicate  that  these
          non-photoionized  areas  do  not  lie in low surface brightness
          regions  exclusively.  To  explain  this  large  percentage  of
          non-photoionized emission, we suggest that NGC 1569 is, indeed,
          in  a post-starburst phase as previous authors have claimed. We
          also  derived  slopes  for  the H II region luminosity function
          (-1.00+/-0.08)   and   size  distribution  (-3.02+/-0.27).  The
          luminosity  slope,  though shallow, is similar to previous work
          on   this   galaxy  and  other  irregular  galaxies.  The  size
          distribution  slope is shallower than previous slopes found for
          irregular  galaxies,  but  our  slope  value  fits  into  their
          confidence intervals and vice versa.

          Jets  from  young  stars  represent  one  of  the most striking
          signposts of star formation. The phenomenon has been researched
          for  over  two  decades and there is now general agreement that
          such  jets  are  generated  as  a by-product of accretion; most
          likely  by  the  accretion  disk  itself.  Thus they mimic what
          occurs  in  more  exotic objects such as active galactic nuclei
          and  micro-quasars.  The precise mechanism for their production
          however  remains  a  mystery.  To  a  large degree, progress is
          hampered  observationally  by  the  embedded nature of many jet
          sources  as  well  as  a  lack  of  spatial  resolution:  Crude
          estimates,  as  well as more sophisticated models, nevertheless
          suggest  that  jets  are accelerated and focused on scales of a
          few AU at most.
          It  is only in the past few years however that we have begun to
          probe  such  scales  in detail using classical T Tauri stars as
          touchstones.  Application  of adaptive optics, data provided by
          the    HST,    use    of   specialised   techniques   such   as
          spectro-astrometry,  and the development of spectral diagnostic
          tools,  are  beginning  to  reveal conditions in the jet launch
          zone.  This  has helped enormously to constrain models. Further
          improvements  in  the  quality  of  the  observational data are
          expected  when  the  new  generation  of  interferometers  come
          on-line.  Here  we review some of the most dramatic findings in
          this area since Protostars and Planets~IV including indications
          for jet rotation, i.e. that they transport angular momentum. We
          will also show how measurements, such as those of width and the
          velocity  field close to the source, suggest jets are initially
          launched as warm magneto-centrifugal disk winds. (abridged)

          Title: Origin of the Counter-Rotating Gas in NGC 1596

          We  present Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) HI imaging
          of  the  edge-on  galaxy  NGC 1596, which was recently found to
          have counter-rotating ionized gas in its center (<15"). We find
          a  large  HI  envelope  associated with a nearby companion, the
          dwarf  irregular  galaxy  NGC  1602.  The  HI  covers  a region
          \~11.9'x13.4'  (62x70  kpc^2) and the total HI mass detected is
          2.5+/-0.1x10^9  Msun  (assuming  an 18 Mpc distance). The HI is
          centered  on  NGC 1602 but appears to have two tidal tails, one
          of  which crosses over NGC 1596. The HI located at the position
          of  NGC  1596  has a velocity gradient in the same sense as the
          ionized  gas,  i.e.  opposite to the stellar rotation. Both the
          existence of a large gas reservoir and the velocity gradient of
          the  HI  and  the ionized gas strongly suggest that the ionized
          gas in NGC 1596 originated from NGC 1602.
          From   the  length  of  the  HI  tails  we  conclude  that  the
          interaction  started  at  least  1  Gyr ago, but the unsettled,
          asymmetric  distribution  of  the ionized gas suggests that the
          accretion  occured more recently. NGC 1596 thus provides a good
          example  where  the  presence  of  counter-rotating  gas can be
          directly  linked to an accretion event. After the accretion has
          stopped  or  the  merging is complete, NGC 1596 may evolve to a
          system  with  more extended counter-rotating gas but no obvious
          signature  of interaction. There is a substantial local HI peak
          in  one  of  the  two tails, where we also find a faint stellar
          counterpart.  The M_HI/L_B ratio in this region is too high for
          a  normal  dwarf elliptical or a low surface brightness galaxy,
          so we conclude that a tidal dwarf is currently forming there.

          Title:  Accretion  Disks  around  Young  Stars: Lifetimes, Disk
          Locking and Variability

          Alexis   Brandeker,  Marten  H.  van  Kerkwijk  (University  of
          Toronto)
          Comments: to appear in The Astrophysical Journal
          We  report  the  findings  of  a  comprehensive  study  of disk
          accretion  and  related  phenomena in four of the nearest young
          stellar  associations  spanning  6-30  million years in age, an
          epoch  that  may  coincide  with  the  late  stages  of  planet
          formation.  We  have  obtained ~650 multi-epoch high-resolution
          optical  spectra  of 100 low-mass stars that are likely members
          of  the  eta  Chamaeleontis  (~6 Myr), TW Hydrae (~8 Myr), beta
          Pictoris (~12 Myr) and Tucanae-Horologium (~30 Myr) groups. Our
          data were collected over 12 nights between 2004 December - 2005
          July  on  the  Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope. Based on H$\alpha$
          line profiles, along with a variety of other emission lines, we
          find  clear  evidence  of on-going accretion in three out of 11
          eta  Cha stars and two out of 32 TW Hydrae members. None of the
          57  beta  Pic  or  Tuc-Hor  members  shows  measurable signs of
          accretion.  Together, these results imply significant evolution
          of the disk accretion process within the first several Myr of a
          low-mass star's life. While a few disks can continue to accrete
          for  up  to  ~10 Myr, our findings suggest that disks accreting
          for beyond that timescale are rather rare. This result provides
          an  indirect constraint on the timescale for gas dissipation in
          inner  disks  and,  in turn, on gas giant planet formation. All
          accretors   in   our   sample   are   slow   rotators,  whereas
          non-accretors  cover  a  large  range in rotational velocities.
          This  may  hint at rotational braking by disks at ages up to ~8
          Myr.   Our   multi-epoch  spectra  confirm  that  emission-line
          variability  is  common  even  in somewhat older T Tauri stars,
          among   which   accretors  tend  to  show  particularly  strong
          variations.  Thus, our results indicate that accretion and wind
          activity   undergo   significant   and   sustained   variations
          throughout the lifetime of accretion disks.

          Using  N-body  simulations,  we have modeled the production and
          evolution of diffuse, low surface brightness intracluster light
          (ICL)   in   three   simulated   galaxy   clusters.   Using  an
          observational  definition  of ICL to be luminosity at a surface
          brightness  mu_V>26.5  mag/sq.arcsec,  we  have  found that the
          fraction  of  cluster  luminosity  contained  in  ICL generally
          increases   as   clusters  evolve,  although  there  are  large
          deviations  from  this  trend  over short timescales, including
          sustained  periods  of  decreasing  ICL  luminosity.  Most  ICL
          luminosity  increases  come in short, discrete events which are
          highly  correlated  with  group  accretion  events  within  the
          cluster.  In  evolved  clusters  we  find  that  ~10-15% of the
          clusters'   luminosity   is  at  ICL  surface  brightness.  The
          morphological  structure of the ICL changes with time, evolving
          from  a  complex  of filaments and small-scale, relatively high
          surface  brightness features early in a cluster's history, to a
          more  diffuse and amorphous cluster-scale ICL envelope at later
          times. Finally, we also see a correlation between the evolution
          of  ICL  at  different  surface  brightnesses, including a time
          delay  between  the  evolution  of  faint  and  extremely faint
          surface  brightness  features  which is traced to the differing
          dynamical timescales in the group and cluster environment.

          We  have  identified a binary companion to (42355) 2002 CR46 in
          our ongoing deep survey using the Hubble Space Telescope's High
          Resolution Camera. It is the first companion to be found around
          an  object  in  a non-resonant orbit that crosses the orbits of
          giant  planets.  Objects  in orbits of this kind, the Centaurs,
          have  experienced  repeated  strong scattering with one or more
          giant  planets  and  therefore the survival of binaries in this
          transient   population   has  been  in  question.  Monte  Carlo
          simulations  suggest,  however,  that  binaries in (42355) 2002
          CR46  -like  heliocentric  orbits  have  a  high probability of
          survival for reasonable estimates of the binary's still-unknown
          system  mass and separation. Because Centaurs are thought to be
          precursors   to  short  period  comets,  the  question  of  the
          existence  of binary comets naturally arises; none has yet been
          definitively  identified.  The  discovery  of  one  binary in a
          sample  of eight observed by HST suggests that binaries in this
          population may not be uncommon.

          We determine relative stellar ages and metallicities mainly for
          about   80   elliptical   galaxies  in  low  and  high  density
          environments  via  the  latest  binary stellar population (BSP)
          synthesis  model and test a latest hierarchical formation model
          of  elliptical  galaxies  which  adopted  the  new $\Lambda$CDM
          cosmology   for   the   first   time.   The  stellar  ages  and
          metallicities  of  galaxies are estimated from two high-quality
          published  spectra  line indices, i.e. H$\beta$ and [MgFe]. The
          results  show that elliptical galaxies have stellar populations
          older  than  3.9 Gyr and more metal rich than 0.02. Most of our
          results  are in agreement with predictions of the model: First,
          elliptical  galaxies  in denser environment are redder and have
          older  populations  than  field  galaxies.  Second,  elliptical
          galaxies  with more massive stellar components are redder while
          have  older  and  more metal rich populations than less massive
          ones.  Third,  the  most massive galaxies are shown to have the
          oldest  and most metal rich stars. However, some of our results
          are  found  to  be  different  with  predictions  of the galaxy
          formation model, i.e. the metallicity distributions of low- and
          high-density  elliptical galaxies and the relations relating to
          cluster-centric distance.

          Title:  Merging  of  a  massive binary due to ejection of bound
          stars
          Authors: Christian Zier
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 pages, submitted to MNRAS
          From  the  results  of  numerical  scattering  experiments  and
          simulations  of  a  massive  black  hole  binary in spherically
          symmetric  and  shallow  cores  it  has  been deduced that most
          likely  the shrinking process stalls due to loss-cone depletion
          before  emission  of gravitational radiation becomes important.
          Here we follow a different approach and focus on the population
          of  stars  which  is  bound  to  the  binary and so far has not
          received  much  attention. With simple assumptions which should
          not  be sensitive to initial conditions we derive a lower limit
          for  the mass of stars that need to be ejected by the binary in
          order  to  coalesce. We also compute this mass in dependency on
          the  steepness  of  the  density profile according to which the
          stars  are  distributed.  Our results are not as pessimistic as
          earlier conclusions and actually suggest that the BHs merge.

          Title:  New  light  on  the  old  problem  of  lithium  pre--MS
          depletion: models with 2D RHD convection
          Authors: Josefina Montalban, Francesca D'Antona
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          The  Teff  location  of  Pre-Main  Sequence  (PMS) evolutionary
          tracks  depends  on  the  treatment  of  over-adiabaticity.  We
          present  here the PMS evolutionary tracks computed by using the
          mixing   length   theory  of  convection  (MLT)  in  which  the
          alpha_MLT=l/H_p    parameter    calibration    is    based   on
          2D--hydrodynamical   models   (Ludwig   et   al.  1999).  These
          MLT--\alpha^2D  stellar  models  and tracks are very similar to
          those  computed  with  non--grey  ATLAS9  atmospheric  boundary
          conditions  and  Full  Spectrum  of Turbulence (FST) convection
          model   both  in  the  atmosphere  and  in  the  interior.  The
          comparison  of  the  new  tracks  with  the  location on the HR
          diagram  of  pre--MS binariesis not completely satisfactory, as
          some  binary  components are located at too low \teff. Besides,
          the  pre--MS  lithium depletion in the MLT--\alpha^2D tracks is
          still  much  larger than that expected from the observations of
          lithium  in young open clusters. This result is similar to that
          of  FST  models.  Thus, in spite of the fact that 2D RHD models
          should  provide  a better convection description than any local
          model, their introduction is not sufficient to reconcile theory
          and  observations.  Lithium  depletion in young clusters points
          towards  a  convection  efficiency which, in pre--MS, should be
          smaller than in the MS. The pre--MS lithium depletion decreases
          significantly  in FST models if we reduce the solar metallicity
          down  to  the  value suggested by Asplund et al.(2004), but the
          corresponding  solar  model does not reproduce the depth of the
          convective zone as determined by helioseismology.

          Observational  constraints provided by high resolution and high
          sensitivity  observations  of  external  galaxies  made  in the
          millimeter  and  submillimeter  range  have started to put on a
          firm  ground  the study of extragalactic chemistry of molecular
          gas.  In  particular,  the  availability  of  multi-species and
          multi-line  surveys  of  nearby  galaxies  is  central  to  the
          interpretation   of   existent   and   forthcoming   millimeter
          observations   of  the  high  redshift  universe.  Probing  the
          physical and chemical status of molecular gas in starbursts and
          active  galaxies  (AGN) requires the use of specific tracers of
          the  relevant  energetic phenomena that are known to be at play
          in these galaxies: large-scale shocks, strong UV fields, cosmic
          rays  and  X-rays.  We  present  below  the first results of an
          ongoing survey, allying the IRAM 30m telescope with the Plateau
          de Bure interferometer(PdBI), devoted to study the chemistry of
          molecular  gas  in  a sample of starbursts and AGN of the local
          universe.  These  observations  highlight  the  existence  of a
          strong  chemical  differentiation  in  the  molecular  disks of
          starbursts and AGN.

          Title:   On   the   search   of   electromagnetic  cosmological
          counterparts to coalescences of massive black hole binaries

          Haardt
          Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  explore the nature of possible electromagnetic counterparts
          of  coalescences of massive black hole binaries at cosmological
          distances  detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
          (LISA).  An  electromagnetic precursor, during the last year of
          gravitational wave (GW)-driven inspiral, or an afterglow within
          few  years after coalescence, may highlight the position in the
          sky of galaxies hosting LISA sources. We show that observations
          of  precursors and afterglows are mutually exclusive, depending
          on  the mass of the primary black hole. Precursors are expected
          to  occur  in  binaries  where the primary (more massive) black
          hole is heavier than ~10^7 \Msun. They may correspond to on-off
          states  of  accretion,  i.e., to a bright X-ray source decaying
          into  quiescence  before black hole coalescence, and are likely
          associated  to  disturbed  galaxies  showing  signs  of ongoing
          starbursts.  Coalescences  of  lighter  binaries,  with  masses
          <5x10^6  \Msun, lack of any precursor, as gas is expected to be
          consumed  long  before the GW-driven orbital decay. Such events
          would  not  be  hosted by (massive) galaxies with an associated
          starburst,  given the slow binary inspiral time compared to the
          typical time scale of starbursts. By contrast, coalescence, for
          such   light   binaries,  is  followed  by  an  electromagnetic
          afterglow,  i.e.,  an off-on accretion state rising in <20 yrs.
          Using a cosmological merger tree algorithm, we show that future
          X-ray missions such as XEUS will be able to identify, in 20 yrs
          operation, almost all the massive BH binary detectable by LISA,
          and, in only 5 yrs, all the LISA sources at z>6.

          Title: Binary central stars of planetary nebula
          Authors: Orsola De Marco
          Comments:   8  pages,  no  figures.  Review  presented  at  IAU
          Symposium 234 on Planetary Nebulae. Proceedings in press
          Only  a  handful  of  binary central stars of planetary nebulae
          (PNe) are known today, due to the difficulty of detecting their
          companions.  Preliminary  results from radial velocity surveys,
          however,    seem    to   indicate   that   binarity   plays   a
          fundamental,rather  than  marginal role in the evolution of PNe
          and  that  the  close binary fraction might be much larger than
          the  currently  known  value of 10-15%. In this review, we list
          all the known binary central stars, giving an updated census of
          their  numbers  and  selected characteristics. A review is also
          given  of  the  techniques  used  to detect binaries as well as
          selected characteristics of related stellar classes which might
          provide constraints (or additional puzzles) to the theory of PN
          evolution.  Finally,  we will formulate the conjecture that all
          PNe  derive  from  binary interactions and suggest that this is
          not inconsistent with our current knowledge.

          nuclear  compactness  in  the  hard  band  (4.5-8.0 keV) into 2
          categories:  Active  Galactic  Nuclei  (AGN) candidates (with a
          clearly  identified  unresolved  nuclear  source) and Starburst
          (SB)  candidates  (without  a clear nuclear source). 60% of the
          total  sample  are classified as AGNs, with a median luminosity
          of  LX(2-10  keV)=2.5  x  10^(40)erg/s,  which  is  an order of
          magnitude  higher  than  that  for SB-like nuclei. The spectral
          fitting  allows  to  conclude  that  most of the objects need a
          non-negligible power-law contribution. When no spectral fitting
          can  be  performed  (data  with low signal-to-noise ratio), the
          Color-Color  diagrams  allow  us  to  roughly estimate physical
          parameters  such  as column density, temperature of the thermal
          model or spectral index for a power-law and therefore to better
          constrain  the  origin  of the X-ray emission. All together the
          X-ray  morphology,  the  spectra  and  the Color-Color diagrams
          allow  us to conclude that a high percentage of LINER galaxies,
          at  least  ~60%,  could host AGN nuclei, although contributions
          from  High  Mass X-ray Binaries or Ultra-luminous X-ray sources
          cannot be ruled out for some galaxies.

          Title:  Analysing  Globular  Cluster  observations - Models and
          Analysis Tools for Lick/IDS indices
          Authors: Thomas Lilly, Uta Fritze-v. Alvensleben
          Comments: 12 pages, 9 Figures (19 plots)
          We  have  extended  our  evolutionary synthesis code, GALEV, to
          include  Lick/IDS  absorption-line  indices for both simple and
          composite   stellar   population   models  (star  clusters  and
          galaxies), using the polynomial fitting functions of Worthey et
          al.  (1994)  and  Worthey  &  Ottaviani  (1997).  We  present a
          mathematically advanced Lick Index Analysis Tool (LINO) for the
          determination  of  ages  and metallicities of globular clusters
          (CGs):  An  extensive grid of GALEV models for the evolution of
          star  clusters  at  various metallicities over a Hubble time is
          compared   to   observed   sets  of  Lick  indices  of  varying
          completeness  and  precision.  A dedicated chi^2 - minimisation
          procedure    selects   the   best   model   including   1-sigma
          uncertainties  on  age  and metallicity. We discuss the age and
          metallicity  sensitivities  of individual indices and show that
          these  sensitivities  themselves depend on age and metallicity;
          thus,  we  extend  Worthey's  (1994)  concept of a "metallicity
          sensitivity  parameter"  for an old stellar population at solar
          metallicity  to younger clusters of different metallicities. We
          find  that  indices  at  low metallicity are generally more age
          sensitive  than  at  high  metallicity. Our aim is to provide a
          robust and reliable tool for the interpretation of star cluster
          spectra becoming available from 10m class telescopes in a large
          variety   of  galaxies:  metal-rich  &  metal-poor,  starburst,
          post-burst,  and  dynamically  young. We test our analysis tool
          using  observations  from  various authors for Galactic and M31
          GCs,  for which reliable age and metallicity determinations are
          available  in  the  literature,  and  discuss  in  how  far the
          observational  availability  of various subsets of Lick indices
          affects  the  results. For M31 GCs, we discuss the influence of
          non-solar abundance ratios on our results.

          We  present  optical  and ultraviolet spectra, lightcurves, and
          Doppler  tomograms  of  the low-mass X-ray binary EXO 0748-676.
          Using  an  extensive set of 15 emission line tomograms, we show
          that,  along  with the usual emission from the stream and ``hot
          spot'',  there  is  extended non-axisymmetric emission from the
          disk  rim.  Some of the emission and Halpha and beta absorption
          features  lend weight to the hypothesis that part of the stream
          overflows  the  disk rim and forms a two phase medium. The data
          are  consistent  with  a  1.35M_sun  neutron  star  with a main
          sequence companion and hence a mass ratio q~0.34.

          Title: Quantum phantom cosmology
          Authors: Mariusz P. Dabrowski, Claus Kiefer, Barbara Sandhoefer
          Comments: 21 pages, 6 figures
          We   apply   the  formalism  of  quantum  cosmology  to  models
          containing   a   phantom  field.  Three  models  are  discussed
          explicitly:  a  toy  model, a model with an exponential phantom
          potential,  and  a  model  with  phantom field accompanied by a
          negative cosmological constant. In all these cases we calculate
          the  classical  trajectories  in  configuration  space and give
          solutions  to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology.
          In  the  cases  of the toy model and the model with exponential
          potential  we  are  able  to  solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation
          exactly.   For  comparison,  we  also  give  the  corresponding
          solutions   for   an  ordinary  scalar  field.  We  discuss  in
          particular the behaviour of wave packets in minisuperspace. For
          the  phantom  field  these  packets disperse in the region that
          corresponds to the Big Rip singularity. This thus constitutes a
          genuine  quantum region at large scales, described by a regular
          solution  of  the  Wheeler-DeWitt  equation.  For  the ordinary
          scalar field, the Big-Bang singularity is avoided. Some remarks
          on  the  arrow  of  time  in  phantom  models as well as on the
          relation of phantom models to loop quantum cosmology are given.

          Title:  Novae  as a Mechanism for Producing Cavities around the
          Progenitors of SN 2002ic and Other SNe Ia
          Authors: W. M. Wood-Vasey, J. L. Sokoloski
          Comments: Accepted to ApJL. 11 pages, 1 table
          We  propose  that  a  nova  shell ejected from a recurrent nova
          progenitor  system  created  the  evacuated  region  around the
          explosion  center of SN 2002ic. In this picture, periodic shell
          ejections  due to nova explosions on a white dwarf sweep up the
          slow   wind   from   the  binary  companion,  creating  density
          variations  and  instabilities  that  lead  to structure in the
          circumstellar  medium  (CSM).  Our model naturally explains the
          observed gap between the supernova explosion center and the CSM
          in  SN  2002ic, accounts for the density variations observed in
          the  CSM, and resolves the coincidence problem of the timing of
          the  explosion  of  SN  2002ic  with  respect  to  the apparent
          cessation  of  mass-loss  in  the  progenitor  system.  We also
          consider  such  nova  outburst sweeping as a generic feature of
          Type Ia supernovae with recurrent nova progenitors.

          Title: Gravitational polarization and the MOND phenomenology
          Authors: Luc Blanchet
          Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure
          The  modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) has been proposed as an
          alternative  to the dark matter paradigm. The philosophy behind
          is  that  there is no dark matter and we witness a violation of
          the  Newtonian  law  of  dynamics. In this Letter, we interpret
          differently  the phenomenology sustaining MOND. We show that it
          could  result  from an effect of gravitational polarization, of
          some  cosmic  fluid  made of dipole moments, and representing a
          new    form   of   dark   matter.   An   internal   force,   of
          non-gravitational  origin, is invoked in order to hold together
          the   microscopic   constituents  of  the  dipole.  Under  some
          equilibrium  condition, the dipole moments are aligned with the
          gravitational field, yielding the MOND regime. The dipolar dark
          matter  particles  are weakly influenced by the distribution of
          ordinary  matter; they are accelerated not by the gravitational
          field, but by its gradient, or tidal gravitational field.

          We  constrain  the past star formation histories of a sample of
          25  distant (z~0.7) luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) detected
          with  the  mid infrared cameras ISOCAM and MIPS onboard the ISO
          and Spitzer satellites.
          We  use high resolution VLT-FORS2 spectroscopy in addition to a
          comprehensive  library  of  200,000  model  optical  spectra to
          derive  Bayesian  likelihood  estimates  of  the star formation
          histories  of  these  galaxies  based on the analysis of Balmer
          absorption lines and the 4000 A break.
          The  locus  of distant LIRGs in the diagram defined by Hdelta_A
          and D4000 is roughly comparable to that of local LIRGs observed
          with  IRAS,  suggesting  that  no  trend  for  an  evolution is
          detected between the local and distant LIRGs. We obtain similar
          results  when  using  either  the  H8 or the H$\delta_A$ Balmer
          absorption-line indices in combination with D4000.
          We  compute  a  birthrate  parameter  (b=SFR/<SFR>)  of  4\pm1,
          confirming  that the distant LIRGs are currently experiencing a
          major  phase of star formation. The most likely duration of the
          bursts  is  0.10  Gyr, during which the LIRGs produce 5-10 % of
          their current stellar mass. No evidence is found for successive
          starbursts on the scale of a few times $10^7$ yr, such as those
          predicted  by  some  numerical  simulations  of  major mergers.
          However,  the  large  number  density of those galaxies suggest
          that  they  could  experience  between two and four LIRG phases
          until the present epoch.

          Title:   Cosmological   Simulations   of  Intergalactic  Medium
          Enrichment from Galactic Outflows
          Authors: Benjamin D. Oppenheimer, Romeel Dav (Arizona)
          Comments: 31 pages, submitted to MNRAS
          We investigate models of self-consistent chemical enrichment of
          the  intergalactic medium (IGM) from z=6 to 1.5, based on hydro
          simulations  of  structure  formation that incorporate galactic
          outflows.  We  find  that  outflow  parameterizations  based on
          momentum-driven  winds  as  seen  in  local  starburst galaxies
          provide  the best agreement with observations of CIV absorption
          at  z~2-5.  Such  models  sufficiently enrich the high-z IGM to
          produce  a  global  mass  density  of  CIV  absorbers  that  is
          relatively  invariant  from  z=5.5  to  1.5,  in agreement with
          observations.   This   occurs   despite  the  majority  of  IGM
          enrichment  occuring at these epochs, because energy deposition
          from  outflows  causes a drop in the global ionization fraction
          of   CIV.  Comparisons  to  observed  CIV  column  density  and
          linewidth  distributions  and  CIV-based  pixel  optical  depth
          ratios  provide  significant  constraints  on  wind models. Our
          best-fitting  models  show  mean IGM temperatures only slightly
          above  our no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just a few
          %  with  volume-weighted  metallicities  around  0.001  at z~3,
          significant  amounts  of  collisionally-ionized CIV absorption,
          and  a  metallicity-density  relationship that rises rapidly at
          low  overdensities  and flattens at higher ones. In general, we
          find  that  outflow  speeds  must  be high enough to enrich the
          low-density  IGM  at early times but low enough not to overheat
          it,  and  concurrently  must  significantly suppress early star
          formation  while  still  producing  enough  early metals. It is
          therefore  non-trivial  that locally-calibrated momentum-driven
          wind   scenarios  naturally  yield  the  desired  strength  and
          evolution of outflows, and suggest that such models represent a
          significant  step  towards understanding the impact of galactic
          outflows on galaxies and the IGM across cosmic time.

          observations.   This   occurs   despite  the  majority  of  IGM
          enrichment  occuring at these epochs, because energy deposition
          from  outflows  causes a drop in the global ionization fraction
          of   CIV.  Comparisons  to  observed  CIV  column  density  and
          linewidth  distributions  and  CIV-based  pixel  optical  depth
          ratios  provide  significant  constraints  on  wind models. Our
          best-fitting  models  show  mean IGM temperatures only slightly
          above  our no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just a few
          %  with  volume-weighted  metallicities  around  0.001  at z~3,
          significant  amounts  of  collisionally-ionized CIV absorption,
          and  a  metallicity-density  relationship that rises rapidly at
          low  overdensities  and flattens at higher ones. In general, we
          find  that  outflow  speeds  must  be high enough to enrich the
          low-density  IGM  at early times but low enough not to overheat
          it,  and  concurrently  must  significantly suppress early star
          formation  while  still  producing  enough  early metals. It is
          therefore  non-trivial  that locally-calibrated momentum-driven
          wind   scenarios  naturally  yield  the  desired  strength  and
          evolution of outflows, and suggest that such models represent a
          significant  step  towards understanding the impact of galactic
          outflows on galaxies and the IGM across cosmic time.

          Progenitors of SN 2002ic and Other SNe Ia
          Authors: W. M. Wood-Vasey, J. L. Sokoloski
          Comments: Accepted to ApJL. 11 pages, 1 table
          We  propose  that  a  nova  shell ejected from a recurrent nova
          progenitor  system  created  the  evacuated  region  around the
          explosion  center of SN 2002ic. In this picture, periodic shell
          ejections  due to nova explosions on a white dwarf sweep up the
          slow   wind   from   the  binary  companion,  creating  density
          variations  and  instabilities  that  lead  to structure in the
          circumstellar  medium  (CSM).  Our model naturally explains the
          observed gap between the supernova explosion center and the CSM
          in  SN  2002ic, accounts for the density variations observed in
          the  CSM, and resolves the coincidence problem of the timing of
          the  explosion  of  SN  2002ic  with  respect  to  the apparent
          cessation  of  mass-loss  in  the  progenitor  system.  We also
          consider  such  nova  outburst sweeping as a generic feature of
          Type Ia supernovae with recurrent nova progenitors.

          Title: Gravitational polarization and the MOND phenomenology
          Authors: Luc Blanchet
          Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure
          The  modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) has been proposed as an
          alternative  to the dark matter paradigm. The philosophy behind
          is  that  there is no dark matter and we witness a violation of
          the  Newtonian  law  of  dynamics. In this Letter, we interpret
          differently  the phenomenology sustaining MOND. We show that it
          could  result  from an effect of gravitational polarization, of
          some  cosmic  fluid  made of dipole moments, and representing a
          new    form   of   dark   matter.   An   internal   force,   of
          non-gravitational  origin, is invoked in order to hold together
          the   microscopic   constituents  of  the  dipole.  Under  some
          equilibrium  condition, the dipole moments are aligned with the
          gravitational field, yielding the MOND regime. The dipolar dark
          matter  particles  are weakly influenced by the distribution of
          ordinary  matter; they are accelerated not by the gravitational
          field, but by its gradient, or tidal gravitational field.

          We  constrain  the past star formation histories of a sample of
          25  distant (z~0.7) luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) detected
          with  the  mid infrared cameras ISOCAM and MIPS onboard the ISO
          and Spitzer satellites.
          We  use high resolution VLT-FORS2 spectroscopy in addition to a
          comprehensive  library  of  200,000  model  optical  spectra to
          derive  Bayesian  likelihood  estimates  of  the star formation
          histories  of  these  galaxies  based on the analysis of Balmer
          absorption lines and the 4000 A break.
          The  locus  of distant LIRGs in the diagram defined by Hdelta_A
          and D4000 is roughly comparable to that of local LIRGs observed
          with  IRAS,  suggesting  that  no  trend  for  an  evolution is
          detected between the local and distant LIRGs. We obtain similar
          results  when  using  either  the  H8 or the H$\delta_A$ Balmer
          absorption-line indices in combination with D4000.
          We  compute  a  birthrate  parameter  (b=SFR/<SFR>)  of  4\pm1,
          confirming  that the distant LIRGs are currently experiencing a
          major  phase of star formation. The most likely duration of the
          bursts  is  0.10  Gyr, during which the LIRGs produce 5-10 % of
          their current stellar mass. No evidence is found for successive
          starbursts on the scale of a few times $10^7$ yr, such as those
          predicted  by  some  numerical  simulations  of  major mergers.
          However,  the  large  number  density of those galaxies suggest
          that  they  could  experience  between two and four LIRG phases
          until the present epoch.

          Enrichment from Galactic Outflows
          Authors: Benjamin D. Oppenheimer, Romeel Dav (Arizona)
          Comments: 31 pages, submitted to MNRAS
          We investigate models of self-consistent chemical enrichment of
          the  intergalactic medium (IGM) from z=6 to 1.5, based on hydro
          simulations  of  structure  formation that incorporate galactic
          outflows.  We  find  that  outflow  parameterizations  based on
          momentum-driven  winds  as  seen  in  local  starburst galaxies
          provide  the best agreement with observations of CIV absorption
          at  z~2-5.  Such  models  sufficiently enrich the high-z IGM to
          produce  a  global  mass  density  of  CIV  absorbers  that  is
          relatively  invariant  from  z=5.5  to  1.5,  in agreement with
          observations.   This   occurs   despite  the  majority  of  IGM
          enrichment  occuring at these epochs, because energy deposition
          from  outflows  causes a drop in the global ionization fraction
          of   CIV.  Comparisons  to  observed  CIV  column  density  and
          linewidth  distributions  and  CIV-based  pixel  optical  depth
          ratios  provide  significant  constraints  on  wind models. Our
          best-fitting  models  show  mean IGM temperatures only slightly
          above  our no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just a few
          %  with  volume-weighted  metallicities  around  0.001  at z~3,
          significant  amounts  of  collisionally-ionized CIV absorption,
          and  a  metallicity-density  relationship that rises rapidly at
          low  overdensities  and flattens at higher ones. In general, we
          find  that  outflow  speeds  must  be high enough to enrich the
          low-density  IGM  at early times but low enough not to overheat
          it,  and  concurrently  must  significantly suppress early star
          formation  while  still  producing  enough  early metals. It is
          therefore  non-trivial  that locally-calibrated momentum-driven
          wind   scenarios  naturally  yield  the  desired  strength  and
          evolution of outflows, and suggest that such models represent a
          significant  step  towards understanding the impact of galactic
          outflows on galaxies and the IGM across cosmic time.

          about dark energy
          Authors: Michael Doran, Joerg Jaeckel
          Comments: 4 pages
          We show that laboratory experiments cannot measure the absolute
          value   of   dark   energy.   All  known  experiments  rely  on
          electromagnetic  interactions.  They  are  thus  insensitive to
          particles  and  fields  that interact only weakly with ordinary
          matter.   In  addition,  Josephson  junction  experiments  only
          measure  differences  in vacuum energy similar to Casimir force
          measurements.  Gravity, however, couples to the absolute value.
          Finally  we  note  that  Casimir force measurements have tested
          zero  point  fluctuations  up to energies of ~10 eV, well above
          the  dark energy scale of ~0.01 eV. Hence, the proposed cut-off
          in the fluctuation spectrum is ruled out experimentally.

          Guesten, S. Philipp
          Comments: APEX A&A special issue, accepted
          We observed the high velocity outflow originating from NGC6334I
          in  several  CO  transitions  with the APEX telescope, with the
          goal  of  deriving the physical parameters of the gas. Using an
          LVG  analysis,  we  studied  line  ratios  between the CO(3-2),
          CO(4-3),  and  CO(7-6) data as a function of the density and of
          the  kinetic  temperature  of the gas. An upper limit on the CO
          column  density  is  derived  by  comparison with 13CO data. We
          constrained  the temperature to be higher than 50 K and the H_2
          density  to  values higher than n~10^4 cm^{-3} towards the peak
          position  in  the red lobe, while T>15 K and n>10^3 cm^{-3} are
          derived  towards  the  peak  position  in  the  blue  lobe. The
          physical   parameters   of   the  outflow,  its  mass  and  its
          energetics,  have  been computed using the temperatures derived
          from  this analysis. We conclude that high kinetic temperatures
          are  present  in  the  outflow and traced by high excitation CO
          lines. Observations of high-J CO lines are thus needed to infer
          reliable  values  of  the kinetic temperatures and of the other
          physical parameters in outflows.

          A   short   review   of   ultra-compact  binaries,  focused  on
          ultra-compact  X-ray  binaries,  is followed by a discussion of
          recent results of our VLT campaign to obtain optical spectra of
          (candidate)  ultra-compact X-ray binaries. We find evidence for
          carbon/oxygen  as well as helium/nitrogen discs and no evidence
          for  (traces) of hydrogen. This suggests that the donors in the
          observed  systems are white dwarfs. However, we also find large
          differences  between  the  two  C/O discs of which we have good
          spectra,  which  highlights the need for a better understanding
          of the optical spectra.

          Title:  Accretion  onto the Companion of Eta Carinae During the
          Spectroscopic Event: III. the He II 4686 Line
          Authors: Noam Soker, Ehud Behar (Technion, Israel)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          We  continue  to  explore  the  accretion  model of the massive
          binary  system  Eta Carinae by studying the anomalously high He
          II  lambda-4686  line.  The line appears just before periastron
          and  disappears  immediately  thereafter.  Based  on  the He II
          lambda-4686  line  emission  from O-stars and their modeling in
          the  literature,  we  postulate that the He II lambda-4686 line
          comes from the acceleration zone of the secondary stellar wind.
          We  attribute  the  large  increase  in the line intensity to a
          slight increase in the density of the secondary stellar wind in
          its  acceleration zone. The increase in density could be due to
          the  ionization  and subsequent deceleration of the wind by the
          enhanced X-ray emission arising from the shocked secondary wind
          further downstream or to accretion of the primary stellar wind.
          Accretion  around  the secondary equatorial plane gives rise to
          collimation of the secondary wind, which increases its density,
          hence  enhancing  the  He  II  lambda-4686  emission  line.  In
          contrast  with  previous  explanations,  the presently proposed
          model  does  not  require  a  prohibitively  high X-ray flux to
          directly photoionize the He.

          Astrophysical Journal
          We   present   time-resolved   spectroscopy   of   the  optical
          counterpart  to  the  proposed ultra-compact binary system V407
          Vul  (=RX  J1914.4+2456).  Our  Gemini spectra resolve the 9.48
          minute  periodicity  that has previously been reported for this
          source.  We find that the optical counterpart is dominated by a
          reddened  late-type  spectrum  of  type G9V and contains solely
          unresolved  absorption  features. No radial velocity signatures
          exceeding  10 km/s could be detected on periods from minutes to
          hours.  Using  interstellar  extinction  estimates, we derive a
          distance  to  the  G9  star of 1.1-3.5 kpc. In addition to this
          stellar  spectrum,  we  detect  a blue component that modulates
          solely  on  the  9.48  minute  period, and peaks ~0.15 in phase
          ahead  of the X-ray peak. This blue component which contributes
          up  to  40%  of  the  light shows no evidence for emission line
          features that are the usual hallmarks of an interacting binary.
          Good  seeing  images  obtained  with  the  Magellan  telescopes
          indicate that the variable and the G-star are aligned to better
          than 0.1". Despite the low probability of a chance alignment of
          a  field  star  along the line of sight, the G9 light cannot be
          directly  associated  with the 9.48 minute variable that powers
          the  luminous (~10^35 ergs/s) and highly variable X-ray source.
          The  outlook  for  the  detection of conclusive radial velocity
          measurements  will  remain  challenging  due  to the extinction
          along  the  line of sight in conjunction with the contaminating
          effect of the G9V star.

          Title: New ways to catch a wave
          Authors: Neil J. Cornish, Edward K. Porter
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          The  gravitational  wave  signals  from coalescing Supermassive
          Black  Hole Binaries are one of the prime targets for the Laser
          Interferometer   Space   Antenna   (LISA).  With  optimal  data
          processing  techniques  the  LISA observatory should be able to
          detect  these  black hole mergers anywhere in the Universe. The
          challenge  is  to  find  ways  to  dig  the  signals  out  of a
          combination  of  instrument noise and the large foreground from
          stellar mass binaries in our own galaxy. The standard procedure
          of  matched  filtering  against  a  bank  of  templates  can be
          computationally  prohibitive,  especially  when the black holes
          are  spinning  or  the  mass ratio is large. Here we develop an
          alternative  approach  based  on annealed Markov Chains that is
          orders  of magnitude cheaper than a grid search. We demonstrate
          our  approach on a simulated LISA data stream that contains the
          signal  from  a  binary  system  of  Schwarzschild Black Holes,
          embedded  in  instrument  noise  and a foreground containing 26
          million  galactic  binaries.  The  annealed  chains are able to
          accurately  recover  the  9  parameters that describe the black
          hole  binary  without  first having to remove any of the bright
          sources in the foreground.

          about dark energy
          Authors: Michael Doran, Joerg Jaeckel
          Comments: 4 pages
          We show that laboratory experiments cannot measure the absolute
          value   of   dark   energy.   All  known  experiments  rely  on
          electromagnetic  interactions.  They  are  thus  insensitive to
          particles  and  fields  that interact only weakly with ordinary
          matter.   In  addition,  Josephson  junction  experiments  only
          measure  differences  in vacuum energy similar to Casimir force
          measurements.  Gravity, however, couples to the absolute value.
          Finally  we  note  that  Casimir force measurements have tested
          zero  point  fluctuations  up to energies of ~10 eV, well above
          the  dark energy scale of ~0.01 eV. Hence, the proposed cut-off
          in the fluctuation spectrum is ruled out experimentally.

          We observed the high velocity outflow originating from NGC6334I
          in  several  CO  transitions  with the APEX telescope, with the
          goal  of  deriving the physical parameters of the gas. Using an
          LVG  analysis,  we  studied  line  ratios  between the CO(3-2),
          CO(4-3),  and  CO(7-6) data as a function of the density and of
          the  kinetic  temperature  of the gas. An upper limit on the CO
          column  density  is  derived  by  comparison with 13CO data. We
          constrained  the temperature to be higher than 50 K and the H_2
          density  to  values higher than n~10^4 cm^{-3} towards the peak
          position  in  the red lobe, while T>15 K and n>10^3 cm^{-3} are
          derived  towards  the  peak  position  in  the  blue  lobe. The
          physical   parameters   of   the  outflow,  its  mass  and  its
          energetics,  have  been computed using the temperatures derived
          from  this analysis. We conclude that high kinetic temperatures
          are  present  in  the  outflow and traced by high excitation CO
          lines. Observations of high-J CO lines are thus needed to infer
          reliable  values  of  the kinetic temperatures and of the other
          physical parameters in outflows.

          Title: Ultra-compact (X-ray) binaries

          A   short   review   of   ultra-compact  binaries,  focused  on
          ultra-compact  X-ray  binaries,  is followed by a discussion of
          recent results of our VLT campaign to obtain optical spectra of
          (candidate)  ultra-compact X-ray binaries. We find evidence for
          carbon/oxygen  as well as helium/nitrogen discs and no evidence
          for  (traces) of hydrogen. This suggests that the donors in the
          observed  systems are white dwarfs. However, we also find large
          differences  between  the  two  C/O discs of which we have good
          spectra,  which  highlights the need for a better understanding
          of the optical spectra.

          Title:  Accretion  onto the Companion of Eta Carinae During the
          Spectroscopic Event: III. the He II 4686 Line
          Authors: Noam Soker, Ehud Behar (Technion, Israel)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          We  continue  to  explore  the  accretion  model of the massive
          binary  system  Eta Carinae by studying the anomalously high He
          II  lambda-4686  line.  The line appears just before periastron
          and  disappears  immediately  thereafter.  Based  on  the He II
          lambda-4686  line  emission  from O-stars and their modeling in
          the  literature,  we  postulate that the He II lambda-4686 line
          comes from the acceleration zone of the secondary stellar wind.
          We  attribute  the  large  increase  in the line intensity to a
          slight increase in the density of the secondary stellar wind in
          its  acceleration zone. The increase in density could be due to
          the  ionization  and subsequent deceleration of the wind by the
          enhanced X-ray emission arising from the shocked secondary wind
          further downstream or to accretion of the primary stellar wind.
          Accretion  around  the secondary equatorial plane gives rise to
          collimation of the secondary wind, which increases its density,
          hence  enhancing  the  He  II  lambda-4686  emission  line.  In
          contrast  with  previous  explanations,  the presently proposed
          model  does  not  require  a  prohibitively  high X-ray flux to
          directly photoionize the He.

          Comments:  8  pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We   present   time-resolved   spectroscopy   of   the  optical
          counterpart  to  the  proposed ultra-compact binary system V407
          Vul  (=RX  J1914.4+2456).  Our  Gemini spectra resolve the 9.48
          minute  periodicity  that has previously been reported for this
          source.  We find that the optical counterpart is dominated by a
          reddened  late-type  spectrum  of  type G9V and contains solely
          unresolved  absorption  features. No radial velocity signatures
          exceeding  10 km/s could be detected on periods from minutes to
          hours.  Using  interstellar  extinction  estimates, we derive a
          distance  to  the  G9  star of 1.1-3.5 kpc. In addition to this
          stellar  spectrum,  we  detect  a blue component that modulates
          solely  on  the  9.48  minute  period, and peaks ~0.15 in phase
          ahead  of the X-ray peak. This blue component which contributes
          up  to  40%  of  the  light shows no evidence for emission line
          features that are the usual hallmarks of an interacting binary.
          Good  seeing  images  obtained  with  the  Magellan  telescopes
          indicate that the variable and the G-star are aligned to better
          than 0.1". Despite the low probability of a chance alignment of
          a  field  star  along the line of sight, the G9 light cannot be
          directly  associated  with the 9.48 minute variable that powers
          the  luminous (~10^35 ergs/s) and highly variable X-ray source.
          The  outlook  for  the  detection of conclusive radial velocity
          measurements  will  remain  challenging  due  to the extinction
          along  the  line of sight in conjunction with the contaminating
          effect of the G9V star.

          Title: New ways to catch a wave
          Authors: Neil J. Cornish, Edward K. Porter
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          The  gravitational  wave  signals  from coalescing Supermassive
          Black  Hole Binaries are one of the prime targets for the Laser
          Interferometer   Space   Antenna   (LISA).  With  optimal  data
          processing  techniques  the  LISA observatory should be able to
          detect  these  black hole mergers anywhere in the Universe. The
          challenge  is  to  find  ways  to  dig  the  signals  out  of a
          combination  of  instrument noise and the large foreground from
          stellar mass binaries in our own galaxy. The standard procedure
          of  matched  filtering  against  a  bank  of  templates  can be
          computationally  prohibitive,  especially  when the black holes
          are  spinning  or  the  mass ratio is large. Here we develop an
          alternative  approach  based  on annealed Markov Chains that is
          orders  of magnitude cheaper than a grid search. We demonstrate
          our  approach on a simulated LISA data stream that contains the
          signal  from  a  binary  system  of  Schwarzschild Black Holes,
          embedded  in  instrument  noise  and a foreground containing 26
          million  galactic  binaries.  The  annealed  chains are able to
          accurately  recover  the  9  parameters that describe the black
          hole  binary  without  first having to remove any of the bright
          sources in the foreground.

          Combined   investigations   of  the  clustering  properties  of
          galaxies  of  different spectral type and high-redshift quasars
          strongly  suggest local ellipticals to be the parent population
          of  optically bright Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, the
          picture gets more blurred when one extends the analysis to that
          class  of  AGNs  which  show  enhanced  radio emission. Objects
          belonging to this class in fact are found to be associated with
          structures  which  are about an order of magnitude more massive
          than  those  that  host  radio-quiet AGNs. Also, masses for the
          black  holes engines of radio-enhanced AGN emission turn out to
          be   systematically  higher  than  those  which  fuel  'normal'
          quasars.  On  the  other  hand,  the level of radio-activity in
          radio-luminous objects does not seem to be connected with black
          hole/host  galaxy  mass,  at  variance  with  what found in the
          optical  case.  These  results,  together  with  evidences  for
          different  cosmological  evolutions  of different types of AGNs
          pose  a  serious  challenge  to  all  those  models  aiming  at
          providing a unified picture for black hole-powered sources.

          Galaxies

          Comments: 18 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  present the first low luminosity (LX > 5 - 10 1036 erg s-1)
          X-ray  luminosity  functions  (XLFs) of low-mass X-ray binaries
          (LMXBs) determined for two typical old elliptical galaxies, NGC
          3379 and NGC 4278. Because both galaxies contain little diffuse
          emission  from hot ISM and no recent significant star formation
          (hence  no  high-mass X-ray binary contamination), they provide
          two  of  the best homogeneous sample of LMXBs. With 110 and 140
          ks Chandra ACIS S3 exposures, we detect 59 and 112 LMXBs within
          the  D25  ellipse  of  NGC 3379 and NGC 4278, respectively. The
          resulting  XLFs are well represented by a single power-law with
          a  slope  (in  a differential form) of 1.9 0.1. In NGC 4278, we
          can  exclude  the  break  at  LX  ~  5  x 1037 erg s-1 that was
          recently suggested to be a general feature of LMXB XLFs. In NGC
          3379  instead we find a localized excess over the power law XLF
          at  ~4  x  1037  erg  s-1,  but with a marginal significance of
          ~1.6s.  Because  of  the  small  number of luminous sources, we
          cannot  constrain  the  high  luminosity break (at 5 x 1038 erg
          s-1)  found in a large sample of early type galaxies. While the
          optical  luminosities  of  the  two galaxies are similar, their
          integrated  LMXB  X-ray  luminosities  differ by a factor of 4,
          consistent  with  the  relation  between  the  X-ray to optical
          luminosity ratio and the globular cluster specific frequency.

          Title:   The   Eccentricity-Mass  Distribution  of  Exoplanets:
          Signatures of Different Formation Mechanisms?
          Authors:  Ignasi Ribas (CSIC/IEEC, Spain), Jordi Miralda-Escude
          (ICREA/IEEC, Spain, and IAS Princeton, USA)
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to A&A
          We  examine  the  distributions  of  eccentricity and host star
          metallicity  of exoplanets as a function of their mass. Planets
          with  M  sin  i  >~  4  M_J  have  an eccentricity distribution
          consistent  with that of binary stars, while planets with M sin
          i  <~  4  M_J  are  less  eccentric  than binary stars and more
          massive  planets. In addition, host star metallicities decrease
          with planet mass. The statistical significance of both of these
          trends  is only marginal with the present sample of exoplanets.
          To  account for these trends, we hypothesize that there are two
          populations  of  gaseous planets: the low-mass population forms
          by  gas  accretion onto a rock-ice core in a circumstellar disk
          and is more abundant at high metalliticities, and the high-mass
          population  forms  directly  by  fragmentation of a pre-stellar
          cloud.  Planets  of  the  first  population  form  in initially
          circular  orbits  and  grow their eccentricities later, and may
          have  a  mass  upper limit from the total mass of the disk that
          can  be  accreted by the core. The second population may have a
          mass  lower limit resulting from opacity-limited fragmentation.
          This would roughly divide the two populations in mass, although
          they would likely overlap over some mass range. If most objects
          in  the  second  population  form  before the pre-stellar cloud
          becomes  highly opaque, they would have to be initially located
          in  orbits larger than ~30 AU, and would need to migrate to the
          much smaller orbits in which they are observed. The higher mean
          orbital  eccentricity  of the second population might be caused
          by  the  larger required intervals of radial migration, and the
          brown  dwarf  desert might be due to the inability of high-mass
          brown dwarfs to migrate inwards sufficiently in radius.

          We  present spectroscopic redshifts for the first 466 X-ray and
          radio-selected AGN targets in the 2 deg^2 COSMOS field. Spectra
          were obtained with the IMACS instrument on the Magellan (Baade)
          telescope,  using  the nod-and-shuffle technique. We identify a
          variety  of Type 1 and Type 2 AGN, as well as red galaxies with
          no  emission  lines. Our redshift yield is 72% down to i_AB=24,
          although   the  yield  is  >90%  for  i_AB<22.  We  expect  the
          completeness  to  increase  as  the  survey continues. When our
          survey  is  complete  and additional redshifts from the zCOSMOS
          project  are  included,  we anticipate ~1100 AGN with redshifts
          over the entire COSMOS field. Our redshift survey is consistent
          with  an  obscured AGN population that peaks at z~0.7, although
          further work is necessary to disentangle the selection effects.

          Astrophysics
          We   study  the  absorption  and  emission  properties  of  the
          photoionised  gas  near  one of the brightest and most variable
          AGN,  the  Seyfert  galaxy  NGC 4051, in order to constrain the
          geometry,  dynamics and ionisation structure of the outflow. We
          analyse two observations taken with the Low Energy Transmission
          Grating  Spectrometer  (LETGS) of Chandra. We study the spectra
          of both observations and investigate the spectral response to a
          sudden,  long-lasting  flux  decrease  of  a  factor  of 5 that
          occurred   during   the  second  observation.  We  confirm  the
          preliminary  detection  of  a  highly ionised component with an
          outflow  velocity  of  -4500  km/s, one of the highest velocity
          outflow  components seen in a Seyfert 1 galaxy. The sudden drop
          in  intensity by a factor of five during the second observation
          causes a drop in ionisation parameter of a similar magnitude in
          the  strongest  and  main ionisation component (v = -610 km/s),
          allowing  us  for the first time to determine the recombination
          time  of  this  component  and thereby its distance in a robust
          way.  We find an upper limit to the distance of 10^15 m, ruling
          out  an origin in the narrow emission line region. In addition,
          an  emission component producing strong radiative recombination
          continua of C VI and C V appears during the low state. This can
          be  explained by emission from an ionised skin of the accretion
          disk  at  a  distance  of  only ~4x10^12 m from the black hole.
          Finally,  the  spectra contain a broad relativistic O VIII line
          with properties similar to what was found before in this source
          with  XMM-Newton; this line has disappeared during the low flux
          state,  consistent  with the disappearance of the inner part of
          the accretion disk during that low flux state. (abridged)

          We  present  preliminary  results  of  a  our  search for close
          (period  P < 10 days) binary systems among hot (Teff > 20000 K)
          horizontal  branch  stars in globular clusters M80 and NGC5986.
          We measured radial velocity variations of 11 targets in M80 and
          5  in  NGC5986, spectroscopically observed at medium resolution
          (R=4100)  during  four  nights at VLT-FORS2. We found one close
          binary  candidate  in  M80, showing statistically significative
          radial  velocity  variations, and no clear evidence in NGC5986.
          These  results  confirm  the  lack  of close binaries among hot
          horizontal  branch stars in globular clusters, as already found
          in  NGC6752, at variance with what observed among hot subdwarfs
          in the field.

          Title: Globular Cluster Formation in Mergers

          Mergers  of  gas-rich  galaxies  lead to gravitationally driven
          increases  in  gas  pressure that can trigger intense bursts of
          star  and  cluster formation. Although star formation itself is
          clustered,   most   newborn   stellar  aggregates  are  unbound
          associations  and disperse. Gravitationally bound star clusters
          that survive for at least 10-20 internal crossing times (~20-40
          Myr)  are relatively rare and seem to contain <10% of all stars
          formed  in  the  starbursts.  The  most  massive young globular
          clusters  formed  in present-day mergers exceed omega Cen by an
          order  of  magnitude in mass, yet appear to have normal stellar
          initial mass functions.
          In  the  local universe, recent remnants of major gas-rich disk
          mergers  appear as protoelliptical galaxies with subpopulations
          of  typically  100-1000  young  metal-rich globular clusters in
          their   halos.   The   evidence   is   now  strong  that  these
          "second-generation"   globular   clusters   formed  from  giant
          molecular  clouds  in the merging disks, squeezed into collapse
          by  large-scale  shocks  and  high  gas pressure rather than by
          high-velocity   cloud-cloud   collisions.   Similarly,   first-
          generation  metal-poor globular clusters may have formed during
          cosmological  reionization from low-metallicity giant molecular
          clouds squeezed by the universal reionization pressure.

          Title:  Identification of the OGLE-2003-BLG-235/MOA-2003-BLG-53
          Planetary Host Star
          Authors:  David  P.  Bennett, Jay Anderson, Ian A.Bond, Andrzej

          Comments: 11 pages, with 3 figures. Submitted to ApJ Lett
          We  present  the results of HST observations of the source star
          for the first clear extrasolar planet detected by microlensing.
          The  light  curve  model  for this event predicts that the lens
          star  should be separated from the source star by ~6 mas at the
          time  of  the  HST  images.  If the lens star is a late G, K or
          early  M dwarf, then it will be visible in the HST images as an
          additional  source  of  light  that  is blended with the source
          image. Unless the lens and source have exactly the same colors,
          its  presence  will  also  be  revealed  by  a systematic shift
          between  centroids  of the source plus lens in different filter
          bands.  The  HST  data indicates both of these effects: the HST
          source  that  matches  the  position of the source star is 0.21
          magnitudes  brighter  in  the  ACS/HRC-F814W  filter  than  the
          microlensing model predicts, and there is an offset of ~0.7 mas
          between  the  centroid  of  this  source in the F814W and F435W
          filter  bands.  We  conclude  the  planetary host star has been
          detected  in  these  HST images, and this identification of the
          lens  star  enables a complete solution of the lens system. The
          lens  parameters  are  determined  with  a  Bayesian  analysis,
          averaging   over  uncertainties  in  the  measured  parameters,
          interstellar  extinction, and allowing for the possibility of a
          binary companion to the source star. This yields a stellar mass
          of  M_* = 0.63 (+0.07/-0.09) M_solar and a planet mass of M_p =
          2.6   (+0.8/-0.6}  M_Jup,  at  an  orbital  separation  of  4.3
          (+2.5/-0.8)  AU.  Thus, the lens system resembles our own Solar
          System,  with  a  planet of ~3 Jupiter-masses in a Jupiter-like
          orbit  around  a  star  of  two-thirds  of  a Solar mass. These
          conclusions  can be tested with future HST images, which should
          reveal  a  broadening  of  the  blended  source-plus-lens point
          spread function due to the relative lens-source proper motion.

          Using  the  3-telescope  IOTA interferometer on Mt. Hopkins, we
          report  results  from  the first near-infrared (lambda=1.65 mu)
          closure-phase  survey  of  Young  Stellar Objects (YSOs). These
          closure phases allow us to unambiguously detect departures from
          centrosymmetry  (i.e.,  skew)  in the emission pattern from YSO
          disks on the scale of ~4 milliarcseconds, expected from generic
          ``flared  disk''  models. Six of fourteen targets showed small,
          yet  statistically-significant,  non-zero  closure phases, with
          largest  values  from the young binary system MWC 361-A and the
          (pre-main  sequence?)  Be  star  HD 45677. Our observations are
          quite sensitive to the vertical structure of the inner disk and
          we  confront  the  predictions  of the ``puffed-up inner wall''
          models of Dullemond, Dominik, and Natta (DDN). Our data support
          disks  models  with  curved  inner  rims  because  the expected
          emission  appear symmetrically-distributed around the star over
          a  wide  range  of inclination angles. In contrast, our results
          are  incompatible  with  the  models  possessing vertical inner
          walls  because  they  predict  extreme  skewness  (i.e.,  large
          closure phases) from the near-IR disk emission that is not seen
          in  our  data.  In  addition,  we also present the discovery of
          mysterious   H-band   ``halos''  (~5-10%  of  light  on  scales
          0.01-0.50   arcsec)   around   a  few  objects,  a  preliminary
          ``parametric  imaging''  study  for  HD  45677,  and  the first
          astrometric orbit for the young binary MWC 361-A.

          Title: Bright Localized Near-Infrared Emission at 1-4 AU in the

          Comments: Accepted by Astrophysical Journal Letters
          We  report on the detection of localized off-center emission at
          1-4  AU  in  the circumstellar environment of the young stellar
          object  AB  Aurigae.  We used closure phase measurements in the
          near-infrared  made  at  the long baseline interferometer IOTA,
          the  first  obtained  on  a  young  stellar  object  using this
          technique.  When  probing sub-AU scales, all closure phases are
          close    to    zero    degrees,    as    expected   given   the
          previously-determined  size  of the AB Aurigae inner dust disk.
          However,  a  clear closure phase signal of -3.5 +/- 0.5 degrees
          is   detected  on  one  triangle  containing  relatively  short
          baselines,  requiring  a high degree of non-point symmetry from
          emission  at  larger (AU-sized) scales in the disk. We have not
          identified  any alternative explanation for these closure phase
          results  and demonstrate that a ``disk hot spot'' model can fit
          our  data.  We  speculate  that  such  asymmetric near-infrared
          emission  detected might arise as a result of localized viscous
          heating  due  to  a gravitational instability in the AB Aurigae
          disk,  or  to  the  presence  of  a  close stellar companion or
          accreting sub-stellar object.

          We  present  the  type-1  active  galactic  nuclei (AGN) sample
          extracted  from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey first observations of
          21000  spectra  in  1.75  square  degree. This sample, which is
          purely  magnitude  limited,  free  of  morphological  or  color
          selection  biases,  contains 130 broad line AGN (BLAGN) spectra
          with  redshift up to 5. Our data are divided into a wide (Iab <
          22.5)  and  a  deep  (Iab  < 24) subsample containing 56 and 74
          objects  respectively.  Because  of  its  depth  and  selection
          criteria,   this   sample  is  uniquely  suited  to  study  the
          population of faint type-1 AGN. Our measured surface density (~
          472   +-  48  BLAGN  per  square  degree  with  Iab  <  24)  is
          significantly  higher than that of any other optically selected
          sample  of BLAGN with spectroscopic confirmation. By applying a
          morphological  and  color  analysis  to  our AGN sample we find
          that:  (1)~23% of the AGN brighter than Iab=22.5 are classified
          as extended; this percentage increases to ~42% for those with z
          <  1.6;  (2)  a  non-negligible fraction of our BLAGN are lying
          close to the color space area occupied by stars in u*-g' versus
          g'-r' color-color diagram. This leads us to the conclusion that
          classical   optical   ultraviolet  preselection  technique,  if
          employed  at such deep magnitudes (Iab=22.5) in conjuction with
          a  preselection of point-like sources, can miss miss up to ~35%
          of the AGN population. Finally, we present a composite spectrum
          of  our  sample  of  objects. While the continuum shape is very
          similar  to that of the SDSS composite at short wavelengths, it
          is much redder than it at lambda > 3000 A. We interpret this as
          due  to  significant  contamination  from  emission of the host
          galaxies,  as  expected  from  the  faint  absolute  magnitudes
          sampled by our survey.

          Proceedings  of  SPIE  Vol.  6275, "Astronomical Telescopes and
          Instrumentation,  Millimeter  and  Submillimeter  Detectors and
          Instrumentation for Astronomy III"
          We   report  on  the  development  of  SuperCam,  a  64  pixel,
          superheterodyne   camera   designed   for   operation   in  the
          astrophysically   important   870  micron  atmospheric  window.
          SuperCam will be used to answer fundamental questions about the
          physics  and  chemistry  of  molecular clouds in the Galaxy and
          their  direct relation to star and planet formation. The advent
          of such a system will provide an order of magnitude increase in
          mapping  speed over what is now available and revolutionize how
          observational   astronomy   is   performed  in  this  important
          wavelength   regime.   Unlike  the  situation  with  bolometric
          detectors,  heterodyne receiver systems are coherent, retaining
          information  about both the amplitude and phase of the incident
          photon stream. From this information a high resolution spectrum
          of  the  incident  light  can be obtained without multiplexing.
          SuperCam  will  be  constructed  by stacking eight, 1x8 rows of
          fixed  tuned,  SIS  mixers. The IF output of each mixer will be
          connected  to  a low-noise, broadband MMIC amplifier integrated
          into  the  mixer  block. The instantaneous IF bandwidth of each
          pixel  will  be  ~2  GHz,  with  a center frequency of 5 GHz. A
          spectrum  of  the  central  500  MHz  of  each  IF band will be
          provided  by  the array spectrometer. Local oscillator power is
          provided  by  a  frequency  multiplier  whose output is divided
          between  the  pixels  by  using  a  matrix  of  waveguide power
          dividers.   The   mixer  array  will  be  cooled  to  4K  by  a
          closed-cycle  refrigeration system. SuperCam will reside at the
          Cassegrain  focus  of the 10m Heinrich Hertz telescope (HHT). A
          prototype  single row of the array will be tested on the HHT in
          2006,  with the first engineering run of the full array in late
          2007.  The  array is designed and constructed so that it may be
          readily scaled to higher frequencies.

          We  have  undertaken  a  multiwavelength  project  to study the
          relatively  unknown  properties  of groups and poor clusters of
          galaxies  at intermediate redshifts. In this paper, we describe
          the  XMM-Newton  observations of six X-ray selected groups with
          0.2<z<0.6.  The X-ray properties of these systems are generally
          in  good  agreement with the properties of low-redshift groups.
          They appear to follow the scaling relations between luminosity,
          temperature,  and  velocity  dispersion defined by low-redshift
          groups  and  clusters.  The  X-ray  emission in four of the six
          groups  is  also  centered on a dominant early-type galaxy. The
          lack  of  a  bright  elliptical galaxy at the peak of the group
          X-ray  emission  is  rare  at  low-redshifts, and the other two
          groups  may be less dynamically evolved. We find indications of
          excess  entropy  in these systems over self-similar predictions
          out  to  large  radii. We also confirm the presence of at least
          one  X-ray  luminous  AGN associated with a group member galaxy
          and find several other potential group AGN.

          Authors: M.Chernyakova, A.Neronov, R.Walter
          Comments: 8 pages, submitted to MNRAS
          LSI  +61  303  is  one  of  the few X-ray binaries with Be star
          companion  from  which  both  radio  and  high-energy gamma-ray
          emission have been observed. We present XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL
          observations  which  reveal  variability  of the X-ray spectral
          index of the system. The X-ray spectrum is hard (photon index ~
          1.5) during the orbital phases of both high and low X-ray flux.
          However,  the spectrum softens at the moment of transition from
          high to low X-ray state. The spectrum of the system in the hard
          X-ray  band  does  not reveal the presence of a cut-off (or, at
          least  a spectral break) at 10-60 keV energies, expected if the
          compact  object  is  an  accreting  neutron  star. The observed
          spectrum  and  spectral  variability  can  be  explained if the
          compact object in the system is a rotation powered pulsar.

          Based  on  a  spectral  analysis  of  the  X-ray  continuum, we
          conclude  that  the  compact primary of the binary X-ray source
          GRS  1915+105  is a rapidly-rotating Kerr black hole. We find a
          lower  limit  on the dimensionless spin parameter of a* greater
          than  0.98.  Our  result  is  robust  in  the  sense that it is
          independent of the details of the data analysis and insensitive
          to  the  uncertainties  in  the  mass and distance of the black
          hole.  Furthermore, the result is based on a fully relativistic
          accretion-disk  model,  which includes an advanced treatment of
          spectral hardening. Our data selection relies on a rigorous and
          quantitative  definition  of  the  thermal  state of black hole
          binaries, which we used to screen all of the available RXTE and
          ASCA  data  for the thermal state of GRS 1915+105. We also give
          an update on published results on the relatively moderate spins
          that  have  been  reported  for  three other stellar-mass black
          holes:  a*  ~ 0.65-0.80 for GRO J1655-40, a* ~ 0.70-0.85 for 4U
          1543-47, and a* less than 0.26 for LMC X-3. Finally, we discuss
          the  significance  of  our  results  for  relativistic-jet  and
          core-collapse  models,  and  for the detection of gravitational
          waves.

          Title:  A  Simultaneous  Optical and X-ray Variability Study of
          the  Orion  Nebula  Cluster.  I.  Incidence  of Time-Correlated

          We  present  a database of $BVRI$ time-series photometry of the
          Orion  Nebula Cluster obtained with two ground-based telescopes
          at  different  longitudes to provide simultaneous coverage with
          the  13-d  Chandra  observation  of  the cluster. The resulting
          database  of  simultaneous  optical  and X-ray light curves for
          some 800 pre--main-sequence (PMS) stars represents, by a factor
          of  hundreds,  the  largest synoptic, multi--wavelength-regime,
          time-series  study  of  young stars to date. This database will
          permit  detailed  analyses  of the relationship between optical
          and   X-ray   variability  among  a  statistically  significant
          ensemble of PMS stars, with the goal of elucidating the origins
          of  PMS  X-ray  production. In this first paper, we present the
          optical   observations,  describe  the  combined  X-ray/optical
          database,   and   perform   an   analysis   of  time-correlated
          variability  in the optical and X-ray light curves. We identify
          40  stars  (representing  5% of our study sample) with possible
          time-correlated optical and X-ray variability. Examples of both
          positive  and  negative  time-correlations  are found, possibly
          representing  X-ray  flares  and  persistent  coronal  features
          associated   with   both  cool  and  hot  surface  spots  (i.e.
          magnetically active regions and accretion shocks). We also find
          two  possible  examples of "white-light" flares coincident with
          X-ray  flares;  these  may  correspond to the impulsive heating
          phase  in  solar-analog  flares.  However,  though interesting,
          these  represent  unusual  cases.  More generally, we find very
          little  evidence  to  suggest  a direct causal link between the
          sources  of  optical  and  X-ray  variability in PMS stars. The
          conclusion   that  accretion  is  a  primary  driver  of  X-ray
          production in PMS stars is not supported by our findings.

          Title:  Orbital Evolution of Algol Binaries with a Circumbinary
          Disk
          Authors: Wen-Cong Chen, Xiang-Dong Li, Sheng-Bang Qian
          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          It  is  generally  thought  that  conservative mass transfer in
          Algol  binaries  causes  their orbits to be wider, in which the
          less  massive  star  overflows  its  Roche-lobe.  The  observed
          decrease in the orbital periods of some Algol binaries suggests
          orbital  angular momentum loss during the binary evolution, and
          the  magnetic braking mechanism is often invoked to explain the
          observed  orbital  shrinkage.  Here  we  suggest an alternative
          explanation,  assuming that a small fraction of the transferred
          mass  forms a circumbinary disk, which extracts orbital angular
          momentum from the binary through tidal torques. We also perform
          numerical  calculations of the evolution of Algol binaries with
          typical   initial  masses  and  orbital  periods.  The  results
          indicate   that,   for   reasonable   input   parameters,   the
          circumbinary  disk  can  significantly  influence  the  orbital
          evolution, and cause the orbit to shrink on a sufficiently long
          timescale.  Rapid mass transfer in Algol binaries with low mass
          ratios can also be accounted for in this scenario.

          With  its ability to look at bright galactic X-ray sources with
          sub-millisecond   time   resolution,  the  Rossi  X-ray  Timing
          Explorer   (RXTE)  discovered  that  the  X-ray  emission  from
          accreting  compact  stars  shows quasi-periodic oscillations on
          the  dynamical  timescales  of  the  strong  field region. RXTE
          showed also that waveform fitting of the oscillations resulting
          from hot spots at the surface of rapidly rotating neutron stars
          constrain  their  masses  and  radii.  These  two breakthroughs
          suddenly  opened  up  a  new  window on fundamental physics, by
          providing  new  insights  on  strong  gravity and dense matter.
          Building  upon  the RXTE legacy, in the Cosmic Vision exercise,
          testing  General  Relativity  in  the  strong  field  limit and
          constraining  the  equation  of  state  of  dense  matter  were
          recognized  recently  as  key  goals  to  be pursued in the ESA
          science   program   for  the  years  2015-2025.  This  in  turn
          identified  the  need  for a large (10 m2 class) aperture X-ray
          observatory.  In  recognition  of  this  need, the XEUS mission
          concept  which  has  evolved  into a single launch L2 formation
          flying  mission will have a fast timing instrument in the focal
          plane.  In  this  paper  I will outline the unique science that
          will be addressed with fast X-ray timing on XEUS.

          Comments:  42  pages,  7  figures. Accepted by The Astronomical
          Journal
          We  report  the  most  sensitive water maser survey towards Bok
          globules  to  date,  using  NASA's  70m  antenna  in Robledo de
          Chavela  (Spain).  We  observed  207  positions  within  the CB
          catalog  with  a  higher probability of harboring a young star,
          using  as  selection  criteria  the presence of radio continuum
          emission   (from   submillimeter  to  centimeter  wavelengths),
          geometrical  centers  of  molecular  outflows, peaks in maps of
          high-density  gas  tracers (NH3 or CS), and IRAS point sources.
          We  have  obtained 7 maser detections, 6 of which (in CB 34, CB
          54,  CB  65,  CB  101, CB 199, and CB 232) are reported for the
          first  time  here.  Most  of  the  water masers we detected are
          likely  to  be  associated  with  young stellar objects (YSOs),
          except  for  CB  101  (probably  an  evolved  object) and CB 65
          (uncertain   nature).  The  water  maser  in  CB  199  shows  a
          relatively  high shift (~30 km/s) of its velocity centroid with
          respect  to  the  cloud velocity, which is unusual for low-mass
          YSOs.  We  speculate  that high-velocity masers in this kind of
          object could be related with episodes of energetic mass-loss in
          close  binaries.  Alternatively,  the  maser in CB 199 could be
          pumped  by a protoplanetary or a young planetary nebula. CB 232
          is  the  smallest  Bok globule (~0.6 pc) known to be associated
          with  water  maser emission, although it would be superseded by
          the  cases  of  CB  65  (~0.3 pc) and CB 199 (~0.5 pc) if their
          association  with YSOs is confirmed. All our selection criteria
          have  statistically compatible detection rates, except for IRAS
          sources,  which  tend  to be a somewhat worse predictor for the
          presence of maser emission.

          Title:  Failed disk winds; a physical origin for the soft X-ray
          excess?
          Authors: N.J. Schurch, C. Done
          Comments:  13 Pages. 5 colour figures. Accepted for publication
          in MNRAS
          The  origin  of the soft X-ray excess emission observed in many
          type-1  AGN  has  been an unresolved problem in X-ray astronomy
          for  over two decades. We develop the model proposed Gierlinski
          &  Done  (2004),  which  models  the  soft  excess with heavily
          smeared,  ionized,  absorption,  by including the emission that
          must  be  associated with this absorption. We show that, rather
          than  hindering  the  ionized absorption model, the addition of
          the  emission  actually  helps  this  model  reproduce the soft
          excess.  The  emission  fills in some of the absorption trough,
          while  preserving  the sharp rise at ~1 keV, allowing the total
          model   to   reproduce   the   soft  excess  curvature  from  a
          considerably  wider  range  of model parameters. We demonstrate
          that  this  model  is capable of reproducing even the strongest
          soft  X-ray  excesses  by  fitting it to the XMM-Newton EPIC PN
          spectrum  of PG1211+143, with good results. The addition of the
          emission  reduces the column density required to fit these data
          by a factor ~2 and reduces the smearing velocity from ~0.28c to
          ~0.2c.  Gierlinski  & Done suggested a tentative origin for the
          absorption   in  the  innermost,  accelerating,  region  of  an
          accretion  disk  wind,  and we highlight the advantages of this
          interpretation  in  comparison  to  accretion  disk  reflection
          models  of  the  soft  excess. Associating this material with a
          wind  off  the  accretion  disk  results  in  several  separate
          problems  however,  namely,  the radial nature, and the massive
          implied  mass-loss rate, of the wind. We propose an origin in a
          'failed  wind', where the central X-ray source is strong enough
          to over-ionize the wind, removing the acceleration through line
          absorption   before   the  material  reaches  escape  velocity,
          allowing the material to fall back to the disk at larger radii.

          Title: Black Holes with Quantum Massive Spin-2 Hair
          Authors: Gia Dvali
          Comments: 15 pages, Latex
          We  show  that  black  holes  can  posses  a long range quantum
          mechanical  hair  associated with a massive spin-2 field, which
          can   be   detected   by   a   stringy  generalization  of  the
          Aharovon-Bohm  effect, in which a string loop lassoes the black
          hole.  The  long  distance  effect persist for arbitrarily high
          mass of the spin-2 field. An analogous effect is exhibited by a
          massive  antisymmetric two-form field. We make a close parallel
          between  the two and the ordinary Aharonov-Bohm phenomenon, and
          also show that in the latter case the effect can be experienced
          even  by  the  electrically-neutral  particles,  provided  some
          boundary terms are added to the action.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A. 9 pages, 9 figures
          We  examine the predictions of the core accretion - gas capture
          model  concerning  the  efficiency  of  planet formation around
          stars  with  various  masses. First, we follow the evolution of
          gas  and solids from the moment when all solids are in the form
          of  small grains to the stage when most of them are in the form
          of  planetesimals.  We  show  that  the  surface density of the
          planetesimal  swarm  tends  to  be  higher  around less massive
          stars.  Then,  we  derive  the  minimum  surface density of the
          planetesimal swarm required for the formation of a giant planet
          both  in a numerical and in an approximate analytical approach.
          We combine these results by calculating a set of representative
          disk  models  characterized  by  different  masses,  sizes, and
          metallicities,  and  by  estimating their capability of forming
          giant  planets. Our results show that the set of protoplanetary
          disks  capable  of  giant  planet  formation is larger for less
          massive  stars.  Provided that the distribution of initial disk
          parameters  does  not  depend  too  strongly on the mass of the
          central  star,  we  predict  that  the percentage of stars with
          giant  planets  should  increase  with decreasing stellar mass.
          Furthermore,  we  identify  the radial redistribution of solids
          during  the formation of planetesimal swarms as the key element
          in explaining these effects.

          Feedback  from  quasars and AGNs is being invoked frequently in
          several  cosmological  settings. Currently, order of magnitude,
          or  more,  uncertainties  in the structure of both the wind and
          the  'obscuring  torus'  make  predictions highly uncertain. To
          make  testable  models  of  this  'cosmological feedback' it is
          essential   to   understand  the  detailed  structure  of  AGNs
          sufficiently  well  to  predict  their properties for the whole
          quasar  population, at all redshifts. Progress in both areas is
          rapid,  and  I  describe  the  near-term prospects for reducing
          these uncertainties for 'slow' (non-relativistic) AGN winds and
          the obscuring torus.

          We  consider  the problem of detectability of macro-engineering
          projects  over interstellar distances, in the context of Search
          for  ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (SETI). Freeman J. Dyson and
          his  imaginative  precursors, like Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Olaf
          Stapledon  or  John  B. S. Haldane, suggested macro-engineering
          projects as focal points in the context of extrapolations about
          the  future  of  humanity  and,  by  analogy, other intelligent
          species  in  the  Milky  Way.  We emphasize that the search for
          signposts of extraterrestrial macro-engineering projects is not
          an  optional  pursuit  within the family of ongoing and planned
          SETI  projects;  inter  alia,  the failure of the orthodox SETI
          thus  far  clearly  indicates this. Instead, this approach (for
          which we suggest a name of "Dysonian") should be the front-line
          and  mainstay  of  any  cogent  SETI  strategy in future, being
          significantly   more  promising  than  searches  for  directed,
          intentional  radio  or  microwave  emissions. This is in accord
          with  our improved astrophysical understanding of the structure
          and  evolution  of the Galactic Habitable Zone, as well as with
          the  recent  wake-up  call  of  Steven  J.  Dick to investigate
          consequences  of  postbiological  evolution for astrobiology in
          general  and  SETI  programs  in  particular. The benefits this
          multidisciplinary  approach  may  bear  for macro-engineers are
          also briefly highlighted.

          Comments: 13 page in emulateapj.sty, ApJ in press
          The  unified  model of Seyfert galaxies suggests that there are
          hidden  broad-line regions (HBLRs) in Seyfert 2 galaxies (S2s).
          However,  there  is increasing evidence for the appearance of a
          subclass  of S2s lacking of HBLR (non-HBLR S2s). An interesting
          issue  arises  as to relations of non-HBLR S2s with other types
          of  Seyfert galaxies and whether or not they can be included in
          the unified model. We assemble two sub-samples consisting of 42
          non-HBLR  S2s  and  44  narrow-line  Seyfert  1s  (NLS1s)  with
          redshift $z\le 0.05$ from published literatures to explore this
          issue.  We  compare  black hole masses in the galactic centers,
          accretion  rates, infrared color ratio ($f_{60 \mu \rm m}/f_{25
          \mu  \rm  m}$)  as  a  potential  indicator  of the dusty torus
          orientation,  \oiii  $\lambda  5007$,  radio  and  far infrared
          luminosities.  We  find  that  non-HBLR  S2s and NLS1s have: 1)
          similar  distributions  of the black hole masses ($10^6-3\times
          10^7\sunm$)  and  the  Eddington  ratios  ($L_{\rm  Bol}/L_{\rm
          Edd}\sim  1$);  2)  significantly  different  distributions  of
          $f_{60  \mu  \rm  m}/f_{25  \mu  \rm  m}$  ratios;  3)  similar
          distributions  of  bulge magnitudes and luminosities of [O {\sc
          iii}],  radio,  far  infrared  emission.  The  similarities and
          differences   can   be   understood   naturally   if  they  are
          intrinsically same but non-HBLR S2s are viewed at larger angles
          of  observer's  sight than NLS1s. We thus suggest that non-HBLR
          S2s  only  have  "narrower" broad line regions and they are the
          counterparts  of  NLS1s  viewed at high inclination angles. The
          absence  of  the  polarized  emission  line  in non-HBLR S2s is
          caused  by the less massive black holes and high accretion rate
          similar to NLS1s. The implications of the unification scheme of
          non-HBLR S2s and NLS1s are discussed.

          We  study the formation of the first generation of stars in the
          standard  cold  dark matter model, using a very high-resolution
          hydordynamic  simulations.  Our  simulation  achieves a dynamic
          range  of  10^{10}  in length scale. With accurate treatment of
          atomic  and  molecular  physics,  it  allows  us  to  study the
          chemo-thermal  evolution  of primordial gas clouds to densities
          up  to n = 10^{16}/cc without assuming any a priori equation of
          state;  a  six  orders  of magnitudes improvement over previous
          three-dimensional  calculations.  All  the  relevant atomic and
          molecular  cooling  and heating processes, including cooling by
          collision-induced  continuum  emission,  are  implemented.  For
          calculating  optically  thick  H2 cooling at high densities, we
          use  the  Sobolev method. To examine possible gas fragmentation
          owing  to thermal instability, we compute explicitly the growth
          rate  of  isobaric  perturbations.  We show that the cloud core
          does  not  fragment  in  either the low-density or high-density
          regimes.  We  also  show  that  the core remains stable against
          gravitational  deformation  and  fragmentation.  We  obtain  an
          accurate  gas  mass  accretion  rate within a 10 Msun innermost
          region  around  the  protostar.  The protostar is accreting the
          surrounding hot gas at a rate of 0.001-0.01 Msun/yr. From these
          findings  we  conclude  that  primordial  stars formed in early
          minihalos  are  massive.  We  carry out proto-stellar evolution
          calculations  using  the obtained accretion rate. The resulting
          mass  of the first star is M_ZAMS = 60-100 Msun, with the exact
          mass dependent on the actual accretion rate.

          Wide-field,    very   long   baseline   interferometry   (VLBI)
          observations  of  the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253, obtained
          with  the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA), have produced a
          2.3  GHz image with a maximum angular resolution of 15 mas (0.3
          pc).  Six  sources  were detected, all corresponding to sources
          identified  in higher frequency (>5 GHz) VLA images. One of the
          sources,  supernova  remnant  5.48-43.3,  is  resolved  into  a
          shell-like structure approximately 90 mas (1.7 pc) in diameter.
          From these data and data from the literature, the spectra of 20
          compact  radio sources in NGC 253 were modelled and found to be
          consistent  with  free-free  absorbed  power laws. Broadly, the
          free-free  opacity  is  highest  toward  the nucleus but varies
          significantly  throughout  the  nuclear region (tau_0 ~ 1->20),
          implying  that  the  overall structure of the ionised medium is
          clumpy.  Of  the  20  sources, nine have flat intrinsic spectra
          associated  with  thermal  radio  emission and the remaining 11
          have  steep  intrinsic  spectra,  associated  with  synchrotron
          emission  from supernova remnants. A supernova rate upper limit
          of  2.4  yr^-1 is determined for the inner 320 pc region of the
          galaxy  at  the  95%  confidence  level,  based  on the lack of
          detection  of  new  sources  in observations spanning almost 17
          years  and  a  simple  model  for  the  evolution  of supernova
          remnants.  A  supernova rate of >0.14 (v/10^5) yr^-1 is implied
          from  estimates  of  supernova remnant source counts, sizes and
          expansion  rates,  where  v is the radial expansion velocity of
          the  supernova remnant in km s^-1. A star formation rate of 3.4
          v/10^6  <  SFR(M<=5Msun)  <  59  Msun  yr^-1 has been estimated
          directly  from  the  supernova  rate  limits and is of the same
          order  of magnitude as rates determined from integrated FIR and
          radio luminosities.

          Relativistic outflows represent one of the best-suited tools to
          probe  the  physics  of  AGN.  Numerical  modelling of internal
          structure   of  the  relativistic  outflows  on  parsec  scales
          provides  important  clues about the conditions and dynamics of
          the  material  in  the  immediate vicinity of the central black
          holes  in AGN. We investigate possible causes of the structural
          patterns  and  regularities observed in the parsec-scale jet of
          the  well-known quasar 3C 273. We present here the results from
          a  3D  relativistic hydrodynamics numerical simulation based on
          the  parameters  given  for the jet by Lobanov & Zensus (2001),
          and  one  in  which  the  effects  of  jet  precession  and the
          injection  of discrete components have been taken into account.
          We  compare  the  model  with the structures observed in 3C 273
          using very long baseline interferometry and constrain the basic
          properties  of  the flow. We find growing perturbation modes in
          the  simulation with similar wavelengths to those observed, but
          with a different set of wave speeds and mode identification. If
          the  observed  longest  helical  structure  is  produced by the
          precession  of  the  flow,  longer precession periods should be
          expected. Our results show that some of the observed structures
          could be explained by growing Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in
          a  slow  moving  region  of  the jet. However, we point towards
          possible  errors  in the mode identification that show the need
          of  more  complete  linear  analysis  in order to interpret the
          observations.  We  conclude that, with the given viewing angle,
          superluminal  components  and jet precession cannot explain the
          observed structures.

          (abridged)  We present panoramic Spitzer MIPS 24um observations
          covering  9x9Mpc  (25'x25') fields around two massive clusters,
          Cl0024+16 and MS0451-03, at z=0.39 and z=0.55. Our observations
          cover  a very wide range of environments within these clusters,
          from   high-density   regions  around  the  cores  out  to  the
          turn-around radius. Cross-correlating the mid-infrared catalogs
          with deep optical and near-infrared imaging of these fields, we
          investigate    the    optical/near-infrared   colors   of   the
          mid-infrared  sources. We find excesses of mid-infrared sources
          with  optical/near-infrared  colors expected of cluster members
          in   the   two   clusters   and   test   this  selection  using
          spectroscopically   confirmed   24um  members.  The  much  more
          significant   excess  is  associated  with  Cl0024+16,  whereas
          MS0451-03  has  comparatively  few  mid-infrared  sources.  The
          mid-infrared  galaxy  population  in  Cl0024+16  appears  to be
          associated  with  dusty star-forming galaxies (typically redder
          than  the  general  cluster  population  by up to A_V~1-2 mags)
          rather  than  emission  from  dusty tori around active galactic
          nuclei  (AGN)  in early-type hosts. The inferred total-infrared
          star-formation  rates  in  Cl0024+16  are typically >5x greater
          than  those  found  from  a  similar  Halpha survey, indicating
          significant  obscured  activity  in  the cluster population. We
          find   evidence   for   strong   evolution   of  the  level  of
          dust-obscured  star-formation  in  dense  environments  out  to
          z=0.5,  analogous to the rise in fraction of optically-selected
          star-forming  galaxies  seen  in  clusters and the field out to
          similar  redshifts.  However,  there  are  clearly  significant
          cluster-to-cluster    variations    in   the   populations   of
          mid-infrared  sources,  probably  reflecting differences in the
          intracluster  media  and  recent  dynamical  evolution of these
          systems.

          Title: Constraints on the mass of a habitable planet with water
          of nebular origin
          Authors: Masahiro Ikoma, Hidenori Genda
          Comments:  25  pages,  8 figures, to appear in the 01 September
          2006 issue of ApJ
          From  an  astrobiological  point of view, special attention has
          been paid to the probability of habitable planets in extrasolar
          systems.  The  purpose of this study is to constrain a possible
          range  of  the mass of a terrestrial planet that can get water.
          We  focus  on the process of water production through oxidation
          of  the  atmospheric  hydrogen--the  nebular  gas  having  been
          attracted  gravitationally--by oxide available at the planetary
          surface.  For  the water production to work well on a planet, a
          sufficient  amount  of  hydrogen and enough high temperature to
          melt  the  planetary  surface are needed. We have simulated the
          structure   of   the   atmosphere   that   connects   with  the
          protoplanetary  nebula  for  wide ranges of heat flux, opacity,
          and density of the nebular gas. We have found both requirements
          are  fulfilled  for an Earth-mass planet for wide ranges of the
          parameters.  We  have  also  found  the  surface temperature of
          planets  of  <=  0.3  Earth  masses  is  lower than the melting
          temperature  of silicate (~ 1500K). On the other hand, a planet
          of  more  than  several Earth masses becomes a gas giant planet
          through runaway accretion of the nebular gas.

          The  feasibility  of  observing the C18O (3-2) spectral line in
          cold  clouds  with  the  APEX telescope has been tested. As the
          line  at  329.330  GHz lies in the wing of a strong atmospheric
          H2O  absorption  it  can  be  observed  only  at  high altitude
          observatories. Using the three lowest rotational levels instead
          of  only  two  helps  to narrow down the physical properties of
          dark clouds and globules. The centres of two C18O maxima in the
          high latitude low mass star forming region CG 12 were mapped in
          C18O  (3-2)  and  the data were analyzed together with spectral
          line  data  from the SEST. The T_MB(3-2)/T_MB(2-1) ratio in the
          northern  C18O  maximum,  CG  12 N, is 0.8, and in the southern
          maximum,  CG  12 S, ~2. CG 12 N is modelled as a 120'' diameter
          (0.4pc)  cold core with a mass of 27 Msun. A small size maximum
          with  a narrow, 0.8 kms-1, C18O (3-2) spectral line with a peak
          temperature of T_MB ~11 K was detected in CG 12 S. This maximum
          is modelled as a 60'' to 80'' diameter (~0.2pc) hot (80 K < Tex
          <  200  K)  ~1.6  Msun  clump. The source lies on the axis of a
          highly  collimated  bipolar  molecular outflow near its driving
          source.  This  is  the  first detection of such a compact, warm
          object in a low mass star forming region.

          Authors: Wei Fang, H.Q.Lu, Z.G.Huang
          Comments: 15 pages, eight figures
          We  present  phase-plane  analysis  of cosmologies containing a
          dilatonic  scalar field coupling to a baryotropic fluid with an
          exponential potential. We show that for baryotropic fluid being
          radiation the properties of critical points are the same as the
          conventional  scalar  field  in  Ref[11]. For baryotropic fluid
          being  ordinary  matter  there  are  coupling between dilatonic
          scalar  field  and ordinary matter and therefore the properties
          of critical points are more distinctive. It is possible for all
          the  critical  points  to  be  stable as long as the parameters
          $\lambda$  and  $\beta$  satisfy  some  conditions. We plot the
          phase plane for some values of $\lambda$ and $\beta$ which show
          the attractor behaviors of the plane-autonomous system clearly.
          Finally  with  the  bound  on  $\beta$  from the observation we
          conclude   that  present  accelerating  expansion  is  not  the
          eventual stage of universe.

          Comments: 19 pages, 18 figures
          The  cosmological  evolution in Nonlinear Born-Infeld(hereafter
          NLBI)   scalar   field  theory  with  negative  potentials  was
          investigated.  The  cosmological  solutions  in  some important
          evolutive  epoches  were  obtained.  The  different evolutional
          behaviors between NLBI and linear scalar field theory have been
          presented.  A  notable characteristic is that NLBI scalar field
          behaves  as  ordinary  matter  nearly the singularity while the
          linear  scalar field behaves as "stiff" matter. We find that in
          order  to  accommodate current observational universe the value
          of  potential  parameters  $|m|$ and $|V_0|$ must have an upper
          bound.   We   compare  different  cosmological  evolutions  for
          different potential parameters $m, V_0$

          designed  to  measure distances of early-type galaxies by means
          of  surface  brightness  fluctuations of unresolved stars. This
          suite of programs called SAPAC is made readily available to the
          astronomical community for extensive testing with the long-term
          goal  to  provide  the  necessary tools for systematic distance
          surveys   of   early-type  galaxies  using  modern  optical/NIR
          telescopes  equipped  with  wide-field  cameras. We discuss the
          technical  and scientific concepts of SAPAC and demonstrate its
          capabilities  by  analysing  deep B and R-band CCD images of 10
          dwarf  elliptical  (dE) galaxy candidates in the Fornax cluster
          obtained with FORS1 at the VLT. All candidates are confirmed as
          cluster  members.  We  then turn our attention to the innermost
          region of the Fornax cluster. A total of 29 early-type galaxies
          closer  than  three  cluster  core  radii  (2 degrees) from the
          central   galaxy   NGC1399   have  radial  velocities  and  SBF
          distances.  Their Hubble diagram exhibits a pronounced S-shaped
          infall pattern suggesting a picture that Fornax is still in the
          process of formation during the present epoch through a general
          collapse and possible accretion of distinct groups of galaxies.
          The  associated  collapse  time  is  2.9(+1.6,  -0.9)Gyr. After
          cleansing our galaxy sample from a few kinematical outliers the
          true  distance  of  the  Fornax  cluster  core is determined at
          20.13+-0.40  Mpc [(m-M)_0=31.51+-0.04mag]. Applying a bootstrap
          resampling   technique   on   the  distance  distribution  with
          individual distance errors taken into account further reveals a
          small intrinsic cluster depth of sigma_int=0.74(+0.52,-0.74)Mpc
          in  best  agreement  with the cluster's linear extension in the
          sky: sigma_R.A=sigma_DEC~=0.5Mpc. (Abridged)

          Comments: MNRAS in press
          We  discuss  the  optical  and X-ray spectral properties of the
          sources  detected  in  a  single  200ks Chandra pointing in the
          Groth-Westphal   Strip   region.  Optical  identifications  and
          spectroscopic  redshifts  are  primarily from the DEEP2 survey.
          This  is complemented with deeper (r~26mag) multi-waveband data
          (ugriz) from the Canada France Hawaii Legacy Survey to estimate
          photometric redshifts and to optically identify sources fainter
          than  the  DEEP2  magnitude limit (R(AB)~24.5mag). We focus our
          study  on  the 2-10keV selected sample comprising 97 sources to
          the  limit  ~8e-16erg/s/cm2,  this  being  the most complete in
          terms   of  optical  identification  rate  (86%)  and  redshift
          determination    fraction    (63%;   both   spectroscopic   and
          photometric).  We  first construct the redshift distribution of
          the  sample  which  shows  a  peak  at  z~1.  This  is in broad
          agreement  with  models  where less luminous AGNs evolve out to
          z~1  with  powerful  QSOs  peaking  at  higher  redshift,  z~2.
          Evolution  similar  to  that  of broad-line QSOs applied to the
          entire  AGN  population  (both  type-I and II) does not fit the
          data.  We  also  explore  the  observed N_H distribution of the
          sample  and  estimate  a fraction of obscured AGN (N_H>1e22) of
          ~48%.  This  is  found  to be consistent with both a luminosity
          dependent  intrinsic  N_H  distribution,  where  less  luminous
          systems  comprise a higher fraction of type-II AGNs, and models
          with  a  fixed ratio 2:1 between type-I and II AGNs. We further
          compare our results with those obtained in deeper and shallower
          surveys.  We  argue that a luminosity dependent parametrisation
          of  the  intrinsic  N_H distribution is required to account for
          the fraction of obscured AGN observed in different samples over
          a wide range of fluxes.

          Title: Effects of a Supermassive Black Hole Binary on a Nuclear
          Gas Disk
          Authors: Hidenori Matsui, Asao Habe, Takayuki R. Saitoh
          Comments: 19 pages, 11 figures, accepted to ApJ
          We  study  influence  of  a galactic central supermassive black
          hole  (SMBH) binary on gas dynamics and star formation activity
          in  a  nuclear  gas  disk  by making three-dimensional Tree+SPH
          simulations. Due to orbital motions of SMBHs, there are various
          resonances  between  gas  motion and the SMBH binary motion. We
          have  shown  that  these  resonances create some characteristic
          structures  of  gas  in the nuclear gas disk, for examples, gas
          elongated  or  filament structures, formation of gaseous spiral
          arms,  and small gas disks around SMBHs. In these gaseous dense
          regions,  active  star  formations  are induced. As the result,
          many star burst regions are formed in the nuclear region.

          Title:  Self-consistent computation of gamma-ray spectra due to
          proton-proton interactions in black hole systems
          Authors:  S.  Bhattacharyya  (BARC),  N. Bhatt (BARC), R. Misra

          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          In  the inner regions of an accretion disk around a black hole,
          relativistic  protons  can  interact  with  ambient  matter  to
          produce  electrons,  positrons and $\gamma$-rays. The resultant
          steady  state  electron and positron particle distributions are
          self-consistently  computed  taking  into  account  Coulomb and
          Compton    cooling,    $e^-e^+$   pair   production   (due   to
          $\gamma-\gamma$  annihilation)  and  pair  annihilation.  While
          earlier  works  used  the diffusion approximation to obtain the
          particle   distributions,   here   we   solve  a  more  general
          integro-differential equation that correctly takes into account
          the large change in particle energy that occur when the leptons
          Compton  scatter  off hard X-rays. Thus this formalism can also
          be  applied  to the hard state of black hole systems, where the
          dominant  ambient  photons  are  hard X-rays. The corresponding
          photon   energy   spectrum  is  calculated  and  compared  with
          broadband  data  of  black  hole binaries in different spectral
          states.  The results indicate that the $\gamma$-ray spectra ($E
          >  0.8$  MeV) of both the soft and hard spectral states and the
          entire  hard  X-ray/$\gamma$-ray  spectrum  of  the  ultra-soft
          state,  could  be  due to $p-p$ interactions. These results are
          consistent  with  the  hypothesis  that  there always exists in
          these  systems  a  $\gamma$-ray spectral component due to $p-p$
          interactions  which  can  contribute  between 0.5 to 10% of the
          total bolometric luminosty. The model predicts that {\it GLAST}
          would  be  able  to  detect  black  hole  binaries  and provide
          evidence  for the presence of non-thermal protons which in turn
          would  give insight into the energy dissipation process and jet
          formation in these systems.

          Century", ESO Astrophysical Symposia Series
          Over  the last five decades, AGN studies have produced a number
          of   spectacular   examples   of   synergies  and  multifaceted
          approaches in astrophysics. The field of AGN research now spans
          the entire spectral range and covers more than twelve orders of
          magnitude  in  the  spatial  and  temporal  domains.  The  next
          generation   of  astrophysical  facilities  will  open  up  new
          possibilities  for  AGN  studies,  especially  in  the areas of
          high-resolution  and  high-fidelity imaging and spectroscopy of
          nuclear  regions  in the X-ray, optical, and radio bands. These
          studies  will  address in detail a number of critical issues in
          AGN  research  such  as  processes in the immediate vicinity of
          supermassive black holes, physical conditions of broad-line and
          narrow-line regions, formation and evolution of accretion disks
          and  relativistic  outflows, and the connection between nuclear
          activity and galaxy evolution.

          Title:   2-Dimensional  Kinematics  of  Simulated  Disc  Merger
          Remnants
          Authors:  Roland  Jesseit,  Thorsten  Naab,  Reynier  Peletier,
          Andreas Burkert
          Comments: submitted
          We present a two-dimensional kinematic analysis for a sample of
          simulated  binary disc merger remnants with mass ratios 1:1 and
          3:1.  For  the  progenitor discs we used pure stellar models as
          well  as  models  with 10% of their mass in gas. A multitude of
          phenomena  also  observed  in  real  galaxies  are found in the
          simulations. These include misaligned rotation, embedded discs,
          gas  rings,  counter-rotating  cores  and  kinematic misaligned
          discs.  Using  the 2D maps we illustrate projection effects and
          the  change  in  properties  of  a  merger  remnant when gas is
          included  in  the  merger.  We  find  that  kinematic  peculiar
          subsystems   are  preferably  formed  in  equal  mass  mergers.
          Equal-mass  collisionless remnants can show almost no rotation,
          regular   rotation   or   strong  kinematic  misalignment.  The
          inclusion  of gas makes the remnants appear more round(1:1) and
          axisymmetric(3:1).  Counter-Rotating  Cores  (CRCs)  are almost
          exclusively  formed  in equal-mass mergers with a dissipational
          component.  3:1 remnants show a much more regular structure. We
          quantify  these  properties  by applying the kinemetric methods
          recently developed by Krajnovi\'c et al. This work will help to
          understand  observations  of  elliptical galaxies with 2D field
          spectrographs, like SAURON and Sinfoni.

          This   mechanism   can   act   in   binaries   with   arbitrary
          component-mass  ratios,  and our precessional spiral wave model
          can be applied to explain observed superhumps of all types.

          Comments:  13  pages,  8  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We  present  an  analysis  of the effects of environment on the
          photometric  properties  of galaxies in the core of the Shapley
          Supercluster  at  z=0.05, one of the most massive structures in
          the  local universe. The Shapley Optical Survey (SOS) comprises
          archive  WFI  optical  imaging of a 2.0 deg^2 region containing
          the  rich  clusters  A3556, A3558 and A3562 which demonstrate a
          highly  complex  dynamical  situation including ongoing cluster
          mergers.  The  B-R/R colour-magnitude relation has an intrinsic
          dispersion  of 0.045 mag and is 0.015\pm0.005 mag redder in the
          highest-density  regions, indicative of the red sequence galaxy
          population  being  500  Myr  older  in  the  cluster cores than
          towards  the  virial  radius.  The  B-R colours of galaxies are
          dependent  on their environment, whereas their luminosities are
          independent of the local density, except for the very brightest
          galaxies   (M_R<-22).  The  global  colours  of  faint  (>M*+2)
          galaxies  change  from the cluster cores where ~90% of galaxies
          lie  along the cluster red sequence to the virial radius, where
          the  fraction  has  dropped  to  just  ~20%. This suggests that
          processes   related   to   the   supercluster  environment  are
          responsible for transforming faint galaxies, rather than galaxy
          merging,  which  should  be  infrequent  in  any of the regions
          studied here. The largest concentrations of faint blue galaxies
          are   found  between  the  clusters,  coincident  with  regions
          containing  high  fractions of ~L* galaxies with radio emission
          indicating  starbursts.  Their location suggests star-formation
          triggered by cluster mergers, in particular the merger of A3562
          and  the  poor  cluster  SC1329-313,  although  they  may  also
          represent  recent  arrivals  in  the supercluster core complex.

          Title:  Rapid Star Formation in the Presence of Active Galactic
          Nuclei
          Authors: Chris Lintott, Serena Viti (University College London)
          Comments:  4  pages,  1  figure.  Accepted by the Astrophysical
          Journal Letters
          Recent  observations  reveal  galaxies  in  the  early Universe
          (2<z<6.4)  with  large  reservoirs of molecular gas and extreme
          star  formation  rates.  For  a  very large range of sources, a
          tight  relationship  exists between star formation rate and the
          luminosity  of  the  HCN  J=1-0  spectral  line, but sources at
          redshifts  of  z~2  and  beyond  do  not follow this trend. The
          deficit  in  HCN  is  conventionally  explained by an excess of
          infrared (IR) radiation due to active galactic nuclei (AGN). We
          show  in  this  letter not only that the presence of AGN cannot
          account  for  the  excess  of IR over molecular luminosity, but
          also  that  the observed abundance of HCN is in fact consistent
          with a population of stars forming from near-primordial gas.

          This  paper  addresses  the  origin  of  the far-infrared (FIR)
          continuum  of  QSOs,  based  on  the Quasar and ULIRG Evolution
          Study (QUEST) of nearby QSOs and ULIRGs using observations with
          the  Spitzer Space Telescope. For 27 Palomar-Green QSOs at z <~
          0.3,  we derive luminosities of diagnostic lines ([NeII]12.8um,
          [NeV]14.3um,   [OIV]25.9um)  and  emission  features  (PAH7.7um
          emission  which  is  related  to  star  formation),  as well as
          continuum  luminosities  over  a  range of mid- to far-infrared
          wavelengths  between  6  and  60um.  We  detect  star-formation
          related  PAH  emission  in  11/26  QSOs and fine-structure line
          emission in all of them, often in multiple lines. The detection
          of   PAHs  in  the  average  spectrum  of  sources  which  lack
          individual  PAH  detections  provides  further evidence for the
          widespread  presence  of  PAHs  in  QSOs.  Similar  PAH/FIR and
          [NeII]/FIR  ratios are found in QSOs and in starburst-dominated
          ULIRGs  and  lower  luminosity starbursts. We conclude that the
          typical  QSO  in our sample has at least 30% but likely most of
          the  far-infrared  luminosity (~ 10^(10...12)Lsun) arising from
          star  formation,  with  a  tendency  for  larger star formation
          contribution  at  the  largest  FIR  luminosities.  In  the QSO
          sample,  we  find  correlations  between most of the quantities
          studied  including  combinations  of  AGN tracers and starburst
          tracers.  The  common scaling of AGN and starburst luminosities
          (and  fluxes)  is  evidence  for  a starburst-AGN connection in
          luminous AGN. Strong correlations of far-infrared continuum and
          starburst related quantities (PAH, low excitation [NeII]) offer
          additional  support  for  the  starburst origin of far-infrared
          emission.

          Comments: 12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          In  this  paper  we  discuss  the  evolution of gravitationally
          unstable  pre-galactic  discs  that result from the collapse of
          haloes  at  high  redshift $z \approx 10$ or so, which have not
          yet  been enriched by metals. In cases where molecular hydrogen
          formation   is   suppressed  the  discs  are  maintained  at  a
          temperature  of  a  few  thousand degrees Kelvin. However, when
          molecular hydrogen is present cooling can proceed down to a few
          hundred  degrees  Kelvin.  Analogous  to the case of the larger
          scale  proto-galactic  discs,  we  assume that the evolution of
          these discs is mainly driven by angular momentum redistribution
          induced  by  the  development of gravitational instabilities in
          the disc. We also properly take into account the possibility of
          disc  fragmentation.  We  thus  show  that  this  simple  model
          naturally predicts the formation of supermassive black holes in
          the nuclei of such discs and provides a robust determination of
          their  mass  distribution  as a function of halo properties. We
          estimate  that  roughly 5% of discs resulting from the collapse
          of  haloes with $M\approx 10^7 M_{\odot}$ should host a massive
          black  hole  with a mass $M_{\rm BH}\approx 10^5 M_{\odot}$. We
          confirm  our  arguments with time-dependent calculations of the

          Finding tracers of the innermost regions of prestellar cores is
          important   for  understanding  their  chemical  and  dynamical
          evolution  before  the  onset  of gravitational collapse. While
          classical molecular tracers, such as CO and CS, have been shown
          to  be  strongly depleted in cold, dense gas by condensation on
          grain  mantles,  it  has  been  a subject of discussion to what
          extent  nitrogen-bearing species, such as ammonia, are affected
          by  this  process.  As  deuterium fractionation is efficient in
          cold,  dense  gas,  deuterated species are excellent tracers of
          prestellar  cores.  A comparison of the spatial distribution of
          neutral  and ionized deuterated species with the dust continuum
          emission  can thus provide important insights into the physical
          and  chemical  structure  of such regions. We study the spatial
          distribution  of  the  ground-state  335.5  GHz line of ND2H in
          LDN1689N,  using  APEX, and compare it with the distribution of
          the  DCO+(3--2)  line, as well as the 350 micron dust continuum
          emission  observed  with  the SHARC~II bolometer camera at CSO.
          While  the  distribution  of  the  ND2H emission in LDN1689N is
          generally  similar  to  that  of the 350 microns dust continuum
          emission,  the  peak of the ND2H emission is offset by ~10'' to
          the  East  from the dust continuum and DCO+ emission peak. ND2H
          and  ND3  share  the  same  spatial  distribution. The observed
          offset  between  the  ND2H and DCO+ emission is consistent with
          the  hypothesis  that  the  deuterium  peak  in  LDN1689N is an
          interaction    region    between   the   outflow   shock   from
          IRAS16293--2422  and the dense ambient gas. We detect the J = 4
          -  3  line  of  H13CO+  at  346.998  GHz in the image side band
          serendipitously.  This line shows the same spatial distribution
          as  DCO+(3--2), and peaks close to the 350 mic emission maximum
          which  provides  further  support  for  the  shock  interaction
          scenario.

          We  present  the  results  of  a  deep  imaging survey of stars
          surrounded  by  planets  detected  through  the radial velocity
          technique.  The  purpose  is  to search for and to characterize
          long-period  stellar  and  substellar  companions.  The  sample
          contains  a total of 26 stars, among which 6 exhibit additional
          radial  velocity  drifts.  We  used NACO, at the ESO Very Large
          Telescope,   and  PUEO-KIR,  at  the  Candian  French  Hawaiian
          Telescope,  in  order  to conduct a near-infrared coronographic
          survey   with   adaptive  optics  of  the  faint  circumstellar
          environment  of  the  planetary  hosts. The domain investigated
          ranges  between  typically  0.1 to 15" (i.e. about 3 to 500 AU,
          according  to  the  mean distance of the sample). The survey is
          sensitive  to  companions within the stellar and the substellar
          domains,  depending on the distance to the central stars and on
          the  stars properties. The images of 14 stars do not reveal any
          companions  once  the  field  objects are removed. 8 stars have
          close  potential  companions that need to be re-observed within
          1-2  years  to  check  for  physical companionship. 4 stars are
          surrounded  by  faint  objects  which  are  confirmed  or  very
          probable  companions.  The  companion  to  HD  13445 (Gl 86) is
          already  known. The HD 196885 star is a new close visual binary
          system  with a high probability for being bound. Finally, the 2
          newly  discovered  companions,  HD 1237 B and HD 27442 B, share
          common  proper  motions  with the central stars. Orbital motion
          is,  in addition, detected for HD 1237 B. HD 1237 B is likely a
          low-mass M star, located at 70 AU (projected distance) from the
          primary.  Surprisingly,  HD  27442  B  is most probably a white
          dwarf companion located at about 240 AU (projected distance).

          Title: MEMS-based Speckle Spectrometer
          Authors: A. I. Sheinis, L. Nigra, M.Q. Kuhlen
          Comments:  11  pages, 5 figures, presented at SPIE Astronomical
          Telescopes  and  Instrumentation,  24  -  31 May 2006, Orlando,
          Florida USA
          We  describe  a  new  concept  for  a MEMS-based active spatial
          filter  for  astronomical spectroscopy. The goal of this device
          is  to allow the use of a diffraction-limited spectrometer on a
          seeing  limited  observation  at  improved  throughput  over  a
          comparable  seeing-limited spectrometer, thus reducing the size
          and  cost  of the spectrometer by a factor proportional to r0/D
          (For  the case of a 10 meter telescope this size reduction will
          be  approximately  a  factor of 25 to 50). We use a fiber-based
          integral  field  unit  (IFU)  that  incorporates an active MEMS
          mirror  array  to  feed  an  astronomical  spectrograph. A fast
          camera is used in parallel to sense speckle images at a spatial
          resolution of lambda/D and at a temporal frequency greater than
          that of atmospheric fluctuations. The MEMS mirror-array is used
          as  an  active  shutter  to  feed speckle images above a preset
          intensity threshold to the spectrometer, thereby increasing the
          signal-to-noise  ratio  (SNR)  of  the spectrogram. Preliminary
          calculations  suggests  an SNR improvement of a factor of about
          1.4. Computer simulations have shown an SNR improvement of 1.1,
          but have not yet fully explored the parameter space.

          During  the  last  two  years  we have used the Palomar Testbed
          Interferometer  to  observe  several  explosive variable stars,
          including  V838  Monocerotis,  V1663  Aquilae  and  recently RS
          Ophiuchi.  We observed V838 Monocerotis approximately 34 months
          after  its  eruption,  and  were  able  to  resolve the ejecta.
          Observations  of  V1663 Aql were obtained starting 9 days after
          peak  brightness  and  continued  for  10 days. We were able to
          resolve   the  milliarcsecond-scale  emission  and  follow  the
          expansion   of   the   nova  photosphere.  When  combined  with
          radial-velocity  information, these observations can be used to
          infer  the  distance  to the nova. Finally we have resolved the
          recurrent nova RS Oph and can draw some preliminary conclusions
          regarding the emission morphology.

          ubiquity of embedded mini cooling cores

          emulateapj5.sty,  submitted  to  ApJ. The COMPLETE version with
          tables and full-resolution figures available at this http URL
          We  present  a  systematic analysis of X-ray thermal coronae in
          157 early-type galaxies and 22 late-type galaxies from a survey
          of  25  hot  (kT>3  keV),  nearby  (z<0.05)  clusters, based on
          Chandra  archival  data.  Cool galactic coronae (kT=0.5-1.1 keV
          generally)  have  been  found  to  be very common, > 60% in NIR
          selected galaxies that are more luminous than 2L*, and > 40% in
          L*  <  L_Ks  <  2L*  galaxies.  These  embedded  coronae in hot
          clusters are generally smaller (1.5-4 kpc radii), less luminous
          (<=  10^{41}  erg  s^{-1}),  and  less massive (10^{6.5}-10^{8}
          M_solar})  than coronae in poor environments, demonstrating the
          negative  effects  of  hot  cluster  environments  on  galactic
          coronae.  Nevertheless,  these  coronae still manage to survive
          ICM  stripping,  evaporation,  rapid  cooling, and powerful AGN
          outflows,  making  them  a rich source of information about gas
          stripping,  transport,  and  feedback  processes in the cluster
          environment. Heat conduction across the coronal boundary has to
          be  suppressed  by  at least a factor of 100, which implies the
          X-ray  gas  in early-type galaxies is magnetized. The luminous,
          embedded   coronae,  with  high  central  density  (0.1  -  0.4
          cm^{-3}), are mini-versions of group and cluster cooling cores.
          As the prevalence of coronae of massive galaxies implies a long
          lifetime  (>  several  Gyr), there must be a heat source inside
          coronae  to  offset  cooling.  While  we argue that AGN heating
          cannot  generally  be  the  heat  source,  we  conclude that SN
          heating  can be enough as long as the kinetic energy of SNe can
          be  efficiently  dissipated. We have also observed a connection
          between  radiative  cooling and the SMBH activity of their host
          galaxies  as  many  coronae  are associated with powerful radio
          galaxies. (abridged)

          Title:   Inelastic  Neutrino-Helium  Scatterings  and  Standing
          Accretion Shock Instability in Core-Collapse Supernovae
          Authors: Naofumi Ohnishi, Kei Kotake, Shoichi Yamada
          Comments: 19 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  present  the  results of numerical experiments, in which we
          have    investigated    the    influence   of   the   inelastic
          neutrino-helium  interactions  on  the standing accretion shock
          instability  supposed  to  occur  in  the post-bounce supernova
          core.  The axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations of accretion
          flows  through  the  standing  accretion  shock  wave  onto the
          protoneutron  star  show  that  the interactions are relatively
          minor  and the linear growth of the shock instability is hardly
          affected.  The  extra  heating given by the inelastic reactions
          becomes  important  for the shock revival after the instability
          enters  the  non-linear  regime,  but  only  when  the neutrino
          luminosity  is  very  close to the critical value, at which the
          shock  would  be revived without the interactions. We have also
          studied the dependence of the results on the initial amplitudes
          of perturbation and the temperatures of mu and tau neutrinos.

          We  observed  the CO(3-2) emission of the emission-line regions
          HubbleI,   HubbleV,  HubbleX,  Holmberg  18,  and  the  stellar
          emission-line  object  S28  in  NGC6822  with  the  ESO Atacama
          Pathfinder  Experiment  (APEX)  12m  telescope  as  part of its
          science  verification.  The  very  low  system  temperature  of
          130-180K enabled us to achieve detections in 4 single pointings
          and  in  a high spatial resolution 70''x70'' map of HubbleV. We
          compare  the  spectra  with  HI observations, obtained with the
          Australia  Telescope  Compact  Array,  of  the same regions. In
          combination   with  previous  multi-line  CO  observations,  we
          perform  a preliminary investigation of the physical conditions
          in  HubbleV  using  a simple LTE model. We estimate the mass of
          the  HubbleV  region  and  the H_2/I_CO(3-2) conversion factor.
          Also,  we show that HubbleV is located very near the line-width
          versus  size relation traced by the Milky Way and LMC molecular
          clouds.

          X-ray-Underluminous Abell Clusters
          Authors: P. Popesso, A. Biviano, H. Bhringer, M. Romaniello
          Comments: 19 pages, 11 figures, A&A in press
          In  this paper we consider a large sample of optically selected
          clusters,  in  order  to elucidate the physical reasons for the
          existence  of X-ray underluminous clusters. For this purpose we
          analyze the correlations of the X-ray and optical properties of
          a  sample  of 137 spectroscopically confirmed Abell clusters in
          the  SDSS database. We search for the X-ray counterpart of each
          cluster  in  the  ROSAT All Sky Survey. We find that 40% of our
          clusters  have  a marginal X-ray detection or remain undetected
          in X-rays. These clusters appear too X-ray faint on average for
          their  velocity  dispersion  determined  mass, i.e. they do not
          follow the scaling relation between X-ray luminosity and virial
          mass  traced  by the other clusters. On the other hand, they do
          follow  the general scaling relation between optical luminosity
          and   virial   mass.   We   refer  to  these  clusters  as  the
          X-ray-Underluminous  Abell  clusters  (AXU clusters, for short)
          and  designate as 'normal' the X-ray detected Abell systems. We
          examine   the   distributions  and  properties  of  the  galaxy
          populations of the normal and the AXU clusters, separately. The
          AXU  clusters  are characterized by leptokurtic (more centrally
          concentrated  than  a  Gaussian) velocity distribution of their
          member  galaxies in the outskirts ($1.5 < r/r_{200} \leq 3.5$),
          as  expected for the systems in accretion. In addition, the AXU
          clusters  have  a  higher  fraction  of  blue  galaxies  in the
          external  region  and  show a marginally significant paucity of
          galaxies  at  the  center.  Our  results  seem  to  support the
          interpretation  that  the AXU clusters are systems in formation
          undergoing   a   phase  of  mass  accretion.  Their  low  X-ray
          luminosity  should  be  due to the still accreting Intracluster
          gas or to an ongoing merging process.

          Title: Toward Understanding the Spectral Energy Distribution of
          Microquasars
          Authors: Yongquan Xue, Xue-Bing Wu, Wei Cui
          Comments:  24  pages,  8  figures,  submitted  to ApJ; comments
          welcome
          (Abridged)  We  report  results  from a systematic study of the
          spectral  energy  distribution  (SED) of XTE J1550--564 and its
          evolution  during  outbursts.  The  main objectives include: 1)
          assessing   the   roles   of   jets  and  accretion  flows;  2)
          re-examining  spectral  states, state transitions, and spectral
          hysteresis;  and 3) disentangling variabilities associated with
          the  jets  and  accretion  flows  and  quantifying the coupling
          between  the  two.  XTE  J1550--564 is the first microquasar to
          have  its  jets  directly imaged at X-ray energies. We began by
          applying  a  synchrotron  model  to  the  broadband  SED of the
          western  ``blob''  (in  the  jets)  that  was  seen in 2002, to
          constrain   the   spectral  energy  distribution  of  radiating
          electrons   in   the   ``blob''.  Assuming  that  the  electron
          distribution is the same for all ``blobs'' in the jets, we then
          applied  the  model to the overall radio spectrum of the source
          and  extrapolated the best fits to higher frequencies. In spite
          of  significant degeneracy in the fits, it seems clear that the
          synchrotron  radiation  from  the jet contributes little to the
          observed  X-ray emission, when the source is relatively bright.
          Assuming  that  the  X-ray  emission originated mostly from the
          accretion  flows,  we  took  an empirical approach to model the
          X-ray spectrum and study its evolution. From the compilation of
          the SEDs, we found it straightforward to define spectral states
          based  on  the  shape of SEDs and visualize transitions between
          various  states  thus  defined.  There is evidence for spectral
          hysteresis  associated  with  the  rise  and  fall  of the 2000
          outburst.  We can also see that a specific state transition may
          occur at different fluxes. We also examined correlation between
          the  X-ray  and  radio  fluxes  of  the  source.  While a rough
          correlation  seems to be present, it is a fairly loose one. The

          Title:  Three-Dimensional  Simulations  of  Spherical Accretion
          Flows with Small-Scale Magnetic Fields
          Authors: Igor V. Igumenshchev
          Comments: 31 pages, 7 figures attached in jpg-format; to appear
          in ApJ
          Spherical   (nonrotating)   accretion  flows  with  small-scale
          magnetic fields have been investigated using three-dimensional,
          time-dependent  MHD  simulations.  These  simulations have been
          designed  to  model  high-resolution  (quasi)  steady accretion
          flows  in  a wedge computational domain that represents a small
          fraction  of the full spherical domain. Subsonic and supersonic
          (super-fast-magnetosonic) accretion flows have been considered.
          Two  accretion  regimes  have  been  studied:  conservative, or
          radiatively inefficient, and nonconservative, in which the heat
          released  in  magnetic  reconnections  is  completely lost. The
          flows  in  both  regimes are turbulent. They show the flattened
          radial   density   profiles  and  reduction  of  the  accretion
          velocities   and   mass  accretion  rates  in  comparison  with
          hydrodynamic  Bondi  flows.  In  the  conservative  regime, the
          turbulence  is  more  intensive and supported mostly by thermal
          convection.  In  the  nonconservative regime, the turbulence is
          less  intensive  and supported by magnetic buoyancy and various
          magnetic   interactions.   We   have   concluded  that  steady,
          supersonic  spherical  accretion  cannot  be  developed  in the
          presence of small-scale magnetic fields.

          Title:   Nuclear   activity   in   galaxies  driven  by  binary
          supermassive black holes
          Authors:    Andrei   P.   Lobanov   (Max-Planck-Institute   for
          Radioastronomy, Bonn, Germany)

          Heidelberg 2006)
          Nuclear  activity  in galaxies is closely connected to galactic
          mergers  and  supermassive  black holes (SBH). Galactic mergers
          perturb   substantially   the   dynamics  of  gas  and  stellar
          population  in  the  merging galaxies, and they are expected to
          lead  to  formation of supermassive binary black holes (BBH) in
          the center of mass of the galaxies merged. A scheme is proposed
          here  that  connects the peak magnitude of the nuclear activity
          with  evolution  of a BBH system. The scheme predicts correctly
          the  relative  fractions  of different types of active galactic
          nuclei  (AGN)  and explains the connection between the galactic
          type  and  the  strength of the nuclear activity. It shows that
          most  powerful  AGN  should result from mergers with small mass
          ratios,  while  weaker activity is produced in unequal mergers.
          The scheme explains also the observed lack of galaxies with two
          active  nuclei,  which is attributed to effective disruption of
          accretion disks around the secondary in BBH systems with masses
          of the primary smaller than ~10^10 solar masses.

          Title: On the metallicity dependence of HMXBs
          Authors: L. M. Dray
          Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures, MNRAS accepted
          It  is  commonly  assumed  that  high  mass X-ray binary (HMXB)
          populations  are  little-affected  by metallicity. However, the
          massive  stars  making  up  their  progenitor systems depend on
          metallicity in a number of ways, not least through their winds.
          We  present simulations, well-matched to the observed sample of
          Galactic  HMXBs, which demonstrate that both the number and the
          mean period of HMXB progenitors can vary with metallicity, with
          the  number increasing by about a factor of three between solar
          and  SMC metallicity. However, the SMC population itself cannot
          be  explained  simply  by metallicity effects; it requires both
          that  the HMXBs observed therein primarily sample the older end
          of the HMXB population, and that the star formation rate at the
          time of their formation was very large.

          Comments: Accepted to ApJ Letters
          We  present  the  first  observations  of  magnetic cataclysmic
          variables  with  the  Spitzer  Space  Telescope.  We  used  the
          Infrared  Array  Camera  to  obtain photometry of the polars EF
          Eri,  GG  Leo,  V347 Pav, and RX J0154.0-5947 at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8,
          and  8.0  $\mu$m.  In  all  of  our  targets,  we detect excess
          mid-infrared  emission  over  that  expected from the component
          stars  alone.  We  explore  the  origin  of  this  IR excess by
          examining   bremsstrahlung,  cyclotron  emission,  circumbinary
          dust,  and  L/T brown dwarf secondary stars. Bremsstrahlung and
          cyclotron   emission   appear   unlikely   to   be  significant
          contributors  to  the  observed  fluxes.  At  present, the most
          likely  candidate  for  the  excess  emission  is  dust that is
          probably   located   in  a  circumbinary  disk  with  an  inner
          temperature  near  800  K. However, a simple dust disk plus any
          reasonable  low  mass  or  brown  dwarf-like  secondary star is
          unable to fully explain the observed flux densities in the 3--8
          $\mu$m region.

          Title:  Properties of galaxies in SDSS Quasar environments at z
          < 0.2
          Authors: Georgina V. Coldwell, Diego G. Lambas
          Comments: 7 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  analyse  the  environment  of  low  redshift, z < 0.2, SDSS
          quasars  using  the  spectral  and  photometric  information of
          galaxies  from  the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Third Data Release
          (SDSS-DR3).  We  compare  quasar  neighbourhoods with field and
          high  density  environments  through  an analysis on samples of
          typical galaxies and groups.
          We  compute  the surrounding surface number density of galaxies
          finding  that  quasar  environments  systematically  avoid high
          density  regions.  Their mean environments correspond to galaxy
          density enhancements similar to those of typical galaxies.
          We  have  also  explored  several  galaxy  properties  in these
          environments,  such  as spectral types, specific star formation
          rates,   concentration   indexes,  colours  and  active  nuclei
          activity.  We  conclude that low redshift quasar neighbourhoods
          (r_p  <  1 Mpc h^-1, Delta V < 500 km/s) are populated by bluer
          and  more intense star forming galaxies of disk-type morphology
          than  galaxies  in  groups  and  in  the  field.  Although star
          formation  activity is thought to be significantly triggered by
          interactions,  we  find that quasar fueling may not require the
          presence of a close companion galaxy (r_p < 100 kpc h^-1, Delta
          V< 350 km/s).
          As a test of the unified AGN model, we have performed a similar
          analysis  to the neighbours of a sample of active galaxies. The
          results  indicate  that  these neighbourhoods are comparable to
          those  of  quasars  giving  further  support  to  this  unified
          scenario.

          Title: Quasars: What turns them off?
          Authors: Robert J. Thacker, Evan Scannapieco, H. M. P. Couchman
          Comments:  16  pages,  11  figures,  submitted to ApJ, comments
          welcomed
          (Abridged)  We  explore  the  idea  that  the anti-hierarchical
          turn-off   observed   in  the  quasar  population  arises  from
          self-regulating  feedback,  via  an  outflow mechanism. Using a
          detailed  hydrodynamic  simulation  we calculate the luminosity
          function  of  quasars  down  to  a  redshift of z=1 in a large,
          cosmologically  representative  volume.  Outflows  are included
          explicitly by tracking halo mergers and driving shocks into the
          surrounding  intergalactic medium. Our results are in excellent
          agreement  with  measurements  of  the  spatial distribution of
          quasars,  and  we  detect an intriguing excess of galaxy-quasar
          pairs   at  very  short  separations.  We  also  reproduce  the
          anti-hierarchical  turnoff  in  the quasar luminosity function,
          however,  the  magnitude  of  the  turn-off falls short of that
          observed  as  well as that predicted by analogous semi-analytic
          models.  The  difference  can be traced to the treatment of gas
          heating  within  galaxies.  The  simulated galaxy cluster L_X-T
          relationship  is  close  to that observed for z~1 clusters, but
          the  simulated galaxy groups at z=1 are significantly perturbed
          by  quasar  outflows,  suggesting  that  measurements  of X-ray
          emission  in high-redshift groups could well be a "smoking gun"
          for the AGN heating hypothesis.

          Aims: The hard and soft spectral states of black hole accretion
          are  understood  as  connected  with  ADAF accretion (truncated
          disk)  and  standard  disk  accretion,  respectively.  However,
          observations  indicate  the  existence of cool gas in the inner
          region  at times when the disk is already truncated outside. We
          try  to  shed  light  on  these not yet understood intermediate
          states. Methods: The disk-corona model allows to understand the
          spectral  state  transitions  as  caused by changes of the mass
          flow  rate in the disk and provides a picture for the accretion
          geometry  when  disk  truncation  starts  at  the  time  of the
          soft/hard transition, the formation of a gap in the disk filled
          by an advection-dominated flow (ADAF) at the distance where the
          evaporation  is  maximal.  We  study the interaction of such an
          ADAF with an inner thin disk below. Results: We show that, when
          the  accretion  rate  is  not far below the transition rate, an
          inner   disk   could   exist  below  an  ADAF,  leading  to  an
          intermediate state of black hole accretion.

          Nova  outbursts  take place in binary star systems comprising a
          white  dwarf  and either a low-mass Sun-like star or, as in the
          case  of  the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi, a red giant. Although
          the  cause  of  these  outbursts  is  known to be thermonuclear
          explosion  of  matter  transferred  from the companion onto the
          surface  of  the  white  dwarf,  models  of the previous (1985)
          outburst  of  RS  Ophiuchi  failed  to adequately fit the X-ray
          evolution   and  there  was  controversy  over  a  single-epoch
          high-resolution  radio  image, which suggested that the remnant
          was  bipolar  rather than spherical as modelled. Here we report
          the  detection  of  spatially resolved structure in RS Ophiuchi
          from two weeks after its 12 February 2006 outburst. We track an
          expanding  shock  wave as it sweeps through the red giant wind,
          producing  a remnant similar to that of a type II supernova but
          evolving  over  months  rather  than millennia. As in supernova
          remnants,   the  radio  emission  is  non-thermal  (synchrotron
          emission),  but  asymmetries  and  multiple emission components
          clearly   demonstrate  that  contrary  to  the  assumptions  of
          spherical  symmetry  in  models  of  the  1985  explosion,  the
          ejection  is  jet-like,  collimated by the central binary whose
          orientation   on   the   sky   can  be  determined  from  these
          observations.

          We  present  high  sensitivity 12/13CO(1-0) molecular line maps
          covering  the  full  extent of the parsec scale L1551 molecular
          outflow,  including the redshifted east-west (EW) flow. We also
          present 12CO(3-2) data that extends over a good fraction of the
          area  mapped  in  the  1-0 transition. We compare the molecular
          data  to  widefield, narrow-band optical emission in H$\alpha$.
          While  there are multiple outflows in the L1551 cloud, the main
          outflow  is oriented at 50\arcdeg position angle and appears to
          be  driven  by  embedded source(s) in the central IRS 5 region.
          The  3-2  data  indicate  that  there may be molecular emission
          associated with the L1551 NE jet, within the redshifted lobe of
          main  outflow. We have also better defined the previously known
          EW   flow  and  believe  we  have  identified  its  blueshifted
          counterpart.  We  further  speculate  that the origin of the EW
          outflow  lies  near  HH  102. We use velocity dependent opacity
          correction  to estimate the mass and the energy of the outflow.
          The  resulting  mass  spectral  indices  from our analysis, are
          systematically  lower  (less  steep) than the power law indices
          obtained  towards other outflows in several recent studies that
          use   a   similar  opacity  correction  method.  We  show  that
          systematic  errors  and  biases  in the analysis procedures for
          deriving   mass   spectra   could   result  in  errors  in  the
          determination  of  the  power-law  indices.  The  mass spectral
          indices,  the morphological appearance of the position-velocity
          plots  and  integrated intensity emission maps of the molecular
          data,  compared  with  the  optical,  suggest  that  jet-driven
          bow-shock  entrainment  is the best explanation for the driving
          mechanism  of  outflows  in  L1551.  The  kinetic energy of the
          outflows is found to be comparable to the binding energy of the
          cloud  and  sufficient  to maintain the turbulence in the L1551
          cloud.

          We  present  far-ultraviolet  (FUV)  imaging of the Hubble Deep
          Field  North  (HDF-N) taken with the Solar Blind Channel of the
          Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS/SBC) and the FUV MAMA detector
          of  the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) onboard the
          Hubble  Space  Telescope.  The  full  WFPC2 deep field has been
          observed at 1600 Angstroms. We detect 134 galaxies and one star
          down to a limit of FUV_{AB} ~ 29. All sources have counterparts
          in  the  WFPC2  image. Redshifts (spectroscopic or photometric)
          for  the  detected sources are in the range 0<z<1. We find that
          the  FUV galaxy number counts are higher than those reported by
          GALEX,  which  we attribute at least in part to cosmic variance
          in the small HDF-N field of view. Six of the 13 Chandra sources
          at  z<0.85  in the HDF-N are detected in the FUV, and those are
          consistent  with  starbursts rather than AGN. Cross-correlating
          with  Spitzer  sources  in  the  field,  we  find  that the FUV
          detections  show  general agreement with the expected L_IR/L_UV
          vs.  Beta  relationship.  We infer star formation rates (SFRs),
          corrected  for extinction using the UV slope, and find a median
          value  of  0.3  Msun/yr  for FUV-detected galaxies, with 75% of
          detected    sources   have   SFR<1   Msun/yr.   Examining   the
          morphological  distribution of sources, we find that about half
          of  all  FUV-detected  sources are identied as spiral galaxies.
          Half   of  morphologically-selected  spheroids  at  z<0.85  are
          detected   in  the  FUV,  suggesting  that  such  sources  have
          significant ongoing star-formation in the epoch since z=1.

          photometric  observations  of  the  faint  UV-excess  object PG
          2200+085.  The  optical  CCD  photometry  observations  of this
          object   were   performed   by  the  Russian-Turkish  1.5-meter
          telescope  RTT150 at the TUBITAK National Observatory (Turkey).
          The  long-slit  optical  spectroscopy  observations  with 2.6 A
          resolution  were  carried  out  by 6-meter telescope BTA at the
          Special  Astrophysical  Observatory  (Russia).  The photometric
          variations  over  two  nights  are  almost  sinusoidal  with an
          amplitude  \Delta  m_V  =  0.04 m and a period of P = 0.3186 d.
          Such  a  light curve is typical of a detached close binary with
          an  illumination  effect  or  the  ellipsoidal deformation of a
          secondary  star.  The  observed  spectrum  clearly  displays  a
          featureless  blue  continuum  of  a  hot  component  and a rich
          absorption--line  and molecular band K--star spectrum. The CaII
          line profiles with strong emission cores are remarkably similar
          to  those of V471 Tau. We tentatively classify PG 2200+085 as a
          pre-cataclysmic binary of the V471 Tau type.

          A  commonly  used  measure  to summarize the nature of a photon
          spectrum  is  the  so-called Hardness Ratio, which compares the
          number  of counts observed in different passbands. The hardness
          ratio   is   especially   useful  to  distinguish  between  and
          categorize  weak  sources  as  a  proxy  for  detailed spectral
          fitting.  However,  in  this  regime classical methods of error
          propagation fail, and the estimates of spectral hardness become
          unreliable. Here we develop a rigorous statistical treatment of
          hardness  ratios  that  properly deals with detected photons as
          independent  Poisson  random variables and correctly deals with
          the non-Gaussian nature of the error propagation. The method is
          Bayesian  in nature, and thus can be generalized to carry out a
          multitude  of  source-population--based analyses. We verify our
          method  with  simulation  studies,  and  compare  it  with  the
          classical  method. We apply this method to real world examples,
          such  as  the  identification  of  candidate quiescent Low-mass
          X-ray  binaries  in  globular  clusters,  and tracking the time
          evolution of a flare on a low-mass star.

          Title: A hot transient jet from eta Carinae
          Authors: Ehud Behar, Raanan Nordon, Eyal Ben-Bassat, Noam Soker
          (Technion)
          Eta  Carinae (eta Car) is a stellar binary system with a period
          of 5.54 years. It harbors one of the brightest and most massive
          stars in our galaxy. This paper presents spectroscopic evidence
          for a fast (up to 2,000 km/s) X-ray jet of ionized gas launched
          from  eta  Car  just  before  what is believed to be the binary
          periastron  (point  of  smallest binary separation). By analogy
          with  jets  in  other  astrophysical systems, it is possible to
          attribute the jet to the onset of a phase of accretion.

          after incorporating referee comments
          We  report  our  analysis of a Chandra X-ray observation of the
          rich  globular  cluster Terzan 5, in which we detect 50 sources
          to  a  limiting  1.0-6 keV X-ray luminosity of 3*10^{31} ergs/s
          within  the  half-mass  radius  of the cluster. Thirty-three of
          these  have  L_X>10^{32} ergs/s, the largest number yet seen in
          any  globular  cluster.  In  addition to the quiescent low-mass
          X-ray  binary (LMXB, identified by Wijnands et al.), another 12
          relatively  soft sources may be quiescent LMXBs. We compare the
          X-ray  colors of the harder sources in Terzan 5 to the Galactic
          Center  sources studied by Muno and collaborators, and find the
          Galactic Center sources to have harder X-ray colors, indicating
          a  possible  difference  in  the populations. We cannot clearly
          identify   a   metallicity  dependence  in  the  production  of
          low-luminosity  X-ray  binaries  in Galactic globular clusters,
          but a metallicity dependence of the form suggested by Jordan et
          al. for extragalactic LMXBs is consistent with our data.

          The  recent  detection  of  the anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXP) 4U
          0142+61 in the far infrared with the Spitzer Observatory (Wang,
          Chakrabarty & Kaplan 2006) constitutes the first instance for a
          disk  around  an  AXP.  Analysis  of  earlier  optical and near
          infrared data, together with the recent data, implies an active
          gaseous  disk  protruding the light cylinder, and not a passive
          dust  disk  beyond the light cylinder, as proposed on the basis
          of the far infrared data alone.

          (Abridged)   We  present  deep  WSRT  observations  of  neutral
          hydrogen  in  12 nearby elliptical and lenticular galaxies. The
          selected  objects  come  from a representative sample of nearby
          galaxies  earlier  studied  at  optical  wavelengths  with  the
          integral-field  spectrograph  Sauron.  We  detect  HI - both in
          regular  discs  as well as in clouds and tails off-set from the
          host  galaxy  -  in 70% of the galaxies. This detection rate is
          much  higher  than  in previous, shallower single-dish surveys,
          and is similar to that for the ionised gas. The results suggest
          that  at  faint  detection  levels  the  presence  of  HI  is a
          relatively  common characteristic of field early-type galaxies.
          The  observed  total  HI  masses range between a few times 10^6
          Msun  to just over 10^9 Msun. The presence of regular disc-like
          structures  is a situation as common as HI in offset clouds and
          tails  around  early-type  galaxies.  All  galaxies where HI is
          detected  also  contain  ionised  gas,  whereas  no HI is found
          around  galaxies  without ionised gas. Galaxies with regular HI
          discs  tend  to have strong emission from ionised gas. In these
          cases,  the  similar  kinematics  of  the  neutral hydrogen and
          ionised  gas  suggest  that  they form one structure. We do not
          find  a  clear  trend between the presence of HI and the global
          age   of   the  stellar  population  or  the  global  dynamical
          characteristics  of  the galaxies. Our observations support the
          idea   that  gas  accretion  is  common  and  does  not  happen
          exclusively  in  peculiar early-type galaxies. For the majority
          of  the  cases  the gas is likely acquired through merging, but
          the  lack  of  correlation  with  the  stellar  population  age
          suggests  that  smooth,  cold accretion could be an alternative
          scenario,  at least in some galaxies. In either cases, the data
          suggest  that  early-type galaxies continue to build their mass
          up to the present.

          Title:   On   the  X-ray  spectra  of  luminous,  inhomogeneous
          accretion flows
          Authors: A. Merloni (MPA), J. Malzac (CESR), A.C. Fabian (IoA),
          R.R. Ross (College of the Holy Cross)
          Comments: 15 pages, 9 figures. MNRAS, in press
          We   discuss   the  expected  X-ray  spectral  and  variability
          properties  of  black  hole accretion discs at high luminosity,
          under  the  hypothesis  that radiation pressure dominated discs
          are subject to violent clumping instabilities and, as a result,
          have a highly inhomogeneous two-phase structure. After deriving
          the  full  accretion  disc solutions explicitly in terms of the
          parameters  of  the  model, we study their radiative properties
          both with a simple two-zones model, treatable analytically, and
          with    radiative    transfer    simulations    which   account
          simultaneously for energy balance and Comptonisation in the hot
          phase,  together  with reflection, reprocessing, ionization and
          thermal  balance  in  the cold phase. We show that, if not only
          the  density,  but  also the heating rate within these flows is
          inhomogeneous, then complex reflection-dominated spectra can be
          obtained for a high enough covering fraction of the cold phase.
          In  general,  large reflection components in the observed X-ray
          spectra   should  be  associated  with  strong  soft  excesses,
          resulting from the combined emission of ionized atomic emission
          lines.  The  variability  properties  of  such systems are such
          that,  even  when  contributing to a large fraction of the hard
          X-ray  spectrum, the reflection component is less variable than
          the   power-law   like   emission   originating  from  the  hot
          Comptonising  phase, in agreement with what is observed in many
          Narrow  Line Seyfert 1 galaxies and bright Seyfert 1. Our model
          falls  within the family of those trying to explain the complex
          X-ray  spectra  of  bright  AGN  with  ionized  reflection, but
          presents   an   alternative,  specific,  physically  motivated,
          geometrical  setup for the complex multi-phase structure of the
          inner regions of near-Eddington accretion flows.

          Astrophysics"
          (Abridged)  Some  240  blue stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud
          are   investigated   on  their  fantastic  irregular  continuum
          variability.  We report here two results regarding these stars.
          First, their optical flux excess is correlated to their near-IR
          flux excess, as determined from optical EROSII light curves and
          2MASS measurements. Second, the relation between optical colour
          and  magnitude is observed to be bi-valued in 40% of the cases,
          resulting  in  a  "loop" when the light curve is presented in a
          colour-magnitude diagram. We argue that optical variability for
          a  large fraction of the variable stars is due to variations in
          the  amount of bound-free and free-free radiation. We do simple
          model  calculations  that  allow  us  to interpret the observed
          colour-magnitude  variability  as  due to an outflowing ionized
          circumstellar  disk.  The  mass  loss  of  the  central star is
          variable,  i.e. on or off. Once the star stops losing mass, the
          disk  evolves  naturally  into  a  ring. The observed bi-valued
          colour-magnitude  relation  is  the  transition  of a partially
          optically  thick to a fully optically thin disk. Significantly,
          the  loop  is  traversed  clockwise  by  outflowing matter, but
          anti-clockwise  by  infalling  matter.  It is observed that the
          material  is  generally outflowing, but few cases of inflow are
          also observed.

          Aims:   The  galactic  superluminal  microquasar  GRO  J1655-40
          started  a  new outburst in February 2005, after seven years in
          quiescence,  rising to a high/soft state in March 2005. In this
          paper  we study the X-ray spectra during this rise. Methods: We
          observed  GRO J1655-40 with XMM-Newton, on 27 February 2005, in
          the  low/hard  state,  and  on  three consecutive days in March
          2005, during the rise of the source to its high/soft state. The
          EPIC-pn  camera  was  used in the fast-read Burst mode to avoid
          photon   pile-up.   Results:   First,  we  contributed  to  the
          improvement  of  the calibration of the EPIC-pn, since the high
          flux  received from the source required some refinements in the
          correction  of  the  Charge  Transfer Efficiency of the camera.
          Second,  we  find  that  the  X-ray spectrum of GRO J1655-40 is
          dominated  in  the high/soft state by the thermal emission from
          the  accretion  disk,  with  an  inner radius of 13-14 km and a
          maximum  temperature  of  1.3  keV.  Fe  XXV K-alpha and K-beta
          absorption  lines  are  detected  in  the  EPIC-pn  spectra, at
          6.7-6.8  and  7.8-8.0  keV.  With  the RGS spectrometers, clear
          absorption  features  are  found for the first time at 17.2 and
          17.4 AA, which may be identified as blueshifted OVII lines from
          a  highly ionized absorbing wind. We find no orbital dependence
          on  the  X-ray  spectra,  which provides an upper limit for the
          inclination  of  the  system  of  73  degr. The interstellar OI
          K-alpha  line  is  also  detected.  Finally, while checking the
          interstellar   origin  of  the  OI  line,  we  find  a  general
          correlation  of  the  OI  K-alpha  line width with the hydrogen
          column   density   using   several  sources  available  in  the
          literature.

          Title: On the weakness of disc models in bright ULXs
          Authors:   Anabela   C.   Goncalves   (Obs.  Astron.  Lisboa  &
          Paris-Meudon), Roberto Soria (CfA & MSSL)
          Comments: 12 pages, accepted by MNRAS
          It  is sometimes suggested that phenomenological power-law plus
          cool  disc-blackbody models represent the simplest, most robust
          interpretation  of  the  X-ray  spectra of bright ultraluminous
          X-ray  sources  (ULXs); this has been taken as evidence for the
          presence of intermediate-mass black holes (BHs) (M ~ 10^3 Msun)
          in  those  sources. Here, we assess this claim by comparing the
          cool  disc-blackbody  model  with  a range of other models. For
          example,  we  show  that  the  same  ULX  spectra can be fitted
          equally  well  by subtracting a disc-blackbody component from a
          dominant power-law component, thus turning a soft excess into a
          soft  deficit.  Then, we propose a more complex physical model,
          based  on  a  power-law  component slightly modified at various
          energies   by   smeared  emission  and  absorption  lines  from
          highly-ionized,  fast-moving  gas.  We  use the XMM-Newton/EPIC
          spectra  of  two  ULXs in Holmberg II and NGC 4559 as examples.
          Our  main conclusion is that the presence of a soft excess or a
          soft  deficit  depends on the energy range over which we choose
          to fit the ``true'' power-law continuum; those small deviations
          from the power-law spectrum are well modelled by disc-blackbody
          components  (either  in  emission or absorption) simply because
          they  are  a  versatile  fitting tool for most kinds of smooth,
          broad  bumps.  Hence, we argue that those components should not
          be  taken  as evidence for accretion disc emission, nor used to
          infer  BH  masses. Finally, we speculate that bright ULXs could
          be  in  a  spectral  state  similar to (or an extension of) the
          steep-power-law  state  of Galactic BH candidates, in which the
          disc is now completely comptonized and not directly detectable,
          and  the power-law emission may be modified by the surrounding,
          fast-moving, ionized gas.

          Cataclysmic Variables - flickering and wind

          Astrophysics  and  Space  Science  "Close  Binaries in the 21th
          Century,   New   Opportunities   and   Challenges"   conference
          proceeding
          Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) are close binary systems where mass
          is  transferred from a red dwarf star to a white dwarf star via
          an  accretion  disk.  The  flickering is observed as stochastic
          variations  in  the emitted radiation both in the continuum and
          in the emission line profiles. The main goal of our simulations
          is to compare synthetic Doppler maps with observed ones, aiming
          to  constrain  the flickering properties and wind parameters. A
          code  was  developed  which  generates  synthetic emission line
          profiles  of a geometrically thin and optically thick accretion
          disk.   The  simulation  allows  us  to  include  flares  in  a
          particular  disk  region.  The  emission  line  flares  may  be
          integrated  over  arbitrary  ``exposure''  times, producing the
          synthetic  line  profiles.  Flickering Doppler maps are created
          using such synthetic time series. The presence of a wind inside
          the Roche lobe was also implemented. Radiative transfer effects
          in the lines where taken into account in order to reproduce the
          single peaked line profiles frequently seen in nova-like CVs.

          Title: On the First Generation of Stars
          Authors: Joseph Silk, Mathieu Langer
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS
          We argue that the first stars may have spanned the conventional
          mass  range  rather  than  be  identified with the Very Massive
          Objects   (100-1000   solar   masses)   favoured  by  numerical
          simulations.   Specifically,   we   find  that  magnetic  field
          generation  processes  acting in the first protostellar systems
          suffice  to  produce  fields  that exceed the threshold for MRI
          instability  to  operate  and  thereby  allow the MRI dynamo to
          generate    equipartition-amplitude    magnetic    fields    on
          protostellar  mass  scales  below  50 solar masses. Such fields
          allow  primordial  star  formation  to occur at essentially any
          metallicity    by   regulating   angular   momentum   transfer,
          fragmentation,  accretion  and feedback in much the same way as
          occurs in conventional molecular clouds.

          Title:   Slow   Star  Formation  in  Dense  Gas:  Evidence  and
          Implications
          Authors:  Mark  R.  Krumholz  (1),  Jonathan  C.  Tan  (2) ((1)
          Princeton University, (2) University of Florida)
          Comments:  Submitted  to  ApJ.  9  pages, 5 figures, emulateapj
          format
          It has been known for more than 30 years that star formation in
          giant  molecular  clouds  is  slow,  with  only  ~1% of the gas
          forming  stars  every  free-fall time. Here we present evidence
          that  it is equally slow in the much denser gas from which star
          clusters  form.  This  has important implications for models of
          star   formation,   since   competing   models  make  differing
          predictions  for  the  characteristic  density  at  which  star
          formation  should transition from slow, with only a few percent
          of  the  mass  forming stars per free-fall time, to rapid, with
          order  unity  of the mass going into stars in a free-fall time.
          We  find  that  the  data are strongly inconsistent with models
          that  explain  low star formation rates by appealing to unbound
          molecular  clouds  or  regulation  of  star formation solely by
          galactic-scale    gravitational    instability,   and   broadly
          consistent  with  models  of star formation regulated by either
          turbulence  or  magnetic  fields  in  virialized  objects.  The
          turbulence-regulated  star  formation model of Krumholz & McKee
          quantitatively    reproduces    the   infrared-HCN   luminosity
          correlation  recently  reported  by  Gao  &  Solomon. Slow star
          formation  also  implies  that  the  process  of  star  cluster
          formation  cannot  be  one of global collapse, but must instead
          proceed   over   many   free-fall  times.  This  suggests  that
          turbulence  in  star-forming  clumps  does  not decay away in a
          single  crossing  time,  and  that  the  competitive  accretion
          mechanism does not operate in typical cluster-forming molecular
          clumps.

          We  present  the  first direct, i.e. not involving intermediate
          steps, distance determination to a detached eclipsing binary in
          M33,  which  was found by the DIRECT Project. Located in the OB
          66 association at coordinates (alpha,
          delta)=(01:33:46.17,+30:44:39.9) for J2000.0, it was one of the
          most  suitable  detached eclipsing binaries found by DIRECT for
          distance   determination,  given  its  apparent  magnitude  and
          orbital   period.   We   obtained   follow-up  BV  time  series
          photometry, JHKs photometry and optical spectroscopy from which
          we  determined the parameters of the system. It contains two O7
          main sequence stars with masses of 33.4+/-3.5 Mo and 30.0+/-3.3
          Mo  and  radii of 12.3+/-0.4 Ro and 8.8+/-0.3 Ro, respectively.
          We  derive  temperatures  of 37000+/-1500 K and 35600+/-1500 K.
          Using  BVRJHKs photometry for the flux calibration, we obtain a
          distance  modulus  of 24.92+/-0.12 mag (964+/-54 kpc), which is
          ~0.3  mag  longer  than  the  Key  Project  distance to M33. We
          discuss  the  implications  of our result and the importance of
          establishing  M33  as  an  independent rung on the cosmological
          distance ladder.

          Title:  The  Interplay  between  Star Formation and the Nuclear
          Environment  of  our  Galaxy:  Deep  X-ray  Observations of the
          Galactic Center Arches and Quintuplet Clusters
          Authors: Q. Daniel Wang, Hui Dong, Cornelia Lang

          The  Galactic  center  (GC)  provides a unique laboratory for a
          detailed  examination  of  the  interplay  between massive star
          formation  and  the nuclear environment of our Galaxy. Here, we
          present  an  100  ks Chandra ACIS observation of the Arches and
          Quintuplet  star  clusters.  We  also report on a complementary
          mapping of the dense molecular gas near the Arches cluster made
          with   the  Owens  Valley  Millimeter  Array.  The  number-flux
          relation    of    point-like   X-ray   sources   indicates   an
          over-population  of  relatively bright X-ray sources, which are
          apparently  associated  with  the  clusters. The sources in the
          core  of  the  Arches  and  Quintuplet clusters are most likely
          extreme colliding wind massive star binaries. The diffuse X-ray
          emission  from  the  core  of the Arches cluster has a spectrum
          showing a 6.7-keV emission line and a surface intensity profile
          declining  steeply  with  radius,  indicating  an  origin  in a
          cluster wind. In the outer regions near the Arches cluster, the
          overall  diffuse  X-ray  enhancement  demonstrates  a bow shock
          morphology  and  is  prominent  in  the  Fe Kalpha 6.4-keV line
          emission.  Much  of this enhancement may result from an ongoing
          collision between the cluster and the adjacent molecular cloud.
          The  older  and  less  compact Quintuplet cluster contains much
          weaker X-ray sources and diffuse emission, probably originating
          from  low-mass  stellar  objects  as  well  as  a cluster wind.
          However,  the  overall population of these objects, constrained
          by   the   observed   total   diffuse  X-ray  luminosities,  is
          substantially  smaller  than  expected  for both clusters. This
          deficiency  of  low-mass  objects may be a manifestation of the
          unique star formation environment of the Galactic center.

          Instrumentation, 24-31 May 2006, Orlando, FL
          To   detect   Earth-like   planets   in   the  visible  with  a
          coronagraphic  telescope,  two  major  noise sources have to be
          overcome:  the  photon  noise of the diffracted star light, and
          the   speckle   noise  due  to  the  star  light  scattered  by
          instrumental defects. Coronagraphs tackle only the photon noise
          contribution.  In order to decrease the speckle noise below the
          planet  level, an active control of the wave front is required.
          We have developed analytical methods to measure and correct the
          speckle noise behind a coronagraph with a deformable mirror. In
          this  paper,  we  summarize  these  methods,  present numerical
          simulations,   and  discuss  preliminary  experimental  results
          obtained  with  the High-Contrast Imaging Testbed at NASA's Jet
          Propulsion Laboratory.

          Title:  Unconstrained  Astrometric  Orbits  for Hipparcos Stars
          with Stochastic Solutions
          Authors: Alexey Goldin, Valeri Makarov
          A  considerable  number of astrometric binaries whose positions
          on  the  sky  do  not obey the standard model of mean position,
          parallax  and  linear  proper  motion,  were  observed  by  the
          Hipparcos  satellite.  Some  of them remain non-discovered, and
          their  observational data have not been properly processed with
          the  more  adequate  astrometric  model that includes nonlinear
          orbital  motion.  We  develop  an  automated algorithm based on
          "genetic  optimization",  to  solve the orbital fitting problem
          with  no  prior  information  about  the  orbital  elements  is
          available  (from,  e.g.,  spectroscopic data or radial velocity
          monitoring).  We test this method on Hipparcos stars with known
          orbital solutions in the catalog, and further apply it to stars
          with stochastic solutions, which may be unresolved binaries. At
          a  confidence  level  of  99%, orbital fits are obtained for 65
          stars,  most  of  which have not been known as binary. A few of
          the  new  probable  binaries with A-type primaries with periods
          444-2015  d  are  chemically  peculiar  stars, including Ap and
          \lambda  Boo  type.  The  anomalous  spectra of these stars are
          explained  as  admixture  of  the  light  from  the unresolved,
          sufficiently  bright  and  massive  companions. We estimate the
          apparent  orbits  of  four  stars which have been identified as
          members  of  the  300 Myr-old UMa kinematic group. Another four
          new  nearby binaries may include low-mass M-type or brown dwarf
          companions.  Similar  astrometric  models and algorithms can be
          used  for  binary  stars  and  planet  hosts  observed  by  SIM
          PlanetQuest and Gaia.

          AIMS : To characterize the molecular environment of classical T
          Tauri  stars in Lupus observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope
          and to search for gas-rich disks toward these sources.
          METHODS  : Submillimeter observations of 12CO, 13CO and C18O in
          the  J=3-2  and  2-1  lines  were obtained with the James Clerk
          Maxwell  Telescope  toward  a  sample  of 21 T Tauri stars with
          disks  in  the Lupus molecular clouds. Pointings at the sources
          and  at  selected  off-positions  are  presented  in  order  to
          disentangle  material  associated with disks from ambient cloud
          material.
          RESULTS  :  One  source,  IM  Lup  (Sz 82), has been found with
          double-peaked  12CO and 13CO profiles characteristic of a large
          rotating  gas  disk. The inclination of the disk is found to be
          ~20 degrees, with an outer radius of 400-700 AU. For most other
          sources,  including  GQ  Lup with its substellar companion, the
          single-dish 12CO lines are dominated by extended cloud emission
          with  a  complex  velocity structure. No evidence for molecular
          outflows   is   found.  Compact  C18O  emission  due  to  dense
          circumstellar  material  has  been  detected  toward  only  two
          sources.  Future  searches  for  gas-rich disks in Lupus should
          either  use  interferometers  or  perform very deep single-dish
          integrations  in  dense  gas  tracers to separate the cloud and
          disk emission.

          In   this   paper  we  use  neutral  hydrogen  HI  and  optical
          spectroscopic  observations  to  compare  the  timescales  of a
          merger  event,  starburst episode and radio-AGN activity in the
          radio  galaxy B2 0648+27. We detect a large ring-like structure
          of  HI  in  emission  around  the  early-type host galaxy of B2
          0648+27  (M_HI  =  8.5  x  10^9  Msun,  diameter = 190 kpc). We
          interpret  this as the result of a major merger that occurred >
          1.5  Gyr  ago. From modelling optical long-slit spectra we find
          that  a  young  stellar  population of 0.3 Gyr, indicative of a
          past  starburst  event,  dominates the stellar light throughout
          the  galaxy.  The  off-set in time between the merger event and
          the   starburst  activity  in  B2  0648+27  suggests  that  the
          starburst  was  triggered  in  an advanced stage of the merger,
          which  can  be  explained  if  the gas-rich progenitor galaxies
          contained  a  bulge. Although the exact age of the radio source
          remains uncertain, there appears to be a significant time-delay
          between  the  merger/starburst event and the current episode of
          radio-AGN activity. We also observe an outflow of emission-line
          gas  in  this  system,  which  is  likely related to superwinds
          driven  by the stars that formed during the starburst event. We
          argue  that  the  radio  galaxy  B2  0648+27  is  a link in the
          evolutionary  sequence between Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies
          (ULIRGs) and genuine early-type galaxies.

          ABRIDGED:  We  use  deep  optical, IR and radio observations to
          explore  the  symbiosis between the nuclear activity and galaxy
          evolution  in  the  southern  compact  radio  source PKS1549-79
          (z=0.1523).   The   optical  imaging  observations  reveal  the
          presence  of  tidal tail features which provide strong evidence
          that the host galaxy has undergone a major merger in the recent
          past.  This  is  further  supported by the detection of a young
          stellar  population which was formed 50-250Myr ago and makes up
          1-30% of the total stellar mass. Despite the core-jet structure
          of  the  radio  source  we detect HI absorption associated with
          both the core and the jet. The luminous, quasar-like AGN (M_V <
          -23.5)   is   highly   extinguished  (A_v  >  4.9)  at  optical
          wavelengths  and  shows  many  properties in common with narrow
          line  Seyfert  1  galaxies  (NLS1), including relatively narrow
          permitted  lines  (FWHM ~ 1940 km/s), highly blueshifted [OIII]
          lines  (~680 km/s), and evidence that the putative supermassive
          black  hole  is  accreting  at  a  high  Eddington  ratio. This
          suggests  that  accretion  at  high  Eddington  ratio  does not
          prevent  the  formation of powerful jets. Our observations lend
          strong  support  to  the  predictions  of some recent numerical
          simulations  of  galaxy  mergers  in which the black hole grows
          rapidly   through   merger-induced   accretion   following  the
          coalescence  of  the  nuclei of two merging galaxies; the major
          growth phase largely hidden by the natal gas and dust. Although
          the  models  predict  that  AGN-driven outflows will eventually
          remove  the  gas from the bulge of the host galaxy, the visible
          warm  outflow  in  PKS1549-79 is not currently capable of doing
          so. ABRIDGED

          We   present   optical   integral  field  spectroscopy  of  the
          H-alpha-luminous  (>1E42 erg/s) central cluster galaxies in the
          cores of the cooling flows A1664, A1835, A2204 and Zw8193. From
          the   [NII]+H-alpha   complex   we  derive  2-D  views  of  the
          distribution  and  kinematics  of  the  emission  line gas, and
          further  diagnostics from the [SII] and [OI] lines. The H-alpha
          emission   shows  a  variety  of  disturbed  morphologies  with
          velocity  gradients  and  splittings of several hundred km/s on
          scales  of 20 kpc or more. Despite the small sample size, there
          are  some generic features. The most disturbed H-alpha emission
          appears  to  be associated with secondary galaxies within 10-20
          kpc  (projected) of the central galaxy and close in velocity to
          the  H-alpha.  The  global  H-alpha  kinematics  match those of
          CO(1-0)   emission  in  single-dish  data.  The  [NII]/H-alpha,
          [SII]/H-alpha   and   [OI]/H-alpha   ratios  vary  little  with
          position, local H-alpha surface brightness or between clusters.
          We  propose that the H-alpha and CO emission arise in molecular
          clouds  heated  by  a  starburst  which  has  been triggered by
          interaction  with a secondary galaxy. Such CO emission is known
          to  trace massive (>1E10 M_sun) compact (<20 kpc) reservoirs of
          cool  molecular  gas,  which  an  infalling galaxy may disturb,
          distorting  the  H-alpha  morphology  and initiating widespread
          star  formation.  We suggest that cloud-cloud collisions in the
          undisturbed  molecular  gas  reservoir  might  be  an important
          excitation  source  for  the  emission line gas in the cores of
          lower  H-alpha  luminosity cluster cores with less intense star
          formation (abridged).

          Comments: accepted for publication in A&A
          We  report  on the results of an EPIC XMM-Newton observation of
          the  faint  source  SAXJ1748.2-2808  and the surrounding field.
          This  source was discovered during the BeppoSAX Galactic center
          survey  performed  in 1997-1998. A spatial analysis resulted in
          the  detection  of  31  sources  within the EPIC field of view.
          SAXJ1748.2-2808  is  clearly  resolved  into  2 sources in EPIC
          images with the brighter contributing almost 80% of the 2-10keV
          flux.  Spectral fits to this main source are consistent with an
          absorbed  power-law  with  a  photon  index  of  1.4+/-0.5  and
          absorption  equivalent  to 14E22cm-2 together with an iron line
          at  6.6+/-0.2  keV  with  an  equivalent  width  of ~780eV. The
          significantly  better statistics of the XMM-Newton observation,
          compared  with  BeppoSAX,allows to exclude a thermal nature for
          the  X-ray  emission.  A  comparison with other observations of
          SAXJ1748.2-2808  does  not  reveal any evidence for spectral or
          intensity  long-term  variability. Based on these properties we
          propose  that  the  source  is a low-luminosity high-mass X-ray
          binary located in the Galactic center region.

          the proceedings of the conference "Isolated Neutron Stars: from
          the Interior to the Surface"
          We  discuss  three topics related to the neutron star (NS) mass
          spectrum.  At first we discuss the possibility to form low-mass
          ($  M  \stackrel{<}{\sim}  1  M_{\odot}$)  and  suggest this is
          possible   only   due  to  fragmentation  of  rapidly  rotating
          proto-NSs.  Such  low-mass  NSs  should  have very high spatial
          velocities   which   could  allow  identification.  A  critical
          assessment of this scenario is given. Secondly, we discuss mass
          growth  due  to accretion for NSs in close binary systems. With
          the  help  of  numerical  population  synthesis calculations we
          derive  the mass spectrum of massive ($M > 1.8 M_{\odot}$) NSs.
          Finally, we discuss the role of the mass spectrum in population
          studies  of young cooling NSs. We formulate a kind of {\it mass
          constraint} which can be helpful, in our opinion, in discussing
          different competive models of the thermal evolution of NSs.

          We  derive  black hole masses for a sample of about 300 AGNs in
          the redshift range 0 < z < 2.5. We use the same virial velocity
          measure  (FWHM  Hbeta  broad  component)  for all sources which
          represents  a significant improvement over previous studies. We
          review  methods  and  caveats  for  determining  AGN black hole
          masses  via  the  virial  assumption  for  motions  in  the gas
          producing  low  ionization  broad  emission  lines. We derive a
          corrected  FWHM  measure for the broad component of H-beta that
          better  estimates  the  virialized  line  emitting component by
          comparing  our  FWHM  measures  with  a  sample of reverberated
          sources  with  H-beta  radial  velocity dispersion measures. We
          also  consider  the  FWHM of the FeII 4570 blend as a potential
          alternative  velocity  estimator. We find a range of black hole
          mass  between log M ~ 6 - 10, where the black hole mass M is in
          solar  masses.  Estimates  using  corrected  FWHM,  as  well as
          FWHM(Fe II) measures, reduce the number of sources with log M >
          9.5 and suggest that extremely large M values (log M >~ 10) may
          not be realistic. Derived Eddington ratio values values show no
          evidence   for  a  significant  population  of  super-Eddington
          radiators  especially after correction is made for sources with
          extreme   orientation  to  our  line  of  sight.  Sources  with
          FWHM(Hbeta  broad  component)  <~ 4000 km/s show systematically
          higher  Eddington  ratio  and lower M values than broader lined
          AGNs (including almost all radio-loud sources).

          We   present  an  analysis  of  optical  lightcurves  of  Small
          Magellanic  Cloud  Be-type  stars.  Observations  show that (1)
          optical  excess  flux  is  correlated  with near-IR excess flux
          indicating  a  similar  mechanism  and  (2) the lightcurves can
          trace  out  ``loops''  in  a colour-magnitude diagram. A simple
          model  for the time dependent bound-free and free-free emission
          produced  by  an outflowing circumstellar disk gives reasonable
          fits to the observations.

          We  present  the  first results from the Distant Radio Galaxies
          Optically  Non-detected  in  the SDSS (DRaGONS) Survey. Using a
          novel  selection  technique for identifying high redshift radio
          galaxy  (HzRG) candidates, a large sample of bright (S_{1.4GHz}
          > 100mJy) radio sources from the FIRST survey having no optical
          counterpart  in  the  SDSS is compiled. K-band imaging with the
          FLAMINGOS  instrument on the 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak for
          96  such  candidates  allows preliminary identification of HzRG
          candidates  through the well-known K-z relation. Of the initial
          candidates,  we  identify  70  with  magnitudes brighter than K
          \approx   19.5,   and   compute  limiting  magnitudes  for  the
          remainder.  Assigning redshifts based on the K-z Hubble diagram
          gives  a  mean  redshift  for  our sample of z=2.5 and a median
          redshift  of  z=2.0.  This  selection  is  also  sensitive to a
          previously  unseen population of anomalously red radio galaxies
          (r-K  >  6.5-7),  which may indicate significant obscuration at
          moderate  redshifts. These obscured objects can be used to test
          the  completeness  of QSO surveys to the effects of reddenning.
          More  than  ten percent of our sample falls into this category,
          which  may  represent  a  sizable radio loud population missing
          from  current  optically  selected AGN samples. We additionally
          identify  479 bright Extremely Red Objects (EROs) in the fields
          surrounding  our  HzRG  candidates,  to  a magnitude of K=17.5,
          within  a  non-contiguous  area  of  2.38  square degrees. This
          constitutes  a  small overdensity of EROs surrounding the radio
          galaxy  candidates  over  random  fields,  and  we see possible
          evidence  for a physical association of the EROs with the radio
          galaxies.  However,  examining  the  clustering of all K < 19.0
          galaxies  around  the  radio  targets  reveals no evidence of a
          global galaxy excess.

          Comments: 13 pages, 14 figures, to appear in MNRAS
          We  report  on  the  results  from  a  five-night  campaign  of
          high-speed  spectroscopy  of  the  17-minute  binary  AM  Canum
          Venaticorum, obtained with the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope
          on La Palma.
          We  derive  a  mass  ratio  q=0.18+/-0.01  for AM CVn, which is
          significantly  higher  than  the  value found in previous, less
          direct  measurements.  We discuss the implications for AM CVn's
          evolutionary  history  and  show  that a helium star progenitor
          scenario   is   strongly   favoured.  We  further  discuss  the
          implications  for  the  interpretation  of  AM  CVn's superhump
          behaviour,  and for the detectability of its gravitational-wave
          signal with LISA.
          We  further  test  the  predictions of an eccentric, precessing
          disc  that  are based on AM CVn's observed superhump behaviour.
          We  limit  the  effective eccentricity in the outermost part of
          the  disc, where the resonances that drive the eccentricity are
          thought  to  occur,  to  e=0.04+/-0.01,  which  is smaller than
          previous models indicated.

          details
          The  Laser  Interferometer  Space Antenna (LISA) will produce a
          data  stream  containing  a vast number of overlapping sources:
          from  strong  signals  generated  by the coalescence of massive
          black  hole  binary  systems  to  much  weaker  radiation  form
          sub-stellar   mass  compact  binaries  and  extreme-mass  ratio
          inspirals.  It  has  been  argued  that the observation of weak
          signals could be hampered by the presence of loud ones and that
          they  first need to be removed to allow such observations. Here
          we  consider  a different approach in which sources are studied
          simultaneously  within  the framework of Bayesian inference. We
          investigate  the  simplified case in which the LISA data stream
          contains  radiation  from  a  massive  black hole binary system
          superimposed   over  a  (weaker)  quasi-monochromatic  waveform
          generated  by  a  white  dwarf  binary. We derive the posterior
          probability  density  function of the model parameters using an
          automatic  Reversible  Jump  Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm
          (RJMCMC).  We  show  that the information about the sources and
          noise  are  retrieved at the expected level of accuracy without
          the need of removing the stronger signal. Our analysis suggests
          that  this  approach  is  worth  pursuing further and should be
          considered for the actual analysis of the LISA data.

          Title:  New  perspectives  on  strong z=0.5 MgII absorbers: are
          halo-mass and equivalent width anti-correlated?

          Comments:  18  pages,  12  EPS figures, Accepted by MNRAS. Full
          table of MgII absorbers available at this http URL
          We measure the mean halo-mass of z=0.5 MgII absorbers using the
          cross-correlation   (over  co-moving  scales  0.05-13h^{-1}Mpc)
          between  1806  MgII  quasar  absorption  systems  and  ~250,000
          Luminous  Red Galaxies (LRGs), both selected from the SDSS DR3.
          The    MgII   systems   have   rest-frame   equivalent   widths
          W_r(2796)>=0.3A.    From    the    ratio    of   the   MgII-LRG
          cross-correlation to the LRG-LRG auto-correlation, we find that
          the  bias ratio between MgII absorbers and LRGs is 0.65+/-0.08,
          which  implies  that  the  absorber  host-galaxies  have a mean
          halo-mass  20-40  times smaller than that of the LRGs; the MgII
          absorbers have halos of mean mass
          <logM_h(M_sol)>=11.94+/-0.31(stat)+/-0.25(sys).  We demonstrate
          that  this  statistical  technique,  which does not require any
          spectroscopic follow-up, does not suffer from contaminants such
          as  stars  or  foreground  and background galaxies. Finally, we
          find  that  the  absorber halo-mass is anti-correlated with the
          equivalent  width.  If MgII absorbers were virialized in galaxy
          halos  a  positive M_h-W_r correlation would have been observed
          since  W_r(2796)  is a direct measure of the velocity spread of
          the MgII sub-components. Thus, our results demonstrate that the
          individual  clouds  of  a MgII system are not virialized in the
          gaseous  halos  of the host-galaxies. We review past results in
          the  literature  on  the  statistics of MgII absorbers and find
          that   they  too  require  an  M_h-W_r  anti-correlation.  When
          combined    with   measurements   of   the   equivalent   width
          distribution,  the  M_h-W_r anti-correlation naturally explains
          why  absorbers  with W_r(2796)>=2A are not seen at large impact
          parameters.  We  interpret  the M_h-W_r anti-correlation within
          the starburst scenario where strong MgII absorbers are produced
          by supernovae-driven winds.

          The   Multi   Unit   Spectroscopic   Explorer   (MUSE)   is   a
          second-generation  VLT  panoramic  integral-field  spectrograph
          under  preliminary  design  study.  MUSE  has  a  field  of 1x1
          arcmin**2  sampled  at 0.2x0.2 arcsec**2 and is assisted by the
          VLT  ground layer adaptive optics ESO facility using four laser
          guide  stars. The simultaneous spectral range is 465-930 nm, at
          a resolution of R~3000. MUSE couples the discovery potential of
          a  large  imaging  device  to  the  measuring capabilities of a
          high-quality   spectrograph,  while  taking  advantage  of  the
          increased  spatial resolution provided by adaptive optics. This
          makes  MUSE  a  unique and tremendously powerful instrument for
          discovering  and  characterizing  objects  that  lie beyond the
          reach of even the deepest imaging surveys. MUSE has also a high
          spatial  resolution  mode  with 7.5x7.5 arcsec**2 field of view
          sampled at 25 milli-arcsec. In this mode MUSE should be able to
          obtain   diffraction  limited  data-cubes  in  the  600-930  nm
          wavelength  range.  Although the MUSE design has been optimized
          for  the study of galaxy formation and evolution, it has a wide
          range  of  possible  applications;  e.g.  monitoring  of  outer
          planets atmosphere, environment of young stellar objects, super
          massive  black  holes  and  active nuclei in nearby galaxies or
          massive  spectroscopic  surveys  of stellar fields in the Milky

          We  have  used  the  NICMOS  NIC1  camera  on  the Hubble Space
          Telescope  to  obtain  high  angular  resolution  images  of 51
          ultracool  dwarfs  in  the  immediate Solar Neighbourhood. Nine
          systems are resolved as binary, with component separations from
          1.5  and 15 AU. All of the systems have components with similar
          luminosities,  and,  consequently,  high  mass ratios, q > 0.8.
          Limiting  analysis  to L dwarfs within 20 parsecs, the observed
          binary fraction is 12(+7/-3). Applying Bayesian analysis to our
          dataset,   we  derive  a  mass-ratio  distribution  that  peaks
          strongly  at  unity. Modelling the semi-major axis distribution
          as a logarithmic Gaussian, the best fit is centered at log(a_0)

          Title:  On  the fraction of X-ray obscured quasars in the local
          universe
          Authors: J. X. Wang, P. Jiang
          Comments: 13 pages, including 4 figures, ApJ letter accepted
          Recent  wide  area  hard  X-ray and soft Gamma ray surveys have
          shown  that  the  fraction  of X-ray obscured AGNs in the local
          universe  significantly decreases with intrinsic luminosity. In
          this letter we point out that two correction have to be made to
          the samples: 1) radio loud AGNs have to be excluded since their
          X-ray  emission  might  be  dominated  by the jet component; 2)
          Compton  thick sources have to be excluded too since their hard
          X-ray  and soft gamma ray emission are also strongly attenuated
          by  Compton scattering. The soft gamma-ray selected AGN samples
          obtained  by SWIFT and INTEGRAL provide the best opportunity to
          study the fraction of obscured AGN in the local universe in the
          least  biased  way.  We  choose  these  samples to check if the
          corrections  could  alter  the  above result on the fraction of
          obscured AGNs. We find that before the corrections both samples
          show   significant   anti-correlation   between  L_X  and  N_H,
          indicating  obvious  decrease  in the fraction of obscured AGNs
          with  luminosity.  However, after the corrections, we find only
          marginal evidence of anti-correlation (at 98% confidence level)
          in  the  SWIFT  sample,  and no evidence at all in the INTEGRAL
          sample  which  consists  of  comparable  number  of objects. We
          conclude  that current samples only show a marginal decrease in
          the  fraction  of obscured AGNs in the local universe, and much
          larger samples are required to reach a more robust conclusion.

          Title: Lyman Alpha Constraints on Very Low Luminosity AGN
          Authors: Mark Dijkstra, Stuart Wyithe
          Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          Recent  surveys  have  detected  Lya emission from z=4.5-6.5 at
          luminosities as low as 10^41 erg/s.
          There  is  good  evidence  that  low  numbers  of AGN are among
          observed  faint Lya emitters. Combining these observations with
          an  empirical  relation  between  the  intrinsic Lya and B-band
          luminosities  of  AGN,  we  obtain an upper limit on the number
          density  of  AGN  with  absolute  magnitudes  M_B=[-16,-19]  at
          z=4.5-6.5.  These AGN are up to two orders of magnitude fainter
          than  those  discovered in the Chandra Deep Field, resulting in
          the   faintest  observational  constraints  to  date  at  these
          redshifts.  At  z=4.5, the powerlaw slope of the very faint end
          of  the  luminosity function of AGN is shallower than the slope
          observed  at  lower redshifts, beta <1.6, at the 99% confidence
          level.  In  fact, we find marginal evidence that the luminosity
          function  rises  with  luminosity,  corresponding to a powerlaw
          slope   beta  <0,  at  magnitudes  fainter  than  M_B~-20  (76%
          confidence  level). These results suggest either that accretion
          onto  lower  mass black holes is less efficient than onto their
          more  massive  counterparts,  or that the number of black holes
          powering  AGN  with  M_B  >-20  is lower than expected from the
          M_BH-sigma   relation   by   one-two   orders   of   magnitude.
          Extrapolating  from reverberation-mapping studies suggests that
          these black holes would have M_BH=10^6-10^7 Msun. To facilitate
          the  identification  of  AGN  among  observed  Lya emitters, we
          derive  observational  properties of faint AGN in the Lya line,
          as well as in the X-ray and optical bands.

          We have searched the OGLE-II archive for candidate counterparts
          of   X-ray  sources  detected  in  two  low-extinction  windows
          included in our Galactic bulge Chandra/HST survey. We find that
          a  significant number - i.e. in excess of the expected level of
          random  associations  -  can be matched with probable M-giants.
          Their  X-ray  properties can be understood if these sources are
          symbiotic  binaries  where  the  X-rays  are  typically, either
          directly  or  indirectly, the result of a white dwarf accreting
          from  the  wind  of  a  cool  giant.  Optical and near-infrared
          properties  of selected sources are consistent with a symbiotic
          nature,  although none of the spectra collected for 8 out of 13
          candidate   counterparts   show   the  high-ionization  nebular
          emission  lines  observed  for  many symbiotics. The hard X-ray
          emission  for several sources (power-law photon indices -1.5 ~<
          Gamma  ~<  1.5) suggests our sample includes systems similar to
          the symbiotics recently detected with INTEGRAL and Swift.

          A detailed imaging analysis of the globular cluster (GC) system
          of the Sombrero galaxy (NGC 4594) has been accomplished using a
          six-image  mosaic  from  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope Advanced
          Camera  for  Surveys.  The  quality  of  the  data is such that
          contamination  by  foreground  stars and background galaxies is
          negligible  for  all  but  the faintest 5% of the GC luminosity
          function  (GCLF). This enables the study of an effectively pure
          sample  of  659  GCs  until  ~2  mags fainter than the turnover
          magnitude,  which  occurs  at  M_V=-7.60+/-0.06  for an assumed
          m-M=29.77.   Two   GC  metallicity  subpopulations  are  easily
          distinguishable, with the metal-poor subpopulation exhibiting a
          smaller   intrinsic   dispersion   in  color  compared  to  the
          metal-rich subpopulation.
          Three   new   discoveries   include:   (1)   A   metal-poor  GC
          color-magnitude trend. (2) Confirmation that the metal-rich GCs
          are  ~26%  smaller than the metal-poor ones for small projected
          galactocentric  radii (less than 2 arcmin). However, the median
          half-light  radii of the two subpopulations become identical at
          ~3 arcmin from the center. This is most easily explained if the
          size  difference  is  the result of projection effects. (3) The
          brightest  (M_V  <  -9.0)  members  of  the  GC  system  show a
          size-magnitude  upturn where the average GC size increases with
          increasing  luminosity.  Evidence is presented that supports an
          intrinsic  origin  for  this feature rather than a being result
          from   accreted  dwarf  elliptical  nuclei.  In  addition,  the
          metal-rich  GCs show a shallower positive size-magnitude trend,
          similar  to  what  is  found  in previous studies of young star
          clusters.

          We  discuss  the  panchromatic  properties  of  99,088 galaxies
          selected  from  the SDSS Data Release 1 spectroscopic sample (a
          flux-limited   sample  for  1360  deg^2).  These  galaxies  are
          positionally  matched  to  sources  detected  by  ROSAT, GALEX,
          2MASS,  IRAS,  GB6,  FIRST,  NVSS  and  WENSS.  We  find strong
          correlations   between   the   detection   fraction   at  other
          wavelengths  and  optical  properties such as flux, colors, and
          emission-line  strengths. Using GALEX, SDSS, and 2MASS data, we
          construct  the  UV-IR  broad-band spectral energy distributions
          for various types of galaxies, and find that they form a nearly
          one-parameter  family. For example, based on SDSS u- and r-band
          data,  supplemented  with redshift, the K-band 2MASS magnitudes
          can  be "predicted" with an rms scatter of only 0.2 mag. When a
          dust content estimate determined from SDSS data by Kauffmann et
          al. (2003) is also utilized, this scatter decreases to 0.1 mag.
          We  demonstrate  that  this  dust  content is indeed higher for
          galaxies  detected by IRAS and that it can be used to "predict"
          measured  IRAS  60  micron  flux density within a factor of two
          using  only  SDSS  data.  We  also  show that the position of a
          galaxy  in  the  emission-line-based Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich
          diagram  is  correlated  with  the  optical light concentration
          index and u-r color determined from the SDSS broad-band imaging
          data,  and  discuss  changes  in the morphology of this diagram
          induced  by requiring detections at other wavelengths. We study
          the  IR-radio  correlation and find evidence that its slope may
          be  different  for AGN and star-forming galaxies and related to
          the H_alpha/H_beta line strength ratio.

          We  compare  the  performance  of  multiple  codes  written  by
          different  groups  for making polarized maps from Planck-sized,
          all-sky  cosmic  microwave  background (CMB) data. Three of the
          codes  are based on a destriping algorithm; the other three are
          implementations  of  an  optimal  maximum-likelihood algorithm.
          Time-ordered data (TOD) were simulated using the Planck Level-S
          simulation  pipeline.  Several  cases  of temperature-only data
          were  run  to  test that the codes could handle large datasets,
          and  to  explore  effects such as the precision of the pointing
          data.  Based  on  these preliminary results, TOD were generated
          for  a  set  of  four  217  GHz  detectors  (the minimum number
          required  to  produce  I,  Q,  and  U maps) under two different
          scanning   strategies,   with   and  without  noise.  Following
          correction   of   various   problems   revealed  by  the  early
          simulation, all codes were able to handle the large data volume
          that  Planck  will  produce.  Differences  in maps produced are
          small  but  noticeable;  differences in computing resources are
          large.

          Effects of Secular Interactions
          Authors: Fred C. Adams, Gregory Laughlin
          Comments: 14 pages, 2 figures, accepted to ApJ
          This paper studies the long term evolution of planetary systems
          containing short-period planets, including the effects of tidal
          circularization,   secular   excitation   of   eccentricity  by
          companion  planets,  and stellar damping. For planetary systems
          subject  to  all  of  these  effects,  analytic  solutions  (or
          approximations)  are  presented  for  the time evolution of the
          semi-major   axes   and  eccentricities.  Secular  interactions
          enhance  the  inward  migration  and accretion of hot Jupiters,
          while general relativity tends to act in opposition by reducing
          the  effectiveness  of  the secular perturbations. The analytic
          solutions presented herein allow us to understand these effects
          over a wide range of parameter space and to isolate the effects
          of general relativity in these planetary systems.

          Comments: 39 pages, 12 figures, ARAA, vol. 44, in press
          We  review  the  properties  and  behavior  X-ray binaries that
          contain  an  accreting  black hole. The larger majority of such
          systems are X-ray transients, and many of them were observed in
          daily  pointings  with  RXTE  throughout  the  course  of their
          outbursts.  The complex evolution of these sources is described
          in   terms   of   common  behavior  patterns  illustrated  with
          comprehensive  overview  diagrams  for  six  selected  systems.
          Central to this comparison are three X-ray states of accretion,
          which  are  reviewed  and  defined  quantitatively.  Each state
          yields  phenomena that arise in strong gravitational fields. We
          sketch  a  scenario  for  the  potential  impact  of black hole
          observations  on  physics and discuss a current frontier topic:
          the measurement of black hole spin.

          Population  synthesis  model  of  the galactic planetary nebula
          population produced by singlestars and binaries
          Authors: Maxwell Moe, Orsola De Marco
          Comments:  52  pages  (referee format), 14 figures. Accepted by
          ApJ
          We  present  a  population  synthesis calculation to derive the
          total  number  of  planetary  nebulae  (PN)  in the Galaxy that
          descend  from  single  stars and stars in binary systems. Using
          the  most  recent  literature  results  on galactic and stellar
          formation  as  well  as stellar evolution, we predict the total
          number  of  galactic  PNe  with radii <0.9 pc to be (46,000 +/-
          13,000).  We  do  not claim this to be the complete population,
          since  there  can  be  visible  PNe with radii larger than this
          limit.  However,  by  taking  this limit, we make our predicted
          population  inherently  comparable to the observationally-based
          value  of  Peimbert,  who determined (7200 +/- 1800) PNe should
          reside  in  the Galaxy today. Our prediction is discrepant with
          the  observations  at the 2.9-sigma level, a disagreement which
          we argue is meaningful in view of our specific treatment of the
          uncertainty.  We  conclude that it is likely that only a subset
          of  the  stars  thought  to  be capable of making a visible PN,
          actually  do.  In  the second paper in this series, an argument
          will  be  presented that the bulk of the galactic PN population
          might be better explained if only binaries produce PNe.
          The  predicted  PN formation rate density from single stars and
          binaries  is (1.1 +/- 0.5) x 10^{-12} PN/yr per cubic pc in the
          local  neighborhood.  This number is lower than the most recent
          PN  birthrate  density  estimates  of  2.1 x 10^{-12} PN/yr per
          cubic  pc,  which  are  based  on  local  PN  counts and the PN
          distance scale, but more in line with the white dwarf birthrate
          densities  determined  by  Liebert  et  al.  ((1.0  +/- 0.25) x
          10^{-12}  WD/yr  per  cubic  pc).  The  predicted  PN birthrate
          density  will  be revised down, if we assume that only binaries
          make  PNe.  This revision will imply that the PN distance scale
          has to be revised to larger values.

          to The Astrophysical Journal
          We show by means of a high-resolution N-body simulation how the
          mass  assembly  histories of galaxy-size cold dark matter (CDM)
          halos depend on environment. Halos in high density environments
          form  earlier  and a higher fraction of their mass is assembled
          in  major  mergers,compared  to  low  density environments. The
          distribution of the present--day specific mass aggregation rate
          is  bimodal and strongly dependent on environment. While in low
          density  environments  only ~20% of the halos are not accreting
          mass  at the present epoch, this fraction rises to ~80% at high
          densities.  At  z=1 the median of the specific aggregation rate
          is  ~4  times  larger  than  at  z=0  and almost independent on
          environment.  All the dependences on environment found here are
          critically  enhanced  by local processes associated to subhalos
          because  the  fraction of subhalos increases as the environment
          gets  denser.  The  distribution  of  the  halo  specific  mass
          aggregation  rate  as  well  as  its  dependence on environment
          resemble  the  relations  for  the specific star formation rate
          distribution of galaxies. An analogue of the morphology-density
          relation  is  also  present  at  the  level of CDM halos, being
          driven   by  the  halo  major  merging  history.  Nevertheless,
          baryonic  processes  are  necessary in order to explain further
          details  and  the evolution of the star formation rate-, color-
          and morphology-environment relations.

          disks grow slowly in mass starting from a Toomre-stable initial
          condition   to  the  point  at  which  they  become  marginally
          unstable. We find that gravitationally bound clumps with masses
          close  to a Jupiter mass can arise. Fragmentation appears to be
          driven   by   vertical   convective-like   motions  capable  of
          transporting  the heat from the disk midplane to its surface on
          a  timescale  of  only  about  40  years  at 10 AU. A larger or
          smaller  cooling  efficiency  of the disk at the optically thin
          surface  can  promote  or stifle fragmentation by affecting the
          vertical   temperature   profile,   which   determines  whether
          convection  can  happen or not, and by regulating the accretion
          flow  from optically thin regions towards overdense regions. We
          also  find  that  the  chances  of fragmentation increase for a
          higher  mean molecular weight $\mu$ since compressional heating
          is  reduced.  Around  a star with mass $1 M_{\odot}$ only disks
          with  $\mu  \ge  2.4$,  as  expected for gas with a metallicity
          comparable  to  solar  or  higher, fragment. This suggests that
          disk instability, like core-accretion, should be more effective
          in  forming  gas giants at higher gas metallicities, consistent
          with  the  observed  correlation  between  metallicity  of  the
          planet-hosting stars and frequency of planets

          We  present high-resolution infrared spectroscopy of the Herbig
          Ae  star  HD  141569  A  in  the  CO v=2-1 transition. With the
          angular  resolution attained by the adaptive optics system, the
          gas  disk  around HD 141569 A is spatially resolved down to its
          inner-rim  truncation.  The size of the inner clearing is 11+-2
          AU  in  radius,  close to the gravitational radius of the star.
          The  rough  coincidence  to  the gravitational radius indicates
          that   the   viscous   accretion   working  together  with  the
          photoevaporation by the stellar radiation has cleared the inner
          part of the disk.

          Authors: Rosanne Di Stefano, Albert Kong, Francis A. Primini
          Comments: 6 pages
          First discovered in the Magellanic Clouds and in the Milky Way,
          the  largest  pools  of luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs)
          now  known lie in M31 and in more distant galaxies. Hundreds of
          newly-discovered SSSs are helping us to test models for Type Ia
          supernovae  and  to  identify  SSSs  that may represent a wider
          range     of     physical    systems,    including    accreting
          intermediate-mass black holes. In this short report we list ten
          intriguing facts about distant SSSs.

          We  present  a  3-dimensional  study  of  the  local ($\leq 100
          h^{-1}$  kpc)  and  the  large  scale  ($\leq$  1 $h^{-1}$ Mpc)
          environment  of  Bright IRAS Galaxies (BIRGs). For this purpose
          we  use  87  BIRGs  located  at  high  galactic latitudes (with
          0.008$\leq  z  \leq$0.018)  as  well  as  a  control  sample of
          non-active galaxies having the same morphological, redshift and
          diameter  size  distributions as the corresponding BIRG sample.
          Using  the  Center  for  Astrophysics  (CfA2)  and Southern Sky
          Redshift Survey (SSRS) galaxy catalogues ($m_b\lesssim 15.5$)as
          well  as our own spectroscopic observations ($m_b\lesssim19.0$)
          for  a  subsample of the original BIRG sample, we find that the
          fraction of BIRGs with a close neighbor is significantly higher
          than  that  of  their  control sample. Comparing with a related
          analysis  of  Sy1 and Sy2 galaxies of Koulouridis et al. (2006)
          we find that BIRGs have a similar environment as Sy2s, although
          the  fraction  of  BIRGs  with  a bright close neighbor is even
          higher than that of Sy2 galaxies. An additional analysis of the
          relation  between  FIR  colors and the type of activity of each
          BIRG  shows  a  significant  difference  between  the colors of
          strongly-interacting   and  non-interacting  starbursts  and  a
          resemblance  between  the  colors of non-interacting starbursts
          and Sy2s. Our results support the view where close interactions
          can   drive  molecular  clouds  towards  the  galactic  center,
          triggering   starburst   activity  and  obscuring  the  nuclear
          activity.   When  the  close  neighbor  moves  away,  starburst
          activity  is  reduced  with  the  simultaneous appearance of an
          obscured (type 2) AGN. Finally, the complete disentanglement of
          the pair gives birth to an unobscured (type 1) AGN.

          While  [OIII]  narrow-band  imaging is commonly used to measure
          the  size  of the narrow-line regions (NLRs) in active galactic
          nuclei   (AGNs),  it  can  be  contaminated  by  emission  from
          surrounding  starbursts. Recently, we have shown that long-slit
          spectroscopy  provides a valuable alternative approach to probe
          the  size  in  terms  of AGN photoionisation. Moreover, several
          parameters  of  the NLR can be directly accessed. We here apply
          the  same  methods  developed  and  described for the Seyfert-2
          galaxy  NGC1386  to  study  the  NLR  of  five  other Seyfert-2
          galaxies  by  using high-sensitivity spatially-resolved optical
          spectroscopy  obtained  at  the  VLT  and the NTT. We probe the
          AGN-photoionisation  of  the  NLR  and  thus, its ``real'' size
          using   diagnostic   line-ratio   diagrams.We  derive  physical
          properties  of the NLR such as reddening, ionisation parameter,
          electron  density,  and velocity as a function of distance from
          the  nucleus.  For  NGC5643,  the  diagnostic diagrams unveil a
          similar  transition  between  line  ratios  falling  in the AGN
          regime  and those typical for HII regions as found for NGC1386,
          thus  determining  the  size  of  the  NLR.  For the other four
          objects,  all  measured  line ratios fall in the AGN regime. In
          almost   all   cases,  both  electron  density  and  ionisation
          parameter  decrease  with  radius. Deviations from this general
          behaviour   (such  as  a  secondary  peak)  seen  in  both  the
          ionisation parameter and electron density can be interpreted as
          signs of shocks from the interaction of a radio jet and the NLR
          gas.  In  several objects, the gaseous velocity distribution is
          characteristic   for   rotational   motion   in  an  (inclined)
          emission-line  disk  in  the  centre. We compare our results to
          those  of NGC1386 and show that the latter can be considered as
          prototypical  also  for  this  larger  sample.  We  discuss our
          findings in detail for each object.

          HST   ACS   images   reveal   blue   cores   in  four  E+A,  or
          post-starburst,  galaxies.  Follow-up  spectroscopy  shows that
          these  cores  have  LINER  spectra.  The  existence  of LINERs,
          consistent  with  those in many elliptical galaxies, is yet one
          more  piece of evidence that these post-merger, post-starburst,
          bulge-dominated  galaxies  will evolve into normal ellipticals.
          More  interestingly,  if  LINERs  are powered by low-luminosity
          AGN,  their  presence  in  these  E+As  suggests that any rapid
          growth  phase  of the central black hole ended in rough concert
          with  the  cessation  of star formation. This result emphasizes
          the importance of E+As for exploring how the evolution of black
          holes and AGN may be tied to that of galactic bulges.

          Comments: 14 pages. Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We present two-dimensional spectroscopy covering the rest-frame
          wavelengths  of  strong  optical emission lines in six luminous
          submillimetre galaxies at z=1.3--2.5. Together with HST ACS and
          NICMOS  imaging  we  map the dynamics and morphologies of these
          systems  on  scales  from  4--11kpc.  Four  of the systems show
          multiple  components  in  their spatially-resolved spectra with
          average velocity offsets of ~180km/s across 8kpc in projection.
          From   the   ensemble   properties  from  our  survey  and  the
          literature,  we estimate the typical dynamical masses of bright
          sub-mm  galaxies  as  (5+/-3)  x10^{11}Mo.  This  is similar to
          recent estimates of their stellar masses -- suggesting that the
          dynamics  of  the  central regions of these galaxies are baryon
          dominated,  with  a  substantial  fraction  of those baryons in
          stars by the epoch of observation. Combining our dynamical mass
          estimates  with  stellar  luminosities  for  this population we
          investigate  whether submillimetre galaxies can evolve onto the
          Faber-Jackson   relation  for  local  ellipticals.  Adopting  a
          typical     lifetime     of    tau_{burst}~300Myr    for    the
          submillimetre-luminous   phase   we   find   that  the  stellar
          populations of sub-mm galaxies should fade to place them on the
          Faber-Jackson  relation, at M_K ~ -25.1. Furthermore, using the
          same  starburst  lifetime we correct the observed space density
          of submillimetre galaxies for the duty cycle to derive a volume
          density  of  the  progenitors  of  \~1x10^{-4}Mpc^{-3}. This is
          consistent  with the space density of local luminous early-type
          galaxies  with  M_K  ~  -25.1,  indicating  that  submillimetre
          galaxies  can  evolve  onto  the scaling relations observed for
          local  early-type  galaxies, and the observed population at z~2
          is  then  sufficient  to account for the formation of the whole
          population of >~3 L^{*} ellipticals seen at z~0.

          The  probably single stars HD15570 and HD15629, and the massive
          binary/triple system HD15558
          Authors: M. De Becker, G. Rauw, J. Manfroid, P. Eenens
          Comments:  12  pages,  including 6 figures (+ 4 pages of online
          material), accepted for publication by A&A
          Aims:  We  address  the  issue of the multiplicity of the three
          brightest  early-type  stars  of the young open cluster IC1805,
          namely  HD15570,  HD15629  and  HD15558. Methods: For the three
          stars,  we  measured  the  radial  velocity by fitting Gaussian
          curves  to  line profiles in the optical domain. In the case of
          the   massive   binary   HD15558,   we  also  used  a  spectral
          disentangling method to separate the spectra of the primary and
          of  the  secondary  in order to derive the radial velocities of
          the  two  components.  These  measurements were used to compute
          orbital   solutions  for  HD15558.  Results:  For  HD15570  and
          HD15629,  the  radial velocities do not present any significant
          trend  attributable  to a binary motion on time scales of a few
          days,  nor from one year to the next. In the case of HD15558 we
          obtained  an  improved  SB1  orbital  solution with a period of
          about  442  days,  and  we  report  for  the  first time on the
          detection  of  the spectral signature of its secondary star. We
          derive  spectral  types  O5.5III(f) and O7V for the primary and
          the  secondary  of  HD15558. We tentatively compute a first SB2
          orbital  solution  although  the  radial  velocities  from  the
          secondary  star  should  be  considered  with caution. The mass
          ratio  is  rather high, i.e. about 3, and leads to very extreme
          minimum  masses,  in particular for the primary object. Minimum
          masses  of  the  order  of 150 \pm 50 and 50 \pm 15 M_\odot are
          found   respectively   for   the  primary  and  the  secondary.
          Conclusions:  We propose that HD15558 could be a triple system.
          This  scenario  could  help to reconcile the very large minimum
          mass  derived for the primary object with its spectral type. In
          addition,  considering new and previously published results, we
          find  that  the  binary frequency among O-stars in IC1805 has a
          lower  limit of 20%, and that previously published values (80%)
          are probably overestimated.

          Comments: Ap.J.Lett. accepted
          We  report  the  detection of variable linear polarization from
          Sgr  A* at a wavelength of 3.5mm, the longest wavelength yet at
          which  a  detection has been made. The mean polarization is 2.1
          +/-  0.1% at a position angle of 16 +/- 2 deg with rms scatters
          of  0.4%  and  9  deg  over  the  five  epochs.  We also detect
          polarization  variability on a timescale of days. Combined with
          previous   detections   over  the  range  150-400GHz  (750-2000
          microns),  the  average  polarization  position  angles are all
          found  to be consistent with a rotation measure of -4.4 +/- 0.3
          x  10^5  rad/m^2. This implies that the Faraday rotation occurs
          external  to  the  polarized  source  at  all wavelengths. This
          implies  an  accretion  rate  ~0.2  - 4 x 10^-8 Msun/yr for the
          accretion  density  profiles  expected  of  ADAF,  jet and CDAF
          models  and  assuming that the region at which electrons in the
          accretion  flow  become  relativistic  is  within  10  R_S. The
          inferred   accretion   rate  is  inconsistent  with  ADAF/Bondi
          accretion.  The  stability  of  the  mean polarization position
          angle  between  disparate  polarization  observations  over the
          frequency  range  limits  fluctuations in the accretion rate to
          less  than  5%.  The flat frequency dependence of the inter-day
          polarization   position   angle   variations  also  makes  them
          difficult  to  attribute  to rotation measure fluctuations, and
          suggests  that both the magnitude and position angle variations
          are intrinsic to the emission.

          We  report  the detection of six discrete, low-luminosity (Lx <
          10^33  erg/s)  X-ray  sources,  located within 12 arcsec of the
          center  of  the collapsed-core globular cluster M30 (NGC 7099),
          and  a  total of 13 sources within the half-mass radius, from a
          50  ksec  Chandra ACIS-S exposure. Three sources lie within the
          very  small  upper  limit of 1.9 arcsec on the core radius. The
          brightest  of  the  three  core  sources has a luminosity of Lx
          (0.5-6  keV)  =  6x10^32  erg/s and a blackbody-like soft X-ray
          spectrum,  which  are both consistent with it being a quiescent
          low-mass  X-ray  binary  (qLMXB).  We  have  identified optical
          counterparts to four of the six central sources and a number of
          the  outlying  sources,  using  deep Hubble Space Telescope and
          ground-based  imaging. While the two proposed counterparts that
          lie  within  the  core may represent chance superpositions, the
          two  identified  central  sources  that lie outside of the core
          have  X-ray  and  optical properties consistent with being CVs.
          Two additional sources outside of the core have possible active
          binary  counterparts. We discuss the X-ray source population of
          M30 in light of its collapsed-core status.

          We present new XMM-Newton observations of two luminous and high
          accretion-rate  radio-quiet  active  galactic  nuclei (AGNs) at
          z~2.  Together  with  archival  X-ray  and  rest-frame  optical
          spectra  of three sources with similar properties as well as 25
          moderate-luminosity  radio-quiet AGNs at z<0.5, we investigate,
          for  the first time, the dependence of the hard (>~2 keV) X-ray
          power-law  photon index on the broad H_beta emission-line width
          and  on the accretion rate across ~3 orders of magnitude in AGN
          luminosity.  Provided  the accretion rates of the five luminous
          sources  can  be  estimated  by  extrapolating  the  well-known
          broad-line    region    size-luminosity    relation   to   high
          luminosities, we find that the photon indices of these sources,
          while  consistent  with  those  expected  from  their accretion
          rates,  are  significantly higher than expected from the widths
          of  their H_beta lines. We argue that, within the limits of our
          sample,  the  hard-X-ray  photon index depends primarily on the
          accretion rate.

          Title: Star formation in the vicinity of the IC 348 cluster
          Authors: M. Tafalla, M. S. N. Kumar, R. Bachiller
          Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures, A&A accepted
          Aims.   We   present   molecular   line   observations  of  the
          southwestern  part of the IC 348 young cluster, and we use them
          together  with  NIR  and  mm  continuum  data  to determine the
          distribution  of  dense gas, search for molecular outflows, and
          analyze  the  ongoing  star  formation  activity in the region.
          Methods.  Our  molecular  line  data consists of C18O(1--0) and
          N2H+(1--0)   maps  obtained  with  the  FCRAO  telescope  at  a
          resolution  of  about  50'' and CO(2--1) data obtained with the
          IRAM  30m telescope at a resolution of 11''. Results. The dense
          gas  southwest of IC 348 is concentrated in two groups of dense
          cores,  each  of  them  with a few solar masses of material and
          indications  of  CO  depletion at high density. One of the core
          groups  is  actively  forming  stars,  while  the  other  seems
          starless.   There  is  evidence  for  at  least  three  bipolar
          molecular  outflows  in  the  region,  two  of  them powered by
          previously  identified  Class 0 sources, while the other one is
          powered  by  a  still  not  well  characterized  low-luminosity
          object.  The  ongoing  star  formation  activity is producing a
          small  stellar subgroup in the cluster. Using the observed core
          characteristics  and  the star formation rate in the cluster we
          propose  that  that  similar episodes of stellar birth may have
          produced the subclustering observed in the halo of IC 348.

          Title: On the formation of dwarf galaxies and stellar halos
          Authors: J.I. Read, A.P. Pontzen, M. Viel
          Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Using  analytic  arguments  and a suite of very high resolution
          (10^3Msun    per    particle)    cosmological   hydro-dynamical
          simulations,  we argue that high redshift, z ~ 10, M ~ 10^8Msun
          halos,  form  the  smallest `baryonic building block' (BBB) for
          galaxy  formation.  These  halos  are  just  massive  enough to
          efficiently  form stars through atomic line cooling and to hold
          onto  their  gas  in  the  presence  of  supernovae  winds  and
          reionisation. These combined effects, in particular that of the
          supernovae  feedback,  create a sharp transition: over the mass
          range  3-10x10^7Msun,  the  BBBs drop two orders ofmagnitude in
          stellar  mass.  Below  ~2x10^7Msun,  galaxies will be dark with
          almost  no  stars  and no gas. Above this scale is the smallest
          unit of galaxy formation: the BBB.
          A  small  fraction  (~100)  of these gas rich BBBs fall in to a
          galaxy  the size of the Milky Way. Ten percent of these survive
          to  become the observed LG dwarf galaxies at the present epoch.
          Those  in-falling  halos  on  benign orbits which keep them far
          away from the Milky Way or Andromeda manage to retain their gas
          and  slowly  form  stars  -  these  become  the  smallest dwarf
          irregular galax ies; those on more severe orbits lose their gas
          faster   than   they  can  form  stars  and  become  the  dwarf
          spheroidals. The remaining 90% of the BBBs will be accreted. We
          show  that  this  gives  a  metallicity  and total stellar mass
          consistent with the Milky Way old stellar halo (abridged).

          milliarcsecond-size  radio  sources  near  methanol  masers  in
          high-mass  star-forming  regions. Such sources are required for
          Very    Long    Baseline    Interferometry    phase-referencing
          observations.  We conducted pointed observations of 234 compact
          sources  found  in  the  NVSS  survey  and find 92 sources with
          unresolved  components  and synchrotron spectral indexes. These
          sources are likely the cores of AGNs and, thus, good candidates
          for astrometric calibrators.

          Comments: Review chapter in "Protostars and Planets V"
          Over  the past 10 years abundant evidence has emerged that many
          (if   not   all)  stars  are  born  with  circumstellar  disks.
          Understanding the evolution of post-accretion disks can provide
          strong   constraints   on  theories  of  planet  formation  and
          evolution.   In  this  review,  we  focus  on  developments  in
          understanding:  a) the evolution of the gas and dust content of
          circumstellar    disks    based   on   observational   surveys,
          highlighting  new  results from the Spitzer Space Telescope; b)
          the  physical  properties  of  specific  systems  as a means to
          interpret  the  survey  results;  c) theoretical models used to
          explain  the  observations; d) an evolutionary model of our own
          solar system for comparison to the observations of debris disks
          around  other  stars;  and  e) how these new results impact our
          assessment  of  whether systems like our own are common or rare
          compared  to  the  ensemble  of normal stars in the disk of the
          Milky Way.

          We  present new observations of 470 stars using the Fibre Large
          Array  Multi-Element Spectrograph (FLAMES) instrument in fields
          centered  on  the  clusters  NGC  330  and NGC 346 in the Small
          Magellanic  Cloud (SMC), and NGC 2004 and the N11 region in the
          Large  Magellanic Cloud (LMC). A further 14 stars were observed
          in  the N11 and NGC 330 fields using the Ultraviolet and Visual
          Echelle  Spectrograph (UVES) for a separate programme. Spectral
          classifications  and  stellar  radial  velocities are given for
          each  target, with careful attention to checks for binarity. In
          particular  we  have investigated previously unexplored regions
          around  the  central  LH9/LH10  complex of N11, finding ~25 new
          O-type   stars  from  our  spectroscopy.  We  have  observed  a
          relatively large number of Be-type stars that display permitted
          Fe  II  emission  lines. These are primarily not in the cluster
          cores and appear to be associated with classical Be-type stars,
          rather  than  pre main-sequence objects. The presence of the Fe
          II  emission, as compared to the equivalent width of H$\alpha$,
          is  not  obviously  dependent  on  metallicity.  We  have  also
          explored the relative fraction of Be- to normal B-type stars in
          the  field-regions  near  to  NGC  330 and NGC 2004, finding no
          strong  evidence  of  a trend with metallicity when compared to
          Galactic results. A consequence of service observations is that
          we have reasonable time-sampling in three of our FLAMES fields.
          We  find  lower  limits  to the binary fraction of O- and early
          B-type  stars  of 23 to 36%. One of our targets (NGC346-013) is
          especially  interesting with a massive, apparently hotter, less
          luminous secondary component.

          We  present short \chandra observations of twelve bright (i<18)
          z_em~1.5  quasars  from  the Sloan Digital Sky Survey chosen to
          have  significantly  redder optical colors than most quasars at
          the  same redshift. Of the five quasars with optical properties
          most  consistent  with  dust  reddening at the quasar redshift,
          four  show  indirect  evidence  of  moderate  X-ray  absorption
          (inferred  N_H~10^22 cm^-2) with a dust-to-gas ratio <1% of the
          SMC  value.  The  remaining  seven objects show no evidence for
          even moderate intrinsic X-ray absorption. Thus, while optically
          red  quasars  are  marginally more likely to show signatures of
          X-ray  absorption  than  optically selected quasars with normal
          colors,  dust-reddened type 1 AGN (as opposed to fully obscured
          type  2  AGN)  are  unlikely to contribute significantly to the
          remaining  unresolved  hard  X-ray  background.  The red quasar
          population  includes objects with intrinsically red continua as
          well  as  objects  with dust-reddened continua. Improved sample
          selection  is  thus  needed  to  increase  our understanding of
          either  subpopulation. To identify dust-reddened quasars likely
          to exhibit X-ray absorption, some measure of spectral curvature
          is preferable to simple cuts in observed or relative broad-band
          colors.

          Title: Inverse Compton e-p pair cascade model for the gamma-ray
          production in massive binary LSI +61^o 303
          Authors: W. Bednarek
          Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  apply  an  inverse  Compton  $e^\pm$ pair cascade model for
          $\gamma$-ray  production in massive binary system LSI +61$^{\rm
          o}$  303 assuming that electrons are accelerated already inside
          the  inner  part  of  the  jet  launched by the compact object.
          $\gamma$-ray  spectra,  affected  by  the  cascade process, and
          lower  energy  spectra,  from  the  synchrotron  cooling of the
          highest  energy  electrons  in  the  jet,  are  calculated as a
          function  of  the  phase  of  this  binary system. $\gamma$-ray
          spectra  expected  in such model have different shape than that
          ones  produced  by  electrons  in the jet directly to observer.
          Moreover,  the  model  predicts  clear anti-correlation between
          $\gamma$-ray  fluxes in the GeV (1-10 GeV) and TeV ($>200$ GeV)
          energy  ranges  with  the peak of the TeV emission at the phase
          $\sim$0.5  (the  peak  half  width  ranges  between  the phases
          $\sim$0.4-0.9 for the inclination of the binary system equal to
          $60^{\rm  o}$,  and  $\sim$0.4-0.1  for $30^{\rm o}$). The fine
          features  of  TeV  $\gamma$-ray  emission  (fluxes and spectral
          shapes)  as  a  function  of the phase of the binary system are
          consistent  with  recent  observations  reported  by  the MAGIC
          collaboration.  Future  simultaneous  observations  in  the GeV
          energies  (by  the  GLAST  and AGILE telescopes) and in the TeV
          energies  (by  the  MAGIC  and  VERITAS telescopes) should test
          other   predictions  of  the  considered  model  supporting  or
          disproving the hypothersis of acceleration of electrons already
          in the inner part of the microquasar jets.

          Intergalactic Medium. I: Monte Carlo Simulations
          Authors:  Matthew Pieri, Hugo Martel, Cedric Grenon (Universite
          Laval)
          Comments: 29 pages, 9 figures (2 color). Submitted to ApJ
          We  have designed an analytical model to describe the evolution
          of  anisotropic galactic outflows. With this we investigate the
          impact  of  varying  opening  angle on galaxy formation and the
          evolution of the IGM. We have implemented this model in a Monte
          Carlo  algorithm to simulate galaxy formation and outflows in a
          cosmological  context.  Using this algorithm, we have simulated
          the  evolution  of a comoving volume of size [12h^(-1)Mpc]^3 in
          the  LCDM  universe.  Starting from a Gaussian density field at
          redshift z=24, we follow the formation of ~20,000 galaxies, and
          simulate the galactic outflows produced by these galaxies. When
          these outflows collide with density peaks, 80% of the time this
          results  in  ram pressure stripping of the gas inside the peak,
          preventing  the  formation  of  a  galaxy. Anisotropic outflows
          follow   the   path   of  least  resistance,  and  thus  travel
          preferentially into low-density regions, away from cosmological
          structures  (filaments  and pancakes) where galaxies form. As a
          result,  the  number  of  collisions is reduced, leading to the
          formation  of a larger number of galaxies. Anisotropic outflows
          can  significantly  enrich  low-density  systems  with  metals.
          Conversely, the cross-pollution in metals of objects located in
          a   common   cosmological   structure,   like  a  filament,  is
          significantly  reduced.  Highly anisotropic outflows can travel
          across   cosmological  voids,  and  deposit  metals  in  other,
          unrelated cosmological structures.

          Title:  Temporal  Evolution  of  Pair Attenuation Signatures in
          Gamma-Ray Burst Spectra
          Authors: Matthew G. Baring
          Comments:  16  pages,  5 embedded figures, apjgalley format, To

          issue
          The  spectra  obtained  above  100  MeV by the EGRET experiment
          aboard  the  Compton  Gamma-Ray  Observatory  for  a handful of
          gamma-ray  bursts  has  given  no  indication  of  any spectral
          attenuation  that  might preclude detection of bursts at higher
          energies.   With   the  discovery  of  optical  afterglows  and
          counterparts  to  bursts  in  the  last few years, enabling the
          determination of significant redshifts for these sources, it is
          anticipated  that  profound  spectral attenuation will arise in
          the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) energy band of
          30 MeV-300 GeV for many if not most bursts. This paper explores
          time-dependent  expectations  for  burst spectral properties in
          the EGRET/GLAST band, focusing on how attenuation of photons by
          pair  creation  internal  to  the  source generates distinctive
          spectral  signatures.  The  energy  of  spectral breaks and the
          associated  spectral  indices provide valuable information that
          constrains  the  bulk  Lorentz  factor  of the GRB outflow at a
          given  time.  Moreover,  the distinct temporal behavior that is
          present  for  internal attenuation is easily distinguished from
          extrinsic  absorption  due  to  intervening  cosmic  background
          fields.  These  characteristics  define  palpable observational
          goals  for both spaced-based hard gamma-ray experiments such as
          GLAST,  and  ground-based  Cherenkov  telescopes,  and strongly
          impact the observability of bursts above 300 MeV.

          We  combine  bright  XMM data with the Chandra Deep Field South
          observations  in order to explore the behavior of the intrinsic
          AGN  absorption,  as  a function of redshift and luminosity.Our
          sample  consists  of  359  sources selected in the hard 2-8 keV
          band,  spanning the flux range 6\times10^{-16}-$3\times10^{-13}
          erg s^-1 cm^-2 with a high rate of spectroscopic or photometric
          redshift completeness (100 and 85 per cent respectively for the
          Chandra and XMM data. We derive the column density values using
          X-ray  spectral fits. We find that the fraction of obscured AGN
          falls  with  increasing  luminosity  in agreement with previous
          findings.  The  fraction  of  obscured  AGN  shows  an apparent
          increase  at  high  redshifts (z>2). Simulations show that this
          effect can be most probably attributed to the fact that at high
          redshifts the column densities are overestimated.

          We  study  the  role  of massive perturbers (MPs) in deflecting
          stars  and  binaries  to  almost radial (``loss-cone'') orbits,
          where  they  pass  near  the  central massive black hole (MBH),
          interact  with  it at periapse q, and are ultimately destroyed.
          MPs  dominate  dynamical  relaxation  when the ratio of the 2nd
          moments   of  the  MP  and  star  mass  distributions,  mu_2  =
          (N_p*M_p^2)/(N_star*M_star^2),  satisfies mu_2>>1. The observed
          MPs  in  the  nucleus of the Galaxy (giant molecular clouds and
          stellar   clusters),   and  plausibly  in  late  type  galaxies
          generally,   have   10^2<=mu_2<=10^5.   MPs  thus  shorten  the
          relaxation timescale by 10^2-10^5 relative to 2-body relaxation
          by  stars  alone. We show this increases by 10-1000 the rate of
          large-q interactions with the MBH, where loss-cone refilling by
          stellar   2-body  relaxation  is  inefficient.  We  extend  the
          Fokker-Planck  loss-cone formalism to approximately account for
          relaxation by rare encounters with MPs. We show that binary-MBH
          exchanges  driven  by  MPs  may explain the origin of the young
          main  sequence B stars that are observed very near the Galactic
          MBH,  and may increase by orders of magnitude the ejection rate
          of  hyper-velocity  stars. We suggest that MP-driven relaxation
          plays  an  important role in the capture of stars on very tight
          orbits around the MBH, leading to their tidal orbital decay and
          disruption or to inspiral through the emission of gravitational
          waves  from  zero-eccentricity  orbits.  We show that loss-cone
          refilling  by  MPs leads to rapid orbital decay and coalescence
          of binary MBHs, thereby solving the stalling problem.

          Title:  Dust  in  starburst  nuclei  and ULIRGs: SED models for
          observers
          Authors: Ralf Siebenmorgen (ESO), Endrik Kruegel (MPIfR)
          Comments: 10pages, 6 figures, submitted to A&A
          We   provide   a  library  of  some  7000  SEDs  (available  at
          www.eso.org/~rsiebenm)  for  the  nuclei of starburst and ultra
          luminous  galaxies.  Its purpose is to quickly obtain estimates
          of  the  basic parameters, such as luminosity, size and dust or
          gas mass and to predict the flux at yet unobserved wavelengths.
          The  procedure  is simple and consists of finding an element in
          the  library  that matches the observations. The objects may be
          in the local universe or at high z.
          We calculate the radiative transfer in spherical symmetry for a
          stellar  cluster  permeated  by  an  interstellar  medium  with
          standard  (Milky Way) dust properties. The cluster contains two
          stellar  populations: old bulge stars and OB stars. Because the
          latter  are  young, a certain fraction of them will be embedded
          in compact clouds which constitute hot spots that determine the
          MIR fluxes.
          We  present  SEDs  for a broad range of luminosities, sizes and
          obscurations.   We  argue  that  the  assumption  of  spherical
          symmetry  and  the  neglect of clumpiness of the medium are not
          severe  shortcomings  for  computing  the  dust  emission.  The
          validity of the approach is demonstrated by matching the SED of
          seven  of  the best studied galaxies, including M82 and Arp220,
          by  library  elements. In all cases, one finds an element which
          fits  the  observed  SED very well, and the parameters defining
          the  element  are  in  full accord with what is known about the
          galaxy  from  detailed  studies.  We also compare our method of
          computing   SEDs   with   other  techniques  described  in  the
          literature.

          Title: Mira B Rejuvenated
          Authors: Brian E. Wood, Margarita Karovska
          Comments: 12 pages, 3 figures, AASTEX v5.0, accepted by ApJ
          Recent  ultraviolet  spectra  from  the  Hubble Space Telescope
          (HST)   and   Far  Ultraviolet  Spectroscopic  Explorer  (FUSE)
          satellites  demonstrate  that  UV  line  and  continuum  fluxes
          observed  from  Mira  B  are increasing back towards the levels
          that   the   International  Ultraviolet  Explorer  observed  in
          1979-1980  and 1990-1995, after having been found in a very low
          state  by  HST  and  FUSE  in  1999-2001.  The  UV  emission is
          associated with accretion of material onto Mira B from Mira A's
          massive   wind,   so  the  variability  is  presumably  due  to
          variations in accretion rate. From wind absorption features, we
          estimate   a  Mira  B  mass  loss  rate  of  2.5e-12  M_sun/yr,
          indicating  that  Mira B's wind has increased in strength along
          with  the  accretion rate. The UV variability may be associated
          with  a  previously  reported  14-year  periodicity in Mira B's
          optical emission.

          Title:  Properties  of  Galaxy  Groups  in  the  SDSS: II.- AGN
          Feedback and Star Formation Truncation
          Authors:  Simone  M.  Weinmann,  Frank C. van den Bosch, Xiaohu

          Comments: 16 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Successfully reproducing the galaxy luminosity function and the
          bimodality in the galaxy distribution requires a mechanism that
          can  truncate  star formation in massive haloes. Current models
          of  galaxy  formation  consider two such truncation mechanisms:
          strangulation,  which  acts  on  satellite  galaxies,  and  AGN
          feedback,  which  predominantly  affects  central galaxies. The
          efficiencies  of  these  processes  set  the  blue  fraction of
          galaxies  as  function  of  galaxy luminosity and halo mass. In
          this  paper  we use a galaxy group catalogue extracted from the
          Sloan  Digital  Sky Survey (SDSS) to determine these fractions.
          To  demonstrate the potential power of this data as a benchmark
          for  galaxy  formation  models,  we  compare the results to the
          semi-analytical  model  for  galaxy  formation of Croton et al.
          (2006).   Although   this  model  accurately  fits  the  global
          statistics  of  the  galaxy population, as well as the shape of
          the  conditional  luminosity  function,  there  are significant
          discrepancies  when the blue fraction of galaxies as a function
          of mass and luminosity is compared between the observations and
          the model. In particular, the model predicts (i) too many faint
          satellite  galaxies  in massive haloes, (ii) a blue fraction of
          satellites  that  is much too low, and (iii) a blue fraction of
          centrals  that  is  too  high  and  with an inverted luminosity
          dependence.   In   the   same   order,   we  argue  that  these
          discrepancies  owe to (i) the neglect of tidal stripping in the
          semi-analytical  model,  (ii)  the  oversimplified treatment of
          strangulation,  and  (iii) improper modeling of dust extinction
          and/or  AGN feedback. The data presented here will prove useful
          to  test and calibrate future models of galaxy formation and in
          particular  to  discriminate  between  various  models  for AGN
          feedback and other star formation truncation mechanisms.

          Title:  The  Connection  Between  Barstrength and Circumnuclear
          Dust Structure
          Authors: Molly Peeples, Paul Martini (Ohio State)
          Comments:  Submitted  to ApJ. High resolution version available
          at  this  http URL Individual high resolution figures available
          at this http URL
          We  present  a  comparison  of barstrength Qb and circumnuclear
          dust  morphology  for  75  galaxies in order to investigate how
          bars affect the centers of galaxies. We trace the circumnuclear
          dust  morphology  and  amount  of dust structure with structure
          maps  generated  from visible-wavelength HST data, finding that
          tightly  wound  nuclear  dust  spirals  are  primarily found in
          weakly   barred   galaxies.   While  strongly  barred  galaxies
          sometimes  exhibit grand design structure within the central 10
          percent  of D25, this structure rarely extends to within ~10 pc
          of  the  galaxy  nucleus.  In  some galaxies, these spiral arms
          terminate  at  a  circumnuclear  starburst  ring. Galaxies with
          circumnuclear  rings  are  generally  more strongly barred than
          galaxies  lacking rings. Within these rings, the dust structure
          is  fairly  smooth  and  usually in the form of a loosely wound
          spiral.   These   data   demonstrate   that   multiple  nuclear
          morphologies are possible in the most strongly barred galaxies:
          chaotic  central  dust  structure  inconsistent with a coherent
          nuclear  spiral,  a  grand  design  spiral that loses coherence
          before reaching the nucleus, or a grand design spiral that ends
          in  a  circumnuclear ring. These observations may indicate that
          not  all  strong bars are equally efficient at fueling material
          to  the centers of their host galaxies. Finally, we investigate
          the  longstanding hypothesis that SB(s) galaxies have weak bars
          and SB(r) galaxies have strong bars, finding the opposite to be
          the  case:  namely, SB(r) galaxies are less strongly barred and
          have  less dust structure than SB(s) galaxies. In general, more
          strongly  barred  galaxies  tend  to  have  higher nuclear dust
          contrast.

          Title: Violent Stellar Merger Model for Transient Events
          Authors:   Noam   Soker  (Technion,  Israel),  Romuald  Tylenda
          (N.Copernicus Ast. Center, Poland)
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS
          We derive the constraints on the mass ratio for a binary system
          to  merge  in  a violent process. We find that the secondary to
          primary  stellar  mass  ratio  should  be  ~0.003 < (M_2/M_1) <
          ~0.15.  A  more  massive  secondary  star will keep the primary
          stellar  envelope  in  synchronized  rotation  with the orbital
          motion  until merger occurs. This implies a very small relative
          velocity  between  the  secondary  star and the primary stellar
          envelope at the moment of merger, and therefore very weak shock
          waves,  and low flash luminosity. A too low mass secondary will
          release  small amount of energy, and will expel small amount of
          mass,  which  is  unable  to  form an inflated envelope. It can
          however produce a quite luminous but short flash when colliding
          with a low mass main sequence star.
          Violent and luminous mergers, which we term mergebursts, can be
          observed   as  V838  Monocerotis  type  events,  where  a  star
          undergoes  a  fast  brightening  lasting days to months, with a
          peak luminosity of up to ~10^6 Lo followed by a slow decline at
          very low effective temperatures.

          Title:  HH135/HH136  -  a  luminous  H$_2$  outflow  towards  a
          high-mass protostar
          Authors: Roland Gredel
          Near-infrared  observations  towards  the  luminous IRAS source
          IRAS11101-5928   and   the   associated   Herbig-Haro   objects
          HH135/HH136 are presented. The observations reveal the presence
          of  a  well-collimated, parsec-sized H$_2$ outflow with a total
          H$_2$ luminosity of about $2L_\odot$. The bulk of the molecular
          gas is characterized by a ro-vibrational excitation temperature
          of $2000\pm200$ K. A small fraction (0.3%) of the molecular gas
          is  very  hot,  with excitation temperatures around 5500 K. The
          molecular  emission  is associated with strong [FeII] emission.
          The  H$_2$  and  [FeII]  emission  characteristics indicate the
          presence   of   fast,   dissociative   J-shocks  at  speeds  of
          $v_\mathrm{s}  \approx$  100 km s$^{-1}$. Electron densities of
          $n_\mathrm{e}$  =  3500-4000  cm$^{-3}$  are  inferred from the
          [FeII]  line  ratios.  The large H$_2$ luminosity combined with
          the  very  large  source luminosity suggests that the high-mass
          protostar that powers the HH135/HH136 flow forms via accretion,
          but  with  a significantly increased accretion rate compared to
          that of low-mass protostars.

          Galactic Center Survey
          Authors: J. F. Wu, S. N. Zhang, F. J. Lu, Y. K. Jin
          Comments:  14  pages, 8 figures, accepted by Chinese Journal of
          Astronomy & Astrophysics
          {\it  Chandra} Galactic Center Survey detected $\sim 800$ X-ray
          point-like  sources  in  the $2^{\circ} \times 0.8^{\circ}$ sky
          region  around the Galactic Center. In this paper, we study the
          spatial and luminosity distributions of these sources according
          to  their spectral properties. Fourteen bright sources detected
          are used to fit jointly an absorbed power-law model, from which
          the  power-law  photon  index  is  determined  to be $\sim$2.5.
          Assuming  that  all other sources have the same power-law form,
          the relation between hardness ratio and HI column density $N_H$
          is  used  to  estimate  the $N_H$ values for all sources. Monte
          Carlo  simulations  show  that  these  sources  are more likely
          concentrated   in  the  Galactic  center  region,  rather  than
          distributed throughout the Galactic disk. We also find that the
          luminosities  of  the  sources  are  positively correlated with
          their  HI  column  densities, i.e. a more luminous source has a
          higher  HI  column density. From this relation, we suggest that
          the  X-ray  luminosity  comes  from  the interaction between an
          isolated old neutron star and interstellar medium (mainly dense
          molecular  clouds).  Using  the standard Bondi accretion theory
          and  the  statistical  information  of  molecular clouds in the
          Galactic  center,  we  confirm  this  positive  correlation and
          calculate  the  luminosity  range  in  this  scenario, which is
          consistent  with  the  observation  ($10^{32}\sim 10^{35}$ ergs
          s$^{-1}$).

          Title:  X-ray  temperature  spectroscopy  of  simulated cooling
          clusters
          Authors: R. Valdarnini
          Comments:   46  pages,  10  figures,  3  tables,  accepted  for
          publication in NewA
          Results   from   a   large   sample   of  hydrodynamical/N-body
          simulations  of galaxy clusters in a LCDM cosmology are used to
          simulate  cluster  X-ray  observations as expected from Chandra
          observations.   The  physical  modeling  of  the  gas  includes
          radiative  cooling,  star  formation, energy feedback and metal
          enrichment.  The  biasing of spectral temperatures with respect
          to  mass-weighted temperatures is found to be influenced by two
          independent  processes. The first scale dependency is absent in
          adiabatic  runs  and  is  due  to  cooling, whose efficiency to
          transform  cold  gas into stars is higher for cool clusters and
          this in turn implies a strong dependency of the spectral versus
          mass-weighted  temperature  relation  on  the cluster mass. The
          second dependency is due to photon emission because of cool gas
          which is accreted during merging events and biases the spectral
          fits.  These events have been quantified according to the power
          ratio method and a robust correlation is found to exist between
          the  spectral  bias and the amount of cluster substructure. The
          shape  of  the  simulated temperature profiles is not universal
          and  it is steeper at the cluster center for cool clusters than
          for  the  massive ones. The profiles are in good agreement with
          data  in  the radial range between $\sim 0.1 r_{vir}$ and $\sim
          0.4  r_{vir}$;  at  small  radii ($r< 0.1 r_{vir}$) the cooling
          runs  fail to reproduce the shape of the observed profiles. The
          fit  is  improved  if  one  considers  a  hierarchical  merging
          scenario  in which cluster cores can accrete cooler gas through
          merging  with  cluster  subclumps,  though  the  shape  of  the
          temperature  profiles  is modified in a significant way only in
          the  regime  where  the  mass  of  the  substructure is a large
          fraction of the cluster mass.

          In  this  paper we present INTEGRAL observations of 7 AGNs: two
          newly  discovered  type  1  Seyferts,  IGR  J18027-1455 and IGR
          J21247+5058, and five well known Seyferts, NGC 6814 (type 1.5),
          Cyg A (Type 2), MCG-05-23-16 (type 2), ESO 103-G035 (type2) and
          GRS1734-292.  For  IGR  J18027-1455  and  IGR  J21247+5058 only
          INTEGRAL/IBIS  data were available, while broadband spectra are
          presented  and  discussed for the remaining 5 sources for which
          either  BeppoSAX  or  ASCA  data  were used in conjunction with
          INTEGRAL  measurements.  In  the  cases  of  NGC  6814  and GRS
          1734-292,  data taken in different periods indicate variability
          in  the  flux: in the case of NGC 6814 by a factor of 16 over a
          period  of about 10 years. Although limited in size, our sample
          can  be  used  to  investigate  the parameter space of both the
          photon  index and cut-off energy. The mean photon index is 1.8,
          while  the cut-off energy ranges from 30-50 keV to greater than
          200  keV;  in the particular case of MCG-05-23-16, ESO 103-G035
          and  GRS  1734-292 the cut-off energy is well constrained at or
          below  100  keV.  We have also tested an enlarged sample, which
          includes  INTEGRAL data of 3 more AGNs, against the correlation
          found  by  a number of authors between the photon index and the
          cut-off  energy  but  have  found  no  evidence  for a relation
          between these two parameters. Our analysis indicates that there
          is  a diversity in cut-off energies in the primary continuum of
          Seyfert galaxies.

          Title: Galactic Nuclei and Jets in Wave Gravity
          Authors: Kris Krogh
          Comments: 14 pages, LaTeX2e, no figures
          "Wave  gravity"  refers  to a quantum-mechanical gravity theory
          introduced  in two previous papers [1,2]. Although based on the
          optics  of  de  Broglie  waves instead of curved space-time, it
          agrees  with  the  standard  tests of general relativity. As in
          that  theory,  galactic  nuclei  are dark objects where gravity
          prevents  the  escape of most radiation. In this case, collapse
          is  counteracted  by  rising  internal  pressure and black hole
          singularities don't occur. Unlike black holes, these nuclei can
          have  internal  magnetic  fields,  and  high-energy  plasma can
          escape  along  magnetic  field  lines  closely aligned with the
          gravitational field direction. This allows a different model of
          jets  from active galactic nuclei, where jets can arise without

          Title:   The  Star  Formation  History  and  Evolution  of  the
          Circumnuclear Region of M100

          Star-forming  nuclear  rings  in  barred galaxies are common in
          nearby  spirals, and their detailed study can lead to important
          insights  into the evolution of galaxies, their bars, and their
          central   regions.  We  present  integral  field  spectroscopic
          observations  obtained with SAURON of the bar and circumnuclear
          region  of  the  barred spiral galaxy M100, complemented by new
          {\it  Spitzer  Space  Telescope}  imaging of the region. We use
          these  data  to  enhance  our  understanding  of the formation,
          evolution,  and  current  properties  of  the  bar and ring. We
          derive  the  kinematics  of  the gas and the stars and quantify
          circular  and  non-circular motions using kinemetry. We analyse
          this  in  conjunction with the optical and infrared morphology,
          and  our previously published dynamical modelling. By comparing
          line  indices  to  simple stellar population models we estimate
          the  ages  and metallicities of the stellar populations present
          within  the  region,  especially  in  and  around the ring. Our
          kinematic  and morphological results all confirm the picture in
          which  the  nuclear ring in M100, considered typical, is fed by
          gas  flowing  in  from the disc under the action of the bar, is
          slowed  down  near  a pair of resonances, and forms significant
          amounts of massive stars. Detailed stellar population modelling
          shows  how  the  underlying  bulge and disc were put in place a
          number  of  Gyr ago, and that the nuclear ring has been forming
          stars since about 500~Myr ago in a stable succession of bursts.
          This  confirms  that  nuclear rings of this kind can form under
          the  influence  of  a  resonant  structure set up by a bar, and
          proves  that  they  are stable features of a galaxy rather than
          one-off starburst events.

          Title: A theory of Cosmic Rays
          Authors: Arnon Dar, Alvaro De Rujula
          Comments: 40 pages, 34 figures
          We  present  a theory of non-solar cosmic rays (CRs) based on a
          single  type of CR source at all energies. The total luminosity
          of the Galaxy, the broken power-law spectra with their observed
          slopes,  the  position of the `knee(s)' and `ankle', and the CR
          composition  and its variation with energy are all predicted in
          terms  of  very  simple  and completely `standard' physics. The
          source  of  CRs  is  extremely  `economical':  it  has only one
          parameter  to be fitted to the ensemble of all of the mentioned
          data.  All  other  inputs are `priors', that is, theoretical or
          observational   items   of   information   independent  of  the
          properties  of  the  source  of CRs, and chosen to lie in their
          pre-established  ranges.  The theory is part of a `unified view
          of  high-energy astrophysics' --based on the `Cannonball' model
          of the relativistic ejecta of accreting black holes and neutron
          stars.  If  correct,  this model is only lacking a satisfactory
          theoretical  understanding  of  the  `cannon'  that  emits  the
          cannonballs in catastrophic processes of accretion.

          R.L.M. Corradi and U. Munari
          The  planets  capture  model  for  the  eruption of V838 Mon is
          discussed. We used three methods to estimate the location where
          the  planets were consumed. There is a nice consistency for the
          results  of  the  three different methods, and we find that the
          typical stopping / slowing radius for the planets is about 1Ro.
          The  three  peaks  in  the  optical light curve of V838 Mon are
          either   explained  by  the  swallowing  of  three  planets  at
          different  radii  or by three steps in the slowing down process
          of a single planet. We discuss the other models offered for the
          outburst of V838 Mon, and conclude that the binary merger model
          and  the planet/s scenario seem to be the most promising. These
          two  models have several similarities, and the main differences
          are  the  stellar  evolutionary  stage,  and  the  mass  of the
          accreted  material. We show that the energy emitted in the V838
          Mon event is consistent with the planets scenario. We suggest a
          few  explanations  for the trigger for the outburst and for the
          double  structure  of  the  optical peaks in the light curve of
          V838 Mon.

          We report the detection of 3 additional Wolf-Rayet stars in the
          young cluster Westerlund 1. They were selected as emission-line
          star  candidates  based  on 1 micron narrow-band imaging of the
          cluster  carried out at OPD/LNA (Brazil), and then confirmed as
          Wolf-Rayet  stars by K-band spectroscopy performed at the 4.1 m
          SOAR  telescope  (Chile).  Together  with  previous works, this
          increases  the  population  of Wolf-Rayet stars detected in the
          cluster  to 22 members. Moreover, it is presented for the first
          time  a  K-band  spectrum  of  the luminous blue variable W243,
          which  apparently  implies  in  a  higher temperature than that
          derived  from  optical spectra taken in 2003. The WC9 star WR-F
          was  also  observed, showing clear evidence of dust emission in
          the K-band.

          Title:  The  Recurrent Eclipse of an Unusual Pre--Main-Sequence
          Star in IC 348
          Authors: S. Nordhagen, W. Herbst, E. C. Williams, E. Semkov
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ (Letters)
          The   recurrence  of  a  previously  documented  eclipse  of  a
          solar-like  pre--main-sequence star in the young cluster IC 348
          has  been observed. The recurrence interval is 4.7 $\pm 0.1$ yr
          and  portions  of  4 cycles have now been seen. The duration of
          each  eclipse  is at least 3.5 years, or $\sim 75$% of a cycle,
          verifying  that  this is not an eclipse by a stellar companion.
          The  light  curve  is  generally  symmetric  and  approximately
          flat-bottomed.  Brightness  at  maximum  and  minimum have been
          rather  stable  over  the  years  but  the  light  curve is not
          perfectly  repetitive  or  smooth and small variations exist at
          all  phases.  We  confirm that the star is redder when fainter.
          Models  are  discussed  and it is proposed that this could be a
          system  similar  to KH 15D in NGC 2264. Specifically, it may be
          an  eccentric  binary  in  which  a portion of the orbit of one
          member  is  currently  occulted  during some binary phases by a
          circumbinary  disk.  The  star deserves sustained observational
          attention  for  what  it  may  reveal  about  the circumstellar
          environment of low-mass stars of planet-forming age.

          Title: Standing Accretion Shocks in the Supernova Core: Effects
          of Convection and Realistic EOS
          Authors: Tatsuya Yamasaki, Shoichi Yamada
          Comments: accepted by ApJ, 20 pages, 8 figures
          We  investigated  the  structure  of  the spherically symmetric
          accretion  flows  through  the  standing  shock  wave  onto the
          proto-neutron   star   in   the   post-bounce   phase   of  the
          collapse-driven supernova. We assume that the accretion flow is
          in  a  steady  state  controlled by the neutrino luminosity and
          mass accretion rate that are kept constant. We obtain solutions
          of  the  steady  Euler  equations  for a wide range of neutrino
          luminosity  and  mass accretion rate. We employ a realistic EOS
          and  neutrino-heating  rates.  More  importantly,  we take into
          account  the  effect of convection phenomenologically. For each
          mass  accretion rate, we find the critical neutrino luminosity,
          above  which  there  exists  no steady solution. These critical
          points  are supposed to mark the onset of the shock revival. As
          the  neutrino  luminosity  increases for a given mass accretion
          rate,  there  appears  a  convectively  unstable region at some
          point  before  the  critical  value  is reached. We introduce a
          phenomenological energy flux by convection so that the negative
          entropy  gradient  should  be  canceled  out.  We find that the
          convection    lowers    the    critical   neutrino   luminosity
          substantially. We also consider the effect of the self-gravity.
          It  is  found  that the self-gravity is important only when the
          neutrino  luminosity is high. The critical luminosity, however,
          is  little  affected  if  the energy transport by convection is
          taken into account.

          companion  (which  itself  is  a  binary  in  V1084  Sco). Five

          Title:  The  hierarchical  formation  of  the brightest cluster
          galaxies
          Authors: Gabriella De Lucia, Jeremy Blaizot
          Comments: 13 pages, 17 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  use  semi-analytic  techniques  to  study the formation and
          evolution  of  brightest  cluster  galaxies (BCGs). We show the
          extreme  hierarchical  nature  of these objects and discuss the
          limits  of  simple  ways to capture their evolution. In a model
          where  cooling  flows  are  suppressed  at  late  times  by AGN
          activity,  the stars of BCGs are formed very early (50 per cent
          at  z~5,  80  per  cent at z~3) and in many small galaxies. The
          high  star  formation  rates  in  these  high-z progenitors are
          fuelled  by  rapid cooling, not by merger-triggered starbursts.
          We  find that model BCGs assemble surprisingly late: half their
          final  mass  is  typically  locked-up  in a single galaxy after
          z~0.5.  Because  most  of  the galaxies accreted onto BCGs have
          little  gas content and red colours, late mergers do not change
          the  apparent  age  of BCGs. It is this accumulation of a large
          number  of  old  stellar  populations  --  driven mainly by the
          merging  history  of the dark matter halo itself -- that yields
          the  observed homogeneity of BCG properties. In the second part
          of  the  paper,  we  discuss  the  evolution  of  BCGs  to high
          redshifts,  from both observational and theoretical viewpoints.
          We  show  that our model BCGs are in qualitative agreement with
          high-z  observations.  We discuss the hierarchical link between
          high-z  BCGs and their local counter-parts. We show that high-z
          BCGs  belong to the same population as the massive end of local
          BCG  progenitors,  although  they  are  not in general the same
          galaxies.  Similarly, high-z BCGs end-up as massive galaxies in
          the  local  Universe,  although  only  a  fraction  of them are
          actually BCGs of massive clusters.

          Gonzalez-Diaz
          Comments: 7 figures, 13 pages, RevTeX
          This  paper  contains  a  detailed  discussion  on  new  cosmic
          solutions describing the early and late evolution of a universe
          that  is  filled with a kind of dark energy that may or may not
          satisfy the energy conditions. The main distinctive property of
          the resulting space-times is that they make to appear twice the
          single   singular   events   predicted   by  the  corresponding
          quintessential  (phantom)  models in a manner which can be made
          symmetric  with respect to the origin of cosmic time. Thus, big
          bang and big rip singularity are shown to take place twice, one
          on  the  positive  branch of time and the other on the negative
          one.  We  have  also  considered dark energy and phantom energy
          accretion  onto  black  holes  and  wormholes in the context of
          these  new cosmic solutions. It is seen that the space-times of
          these  holes  would  then undergo swelling processes leading to
          big  trip  and  big hole events taking place on distinct epochs
          along   the  evolution  of  the  universe.  In  this  way,  the
          possibility is considered that the past and future be connected
          in a non-paradoxical manner in the universes described by means
          of the new symmetric solutions.

          galaxy  MRC1138-262: Evidence for efficient AGN feedback in the
          early Universe?
          Authors:  N.P.H.Nesvadba, M.D.Lehnert, F.Eisenhauer, A.Gilbert,
          M.Tecza, R.Abuter
          Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal
          To  explain  the  properties  of  the most massive low-redshift
          galaxies and the shape of their mass function, recent models of
          galaxy  evolution  include  strong  AGN  feedback to complement
          starburst-driven   feedback  in  massive  galaxies.  Using  the
          near-infrared integral-field spectrograph SPIFFI on the VLT, we
          searched for direct evidence for such a feedback in the optical
          emission  line  gas  around  the  z=2.16  powerful radio galaxy
          MRC1138-262,   likely   a  massive  galaxy  in  formation.  The
          kpc-scale  kinematics,  with  FWHMs  and relative velocities <=
          2400  km/s  and  nearly  spherical spatial distribution, do not
          resemble  large-scale  gravitational motion or starburst-driven
          winds.  Order-of-magnitude timescale and energy arguments favor
          the  AGN as the only plausible candidate to accelerate the gas,
          with  a  total  energy injection of a few x 10^60 ergs or more,
          necessary  to  power  the  outflow,  and  relatively  efficient
          coupling between radio jet and ISM. Observed outflow properties
          are  in  gross  agreement with the models, and suggest that AGN
          winds  might  have  a  similar, or perhaps larger, cosmological
          significance  than  starburst-driven  winds,  if MRC1138-262 is
          indeed  archetypal.  Moreover, the outflow has the potential to
          remove  significant  gas  fractions  (<= 50%) from a >L* galaxy
          within  a  few  10  to  100  Myrs,  fast enough to preserve the
          observed  [alpha/Fe]  overabundance  in massive galaxies at low
          redshift. Using simple arguments, it appears that feedback like
          that  observed  in  MRC1138-262  may  have sufficient energy to
          inhibit  material  from infalling into the dark matter halo and
          thus  regulate  galaxy growth as required in some recent models
          of hierarchical structure formation.

          Subj-class: Materials Science
          Electron diffraction, imaging, and energy loss provide evidence
          for   unlayered   graphene   sheets  in  the  core  of  certain
          interstellar  graphite  onions  (from  the meteorite Murchison)
          whose   isotopes   indicate  formation  in  the  atmosphere  of
          late-stage  asymptotic  giant  branch  stars  (like those which
          nucleo-synthesized  much  of  the earth's carbon). The data are
          compared   to   structural   models   loosely  associated  with
          atom-by-atom,   molecule-by-molecule,   and   dendritic-droplet
          solidification processes. In this context the observed density,
          diffraction peak-shapes, and edge-on sheet patterns, along with
          theoretical  limits  on  time  for  growth  in  the presence of
          outgoing  radiation  pressure,  suggest nucleation of hexagonal
          sheets  from  pentagons, perhaps from a supercooled melt. These
          results warrant a closer examination of specimen structure, the
          energetics of unlayered graphene nucleation, and processes such
          as jets in late star atmospheres.

          time-resolved  photometry  reveals  a source of UV flux that is
          much  larger than the underlying 9500K white dwarf, and that is
          highly modulated on the orbital period. The near UV and optical
          light  curves  can  be  modeled with a 20,000K spot but no spot
          model  can  explain both the large amplitude FUV variations and
          the  SED.  The  limitations  of  limb  darkening, cyclotron and
          magnetic  white dwarf models in explaining the observations are
          discussed.

          We  investigate  the  radio  emitting structures of radio-quiet
          active  galactic nuclei with an emphasis on radio-quiet quasars
          to  study  their connection to Seyfert galaxies. We present and
          analyse  high-sensitivity  VLA  radio  continuum  images  of 14
          radio-quiet  quasars  and six Seyfert galaxies. Many of the low
          redshift  radio-quiet quasars show radio structures that can be
          interpreted  as  jet-like outflows. However, the detection rate
          of  extended  radio  structures  on  arcsecond scales among our
          sample  decreases with increasing redshift and luminosity, most
          likely  due  to  a  lack of resolution. The morphologies of the
          detected  radio  emission  indicate  strong interactions of the
          jets  with  the  surrounding  medium. We also compare the radio
          data  of  seven  quasars  with  corresponding HST images of the
          [OIII]  emitting  narrow-line  region  (NLR).  We find that the
          scenario  of  interaction between the radio jet and the NLR gas
          is  confirmed  in  two  sources  by  structures  in the NLR gas
          distribution  as  previously  known  for  Seyfert galaxies. The
          extended   radio   structures   of   radio-quiet   quasars   at
          sub-arcsecond resolution are by no means different from that of
          Seyferts.    Among   the   luminosities   studied   here,   the
          morphological  features  found  are  similar  in  both types of
          objects   while  the  overall  size  of  the  radio  structures
          increases  with  luminosity.  This  supports  the picture where
          radio-quiet  quasars  are  the  scaled-up  versions  of Seyfert
          galaxies.  In  addition to known luminosity relations we find a
          correlation  of  the  NLR  size  and  the  radio size shared by
          quasars and Seyferts.

          Title:  An  XMM-Newton  Observation  of  the Massive Edge-on Sb
          Galaxy NGC 2613

          We  present an XMM-Newton observation of the massive edge-on Sb
          galaxy NGC 2613. We discover that this galaxy contains a deeply
          embedded  active  nucleus  with  a  0.3-10  keV  luminosity  of
          3.3x10^40  erg/s  and  a  line-of-sight  absorption  column  of
          1.2x10^23  cm^-2.  Within  the  25  mag/arcsec^2 optical B-band
          isophote  of the galaxy, we detect an additional 4 sources with
          an  accumulated  luminosity of 4.3x10^39 erg/s. The bulk of the
          unresolved  X-ray  emission spatially follows the near-infrared
          (NIR)  K-band  surface  brightness distribution; the luminosity
          ratio  L_X/L_K  ~ 8x10^-4 is consistent with that inferred from
          galactic  discrete  sources. This X-ray-NIR association and the
          compatibility  of  the  X-ray  spectral  fit  with the expected
          spectrum  of  a  population  of  discrete  sources suggest that
          low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are the most likely emitters of
          the  unresolved  emission  in  the  disk  region. The remaining
          unresolved  emission  is  primarily due to extraplanar hot gas.
          The luminosity of this gas is at least a factor of 10 less than
          that  predicted  by  recent  simulations  of  intergalactic gas
          accretion  by  such  a  massive galaxy with a circular rotation
          speed  V_c  ~  304  km/s^2 (Toft et al. 2002). Instead, we find
          that  the  extraplanar  hot gas most likely represents discrete
          extensions  away  from  the disk, including two ``bubble-like''
          features on either side of the nucleus. These extensions appear
          to  correlate with radio continuum emission and, energetically,
          can be easily explained by outflows from the galactic disk.

          Journal, August 2006
          We  examine,  from  a  theoretical  viewpoint, how the physical
          parameters  of  HII  regions  are  controlled  in  both  normal
          galaxies  and  in  starburst environments. These parameters are
          the  HII  region  luminosity function, the time-dependent size,
          the  covering fraction of molecular clouds, the pressure in the
          ionized  gas  and  the  ionization parameter. The factors which
          control  them  are  the  initial  mass function of the exciting
          stars,  the cluster mass function, the metallicity and the mean
          pressure in the surrounding interstellar medium. We investigate
          the  sensitivity  of  the  H$\alpha$ luminosity to the IMF, and
          find  that  this  can  translate  to  more  than  a  factor two
          variation  in derived star formation rates. The molecular cloud
          dissipation  timescale is estimated from a case study of M17 to
          be  $\sim1$  Myr  for  this  object.  Based upon HII luminosity
          function  fitting for nearby galaxies, we suggest that the \HII
          region  cluster  mass  function  is fitted by a log-normal form
          peaking  at  $\sim  100  M_{\odot}$.  The cluster mass function
          continues  the  stellar IMF to higher mass. The pressure in the
          HII  regions  is  controlled  by the mechanical luminosity flux
          from  the central cluster. Since this is closely related to the
          ionizing  photon flux, we show that the ionization parameter is
          not a free variable, and that the diffuse ionized medium may be
          composed  of many large, faint and old HII regions. Finally, we
          derive theoretical probability distributions for the ionization
          parameter  as  a  function  of metallicity and compare these to
          those derived for SDSS galaxies.

          Photometric  data  will  be  made available at the CDS once the
          final  version  appears.  The  resolution  in  Fig.  1 has been
          reduced
          Determinations  of  stellar  mass  and  radius  with  realistic
          uncertainties  at the level of 1% provide important constraints
          on  models  of  stellar  structure  and evolution. We present a
          high-precision  light curve of the A0IV star Psi Centauri, from
          the star tracker on board the WIRE satellite and the Solar Mass
          Ejection  Imager  camera  on  the Coriolis spacecraft. The data
          show  that Psi Cen is an eccentric eclipsing binary system with
          a  relatively long orbital period. The WIRE light curve extends
          over  28.7  nights  and contains 41334 observations with 2 mmag
          point-to-point  scatter.  The  eclipse depths are 0.28 and 0.16
          mag, and show that the two eclipsing components of Psi Cen have
          very  different  radii. As a consequence, the secondary eclipse
          is total. We find the eccentricity to be e=0.55 with an orbital
          period  of  38.8  days from combining the WIRE light curve with
          data  taken  over two years from the Solar Mass Ejection Imager
          camera.  We  have  fitted  the  light  curve with EBOP and have
          assessed  the  uncertainties  of the resulting parameters using
          Monte  Carlo simulations. The fractional radii of the stars and
          the  inclination  of  the orbit have random errors of only 0.1%
          and  0.01 degrees, respectively, but the systematic uncertainty
          in  these  quantities  may  be  somewhat  larger.  We have used
          photometric calibrations to estimate the effective temperatures
          of  the components of Psi Cen to be 10450+-300 and 8800+-300 K,
          indicating  masses of about 3.1 and 2.0 Msun. There is evidence
          in  the  WIRE  light curve for g-mode pulsations in the primary
          star.

          We  compare  the  number  of  detected 22 GHz H2O masers in the
          Local  Group  galaxies M31, M33, NGC6822, IC10, IC1613, DDO187,
          GR8,  NGC185,  and  the  Magellanic Clouds with the water maser
          population of the Milky Way. To accomplish this we searched for
          water  maser  emission  in the two Local Group galaxies M33 and
          NGC6822  using  the  Very  Large  Array  (VLA) and incorporated
          results  from  previous  studies. We observed 62 HII regions in
          M33  and 36 regions with H-alpha emission in NGC6822. Detection
          limits  are  0.0015  and  0.0008  Lsun  for  M33  and  NGC6822,
          respectively  (corresponding to 47 and 50 mJy in three channels
          with  0.7  km/s  width). M33 hosts three water masers above our
          detection limit, while in NGC6822 no maser source was detected.
          We find that the water maser detection rates in the Local Group
          galaxies  M31,  M33,  NGC6822, IC1613, DDO187, GR8, NGC185, and
          the Magellanic Clouds are consistent with expectations from the
          Galactic  water  masers  if  one  considers  the different star
          formation  rates  of  the  galaxies.  However,  the galaxy IC10
          exhibits  an  overabundance  of masers, which may result from a
          compact central starburst.

          We  have  observed the bipolar post-AGB candidate OH 231.8+4.2,
          using  the  mid-infrared  interferometer  MIDI and the infrared
          camera  with  the adaptive optics system NACO on the Very Large
          Telescope.  An  unresolved  core (<200 mas in FWHM) is found at
          the  center  of  the OH 231.8+4.2 in the 3.8 micron image. This
          compact source is resolved with the interferometer. We used two
          8-meter  telescopes  with four different baselines, which cover
          projected  baseline lengths from 62 to 47 meters, and projected
          position  angles  from  112  to  131  degrees  that  are almost
          perpendicular  to  the  bipolar  outflow.  Fringes  from 8 to 9
          micron and from 12 to 13.5 micron were clearly detected, whilst
          the   strong  silicate  self-absorption  allows  only  marginal
          detection  of visibilities between 9 and 12 micron. The fringes
          from  the  four  baselines  consistently show the presence of a
          compact circumstellar object with an inner radius of 30-40 mas,
          which  is equivalent to 40-50 AU at 1.3 kpc. This clearly shows
          that the mid-infrared compact source is not the central star (3
          AU)  but  circumstellar  material.  The  measured  size  of the
          circumstellar  material  is  consistent  with  the size of such
          disks   calculated   by   hydrodynamic   models,  implying  the
          circumstellar material may have a disk configuration.

          Title:   Modelling   the   closest   double  degenerate  system
          RXJ0806.3+1527 and its decreasing period
          Authors: F. D'Antona, P. Ventura, L. Burderi, A. Teodorescu
          Comments: 13 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication on ApJ,
          main journal
          In  the hypothesis that the 5.4m binary RXJ0806.3+1527 consists
          of  a  low  mass  helium  white dwarf (donor) transferring mass
          towards  its  more  massive white dwarf companion (primary), we
          consider  as  possible donors white dwarfs which are the result
          of  common  envelope  evolution  occurring when the helium core
          mass  of the progenitor giant was still very small (~ 0.2Msun),
          so  that  they  are  surrounded  by  a  quite  massive hydrogen
          envelope  (~1/100Msun or larger), and live for a very long time
          supported  by  proton--proton  burning. Mass transfer from such
          low  mass white dwarfs very probably starts during the hydrogen
          burning stage, and the donor structure will remain dominated by
          the  burning shell until it loses all the hydrogen envelope and
          begins  transferring  helium. We model mass transfer from these
          low  mass  white  dwarfs, and show that the radius of the donor
          decreases  while  they  shed the hydrogen envelope. This radius
          behavior,  which is due to the fact that the white dwarf is not
          fully   degenerate,  has  two  important  consequences  on  the
          evolution  of the binary: 1) the orbital period decreases, with
          a  timescale  consistent with the period decrease of the binary
          RXJ0806.3+1527;  2) the mass transfer rate is a factor of about
          10 smaller than from a fully degenerate white dwarf, easing the
          problem  connected  with  the  small  X-ray  luminosity of this
          object.  The  possibility  that  such  evolution  describes the
          system  RXJ0806.3+1527  is  also  consistent  with the possible
          presence of hydrogen in the optical spectrum of the star, whose
          confirmation would become a test of the model.

          Title:  Stability of the Accretion Flows with Stalled Shocks in
          Core-Collapse Supernovae
          Authors: Tatsuya Yamasaki, Shoichi Yamada
          Comments: 37 pages, 15 figures, submitted to ApJ
          Bearing  in mind the application to the theory of core-collapse
          supernovae,  we  performed  a  global  linear  analysis  on the
          stability  of  spherically  symmetric accretion flows through a
          standing  shock  wave onto a proto neutron star. As unperturbed
          flows, we adopted the spherically symmetric steady solutions to
          the  Euler  equations obtained with realistic equation of state
          and  formulae  for  neutrino reaction rates taken into account.
          Then   we   solved   the  equations  for  linear  perturbations
          numerically,  and  obtained  the  eigen  frequencies  and eigen
          functions.  We  found (1) the flows are stable for all modes if
          the  neutrino  luminosity  is lower than $\sim 1\times 10^{52}$
          ergs/s  for  $\dot{M}=1.0M_{\odot}/{\rm  s}$.  (2)  For  larger
          luminosities,   the   non-radial   instabilities  are  induced,
          probably  via the advection-acoustic cycles. Interestingly, the
          modes  with  $\ell=2$  and  3  become  unstable  at  first  for
          relatively  low  neutrino luminosities, e.g. $\gtrsim 2-3\times
          10^{52}$  ergs/s  for  the  same  accretion  rate,  whereas the
          $\ell=1$  mode  is  the  most unstable for higher luminosities,
          $\sim  3-7\times  10^{52}$  ergs/s.  These  are all oscillatory
          modes.   (3)  For  still  larger  luminosities,  $\sim  7\times
          10^{52}$    ergs/s    for    $\dot{M}=1.0M_{\odot}/{\rm    s}$,
          non-oscillatory  modes,  both  radial  and  non-radial,  become
          unstable. These non-radial modes were identified as convection.
          We confirmed the results obtained by numerical simulations that
          the  instabilities induced by the advection-acoustic cycles are
          more   important   than   the  convection  for  lower  neutrino
          luminosities.

          We  review  work  on  the  evolution  of  planetary nebulae and
          proto-planetaries  via  magneto-rotational  mechanisms  showing
          that  a  dynamo generated magnetic field can produce the energy
          and  momentum  needed  to  drive  pPN and PNe outflows. Angular
          momentum  considerations  lead  to  the  conclusion that single
          stars  may  not be capable of supporting strong fields for long
          times.  Thus  we  take  the working hypothesis that most PN may
          form  via binary stars. We propose that the grand challenge for
          PN   studies   is  fully  understanding  the  diverse  physical
          processes  at work in binary late stage evolution including the
          development of disks, fields and outflows.

          The  luminous infrared galaxy Arp299 (IC694+NGC3690) is studied
          using  optical  integral  field  spectroscopy obtained with the
          INTEGRAL  system, together with archival Hubble Space Telescope
          WFPC2 and NICMOS images. The stellar and ionized gas morphology
          shows  lambda-dependent  variations due to the combined effects
          of  the  dust  internal  extinction, and the nature and spatial
          distribution   of   the   different   ionizing   sources.   The
          two-dimensional  ionization  maps  have revealed an off-nuclear
          conical  structure  of  about 4 kpc in length, characterized by
          high  excitation  conditions  and  a radial gradient in the gas
          electron  density. The apex of this structure coincides with B1
          region   of  NGC3690  which,  in  turn,  presents  Seyfert-like
          ionization,  high  extinction  and  a high velocity dispersion.
          These  results  strongly  support the hypothesis that B1 is the
          true  nucleus  of  NGC3690,  where  an  AGN  is located. In the
          circumnuclear  regions  HII-like  ionization  dominates,  while
          LINER-like  ionization  is found elsewhere. The Halpha emitting
          sources  with  ages  from 3.3 to 7.2x10^6 years, have masses of
          between   6   and  680x10^6  Msun  and  contribute  (extinction
          corrected)  about 45% to the bolometric luminosity. The ionized
          (Halpha)  and  neutral  (NaD)  gas velocity fields show similar
          structure  on  scales  of  several  hundred  to  about  1  kpc,
          indicating that these gas components are kinematically coupled.
          The  kinematic  structure is complex and on scales of about 0.2
          kpc does not appear to be dominated by the presence of ordered,
          rotational  motions.  The large velocity dispersion measured in
          NGC3690  indicates  that this galaxy is the most massive of the
          system.  The  low  velocity  amplitude  and  dispersion  of the
          interface suggest that the ionized gas is slowly rotating or in
          a close to quiescent phase.

          Title:  Formation of Galactic Systems in Light of the Magnesium
          Abundance in Field Stars.III.the Halo
          Authors: V.A. Marsakov, T.V. Borkova
          Comments:  accepted  2006,  Astronomy  Letters,  Vol. 32 No. 8,
          P.545, 18 pages, 6 figures
          We   analyze  the  relations  between  the  relative  magnesium
          abundances,  metallicities,  and  Galactic orbital elements for
          halo  stars.  We show that the relative magnesium abundances in
          protodisk  halo  stars are virtually independent of metallicity
          and  lie within a fairly narrow range while presumably accreted
          stars   demonstrate   a  large  spread  in  relative  magnesium
          abundances  up  to  negative  [Mg/Fe].  The mean metallicity of
          magnesium-poor  ([Mg/Fe]<0.2 dex) accreted stars has been found
          to  be  displaced  toward the negative values when passing from
          stars  with low azimuthal velocities to those with high ones at
          \Delta[Fe/H]=0.5dex.    The    mean   apogalactic   radii   and
          inclinations   of   the   orbits   also  increase  while  their
          eccentricities  decrease.  As  a  result  negative  radial  and
          vertical   gradients   in  relative  magnesium  abundances  are
          observed  in  the  accreted halo in the absence of correlations
          between  the  [Mg/Fe]  ratios and other orbital elements, while
          these  correlations  are found at a high significance level for
          genetically  related  Galactic  stars.  We  surmise that as the
          masses  of dwarf galaxies decrease, the maximum SNII masses and
          hence,  the  yield of \alpha-elements in them also decrease. In
          this  case,  the  relation  between  the [Mg/Fe] ratios and the
          inclinations  and  sizes  of the orbits of accreted stars is in
          complete  agreement  with  numerical  simulations  of dynamical
          processes during the interaction of galaxies. Thus the behavior
          of  the magnesium abundance in accreted stars suggests that the
          satellite  galaxies are disrupted and lose their stars en masse
          only  after  dynamical friction reduces significantly the sizes
          of  their  orbits  and drags them into the Galactic plane. Less
          massive  satellite  galaxies  are  disrupted  even before their
          orbits change appreciably under tidal forces.

          Title:  A  Time  Dependent Leptonic Model for Microquasar Jets:
          Application to LSI 61 303
          Authors: Swati Gupta, Markus Boettcher (Ohio University)
          Comments:  submitted  to  ApJ Letters; 11 ms pages, including 2
          figures and 1 table
          he Galactic high-mass X-ray binary and jet source (microquasar)
          LSI  +61  303  has  recently  been  detected  at  TeV gamma-ray
          energies   by   the   MAGIC   telescope.   We  have  applied  a
          time-dependent  leptonic  jet  model  to the broadband spectral
          energy  distribution  and  orbital  modulation of the very high
          energy  gamma-ray emission of this source. Our model takes into
          account time dependent electron injection and acceleration, and
          the  adiabatic  and radiative cooling of non-thermal electrons.
          It  includes  synchrotron,  inverse  Compton (with seed photons
          from   the   companion   star  and  the  accretion  disk),  and
          synchrotron  self-Compton  emission,  as  well  as  gamma-gamma
          absorption  of  gamma-rays  by starlight photons. The model can
          successfully    reproduce    the    available   multiwavelength
          observational  data.  Our  best fit to the SED indicates that a
          magnetic  field  of B_0 ~ 5 X 10^3 G at ~ 10^3 R_g is required,
          and  electrons  need  to  be  accelerated  out  to TeV energies
          (gamma_2  =  10^6)  with a nonthermal injection spectrum with a
          spectral  index  of  q  =  1.7,  indicating  the  operation  of
          acceleration  mechanisms  beyond the standard first-order Fermi
          mechanism  at  relativistic  or  non-relativistic  shocks.  The
          orbital  modulation  of  the  VHE  gamma-ray  emission  can  be
          explained  solely  by  the geometrical effect of changes in the
          relative  orientation  of the stellar companion with respect to
          the compact object and jet as it impacts the position and depth
          of the gamma-gamma absorption trough.

          Title:  What  triggers galaxy transformations? The environments
          of post-starburst galaxies

          Michael  R.  Blanton, Alejandro D. Quintero (NYU), J. Brinkmann
          (APO)
          Comments: submitted to ApJ
          (abridged) There are good observational reasons to believe that
          the  progenitors  of  red  galaxies  have undergone starbursts,
          followed   by   a  post-starburst  phase.  We  investigate  the
          environments    of   post-starburst   galaxies   by   measuring
          \textsl{(1)}~number   densities   in   $8\,h^{-1}~\mathrm{Mpc}$
          radius  comoving  spheres, \textsl{(2)}~transverse distances to
          nearest Virgo-like galaxy clusters, and \textsl{(3)}~transverse
          distances  to nearest luminous-galaxy neighbors. We compare the
          post-starburst  galaxies  to  currently  star-forming  galaxies
          identified  solely  by  A-star excess or $\Halpha$ emission. We
          find  that  post-starburst  galaxies  are  in the same kinds of
          environments  as  star-forming  galaxies;  this  is  our ``null
          hypothesis''.  More  importantly, we find that at each value of
          the A-star excess, the star-forming and post-starburst galaxies
          lie  in  very  similar  distributions  of environment. The only
          deviations  from  our null hypothesis are barely significant: a
          slight  deficit  of  post-starburst  galaxies  (relative to the
          star-forming  population)  in very low-density regions, a small
          excess inside the virial radii of clusters, and a slight excess
          with  nearby  neighbors. None of these effects is strong enough
          to  make the post-starburst galaxies a high-density phenomenon,
          or  to  argue that the starburst events are primarily triggered
          by external tidal impulses (\eg, from close passages of massive
          galaxies).   The  small  excess  inside  cluster  virial  radii
          suggests   that   some   post-starbursts   are   triggered   by
          interactions  with the intracluster medium, but this represents
          a very small fraction of all post-starburst galaxies.

          Title:   Radio   Emission   on   Sub-Parsec   Scales  from  the
          Intermediate-Mass Black Hole in NGC 4395
          Authors: J.M. Wrobel, L.C. Ho
          Comments: 5 pages; 1 figure; emulateapj; to appear in ApJL
          The  Seyfert 1 nucleus of NGC 4395 is energized by a black hole
          of  360,000  Solar  masses  (Peterson et al.), making it one of
          only two nuclear black holes of intermediate mass, one thousand
          to  one  million  Solar  masses,  detected in the radio regime.
          Building  upon  UV  and  X-ray  evidence for outflows from this
          Seyfert  nucleus,  the  VLBI High Sensitivity Array was used at
          1.4 GHz to search for extended structure on scales greater than
          5  mas  (0.1  pc). Elongated emission was discovered, extending
          over  15  mas  (0.3 pc) and suggesting an outflow on sub-parsec
          scales  from  this  intermediate-mass  black  hole. The Seyfert
          nucleus is located at the center of an elliptical star cluster,
          and  the  elongation  position  angle  of  the sub-parsec radio
          structure  is  only  19  degrees  from the star cluster's minor
          axis.

          We  present  new  results  of [Fe II] 1.644-micron spectroscopy
          toward  the  jets  from  HL Tau and RW Aur carried out with the
          Subaru  Telescope  combined with the adaptive optics system. We
          observed  the  regions  within  2" - 3" from the stars with the
          sub-arcsecond  resolutions  of  0."5 and 0."2 for HL Tau and RW
          Aur,  respectively.  In  addition  to the strong, high velocity
          emission extended along each jet, we detected a blueshifted low
          velocity  emission  feature  seen  as a wing or shoulder of the
          high  velocity  emission  at  each  stellar  position. Detailed
          analysis shows that the position-velocity diagrams (PVDs) of HL
          Tau  and  RW  Aur show a characteristic similar to those of the
          cold disk wind and X-wind models in that the [Fe II] line width
          is  broad  in  the  vicinity  of  the  stellar  position and is
          narrower  at  the  extended  jet. A closer comparison suggests,
          however,  that the disk wind model tends to have too large line
          width  at the jet while the X-wind model has excess emission on
          the  redshifted  side  at  the  stellar  position.  The  narrow
          velocity  width  with  symmetric  line profiles of the observed
          high  velocity emission supports an X-wind type model where the
          launching  region  is  localized in a small radial range, while
          the low velocity emission located away from the star favors the
          presence  of  a disk wind. The [Fe II] emission from the HL Tau
          jet  shows  a  gap  of  0."8 between the redshifted jet and the
          star,  indicating  the presence of an optically thick disk of ~
          160  AU  in  radius.  The  [Fe II] emission from the RW Aur jet
          shows  a  marked  drop  from  the  redshifted peak at Y ~ -0."2
          toward  the  star,  suggesting  that its disk radius is smaller
          than 40 AU.

          Title:  The  Nature  of  Blue  Early-Type Galaxies in the Goods
          Fields
          Authors: Joon Hyeop Lee, Myung Gyoon Lee, Ho Seong Hwang
          Comments:  26 pages, 17 figures, To appear in the Astrophysical
          Journal, Oct 2006
          We  present  a  study  of  the  nature  of  the blue early-type
          galaxies  (BEGs)  in the GOODS north and south fields using the
          GOODS  HST/ACS  archival data. Using visual inspection, we have
          selected  58 BEGs and 113 normal red early-type galaxies (REGs)
          in  the  sample of 1,949 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts.
          We  find  that  the  BEGs  are  generally  bluer,  fainter, and
          less-massive   than   the   REGs,   although  a  few  BEGs  are
          exceptionally  bright  and  massive. The number fraction of the
          BEGs   to   total   early-type   galaxies  is  almost  constant
          ($\sim0.3$)  at $z \le 1.1$. In addition, we find that the size
          of  the  BEGs  in  given  redshift  bin  decrease  as  redshift
          decreases.  The BEGs look similar to the REGs in the images and
          surface  brightness  profiles.  However,  at least 27 BEGs show
          traces   of   tidal  disturbances  in  their  fine  structures:
          elongated  cores, off-centered cores, asymmetric internal color
          distributions,  tidally distorted outer structures, collisional
          rings,  or very nearby companions. Twenty-one BEGs are detected
          in  the  X-ray  bands  and  eleven  of  them are as luminous as
          $L_{0.5-10   {\rm   keV}}   \ge  10^{43.5}  {\rm  erg~s}^{-1}$,
          indicating  the  existence  of  AGNs  in  their  centers. These
          results  show  that  at  least  a  half  of  the  BEGs  may  be
          descendants of mergers/interacting-galaxies and that at least a
          quarter  of  the  BEGs  may  be AGN-host galaxies. The BEGs may
          evolve  into  REGs,  and  the  size  evolution  of  the BEGs is
          consistent with the galactic \emph{downsizing} scenario.

          We  present the results of numerical simulations of stationary,
          spherically  outflowing,  electron-positron  pair  winds,  with
          total luminosities in the range 10^{34}- 10^{42} ergs/s. In the
          concrete example described here, the wind injection source is a
          hot,  bare,  strange star, predicted to be a powerful source of
          electron-positron  pairs  created by the Coulomb barrier at the
          quark  surface.  We  find that photons dominate in the emerging
          emission,  and  the emerging photon spectrum is rather hard and
          differs substantially from the thermal spectrum expected from a
          neutron   star  with  the  same  luminosity.  This  might  help
          distinguish the putative bare strange stars from neutron stars.

          Title:  Light  Curves  from  an  MHD Simulation of a Black Hole
          Accretion Disk
          Authors:  Jeremy  D. Schnittman (U. Maryland), Julian H. Krolik
          (Johns Hopkins), John F. Hawley (U. Virginia)
          Comments: Accepted to ApJ, 43 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables
          We  use  a relativistic ray-tracing code to calculate the light
          curves    observed   from   a   global   general   relativistic
          magneto-hydrodynamic  simulation  of  an  accretion flow onto a
          Schwarzschild  black hole. We apply three basic emission models
          to  sample different properties of the time-dependent accretion
          disk. With one of these models, which assumes thermal blackbody
          emission  and  free-free absorption, we can predict qualitative
          features of the high-frequency power spectrum from stellar-mass
          black  holes  in  the  "Thermal  Dominant" state. The simulated
          power spectrum is characterized by a power law of index Gamma ~
          3  and  total rms fractional variance of <~ 2% above 10 Hz. For
          each  emission  model,  we  find that the variability amplitude
          should increase with increasing inclination angle. On the basis
          of a newly-developed formalism for quantifying the significance
          of  quasi-periodic  oscillations  (QPOs) in simulation data, we
          find  that  these  simulations  are  able  to identify any such
          features  with  (rms/mean)  amplitudes  >~ 1 % near the orbital
          frequency  at  the  inner-most  stable  orbit.  Initial results
          indicate  the  existence  of transient QPO peaks with frequency
          ratios  of nearly 2:3 at a 99.9% confidence limit, but they are
          not  generic  features  because at any given time they are seen
          only from certain observer directions. Additionally, we present
          detailed  analysis  of the azimuthal structure of the accretion
          disk  and  the  evolution of density perturbations in the inner
          disk.   These  "hot  spot"  structures  appear  to  be  roughly
          self-similar  over  a  range  of  disk  radii,  with  a  single
          characteristic  size  \delta\phi=25 deg and \delta r/r=0.3, and
          typical lifetimes T_l ~ 0.3 T_orb.

          In  this  work  we  connect  some  measurable properties of the

          (Eddington  ratios).  A tight correlation is found for a sample

          method  for  a  relatively  accurate  estimate of the Eddington
          ratio  of  high-redshift  quasars, at least for the radio-quiet
          ones.  This paper further confirms the existing notion that the
          CIV changes (shifts) are mostly driven by the accretion rate.

          in MNRAS
          Values  of black hole masses are frequently determined with the
          help  of  the  reverberation  method.  This  method  requires a
          specific  geometrical factor related to the distribution of the
          orbits of the Broad Line Region clouds. Onken et al. determined
          the   value  f^2=  1.37+/-0.45  from  the  black  hole  mass  -
          dispersion  relation.  In  this  paper we determine this factor
          using an independent mass determination from the X-ray variance
          method  for  a  number of Seyfert 1 galaxies and comparing them
          with  the  reverberation  results  by Peterson et al. We obtain
          mean  value  f^2  = 1.12 +/- 0.54, consistent with Onken et al.
          Both  values  are larger than the value 0.75 corresponding to a
          spherical  geometry. It indicates that most probably all values
          of  the black hole masses obtained with the use of the Kaspi et
          al. formulae should be multiplied by a factor of \sim 1.7. This
          also shows that the Broad Line Region is rather flat, and hints
          for a dependence of the factor f^2 on a source inclination seem
          to be present in the data.

          Title:  Young  Massive  Clusters  -  Formation Efficiencies and
          (Initial) Mass Functions
          Authors:  Soeren  S. Larsen (Astronomical Institute, University
          of Utrecht)
          Comments: 8 pages. Contribution to the proceedings of "Globular
          Clusters - Guides to Galaxies", Concepcion, March 2006 (eds. T.
          Richtler and S. S. Larsen)
          Globular clusters are often assumed to be good tracers of major
          star   formation   episodes   in  their  host  galaxies.  While
          observations  over  the  past  2  decades  have  confirmed  the
          presence of young objects with globular cluster-like properties
          in  many  galaxies, it is still not well understood exactly how
          the  formation  efficiency  of  bound star clusters relative to
          field stars and their mass spectrum depend on external factors.
          The  cluster  initial  mass  function  typically  appears to be
          consistent  with a power-law with a slope of about -2, but most
          attempts  to  constrain  any  upper limit on the CIMF have been
          limited   by   size-of-sample  effects.  However,  evidence  is
          starting  to  accumulate for possible truncation of the cluster
          mass  function. It is tentatively suggested that the upper mass
          limit  may  currently  be  at  about 10^5 Msun in the Milky Way
          disk,  while there are indications that it is about 5x10^5 Msun
          in  M51  and  about  2x10^6  Msun in the Antennae. Some extreme
          starbursts  (e.g. Arp 220, NGC 7252) are (or were) able to form
          clusters  as  massive  as  10^7  Msun.  The  overall  formation
          efficiency  of  star  clusters (relative to field stars) in the
          Galactic  bulge  may  not have been much different from that in
          the  disk  today,  but  was  probably  significantly higher for
          metal-poor GCs in halos.

          Recent  detections of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect through
          the  correlation of the cosmic microwave background temperature
          anisotropy  with  traces  of  large  scale  structure  provided
          independent  evidence  for  the expansion of the universe being
          dominated  by  something  other  than matter. Even with perfect
          data,  statistical  errors  will  limit  the  accuracy  of such
          measurements  to  worse  than  10%.  On  the  other  hand,  the
          extraordinary  sensitivity  of the ISW effect to the details of
          structure  formation  should  help  to  make up for the lack of
          precision. In these conference proceedings I discuss the extent
          to  which  future  ISW  measurements  can  help  in testing the
          physics responsible for the observed cosmic acceleration.

          We  analyse  observations,  spanning 15 years, dedicated to the
          extreme  emission-line  object  Hen3-209.  Our photometric data
          indicate  that  the  luminosity  of  the  star undergoes marked
          variations  with  a  peak-to-peak  amplitude  of 0.65mag. These
          variations  are recurrent, with a period of 16.093+-0.005d. The
          spectrum of Hen3-209 is peculiar with many different lines (HI,
          HeI,  FeII,...) showing P Cygni profiles. The line profiles are
          apparently   changing  in  harmony  with  the  photometry.  The
          spectrum  also  contains  [OIII]  lines  that  display a saddle
          profile  topped  by  three  peaks, with a maximum separation of
          about  600km/s.  Hen3-209  is  most  likely an evolved luminous
          object  suffering from mass ejection events and maybe belonging
          to a binary system.

          Authors: Garcia-Segura
          Comments:  7  pages, Review Talk, IAU 243, Planetary Nebulae in
          our Galaxy and Beyond
          Hydrodynamical   simulations   played   an  important  role  in
          understanding  the dynamics and shaping of planetary nebulae in
          the past century. However, hydrodynamical simulations were just
          a  first  order  approach.  The new millennium arrived with the
          generalized  understanding  that the effects of magnetic fields
          were  necessary  to  study  the  dynamics of planetary nebulae.
          Thus,  B-fields  introduced  a  whole  new  number  of physical
          possibilities  for  the  modeling.  In  this  paper,  we review
          observational  works done in the last 5 years and several works
          on  magnetohydrodynamics  about  proto-planetary nebulae, since
          all  the  effort  has  been  focused on that stage, and discuss
          different scenarios for the origin of magnetized winds, and the
          relation binary-bipolararity.

          of the Chandrasekhar formula

          Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          Using analytic calculations and N-body simulations we show that
          in   constant  density  (harmonic)  cores,  sinking  satellites
          undergo  an  initial  phase of very rapid (super-Chandrasekhar)
          dynamical  friction,  after  which they experience no dynamical
          friction  at all. For density profiles with a central power law
          profile  of log-slope, $-\alpha$, the infalling satellite heats
          the  background  and causes $\alpha$ to decrease. For $\alpha <
          0.5$   initially,  the  satellite  generates  a  small  central
          constant density core and stalls as in the $\alpha = 0$ case.
          We  discuss  some  astrophysical applications of our results to
          decaying   satellite  orbits,  galactic  bars  and  mergers  of
          supermassive  black hole binaries. In a companion paper we show
          that  a  central  constant  density  core can provide a natural
          solution to the timing problem for Fornax's globular clusters.

          Title:  Instability  of a stalled accretion shock: evidence for
          the advective-acoustic cycle
          Authors: T. Foglizzo, P. Galletti, L. Scheck, H.-Th. Janka
          Comments: 25 pages, 16 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We analyze the linear stability of a stalled accretion shock in
          a  perfect gas with a parametrized cooling function L~ rho^beta
          T^alpha.  A  new  formulation of the boundary conditions at the
          shock is proposed, different from Houck & Chevalier (1992). The
          instability  is  dominated  by the l=1 mode if the shock radius
          exceeds  2-3  times  the  accretor  radius,  depending  on  the
          parameters  of  the  cooling  function.  The  growth  rate  and
          oscillation  period  are  comparable  to  those observed in the
          numerical  simulations  of  Blondin  &  Mezzacappa  (2006). The
          instability  mechanism  is analyzed by separately measuring the
          efficiencies   of   the   purely   acoustic   cycle   and   the
          advective-acoustic  cycle.  These  efficiencies  are  estimated
          directly  from  the  eigenspectrum,  and  also  through  a  WKB
          analysis.  Both methods indicate that the instability is due to
          an  unstable  advective-acoustic  cycle,  and  that  the purely
          acoustic  cycle  is  stable.  These  results do not support the
          purely  acoustic interpretation of Blondin & Mezzacappa (2006).
          A  simplified  characterization of the instability is proposed,
          based  on an advective-acoustic cycle between the shock and the
          radius  r_nabla  where the velocity gradients of the stationary
          flow  are  strongest.  The importance of the coupling region in
          this   mechanism  calls  for  a  better  understanding  of  the
          conditions  for  an  efficient advective-acoustic coupling in a
          decelerated,  nonadiabatic  flow,  in  order  to  extend  these
          results to core-collapse supernovae.

          Title:  Impact  of  Stellar  Dynamics on the Frequency of Giant
          Planets in Close Binaries
          Authors: Eric Pfahl (KITP), Matt Muterspaugh (Caltech/MIT)
          Comments: 4 pages, submitted to ApJL
          Hostile  tidal  forces  may  inhibit  the  formation  of Jovian
          planets  in  binaries  with  semimajor  axes  of  $\la$$50\au$,
          binaries  that might be called ``close'' in this context. As an
          alternative to in situ planet formation, a binary can acquire a
          giant  planet when one of its original members is replaced in a
          dynamical  interaction  with  another star that hosts a planet.
          Simple  scaling  relations  for  the structure and evolution of
          star   clusters,  coupled  with  analytic  arguments  regarding
          binary-single   and  binary-binary  scattering,  indicate  that
          dynamical  processes  can  deposit  Jovian  planets in $<$1% of
          close binaries. If ongoing and future exoplanet surveys measure
          a much larger fraction, it may be that giant planets do somehow
          form frequently in such systems.

          As  part  of the Red MSX Source Survey of Massive Young Stellar
          Objects  (MYSOs)  we  have conducted multi-wavelength follow up
          observations  of  the  well-known object V645 Cygni. We present
          our  data  on  this  object,  whose  near-infrared  spectrum is
          exceptional   and   place   these   in  context  with  previous
          observations.  Our  observations  of V645 Cyg included near/mid
          infrared  imaging  observations, 13CO 2-1 line observations and
          high    signal-to-noise    velocity    resolved   near-infrared
          spectroscopy.  The  spectrum  shows  P-Cygni  hydrogen Brackett
          emission,  consistent  with  a  high  velocity  stellar wind. A
          red-shifted  emission component to a number of near-IR emission
          lines  was  also  uncovered.  This is associated with a similar
          component  in  the H alpha line. V645 Cyg is also found to have
          variable  CO first overtone bandhead emission. The data clearly
          indicate  that  the  outflow  of  V645  Cyg  is  variable.  The
          unidentified feature in a previously published optical spectrum
          is  identified  with  a receding outflow at 2000 km per second.
          The  nature  of  this  feature,  which is found in hydrogen and
          helium atomic lines and CO molecular lines remains a puzzle.

          publication in ApJ
          Periodic  outbursts  are  observed  in  many  AGNs  and usually
          explained   with  a  supermassive  black  hole  binary  (SMBHB)
          scenario.  However,  multiple periods are observed in some AGNs
          and   cannot   be  explained  with  it.  Here  we  analyze  the
          periodicity  of  the  radio  light  curves  of  AO  0235+164 at
          multi-frequencies  and  report  the  discovery  of  six QPOs in
          integer  ratio  1:2:3:4:5:6  of  QPO  frequencies, of which the
          second  with  period  $P_2  =  (5.46 \pm 0.47) {\rm yr}$ is the
          strongest.  We  fit  the  radio  light curves and show that the
          initial  phases  of  six  QPOs  have  zero or $\pi$ differences
          relative  to  each other. We suggest a harmonic relationship of
          QPOs.  The  centroid  frequency,  relative  strength,  harmonic
          relationship   and   relative   initial   phases  of  QPOs  are
          independent  of  radio  frequency. The harmonic QPOs are likely
          due   to   the  quasi-periodic  injection  of  plasma  from  an
          oscillating  accretion  disk  into  the  jet.  We  estimate the
          supermassive  black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} \simeq (4.72\pm 2.04)
          \times  10^8  M_\odot$  and  the  accretion rate $\dot{m}\simeq
          0.007$.  With  the knowledge of accretion disk, it implies that
          the  inner  region  of  accretion  disk  of  AO  0235+164  is a
          radiatively   inefficient   accretion   flow.  The  oscillation
          accretion  is  due  to the p-mode oscillation of the thick disk
          probably  excited  by  a SMBHB. The theoretical predications of
          fundamental  oscillation  frequency  and the harmonics are well
          consistent with the observations. Harmonic QPOs would be absent
          when  the  thick  disk  becomes  geometrically  thin due to the
          increase  of  accretion rate. We discuss the observations of AO
          0235+164 basing on the SMBHB-thick disk oscillation scenario.

          We  present  an  XMM-Newton observation of the eclipsing binary
          Algol  which  contains  an  X-ray dark B8V primary and an X-ray
          bright  K2IV  secondary.  The  observation  covered the optical
          secondary eclipse and captured an X-ray flare that was eclipsed
          by  the  B  star.  The  EPIC  and  RGS  spectra of Algol in its
          quiescent  state  are  described  by  a  two-temperature plasma
          model.   The   cool   component   has   a   temperature  around
          6.4$\times10^{6}$ K while that of the hot component ranges from
          2  to  4.0$\times10^{7}$  K. Coronal abundances of C, N, O, Ne,
          Mg,  Si  and  Fe  were obtained for each component for both the
          quiescent and the flare phases, with generally upper limits for
          S  and  Ar, and C, N, and O for the hot component. F-tests show
          that  the  abundances need not to be different between the cool
          and  the  hot component and between the quiescent and the flare
          phase with the exception of Fe. Whereas the Fe abundance of the
          cool   component   remains  constant  at  $\sim$0.14,  the  hot
          component  shows an Fe abundance of $\sim$0.28, which increases
          to  $\sim$0.44 during the flare. This increase is expected from
          the  chromospheric  evaporation  model.  The  absorbing  column
          density  $N_H$  of the quiescent emission is 2.5$\times10^{20}$
          cm$^{-2}$,  while that of the flare-only emission is lower than
          1.3$\times10^{20}$    cm$^{-2}$.    Together    with   previous
          observations,  this $N_H$ difference suggests that there exists
          a  belt of cool gas above the corona and the belt runs parallel
          to the equator of the K star.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          The  connection  between  the accretion process that powers AGN
          and  the  formation of jets is still poorly understood. Here we
          tackle   this   issue   using   new,  deep  \chandra  and  \xmm
          observations of the cores of three powerful radio loud quasars:
          1136--135,  1150+497  (\chandra),  and  0723+679 (\xmm), in the
          redshift  range  $z$=0.3--0.8. These sources are known from our
          previous \chandra snapshot survey to have kpc-scale X-ray jets.
          In  1136--135  and 1150+497, evidence is found for the presence
          of  diffuse  thermal X-ray emission around the cores, on scales
          of  40--50 kpc and with luminosity L$_{0.3-2 keV} \sim 10^{43}$
          \lum,  suggesting  thermal  emission  from the host galaxy or a
          galaxy  group.  The  X-ray  continua  of the cores in the three
          sources  are  described  by  an  upward-curved (concave) broken
          power law, with photon indices $\Gamma_{soft} \sim 1.8-2.1$ and
          $\Gamma_{hard}  \sim  1.7$  below  and  above  $\approx 2$ keV,
          respectively.  There  is  evidence for an unresolved \feka line
          with  EW $\sim$ 70 eV in the three quasars. The Spectral Energy
          Distributions  of the sources can be well described by a mix of
          jet  and  disk  emission, with the jet dominating the radio and
          hard X-rays (via synchrotron and external Compton) and the disk
          dominating the optical/UV through soft X-rays. The ratio of the
          jet-to-disk  powers  is $\sim 1$, consistent with those derived
          for a number of gamma-ray emitting blazars. This indicates that
          near  equality  of  accretion  and  jet  power may be common in
          powerful radio-loud AGN.

          Title: Coupled quintessence and curvature-assisted acceleration
          Authors: Roger Bieli
          Comments: 17 pages, no figures
          Spatially  homogeneous models with a scalar field non-minimally
          coupled  to  the space-time curvature or to the ordinary matter
          content  are  analysed  with  respect  to  late-time asymptotic
          behaviour,   in   particular   to   accelerated  expansion  and
          isotropization.  It  is  found  that  a  direct coupling to the
          curvature  leads to asymptotic de Sitter expansion in arbitrary
          exponential  potentials,  thus yielding a positive cosmological
          constant although none is apparent in the potential. This holds
          true  regardless  of  the  steepness  of  the  potential or the
          smallness  of  the coupling constant. For matter-coupled scalar
          fields,  the  asymptotics  are  obtained  for  a large class of
          positive potentials, generalizing the well-known cosmic no-hair
          theorems for minimal coupling. In this case it is observed that
          the  direct  coupling  to  matter does not impact the late-time
          dynamics essentially.

          Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          Using analytic calculations and N-body simulations we show that
          in   constant  density  (harmonic)  cores,  sinking  satellites
          undergo  an  initial  phase of very rapid (super-Chandrasekhar)
          dynamical  friction,  after  which they experience no dynamical
          friction  at all. For density profiles with a central power law
          profile  of log-slope, $-\alpha$, the infalling satellite heats
          the  background  and causes $\alpha$ to decrease. For $\alpha <
          0.5$   initially,  the  satellite  generates  a  small  central
          constant density core and stalls as in the $\alpha = 0$ case.
          We  discuss  some  astrophysical applications of our results to
          decaying   satellite  orbits,  galactic  bars  and  mergers  of
          supermassive  black hole binaries. In a companion paper we show
          that  a  central  constant  density  core can provide a natural
          solution to the timing problem for Fornax's globular clusters.

          Title:  Instability  of a stalled accretion shock: evidence for
          the advective-acoustic cycle
          Authors: T. Foglizzo, P. Galletti, L. Scheck, H.-Th. Janka
          Comments: 25 pages, 16 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We analyze the linear stability of a stalled accretion shock in
          a  perfect gas with a parametrized cooling function L~ rho^beta
          T^alpha.  A  new  formulation of the boundary conditions at the
          shock is proposed, different from Houck & Chevalier (1992). The
          instability  is  dominated  by the l=1 mode if the shock radius
          exceeds  2-3  times  the  accretor  radius,  depending  on  the
          parameters  of  the  cooling  function.  The  growth  rate  and
          oscillation  period  are  comparable  to  those observed in the
          numerical  simulations  of  Blondin  &  Mezzacappa  (2006). The
          instability  mechanism  is analyzed by separately measuring the
          efficiencies   of   the   purely   acoustic   cycle   and   the
          advective-acoustic  cycle.  These  efficiencies  are  estimated
          directly  from  the  eigenspectrum,  and  also  through  a  WKB
          analysis.  Both methods indicate that the instability is due to
          an  unstable  advective-acoustic  cycle,  and  that  the purely
          acoustic  cycle  is  stable.  These  results do not support the
          purely  acoustic interpretation of Blondin & Mezzacappa (2006).
          A  simplified  characterization of the instability is proposed,
          based  on an advective-acoustic cycle between the shock and the
          radius  r_nabla  where the velocity gradients of the stationary
          flow  are  strongest.  The importance of the coupling region in
          this   mechanism  calls  for  a  better  understanding  of  the
          conditions  for  an  efficient advective-acoustic coupling in a
          decelerated,  nonadiabatic  flow,  in  order  to  extend  these
          results to core-collapse supernovae.

          Planets in Close Binaries
          Authors: Eric Pfahl (KITP), Matt Muterspaugh (Caltech/MIT)
          Comments: 4 pages, submitted to ApJL
          Hostile  tidal  forces  may  inhibit  the  formation  of Jovian
          planets  in  binaries  with  semimajor  axes  of  $\la$$50\au$,
          binaries  that might be called ``close'' in this context. As an
          alternative to in situ planet formation, a binary can acquire a
          giant  planet when one of its original members is replaced in a
          dynamical  interaction  with  another star that hosts a planet.
          Simple  scaling  relations  for  the structure and evolution of
          star   clusters,  coupled  with  analytic  arguments  regarding
          binary-single   and  binary-binary  scattering,  indicate  that
          dynamical  processes  can  deposit  Jovian  planets in $<$1% of
          close binaries. If ongoing and future exoplanet surveys measure
          a much larger fraction, it may be that giant planets do somehow
          form frequently in such systems.

          As  part  of the Red MSX Source Survey of Massive Young Stellar
          Objects  (MYSOs)  we  have conducted multi-wavelength follow up
          observations  of  the  well-known object V645 Cygni. We present
          our  data  on  this  object,  whose  near-infrared  spectrum is
          exceptional   and   place   these   in  context  with  previous
          observations.  Our  observations  of V645 Cyg included near/mid
          infrared  imaging  observations, 13CO 2-1 line observations and
          high    signal-to-noise    velocity    resolved   near-infrared
          spectroscopy.  The  spectrum  shows  P-Cygni  hydrogen Brackett
          emission,  consistent  with  a  high  velocity  stellar wind. A
          red-shifted  emission component to a number of near-IR emission
          lines  was  also  uncovered.  This is associated with a similar
          component  in  the H alpha line. V645 Cyg is also found to have
          variable  CO first overtone bandhead emission. The data clearly
          indicate  that  the  outflow  of  V645  Cyg  is  variable.  The
          unidentified feature in a previously published optical spectrum
          is  identified  with  a receding outflow at 2000 km per second.
          The  nature  of  this  feature,  which is found in hydrogen and
          helium atomic lines and CO molecular lines remains a puzzle.

          Comments:   40   pages,  10  figures,  1  table;  accepted  for
          publication in ApJ
          Periodic  outbursts  are  observed  in  many  AGNs  and usually
          explained   with  a  supermassive  black  hole  binary  (SMBHB)
          scenario.  However,  multiple periods are observed in some AGNs
          and   cannot   be  explained  with  it.  Here  we  analyze  the
          periodicity  of  the  radio  light  curves  of  AO  0235+164 at
          multi-frequencies  and  report  the  discovery  of  six QPOs in
          integer  ratio  1:2:3:4:5:6  of  QPO  frequencies, of which the
          second  with  period  $P_2  =  (5.46 \pm 0.47) {\rm yr}$ is the
          strongest.  We  fit  the  radio  light curves and show that the
          initial  phases  of  six  QPOs  have  zero or $\pi$ differences
          relative  to  each other. We suggest a harmonic relationship of
          QPOs.  The  centroid  frequency,  relative  strength,  harmonic
          relationship   and   relative   initial   phases  of  QPOs  are
          independent  of  radio  frequency. The harmonic QPOs are likely
          due   to   the  quasi-periodic  injection  of  plasma  from  an
          oscillating  accretion  disk  into  the  jet.  We  estimate the
          supermassive  black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} \simeq (4.72\pm 2.04)
          \times  10^8  M_\odot$  and  the  accretion rate $\dot{m}\simeq
          0.007$.  With  the knowledge of accretion disk, it implies that
          the  inner  region  of  accretion  disk  of  AO  0235+164  is a
          radiatively   inefficient   accretion   flow.  The  oscillation
          accretion  is  due  to the p-mode oscillation of the thick disk
          probably  excited  by  a SMBHB. The theoretical predications of
          fundamental  oscillation  frequency  and the harmonics are well
          consistent with the observations. Harmonic QPOs would be absent
          when  the  thick  disk  becomes  geometrically  thin due to the
          increase  of  accretion rate. We discuss the observations of AO
          0235+164 basing on the SMBHB-thick disk oscillation scenario.

          Comments: 20 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  present  an  XMM-Newton observation of the eclipsing binary
          Algol  which  contains  an  X-ray dark B8V primary and an X-ray
          bright  K2IV  secondary.  The  observation  covered the optical
          secondary eclipse and captured an X-ray flare that was eclipsed
          by  the  B  star.  The  EPIC  and  RGS  spectra of Algol in its
          quiescent  state  are  described  by  a  two-temperature plasma
          model.   The   cool   component   has   a   temperature  around
          6.4$\times10^{6}$ K while that of the hot component ranges from
          2  to  4.0$\times10^{7}$  K. Coronal abundances of C, N, O, Ne,
          Mg,  Si  and  Fe  were obtained for each component for both the
          quiescent and the flare phases, with generally upper limits for
          S  and  Ar, and C, N, and O for the hot component. F-tests show
          that  the  abundances need not to be different between the cool
          and  the  hot component and between the quiescent and the flare
          phase with the exception of Fe. Whereas the Fe abundance of the
          cool   component   remains  constant  at  $\sim$0.14,  the  hot
          component  shows an Fe abundance of $\sim$0.28, which increases
          to  $\sim$0.44 during the flare. This increase is expected from
          the  chromospheric  evaporation  model.  The  absorbing  column
          density  $N_H$  of the quiescent emission is 2.5$\times10^{20}$
          cm$^{-2}$,  while that of the flare-only emission is lower than
          1.3$\times10^{20}$    cm$^{-2}$.    Together    with   previous
          observations,  this $N_H$ difference suggests that there exists
          a  belt of cool gas above the corona and the belt runs parallel
          to the equator of the K star.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          The  connection  between  the accretion process that powers AGN
          and  the  formation of jets is still poorly understood. Here we
          tackle   this   issue   using   new,  deep  \chandra  and  \xmm
          observations of the cores of three powerful radio loud quasars:
          1136--135,  1150+497  (\chandra),  and  0723+679 (\xmm), in the
          redshift  range  $z$=0.3--0.8. These sources are known from our
          previous \chandra snapshot survey to have kpc-scale X-ray jets.
          In  1136--135  and 1150+497, evidence is found for the presence
          of  diffuse  thermal X-ray emission around the cores, on scales
          of  40--50 kpc and with luminosity L$_{0.3-2 keV} \sim 10^{43}$
          \lum,  suggesting  thermal  emission  from the host galaxy or a
          galaxy  group.  The  X-ray  continua  of the cores in the three
          sources  are  described  by  an  upward-curved (concave) broken
          power law, with photon indices $\Gamma_{soft} \sim 1.8-2.1$ and
          $\Gamma_{hard}  \sim  1.7$  below  and  above  $\approx 2$ keV,
          respectively.  There  is  evidence for an unresolved \feka line
          with  EW $\sim$ 70 eV in the three quasars. The Spectral Energy
          Distributions  of the sources can be well described by a mix of
          jet  and  disk  emission, with the jet dominating the radio and
          hard X-rays (via synchrotron and external Compton) and the disk

          jet-to-disk  powers  is $\sim 1$, consistent with those derived
          for a number of gamma-ray emitting blazars. This indicates that
          near  equality  of  accretion  and  jet  power may be common in

          cluster  physics.  The  simulations  successfully reproduce the
          observed  morphologies  of  radio  sources in clusters. We find
          that   cluster  inhomogeneities  and  large  scale  flows  have
          significant  impact  on  the morphology of the radio source and
          cannot  be  ignored  a-priori  when  investigating radio source
          dynamics. Morphological comparison suggests that the gas in the
          centres of clusters like Virgo and Abell 4059 shows significant
          shear  and/or  rotation. We find that shear and rotation in the
          intra-cluster  medium  move large amounts of cold material back
          into  the  path  of  the  jet,  ensuring  that  subsequent  jet
          outbursts  encounter  a  sufficient  column  density  of gas to
          couple with the inner cluster gas, thus alleviating the problem
          of  evacuated  channels discussed in the recent literature. The
          same  effects  redistribute the excess energy Delta_E deposited
          by  the  jets, making the distribution of Delta_E at late times
          consistent with being isotropic.

          Title:   The   Starburst  Contribution  to  the  Extra-Galactic
          Gamma-Ray Background
          Authors: Todd A. Thompson, Eliot Quataert, Eli Waxman

          Cosmic  ray protons interacting with gas at the mean density of
          the  interstellar  medium  in  starburst  galaxies  lose energy
          rapidly  via  inelastic  collisions  with  ambient  nuclei. The
          resulting  pions  produce  secondary  electrons  and positrons,
          high-energy  neutrinos,  and gamma-ray photons. We estimate the
          cumulative  gamma-ray emission from starburst galaxies and find
          a  specific  intensity  at  GeV energies of (nu I_nu) ~ 3 times
          10^{-7} GeV cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1}. Starbursts may thus account
          for  a  significant  fraction  of  the extra-galactic gamma-ray
          background.  We  show that the FIR-radio correlation provides a
          strong  constraint  on  the  gamma-ray  emission from starburst
          galaxies   because   pions   decay  into  both  gamma-rays  and
          radio-emitting  electron/positron  pairs.  We  identify several
          nearby  systems  where  the  potential  for observing gamma-ray
          emission  is  the  most  favorable  (M82,  NGC  253, & IC 342),
          predict  their  fluxes,  and  predict  a  linear  FIR-gamma-ray
          correlation  for  the  densest  starbursts. If established, the
          FIR-gamma-ray correlation would provide strong evidence for the
          ``calorimeter''  theory  of the FIR-radio correlation and would
          imply  that cosmic rays in starburst galaxies interact with gas
          at  approximately  the  mean density of the interstellar medium
          (ISM), thereby providing an important constraint on the physics
          of the ISM in starbursts.

          Title:  Outgassing  of Ordinary Chondritic Material and Some of
          its  Implications  for the Chemistry of Asteroids, Planets, and
          Satellites
          Authors: Laura Schaefer, Bruce Fegley, Jr
          Comments: 72 pages, 17 figures, 3 tables; submitted to Icarus
          We  used  chemical  equilibrium  calculations  to model thermal
          outgassing  of  ordinary  chondritic  material as a function of
          temperature,  pressure,  and  bulk  compositions  and  use  our
          results to discuss outgassing on asteroids and the early Earth.
          The  calculations  include  ~1,000  solids  and  gases  of  the
          elements Al, C, Ca, Cl, Co, Cr, F, Fe, H, K, Mg, Mn, N, Na, Ni,
          O,  P,  S,  Si,  and  Ti.  The  major  outgassed volatiles from
          ordinary  chondritic material are CH4, H2, H2O, N2, and NH3(the
          latter  at conditions where hydrous minerals form). Contrary to
          widely  held  assumptions,  CO is never the major C-bearing gas
          during  ordinary  chondrite metamorphism. The calculated oxygen
          fugacity  (partial pressure) of ordinary chondritic material is
          close  to  that  of  the quartz-fayalite-iron (QFI) buffer. Our
          results  are  insensitive  to variable total pressure, variable
          volatile  element abundances, and kinetic inhibition of C and N
          dissolution in Fe metal. Our results predict that Earth's early
          atmosphere contained CH4, H2, H2O, N2, and NH3; similar to that
          used in Miller-Urey synthesis of organic compounds.

          Title: Physics of Strongly Magnetized Neutron Stars
          Authors: Alice K. Harding (GSFC), Dong Lai (Cornell)
          Comments:  93  pages.  Reports on Progress in Physics, in press
          (2006)
          There  has  recently been growing evidence for the existence of
          neutron  stars  possessing  magnetic fields with strengths that
          exceed  the  quantum  critical  field  strength  of $4.4 \times
          10^{13}$  G,  at which the cyclotron energy equals the electron
          rest  mass.  Such evidence has been provided by new discoveries
          of  radio  pulsars  having  very  high  spin-down  rates and by
          observations  of  bursting  gamma-ray sources termed magnetars.
          This article will discuss the exotic physics of this high-field
          regime,  where  a  new  array of processes becomes possible and
          even  dominant,  and  where  familiar processes acquire unusual
          properties. We review the physical processes that are important
          in  neutron  star  interiors  and magnetospheres, including the
          behavior  of  free  particles,  atoms,  molecules,  plasma  and
          condensed  matter in strong magnetic fields, photon propagation
          in  magnetized  plasmas, free-particle radiative processes, the
          physics  of  neutron  star  interiors,  and field evolution and
          decay    mechanisms.   Application   of   such   processes   in
          astrophysical   source   models,   including   rotation-powered
          pulsars,  soft gamma-ray repeaters, anomalous X-ray pulsars and
          accreting X-ray pulsars will also be discussed. Throughout this
          review,  we will highlight the observational signatures of high
          magnetic  field  processes,  as  well as the theoretical issues
          that remain to be understood.

          Title:  Constraints  on  the Accretion History of Massive Black
          Holes from Faint X-ray Counts
          Authors: Marta Volonteri, Ruben Salvaterra, Francesco Haardt
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS, 7 pages, 8 figures
          We  investigate how hierarchical models for the co-evolution of
          the  massive  black hole (MBH) and AGN population can reproduce
          the observed faint X-ray counts. We find that the main variable
          influencing  the theoretical predictions is the Eddington ratio
          of   accreting  sources.  We  compare  three  different  models
          proposed  for  the  evolution  of  AGN  Eddington ratio, f_Edd:
          constant  f_Edd=1,  f_Edd  decreasing  with redshift, and f_Edd
          depending on the AGN luminosity, as suggested by simulations of
          galactic  mergers including BHs and AGN feedback. We follow the
          full  assembly  of  MBHs and host halos from early times to the
          present  in a LambdaCDM cosmology. AGN activity is triggered by
          halo major mergers and MBHs accrete mass until they satisfy the
          observed correlation with velocity dispersion. We find that all
          three  models  can  reproduce fairly well the total faint X-ray
          counts.  The redshift distribution is however poorly matched in
          the  first two models. The Eddington ratios suggested by merger
          simulations  predicts  no  turn-off of the faint end of the AGN
          optical  luminosity function at redshifts z>=1 down to very low
          luminosity.

          Accretion  processes  in quasars and active galactic nuclei are
          still  poorly  understood,  especially as far as the connection
          between observed spectral properties and physical parameters is
          concerned.  Quasars  show  an  additional  degree of complexity
          compared    to   stars   that   is   related   to   anisotropic
          emission/obscuration  influencing  the  observed  properties in
          most  spectral  ranges.  This  complicating factor has hampered
          efforts  to  define  the  equivalent  of  an Hertzsprung-Russel
          diagram for quasars. Even if it has recently become possible to
          estimate  black hole mass and Eddington ratio for sources using
          optical  and  UV  broad  emission  lines, the results are still
          plagued by large uncertainties. Nevertheless, robust trends are
          emerging  from multivariate analysis of large spectral datasets
          of  quasars.  A  firm  observational basis is being laid out by
          accurate   measurements   of  broad  emission  line  properties
          especially when the source rest-frame is known. We consider the
          most   widely   discussed   correlations  (i.e.  the  so-called
          "eigenvector  1  parameter space" and the "Baldwin effect") and
          analyze  how  they  can  be  explained  in  terms  of accretion
          properties,  broad line region structure, and source evolution.
          We  critically  review  recent  estimates  of  black hole mass,
          accretion  rate,  spin  and  possible  orientation  indicators,
          stressing that any improvement in these parameters will provide
          a  much better understanding of the physics and dynamics of the
          region  producing the optical and UV broad emission lines. More
          accurate  measurements  of  Eddington ratio and black hole mass
          may  have  a significant impact on our ideas about evolution of
          quasar  properties  with  redshift and luminosity as well as on
          broader cosmological issues.

          Title: Mass Accretion onto T Tauri Stars
          Authors: S. G. Gregory, M. Jardine, I. Simpson, J.-F. Donati
          Comments:  17  pages,  10  figures, accepted for publication by
          MNRAS
          It  is now accepted that accretion onto classical T Tauri stars
          is  controlled  by  the stellar magnetosphere, yet to date most
          accretion  models  have  assumed that their magnetic fields are
          dipolar.  By  considering a simple steady state accretion model
          with  both  dipolar  and  complex  magnetic  fields  we  find a
          correlation between mass accretion rate and stellar mass of the
          form  $\dot{M}  \propto  M_{\ast}^{\alpha}$,  with  our results
          consistent  within observed scatter. For any particular stellar
          mass there can be several orders of magnitude difference in the
          mass  accretion  rate,  with accretion filling factors of a few
          percent.   We   demonstrate  that  the  field  geometry  has  a
          significant effect in controlling the location and distribution
          of  hot  spots,  formed  on  the  stellar surface from the high
          velocity  impact  of accreting material. We find that hot spots
          are  often  at  mid  to  low  latitudes, in contrast to what is
          expected for accretion to dipolar fields, and that particularly
          for  higher  mass  stars,  the  accretion flow is predominantly
          carried by open field lines.

          Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  have  compiled  a  complete  extragalactic  sample based on
          25,000  deg^2 to a limiting flux of 3E-11 ergs/cm**2/sec (7,000
          deg^2  to  a flux limit of 1E-11 ergs/cm**2/sec) in the 20 - 40
          keV band with INTEGRAL. We have constructed a detailed exposure
          map  to  compensate  for  effects  of non-uniform exposure. The
          flux-number  relation  is  best described by a power-law with a
          slope  of alpha = 1.66+-0.11. The integration of the cumulative
          flux  per  unit  area  leads  to f = 2.6E-10 ergs/cm**2/sec/sr,
          which is about 1% of the known 20 - 40 keV X-ray background. We
          present  the first luminosity function of AGNs in the 20-40 keV
          energy range, based on 38 extragalactic objects detected by the
          imager  IBIS/ISGRI  on-board  INTEGRAL. The luminosity function
          shows a smoothly connected two power-law form, with an index of
          gamma_1  =  0.8  below,  and  gamma_2 = 2.1 above the turn-over
          luminosity  of  L*  =  2.4E43  ergs/sec.  The emissivity of all
          INTEGRAL  AGNs  per  unit volume is W(> 1E41 ergs/sec) = 2.8E38
          ergs/sec/Mpc**3.   These  results  are  consistent  with  those
          derived  in  the  2  -  20  keV  energy  band and do not show a
          significant  contribution by Compton-thick objects. Because the
          sample  used  in this study is truly local (average z = 0.022),
          only limited conclusions can be drawn for the evolution of AGNs
          in this energy band.

          We  present  a  satellite  mission  concept to measure the dark
          energy   equation  of  state  parameter  w  with  percent-level
          precision.  The  Very  Ambitious Dark Energy Research satellite
          (VADER)  is  a  multi-wavelength  survey mission joining X-ray,
          optical,   and  IR  instruments  for  a  simultaneous  spectral
          coverage  from  4microns  (0.3eV) to 10keV over a field of view
          (FoV)  of 1 square degree. VADER combines several clean methods
          for  dark energy studies, the baryonic acoustic oscillations in
          the  galaxy and galaxy cluster power spectrum and weak lensing,
          for  a  joint  analysis  over  an unrivalled survey volume. The
          payload  consists  of  two  XMM-like  X-ray  telescopes with an
          effective area of 2,800cm^2 at 1.5keV and state-of-the-art wide
          field  DEPFET  pixel  detectors  (0.1-10keV)  in a curved focal
          plane configuration to extend the FoV. The X-ray telescopes are
          complemented  by a 1.5m optical/IR telescope with 8 instruments
          for  simultaneous  coverage  of  the  same  FoV  from  0.3 to 4
          microns.   The  8  dichroic-separated  bands  (u,g,r,z,J,H,K,L)
          provide  accurate  photometric  galaxy  redshifts,  whereas the
          diffraction-limited  resolution  of  the  central z-band allows
          precise shape measurements for cosmic shear analysis.
          The  5  year  VADER  survey will cover a contiguous sky area of
          3,500  square degrees to a depth of z~2 and will yield accurate
          photometric  redshifts  and  multi-wavelength object parameters
          for  about 175,000 galaxy clusters, one billion galaxies, and 5
          million   AGN.   VADER  will  not  only  provide  unprecedented
          constraints on the nature of dark energy, but will additionally
          extend  and  trigger a multitude of cosmic evolution studies to
          very large (>10 Gyrs) look-back times.

          Short-period binaries represent extreme cases in the generation
          of  stellar  coronae  via  a  rotational dynamo. Such stars are
          important  for  probing the origin and nature of coronae in the
          regimes  of  rapid  rotation  and  activity  saturation. VW Cep
          (P=0.28  d)  is  a  relatively bright, partially eclipsing, and
          very  active  object. Light curves made from Chandra/HETGS data
          show  flaring  and  rotational  modulation,  but  no  eclipses.
          Velocity  modulation  of  emission  lines  indicates  that  one
          component dominates the X-ray emission. The emission measure is
          highly  structured,  having  three  peaks.  Helium-like triplet
          lines  give  electron  densities  of  about  3.0E+10 - 18.0E+10
          /cm^3.  We  conclude  that  the  corona is predominantly on the
          polar regions of the primary star and compact.

          A  new  sample  of  hard X-ray sources in the Galactic Plane is
          being  revealed  by  the  regular observations performed by the
          INTEGRAL  satellite. The full characterization of these sources
          is  mandatory  to understand the hard X-ray sky. Here we report
          new  multifrequency radio, infrared and optical observations of
          the source IGR J18027-1455, as well as a multi-wavelength study
          from  radio  to  hard  X-rays.  The  radio  counterpart  of IGR
          J18027-1455  is  not  resolved  at any observing frequency. The
          radio  flux density is well fitted by a simple power law with a
          spectral  index  alpha=-0.75+/-0.02.  This  value is typical of
          optically thin non-thermal synchrotron emission originated in a
          jet. The NIR and optical spectra show redshifted emission lines
          with  z=0.034,  and a broad Halpha line profile with FWHM ~3400
          km/s.  This suggests an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) of type 1
          as  the  optical  counterpart  of  IGR  J18027-1455.  Through a
          detailed  analysis  of its overall spectral energy distribution
          we  confirm  the  Seyfert  1  nature  of  the  source, which is
          intrinsically  bright  at  high energies both in absolute terms
          and  when  scaled  to  a  normalized  6 cm luminosity. Finally,
          comparing  its  X-ray  luminosity with isotropic indicators, we
          find  that  the  source is Compton thin and AGN dominated. This
          indicates  that  INTEGRAL  might  have just seen the tip of the
          iceberg,  and  several  tens of such sources should be unveiled
          during the course of its lifetime.

          We  have  used  the HST/ACS images to identify 4700 Lyman break
          galaxies  (LBGs)  in  GOODS.  We  present  the  results  from a
          parametric analysis of the 2-D surface brightness profiles, for
          1333  LBGs  at  z  >  2.5  with rest-frame UV(1600 Angstrom) AB
          magnitude < -20.5. Based on the Sersic index, n, which measures
          the  profile  shape, we find that about 40% of LBGs at z=3 have
          light profiles close to exponential, and only 30% have the high
          concentrations  seen for spheroids. About 30% of LBGs appear to
          have  multiple  cores  or  disturbed morphologies suggestive of
          close  pairs or on-going mergers. The fraction of spheroid-like
          (n  >  2.5)  LBGs  decreases  by  about  15% from z = 5 to 3. A
          comparison  of  LBGs  with  the  starburst galaxies at z = 1.2,
          shows  that the fraction of spheroid-like profiles is about 20%
          higher  among  LBGs.  The  ellipticity  distribution  for  LBGs
          exhibits  a pronounced skew towards high ellipticities (> 0.5),
          which  cannot be explained by morphologies similar to the local
          disks  and spheroids viewed at random orientations. The peak of
          the  distribution  evolves toward lower ellipticities, from 0.7
          at  z  =  4  to  0.5  at  z = 3. At z = 1.2 the distribution is
          relatively  flat  as  seen  among the present-day galaxies. The
          dominance of elongated morphologies among LBGs suggests that in
          a   significant   fraction   of   them  we  may  be  witnessing
          star-formation  in  clumps  along  gas-rich  filaments,  or the
          earliest  gas-rich  bars  that encompass essentially the entire
          visible  galaxy. Similar features are found to be ubiquitous in
          hydrodynamical  simulations  in  which galaxy formation at high
          redshifts occurs in filamentary inflows of dynamically cold gas
          within the dark matter halos, and involves gas- rich mergers.

          Title: The Clustering of Massive Halos
          Authors:  Andrew R. Wetzel, J. D. Cohn, Martin White, Daniel E.

          Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures; submitted to ApJ
          The  clustering  properties  of  dark  matter  halos are a firm
          prediction  of  modern  theories of structure formation. We use
          two  large  volume, high-resolution N-body simulations to study
          how  the  correlation  function  of  massive  dark matter halos
          depends  upon  their  mass  and formation history. We find that
          halos   with  the  lowest  concentrations  are  presently  more
          clustered  than  those of higher concentration, the size of the
          effect increasing with halo mass; this agrees with trends found
          in  studies  of  lower mass halos. The clustering dependence on
          other  characterizations  of  the  full  mass accretion history
          appears  weaker  than  the effect with concentration. Using the
          integrated  correlation function, marked correlation functions,
          and  a  power-law  fit  to  the  correlation  function, we find
          evidence  that  halos  which  have  recently  undergone a major
          merger  or  a large mass gain have slightly enhanced clustering
          relative  to  a  randomly  chosen population with the same mass
          distribution.

          Title:   Fundamental  parameters  of  six  neglected  old  open
          clusters
          Authors:  Giovanni Carraro (UChile/Yale), Annapurni Subramaniam
          (Bangalore), Kenneth A. Janes (BU)
          Comments: in publication in MNRAS
          In  this paper we present the first $BVI$ CCD photometry of six
          overlooked  old  open clusters (Berkeley 44, NGC 6827, Berkeley
          52,  Berkeley  56, Skiff 1 and Berkeley 5) and derive estimates
          of  their  fundamental  parameters by using isochrones from the
          Padova  library  (Girardi  et  al. 2000). We found that all the
          clusters  are older than the Hyades, with ages ranging from 0.8
          (NGC 6827 and Berkeley 5) to 4.0 (Berkeley 56) Gyr. This latter
          is  one  of the old open clusters with the largest heliocentric
          distance.  In  the  field  of Skiff 1 we recognize a faint blue
          Main  Sequence  identical to the one found in the background of
          open  clusters  in  the Second and Third Galactic Quadrant, and
          routinely attributed to the Canis Major accretion event. We use
          the  synthetic  Color  Magnitude  Diagram method and a Galactic
          model to show that this population can be easily interpreted as
          Thick  Disk  and  Halo  population  toward  Skiff 1. We finally
          revise the old open clusters age distribution, showing that the
          previously  suggested  peak  at  5  Gyr  looses  importance  as
          additional old clusters are discovered.

          Title: Cosmological Evolution of the Duty Cycle of Quasars
          Authors: Jian-Min Wang, Yan-Mei Chen, Fan Zhang (IHEP, Beijing)
          Comments: Accepted by ApJL, 4 pages and 2 Figures
          Quasars are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes,
          but  the  problem  of  the  duty  cycle related to the episodic
          activity  of  the  black holes remains open as one of the major
          questions of cosmological evolution of quasars. In this Letter,
          we  obtain  quasar  duty  cycles  based  on analyses of a large
          sample composed of 10,979 quasars with redshifts $z\le2.1$ from
          the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS) Data Release Three. We
          estimate  masses  of  quasar  black holes and obtain their mass
          function (MF) of the present sample. We then get the duty cycle
          $\bar{\delta}(z)=10^{-3}\sim   1$   based  on  the  So{\l}tan's
          argument,  implying  that  black  holes are undergoing multiple
          episodic  activity.  We  find  that the duty cycle has a strong
          evolution.  By  comparison,  we show that evolution of the duty
          cycle  follows  the history of cosmic star formation rate (SFR)
          density  in  the  Universe, providing intriguing evidence for a
          natural  connection  between  star  formation and triggering of
          black hole activity. Feedback on star formation from black hole
          activity is briefly discussed.

          Title:  FUSE observations of HD 5980: The wind structure of the
          eruptor
          Authors:  Gloria  Koenigsberger,  Alexander W. Fullerton, Derck
          Massa, Lawrence H. Auer
          Comments: 19 pages, 13 figures
          HD 5980 is a unique system containing one massive star (star A)
          that  is  apparently entering the luminous blue variable phase,
          and  an  eclipsing  companion  (star  B)  that may have already
          evolved  beyond this phase to become a Wolf-Rayet star. In this
          paper we present the results from FUSE observations obtained in
          1999,  2000,  and  2002  and one far-UV observation obtained by
          ORFEUS/BEFS  in  1993  shortly  before the first eruption of HD
          5980. The eight phase-resolved spectra obtained by FUSE in 2002
          are  analyzed  in  the  context  of  a wind-eclipse model. This
          analysis  shows that the wind of the eruptor obeyed a very fast
          velocity law in 2002, which is consistent with the line-driving
          mechanism.  Large  amplitude  line-profile  variations  on  the
          orbital  period are shown to be due to the eclipse of star B by
          the  wind of star A, although the eclipse due to gas flowing in
          the  direction  of star B is absent. This can only be explained
          if  the  wind of star A is not spherically symmetric, or if the
          eclipsed  line radiation is "filled-in" by emission originating
          from  somewhere  else  in  the  system,  e.g., in the wind-wind
          collision  region.  Except for a slightly lower wind speed, the
          ORFEUS/BEFS  spectrum  is very similar to the spectrum obtained
          by  FUSE  at  the same orbital phase: there is no indication of
          the  impending eruption. However, the trend for decreasing wind
          velocity   suggests   the   occurrence  of  the  "bi-stability"
          mechanism,  which in turn implies that the restructuring of the
          circumbinary  environment  caused by the transition from "fast,
          rarefied  wind"  to  "slow,  dense  wind"  was  observed as the
          eruptive  event.  The  underlying mechanism responsible for the
          long-term  decrease  in  wind  velocity  that precipitated this
          change remains an open issue.

          Title:  Radio  and  X-ray  Properties  of  Relativistic Beaming
          Models for Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources
          Authors: M Freeland, Z Kuncic, R Soria, G V Bicknell
          Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          We  calculate  the  broadband radio--X-ray spectra predicted by
          microblazar  and  microquasar  models  for Ultra-Luminous X-ray
          sources  (ULXs),  exploring the possibility that their dominant
          power-law  component is produced by a relativistic jet, even at
          near-Eddington  mass  accretion  rates.  We  do  this  by first
          constructing  a  generalized disk--jet theoretical framework in
          which  some  fraction  of  the  total  accretion  power  Pa  is
          efficiently  removed  from  the  accretion  disk  by a magnetic
          torque responsible for jet formation. Thus, for different black
          hole   masses,  mass  accretion  rates  and  magnetic  coupling
          strength,   we   self-consistently   calculate   the   relative
          importance  of  the  modified  disk  spectrum,  as  well as the
          overall  jet emission due to synchrotron and Compton processes.
          In  general,  transferring  accretion  power to a jet makes the
          disk  fainter  and cooler than a standard disk at the same mass
          accretion   rate;  this  may  explain  why  the  soft  spectral
          component  appears  less  prominent than the dominant power-law
          component  in most bright ULXs. We show that the apparent X-ray
          luminosity  and spectrum predicted by the microquasar model are
          consistent  with  the  observed  properties  of  most  ULXs. We
          predict that the radio synchrotron jet emission is too faint to
          be  detected at the typical threshold of radio surveys to date.
          This  is  consistent  with the high rate of non-detections over
          detections   in  radio  counterpart  searches.  Conversely,  we
          conclude that the observed radio emission found associated with
          a  few ULXs cannot be due to beamed synchrotron emission from a
          relativistic jet.

          Title: A model for the infrared emission of FSC 10214+4724
          Authors: Andreas Efstathiou
          Comments:  5  pages,  4  figures, accepted for publication as a
          MNRAS Letter
          A  model  for  the  infrared  emission  of  the  high  redshift
          ultraluminous  infrared galaxy FSC 10214+4724 is presented. The
          model  assumes  three  components  of  emission:  a dusty torus
          viewed edge-on, clouds that are associated with the narrow-line
          region and a highly obscured starburst. It is demonstrated that
          the  presence  of  clouds  in  the  narrow-line  region, with a
          covering  factor  of  17%,  can  explain  why  the mid-infrared
          spectrum of FSC 10214+4724 shows a silicate feature in emission
          despite  the  fact that its torus is viewed edge-on. It is also
          shown  that  the same model, but with the torus viewed face-on,
          predicts  a  spectrum  with  silicate emission features that is
          characteristic of the spectra of quasars recently observed with
          Spitzer.

          Title:  The  Einstein  Ring  0047-2808  Revisited:  A  Bayesian
          Inversion
          Authors: Brendon J. Brewer, Geraint F. Lewis
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          In  a  previous  paper,  we  outlined a new Bayesian method for
          inferring  the  properties  of  extended  gravitational lenses,
          given  data  in  the form of resolved images. This method holds
          the  most promise for optimally extracting information from the
          observed  image, whilst providing reliable uncertainties in all
          parameters.  Here,  we  apply  the  method  to the well studied
          optical  Einstein  ring  0047-2808.  Our  results  are in broad
          agreement  with  previous  studies,  showing  that  the density
          profile  of  the lensing galaxy is aligned within a few degrees
          of the light profile, and suggesting that the source galaxy (at
          redshift  3.6) is a binary system, although its size is only of
          order  1-2  kpc.  We  also find that the mass of the elliptical
          lensing galaxy enclosed by the image is
          (2.91$\pm$0.01)$\times10^{11}$  M$_{\sun}$.  Our method is able
          to  achieve improved resolution for the source reconstructions,
          although  we  also  find  that  some  of  the uncertainties are
          greater  than  has  been found in previous analyses, due to the
          inclusion of extra pixels and a more general lens model.

          Title: Masses and angular momenta of contact binary stars
          Authors: K. D. Gazeas, P. G. Niarchos
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, accepted in MNRAS
          Results  are  presented  on component masses and system angular
          momenta for over a hundred low-temperature contact binaries. It
          is  found that the secondary components in close binary systems
          are  very  similar in mass. Our observational evidence strongly
          supports  the  argument that the evolutionary process goes from
          near-contact  binaries  to A-type contact binaries, without any
          need   of   mass   loss   from  the  system.  Furthermore,  the
          evolutionary  direction  of  A-type  into W-type systems with a
          simultaneous  mass and angular momentum loss is also discussed.
          The opposite direction of evolution seems to be unlikely, since
          it  requires  an  increase  of  the  total mass and the angular
          momentum of the system.

          Eds. A. De Koter, LJ Smith & R Waters
          Physical  and  wind  properties  of  Galactic B supergiants are
          presented  based upon non-LTE line blanketed model atmospheres,
          including  Sher  25  toward  the  NGC  3603 cluster. We compare
          Halpha  derived  wind  densities  with recent results for SMC B
          supergiants  and generally confirm theoretical expectations for
          stronger  winds  amongst Galactic supergiants. Mid B supergiant
          winds  are  substantially  weaker than predictions from current
          radiatively  driven wind theory, a problem which is exacerbated
          if winds are already clumped in the Halpha line forming region.
          We  find  that  the  so-called `bistability jump' at B1 (Teff ~
          21kK)  from  Lamers  et  al.  is rather a more gradual downward
          trend.  CNO  elemental  abundances,  including  Sher 25, reveal
          partially  processed  material  at  their surfaces. In general,
          these  are  in good agreement with evolutionary predictions for
          blue  supergiants  evolving  redward  accounting for rotational
          mixing.  A few cases, including HD 152236 (zeta^1 Sco), exhibit
          strongly  processed  material which is more typical of Luminous
          Blue  Variables.  Our  derived  photospheric  [N/O]  ratio  for
          Sher~25  agrees  with  that  for  its ejecta nebula, although a
          higher degree of CNO processing would be expected if the nebula
          originated  during  a red supergiant phase, as is suspected for
          the  ring  nebula  ejected by the B supergiant progenitor of SN
          1987A,  Sk-69  202.  Sher  25  has  an inferred age of ~5Myr in
          contrast  with  ~2Myr for HD 97950, the ionizing cluster of NGC
          3603.  Sher  25  may  be  a  foreground  object or close binary
          evolution  could be responsible for its unusual location in the
          H-R diagram.

          The  optical/near-infrared  (OIR)  region  of  the  spectra  of
          low-mass X-ray binaries appears to lie at the intersection of a
          variety  of  different  emission  processes.  In  this paper we
          present  quasi-simultaneous  OIR - X-ray observations of 33 XBs
          in an attempt to estimate the contributions of various emission
          processes  in  these  sources, as a function of X-ray state and
          luminosity. A global correlation is found between OIR and X-ray
          luminosity for low-mass black hole candidate XBs (BHXBs) in the
          hard  X-ray state, of the form L_OIR is proportional to Lx^0.6.
          This  correlation  holds  over  8 orders of magnitude in Lx and
          includes  data  from BHXBs in quiescence and at large distances
          (LMC  and  M31).  A  similar  correlation  is found in low-mass
          neutron  star  XBs  (NSXBs) in the hard state. For BHXBs in the
          soft state, all the near-infrared (NIR) and some of the optical
          emission  is  suppressed  below  the  correlation,  a behaviour
          indicative  of  the  jet switching off/on in transition to/from
          the  soft  state.  We  compare  these  relations to theoretical
          models  of  a  number of emission processes. We find that X-ray
          reprocessing  in  the  disc  and  emission  from  the jets both
          predict  a slope close to 0.6 for BHXBs, and both contribute to
          the  OIR  in  BHXBs  in  the hard state, the jets producing ~90
          percent  of  the  NIR  emission  at  high  luminosities.  X-ray
          reprocessing dominates the OIR in NSXBs in the hard state, with
          possible  contributions from the jets (only at high luminosity)
          and  the viscously heated disc. We also show that the optically
          thick  jet  spectrum  of  BHXBs  extends  to  near  the K-band.

          We  consider  the techniques to distinguish normal star forming
          (NSF)  galaxies  and  active  galactic nuclei (AGN) hosts using
          optical  spectra. The observational data base is a set of 20000
          galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, for which
          we   have   determined  the  emission  line  intensities  after
          subtracting   the  stellar  continuum  obtained  from  spectral
          synthesis.  Our  analysis  is  based  on photoionization models
          computed  using  the  stellar  ionizing  radiation predicted by
          Starburst 99 and, for the AGNs, a broken power-law spectrum. We
          explain  why, among the four classical emission line diagnostic
          diagrams,  the  [OIII]/Hb  vs  [NII]/Ha one works best. We show
          however,  that none of these diagrams is efficient in detecting
          AGNs  in  metal  poor  galaxies,  should  such  cases exist. We
          propose  a  new divisory line between ``pure'' NSF galaxies and
          AGN  hosts. We also show that a classification into NSF and AGN
          galaxies  using  only [NII]/Ha is feasible and useful. Finally,
          we  propose  a  new  classification  diagram,  the DEW diagram,
          plotting  D_n(4000) vs max(EW[OII],EW[NeIII]). This diagram can
          be  used with optical spectra for galaxies with redshifts up to
          z  =  1.3,  meaning  an important progress over classifications
          proposed up to now. Since the DEW diagram requires only a small
          range  in  wavelength,  it  can  also  be  used  at even larger
          redshifts  in  suitable  atmospheric  windows.  It also has the
          advantage  of  not  requiring  stellar  synthesis  analysis  to
          subtract  the stars and of allowing one to see ALL the galaxies
          in the same diagram, including passive galaxies.

          Seyfert 1 galaxy IGR J18027-1455

          A  new  sample  of  hard X-ray sources in the Galactic Plane is
          being  revealed  by  the  regular observations performed by the
          INTEGRAL  satellite. The full characterization of these sources
          is  mandatory  to understand the hard X-ray sky. Here we report
          new  multifrequency radio, infrared and optical observations of
          the source IGR J18027-1455, as well as a multi-wavelength study
          from  radio  to  hard  X-rays.  The  radio  counterpart  of IGR
          J18027-1455  is  not  resolved  at any observing frequency. The
          radio  flux density is well fitted by a simple power law with a
          spectral  index  alpha=-0.75+/-0.02.  This  value is typical of
          optically thin non-thermal synchrotron emission originated in a
          jet. The NIR and optical spectra show redshifted emission lines
          with  z=0.034,  and a broad Halpha line profile with FWHM ~3400
          km/s.  This suggests an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) of type 1
          as  the  optical  counterpart  of  IGR  J18027-1455.  Through a
          detailed  analysis  of its overall spectral energy distribution
          we  confirm  the  Seyfert  1  nature  of  the  source, which is
          intrinsically  bright  at  high energies both in absolute terms
          and  when  scaled  to  a  normalized  6 cm luminosity. Finally,
          comparing  its  X-ray  luminosity with isotropic indicators, we
          find  that  the  source is Compton thin and AGN dominated. This
          indicates  that  INTEGRAL  might  have just seen the tip of the
          iceberg,  and  several  tens of such sources should be unveiled
          during the course of its lifetime.

          We  have  used  the HST/ACS images to identify 4700 Lyman break
          galaxies  (LBGs)  in  GOODS.  We  present  the  results  from a
          parametric analysis of the 2-D surface brightness profiles, for
          1333  LBGs  at  z  >  2.5  with rest-frame UV(1600 Angstrom) AB
          magnitude < -20.5. Based on the Sersic index, n, which measures
          the  profile  shape, we find that about 40% of LBGs at z=3 have
          light profiles close to exponential, and only 30% have the high
          concentrations  seen for spheroids. About 30% of LBGs appear to
          have  multiple  cores  or  disturbed morphologies suggestive of
          close  pairs or on-going mergers. The fraction of spheroid-like
          (n  >  2.5)  LBGs  decreases  by  about  15% from z = 5 to 3. A
          comparison  of  LBGs  with  the  starburst galaxies at z = 1.2,
          shows  that the fraction of spheroid-like profiles is about 20%
          higher  among  LBGs.  The  ellipticity  distribution  for  LBGs
          exhibits  a pronounced skew towards high ellipticities (> 0.5),
          which  cannot be explained by morphologies similar to the local
          disks  and spheroids viewed at random orientations. The peak of
          the  distribution  evolves toward lower ellipticities, from 0.7
          at  z  =  4  to  0.5  at  z = 3. At z = 1.2 the distribution is
          relatively  flat  as  seen  among the present-day galaxies. The
          dominance of elongated morphologies among LBGs suggests that in
          a   significant   fraction   of   them  we  may  be  witnessing
          star-formation  in  clumps  along  gas-rich  filaments,  or the
          earliest  gas-rich  bars  that encompass essentially the entire
          visible  galaxy. Similar features are found to be ubiquitous in
          hydrodynamical  simulations  in  which galaxy formation at high
          redshifts occurs in filamentary inflows of dynamically cold gas
          within the dark matter halos, and involves gas- rich mergers.

          Title: The Clustering of Massive Halos
          Authors:  Andrew R. Wetzel, J. D. Cohn, Martin White, Daniel E.

          Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures; submitted to ApJ
          The  clustering  properties  of  dark  matter  halos are a firm
          prediction  of  modern  theories of structure formation. We use
          two  large  volume, high-resolution N-body simulations to study
          how  the  correlation  function  of  massive  dark matter halos
          depends  upon  their  mass  and formation history. We find that
          halos   with  the  lowest  concentrations  are  presently  more
          clustered  than  those of higher concentration, the size of the
          effect increasing with halo mass; this agrees with trends found
          in  studies  of  lower mass halos. The clustering dependence on
          other  characterizations  of  the  full  mass accretion history
          appears  weaker  than  the effect with concentration. Using the
          integrated  correlation function, marked correlation functions,
          and  a  power-law  fit  to  the  correlation  function, we find
          evidence  that  halos  which  have  recently  undergone a major
          merger  or  a large mass gain have slightly enhanced clustering
          relative  to  a  randomly  chosen population with the same mass
          distribution.

          Title:   Fundamental  parameters  of  six  neglected  old  open
          clusters
          Authors:  Giovanni Carraro (UChile/Yale), Annapurni Subramaniam
          (Bangalore), Kenneth A. Janes (BU)
          Comments: in publication in MNRAS
          In  this paper we present the first $BVI$ CCD photometry of six
          overlooked  old  open clusters (Berkeley 44, NGC 6827, Berkeley
          52,  Berkeley  56, Skiff 1 and Berkeley 5) and derive estimates
          of  their  fundamental  parameters by using isochrones from the
          Padova  library  (Girardi  et  al. 2000). We found that all the
          clusters  are older than the Hyades, with ages ranging from 0.8
          (NGC 6827 and Berkeley 5) to 4.0 (Berkeley 56) Gyr. This latter
          is  one  of the old open clusters with the largest heliocentric
          distance.  In  the  field  of Skiff 1 we recognize a faint blue
          Main  Sequence  identical to the one found in the background of
          open  clusters  in  the Second and Third Galactic Quadrant, and
          routinely attributed to the Canis Major accretion event. We use
          the  synthetic  Color  Magnitude  Diagram method and a Galactic
          model to show that this population can be easily interpreted as
          Thick  Disk  and  Halo  population  toward  Skiff 1. We finally
          revise the old open clusters age distribution, showing that the
          previously  suggested  peak  at  5  Gyr  looses  importance  as
          additional old clusters are discovered.

          Title: Cosmological Evolution of the Duty Cycle of Quasars
          Authors: Jian-Min Wang, Yan-Mei Chen, Fan Zhang (IHEP, Beijing)
          Comments: Accepted by ApJL, 4 pages and 2 Figures
          Quasars are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes,
          but  the  problem  of  the  duty  cycle related to the episodic
          activity  of  the  black holes remains open as one of the major
          questions of cosmological evolution of quasars. In this Letter,
          we  obtain  quasar  duty  cycles  based  on analyses of a large
          sample composed of 10,979 quasars with redshifts $z\le2.1$ from
          the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS) Data Release Three. We
          estimate  masses  of  quasar  black holes and obtain their mass
          function (MF) of the present sample. We then get the duty cycle
          $\bar{\delta}(z)=10^{-3}\sim   1$   based  on  the  So{\l}tan's
          argument,  implying  that  black  holes are undergoing multiple
          episodic  activity.  We  find  that the duty cycle has a strong
          evolution.  By  comparison,  we show that evolution of the duty
          cycle  follows  the history of cosmic star formation rate (SFR)
          density  in  the  Universe, providing intriguing evidence for a
          natural  connection  between  star  formation and triggering of
          black hole activity. Feedback on star formation from black hole
          activity is briefly discussed.

          Title:  FUSE observations of HD 5980: The wind structure of the
          eruptor
          Authors:  Gloria  Koenigsberger,  Alexander W. Fullerton, Derck
          Massa, Lawrence H. Auer
          Comments: 19 pages, 13 figures
          HD 5980 is a unique system containing one massive star (star A)
          that  is  apparently entering the luminous blue variable phase,
          and  an  eclipsing  companion  (star  B)  that may have already
          evolved  beyond this phase to become a Wolf-Rayet star. In this
          paper we present the results from FUSE observations obtained in
          1999,  2000,  and  2002  and one far-UV observation obtained by
          ORFEUS/BEFS  in  1993  shortly  before the first eruption of HD
          5980. The eight phase-resolved spectra obtained by FUSE in 2002
          are  analyzed  in  the  context  of  a wind-eclipse model. This
          analysis  shows that the wind of the eruptor obeyed a very fast
          velocity law in 2002, which is consistent with the line-driving
          mechanism.  Large  amplitude  line-profile  variations  on  the
          orbital  period are shown to be due to the eclipse of star B by
          the  wind of star A, although the eclipse due to gas flowing in
          the  direction  of star B is absent. This can only be explained
          if  the  wind of star A is not spherically symmetric, or if the
          eclipsed  line radiation is "filled-in" by emission originating
          from  somewhere  else  in  the  system,  e.g., in the wind-wind
          collision  region.  Except for a slightly lower wind speed, the
          ORFEUS/BEFS  spectrum  is very similar to the spectrum obtained
          by  FUSE  at  the same orbital phase: there is no indication of
          the  impending eruption. However, the trend for decreasing wind
          velocity   suggests   the   occurrence  of  the  "bi-stability"
          mechanism,  which in turn implies that the restructuring of the
          circumbinary  environment  caused by the transition from "fast,
          rarefied  wind"  to  "slow,  dense  wind"  was  observed as the
          eruptive  event.  The  underlying mechanism responsible for the
          long-term  decrease  in  wind  velocity  that precipitated this
          change remains an open issue.

          Title:  Radio  and  X-ray  Properties  of  Relativistic Beaming
          Models for Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources
          Authors: M Freeland, Z Kuncic, R Soria, G V Bicknell
          Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          We  calculate  the  broadband radio--X-ray spectra predicted by
          microblazar  and  microquasar  models  for Ultra-Luminous X-ray
          sources  (ULXs),  exploring the possibility that their dominant
          power-law  component is produced by a relativistic jet, even at
          near-Eddington  mass  accretion  rates.  We  do  this  by first
          constructing  a  generalized disk--jet theoretical framework in
          which  some  fraction  of  the  total  accretion  power  Pa  is
          efficiently  removed  from  the  accretion  disk  by a magnetic
          torque responsible for jet formation. Thus, for different black
          hole   masses,  mass  accretion  rates  and  magnetic  coupling
          strength,   we   self-consistently   calculate   the   relative
          importance  of  the  modified  disk  spectrum,  as  well as the
          overall  jet emission due to synchrotron and Compton processes.
          In  general,  transferring  accretion  power to a jet makes the
          disk  fainter  and cooler than a standard disk at the same mass
          accretion   rate;  this  may  explain  why  the  soft  spectral
          component  appears  less  prominent than the dominant power-law
          component  in most bright ULXs. We show that the apparent X-ray
          luminosity  and spectrum predicted by the microquasar model are
          consistent  with  the  observed  properties  of  most  ULXs. We
          predict that the radio synchrotron jet emission is too faint to
          be  detected at the typical threshold of radio surveys to date.
          This  is  consistent  with the high rate of non-detections over
          detections   in  radio  counterpart  searches.  Conversely,  we
          conclude that the observed radio emission found associated with
          a  few ULXs cannot be due to beamed synchrotron emission from a
          relativistic jet.

          Title: A model for the infrared emission of FSC 10214+4724
          Authors: Andreas Efstathiou
          Comments:  5  pages,  4  figures, accepted for publication as a
          MNRAS Letter
          A  model  for  the  infrared  emission  of  the  high  redshift
          ultraluminous  infrared galaxy FSC 10214+4724 is presented. The
          model  assumes  three  components  of  emission:  a dusty torus
          viewed edge-on, clouds that are associated with the narrow-line
          region and a highly obscured starburst. It is demonstrated that
          the  presence  of  clouds  in  the  narrow-line  region, with a
          covering  factor  of  17%,  can  explain  why  the mid-infrared
          spectrum of FSC 10214+4724 shows a silicate feature in emission
          despite  the  fact that its torus is viewed edge-on. It is also
          shown  that  the same model, but with the torus viewed face-on,
          predicts  a  spectrum  with  silicate emission features that is
          characteristic of the spectra of quasars recently observed with
          Spitzer.

          Title:  The  Einstein  Ring  0047-2808  Revisited:  A  Bayesian
          Inversion
          Authors: Brendon J. Brewer, Geraint F. Lewis
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          In  a  previous  paper,  we  outlined a new Bayesian method for
          inferring  the  properties  of  extended  gravitational lenses,
          given  data  in  the form of resolved images. This method holds
          the  most promise for optimally extracting information from the
          observed  image, whilst providing reliable uncertainties in all
          parameters.  Here,  we  apply  the  method  to the well studied
          optical  Einstein  ring  0047-2808.  Our  results  are in broad
          agreement  with  previous  studies,  showing  that  the density
          profile  of  the lensing galaxy is aligned within a few degrees
          of the light profile, and suggesting that the source galaxy (at
          redshift  3.6) is a binary system, although its size is only of
          order  1-2  kpc.  We  also find that the mass of the elliptical
          lensing galaxy enclosed by the image is
          (2.91$\pm$0.01)$\times10^{11}$  M$_{\sun}$.  Our method is able
          to  achieve improved resolution for the source reconstructions,
          although  we  also  find  that  some  of  the uncertainties are
          greater  than  has  been found in previous analyses, due to the
          inclusion of extra pixels and a more general lens model.

          Title: Masses and angular momenta of contact binary stars
          Authors: K. D. Gazeas, P. G. Niarchos
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, accepted in MNRAS
          Results  are  presented  on component masses and system angular
          momenta for over a hundred low-temperature contact binaries. It
          is  found that the secondary components in close binary systems
          are  very  similar in mass. Our observational evidence strongly
          supports  the  argument that the evolutionary process goes from
          near-contact  binaries  to A-type contact binaries, without any
          need   of   mass   loss   from  the  system.  Furthermore,  the
          evolutionary  direction  of  A-type  into W-type systems with a
          simultaneous  mass and angular momentum loss is also discussed.
          The opposite direction of evolution seems to be unlikely, since
          it  requires  an  increase  of  the  total mass and the angular
          momentum of the system.

          presented  based upon non-LTE line blanketed model atmospheres,
          including  Sher  25  toward  the  NGC  3603 cluster. We compare
          Halpha  derived  wind  densities  with recent results for SMC B
          supergiants  and generally confirm theoretical expectations for
          stronger  winds  amongst Galactic supergiants. Mid B supergiant
          winds  are  substantially  weaker than predictions from current
          radiatively  driven wind theory, a problem which is exacerbated
          if winds are already clumped in the Halpha line forming region.
          We  find  that  the  so-called `bistability jump' at B1 (Teff ~
          21kK)  from  Lamers  et  al.  is rather a more gradual downward
          trend.  CNO  elemental  abundances,  including  Sher 25, reveal
          partially  processed  material  at  their surfaces. In general,
          these  are  in good agreement with evolutionary predictions for
          blue  supergiants  evolving  redward  accounting for rotational
          mixing.  A few cases, including HD 152236 (zeta^1 Sco), exhibit
          strongly  processed  material which is more typical of Luminous
          Blue  Variables.  Our  derived  photospheric  [N/O]  ratio  for
          Sher~25  agrees  with  that  for  its ejecta nebula, although a
          higher degree of CNO processing would be expected if the nebula
          originated  during  a red supergiant phase, as is suspected for
          the  ring  nebula  ejected by the B supergiant progenitor of SN
          1987A,  Sk-69  202.  Sher  25  has  an inferred age of ~5Myr in
          contrast  with  ~2Myr for HD 97950, the ionizing cluster of NGC
          3603.  Sher  25  may  be  a  foreground  object or close binary
          evolution  could be responsible for its unusual location in the
          H-R diagram.

          The  optical/near-infrared  (OIR)  region  of  the  spectra  of
          low-mass X-ray binaries appears to lie at the intersection of a
          variety  of  different  emission  processes.  In  this paper we
          present  quasi-simultaneous  OIR - X-ray observations of 33 XBs
          in an attempt to estimate the contributions of various emission
          processes  in  these  sources, as a function of X-ray state and
          luminosity. A global correlation is found between OIR and X-ray
          luminosity for low-mass black hole candidate XBs (BHXBs) in the
          hard  X-ray state, of the form L_OIR is proportional to Lx^0.6.
          This  correlation  holds  over  8 orders of magnitude in Lx and
          includes  data  from BHXBs in quiescence and at large distances
          (LMC  and  M31).  A  similar  correlation  is found in low-mass
          neutron  star  XBs  (NSXBs) in the hard state. For BHXBs in the
          soft state, all the near-infrared (NIR) and some of the optical
          emission  is  suppressed  below  the  correlation,  a behaviour
          indicative  of  the  jet switching off/on in transition to/from
          the  soft  state.  We  compare  these  relations to theoretical
          models  of  a  number of emission processes. We find that X-ray
          reprocessing  in  the  disc  and  emission  from  the jets both
          predict  a slope close to 0.6 for BHXBs, and both contribute to
          the  OIR  in  BHXBs  in  the hard state, the jets producing ~90
          percent  of  the  NIR  emission  at  high  luminosities.  X-ray
          reprocessing dominates the OIR in NSXBs in the hard state, with
          possible  contributions from the jets (only at high luminosity)
          and  the viscously heated disc. We also show that the optically
          thick  jet  spectrum  of  BHXBs  extends  to  near  the K-band.

          Title:  Semi-empirical  analysis  of  Sloan  Digital Sky Survey
          galaxies III. How to distinguish AGN hosts
          Authors:  G.  Stasinska,  R. Cid Fernandes, A. Mateus, L. Sodre

          Comments:  14  pages,  9  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We  consider  the techniques to distinguish normal star forming
          (NSF)  galaxies  and  active  galactic nuclei (AGN) hosts using
          optical  spectra. The observational data base is a set of 20000
          galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, for which
          we   have   determined  the  emission  line  intensities  after
          subtracting   the  stellar  continuum  obtained  from  spectral
          synthesis.  Our  analysis  is  based  on photoionization models
          computed  using  the  stellar  ionizing  radiation predicted by
          Starburst 99 and, for the AGNs, a broken power-law spectrum. We
          explain  why, among the four classical emission line diagnostic
          diagrams,  the  [OIII]/Hb  vs  [NII]/Ha one works best. We show
          however,  that none of these diagrams is efficient in detecting
          AGNs  in  metal  poor  galaxies,  should  such  cases exist. We
          propose  a  new divisory line between ``pure'' NSF galaxies and
          AGN  hosts. We also show that a classification into NSF and AGN
          galaxies  using  only [NII]/Ha is feasible and useful. Finally,
          we  propose  a  new  classification  diagram,  the DEW diagram,
          plotting  D_n(4000) vs max(EW[OII],EW[NeIII]). This diagram can
          be  used with optical spectra for galaxies with redshifts up to
          z  =  1.3,  meaning  an important progress over classifications
          proposed up to now. Since the DEW diagram requires only a small
          range  in  wavelength,  it  can  also  be  used  at even larger
          redshifts  in  suitable  atmospheric  windows.  It also has the
          advantage  of  not  requiring  stellar  synthesis  analysis  to
          subtract  the stars and of allowing one to see ALL the galaxies
          in the same diagram, including passive galaxies.

          We  study  the  process  of  mass  segregation  through  2-body
          relaxation in galactic nuclei with a central massive black hole
          (MBH).  This  study  has  bearing on a variety of astrophysical
          questions,  from  the  distribution  of  X-ray  binaries at the
          Galactic  centre,  to  tidal  disruptions  of main-sequence and
          giant  stars,  to inspirals of compact objects into the MBH, an
          important  category  of  events  for  the  future  space  borne
          gravitational  wave  interferometer  LISA.  In relatively small
          galactic nuclei, typical hosts of MBHs with masses in the range
          1e4-1e7  Msun,  the relaxation induces the formation of a steep
          density  cusp around the MBH and strong mass segregation. Using
          a spherical stellar dynamical Monte-Carlo code, we simulate the
          long-term  relaxational  evolution  of  galactic nucleus models
          with   a   spectrum   of  stellar  masses.  Our  focus  is  the
          concentration  of stellar black holes to the immediate vicinity
          of  the  MBH. Special attention is given to models developed to
          match the conditions in the Milky Way nucleus.

          protostellar accretion rate
          Authors: Brian W. O'Shea, Michael L. Norman
          Comments:  Submitted  to The Astrophysical Journal. 59 pages, 3
          tables, 21 figures (3 color). Comments welcome
          (abridged)  We  perform  12  extremely high resolution adaptive
          mesh   refinement   cosmological  hydrodynamic  simulations  of
          Population III star formation in a Lambda CDM universe, varying
          the   box   size   and  large-scale  structure,  to  understand
          systematic  effects in the formation of primordial protostellar
          cores.  We find results that are qualitatively similar to those
          observed  previously.  We  observe that the threshold halo mass
          for  formation  of  a  Population III protostar does not evolve
          significantly with time in the redshift range studied (33 > z >
          19)  but  exhibits  substantial  scatter  due to different halo
          assembly  histories:  Halos which assembled more slowly develop
          cooling  cores  at  lower  mass  than  those that assemble more
          rapidly,  in  agreement  with  Yoshida  et  al.  (2003). We do,
          however,  observe  significant evolution in the accretion rates
          of  Population  III protostars with redshift, with objects that
          form  later  having  higher  maximum  accretion  rates,  with a
          variation   of   two   orders   of  magnitude  (10^-4  -  10^-2
          Msolar/year). This can be explained by considering the evolving
          virial properties of the halos with redshift and the physics of
          molecular  hydrogen  formation  at  low  densities.  Our result
          implies  that  the  mass  distribution  of Population III stars
          inferred  from  their  accretion  rates  may  be  broader  than
          previously  thought,  and may evolve with redshift. Finally, we
          observe  that  our  collapsing  protostellar cloud cores do not
          fragment, consistent with previous results, which suggests that
          Population  III  stars  which form in halos of mass 10^5 - 10^6
          Msun always form in isolation.

          We  report  on detailed spectroscopic studies performed for the
          secondary  star  in  the black hole binary (micro-quasar) V4641
          Sgr in order to examine its surface chemical composition and to
          see  if  its surface shows any signature of pollution by ejecta
          from  a  supernova  explosion. High-resolution spectra of V4641
          Sgr  observed  in the quiescent state in the blue-visual region
          are compared with those of the two bright well-studied B9 stars
          (14  Cyg  and $\nu$ Cap) observed with the same instrument. The
          effective  temperature  of  V4641  Sgr  (10500  $\pm$ 200 K) is
          estimated  from  the  strengths  of He~{\sc i} lines, while its
          rotational  velocity,  $\it  v$  sin  $\it  i$  (95 $\pm$ 10 km
          s${}^{-1}$),  is  estimated from the profile of the Mg~{\sc ii}
          line  at 4481 \AA. We obtain abundances of 10 elements and find
          definite  over-abundances  of N (by 0.8 dex or more) and Na (by
          0.8  dex)  in V4641 Sgr. From line-by-line comparisons of eight
          other elements (C, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ti, Cr, and Fe) between V4641
          Sgr  and  the two reference stars, we conclude that there is no
          apparent difference in the abundances of these elements between
          V4641 Sgr and the two normal late B-type stars, which have been
          reported  to  have solar abundances. An evolutionary model of a
          massive close binary system has been constructed to explain the
          abundances  observed  in V4641 Sgr. The model suggests that the
          progenitor  of  the black hole forming supernova was as massive
          as  ~  35  Msun on the main-sequence and, after becoming a ~ 10
          Msun  He  star, underwent "dark" explosion which ejected only N
          and  Na-rich  outer  layer  of  the He star without radioactive
          $^{56}$Ni.

          Shocks and blastwaves are expected to be driven driven into the
          intracluster  medium  filling  galaxy  groups  and  clusters by
          powerful  outbursts of active galactic nuclei or quasars in the
          member galaxies; the first footprints of shock fronts have been
          tentatively   traced  out  with  X-ray  imaging.  We  show  how
          overpressures in the blasts behind the shock can prove the case
          and  also  provide  specific marks of the nuclear activity: its
          strength,  its  current stage, and the nature of its prevailing
          output.  We  propose  to  detect  these  marks  with  the aimed
          pressure  probe  constituted by the resolved Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
          effect.  We  compute and discuss the outcomes to be expected in
          nearby  and  distant  sources  at  different  stages  of  their
          activity.

          We  present  results  from  quantitative  modeling and spectral
          analysis  of  the high mass X-ray binary Vela X-1 obtained with
          the  Chandra  HETGS.  The  spectra  exhibit emission lines from
          H-like  and  He-like ions driven by photoionization, as well as
          fluorescent  emission  lines  from  several  elements  in lower
          charge  states.  In order to interpret and make full use of the
          high-quality   data,  we  have  developed  a  simulator,  which
          calculates  the  ionization  and thermal structure of a stellar
          wind  photoionized by an X-ray source, and performs Monte Carlo
          simulations  of X-ray photons propagating through the wind. The
          emergent spectra are then computed as a function of the viewing
          angle  accurately  accounting  for  photon  transport  in three
          dimensions including dynamics. From comparisons of the observed
          spectra  with  the  simulation results, we are able to find the
          ionization   structure  and  the  geometrical  distribution  of
          material  in  Vela X-1 that can reproduce the observed spectral
          line  intensities  and  continuum  shapes  at different orbital
          phases  remarkably  well.  It is found that a large fraction of
          X-ray emission lines from highly ionized ions are formed in the
          region between the neutron star and the companion star. We also
          find  that  the  fluorescent X-ray lines must be produced in at
          least  three  distinct  regions --(1)the extended stellar wind,
          (2)reflection   off   the  stellar  photosphere,  and  (3)in  a
          distribution  of dense material partially covering and possibly
          trailing  the  neutron  star,  which  may be associated with an
          accretion wake. Finally, from detailed analysis of the emission
          lines,  we  demonstrate  that  the  stellar wind is affected by
          X-ray photoionization.

          Title:  Can  We Trust the Dust? Evidence of Dust Segregation in
          Molecular Clouds
          Authors:  Paolo  Padoan,  Laurent Cambresy, Mika Juvela, Alexei
          Kritsuk, William D. Langer, Michael L. Norman
          Comments: 10 pages, 8 figures included, ApJ, in press
          Maps  of  estimated dust column density in molecular clouds are
          usually  assumed to reliably trace the total gas column density
          structure.  In  this  work  we  present results showing a clear
          discrepancy  between  the  dust and the gas distribution in the
          Taurus  molecular  cloud complex. We compute the power spectrum
          of  a  2MASS extinction map of the Taurus region and find it is
          much  shallower  than  the  power spectrum of a 13CO map of the
          same  region  previously  analyzed.  This  discrepancy  may  be
          explained as the effect of grain growth on the grain extinction
          efficiency. However, this would require a wide range of maximum
          grain  sizes,  which is ruled out based on constraints from the
          extinction  curve  and the available grain models. We show that
          major  effects due to CO formation and depletion are also ruled
          out.   Our  result  may  therefore  suggest  the  existence  of
          intrinsic  spatial  fluctuations of the dust to gas ratio, with
          amplitude increasing toward smaller scales. Preliminary results
          of  numerical simulations of trajectories of inertial particles

          Title: Intergalactic CIV absorption at redshifts 5.4 to 6
          Authors:  Emma  V. Ryan-Weber (1), Max Pettini (1), Piero Madau

          on June 28th
          We  report  the  discovery of a strong CIV 1548,1550 absorption
          system at z_abs = 5.7238 in the near-infrared spectrum (J-band)
          of  the  z_em  =  6.28 QSO SDSS J1030+0524. These observations,
          obtained  with  the  Infrared  Spectrometer  And  Array  Camera
          (ISAAC)   on  the  European  Southern  Observatory  Very  Large
          Telescope    (ESO   VLT),   demonstrate   that,   with   modern
          instrumentation,   QSO  absorption  line  spectroscopy  can  be
          successfully extended to near-infrared wavelengths to probe the
          intergalactic  medium  near  the end of the reionization epoch.
          Although  the  statistics  of this pilot study are limited, the
          mass  density  of  triply ionized carbon implied by our data is
          comparable  to  the  values  of  Omega_CIV  reported  at  lower
          redshifts.  Neither  the  column  density  distribution  of CIV
          absorbers  nor its integral show significant redshift evolution
          over  a  period of time which stretches from 1 to 4.5 Gyr after
          the big bang, suggesting that a large fraction of intergalactic
          metals  may  already  have  been in place at redshifts above 6.
          Alternatively,  the  strong  CIV system we have detected may be
          associated   with   outflowing,   highly-ionized,  gas  from  a
          foreground  massive  galaxy;  deep  imaging and spectroscopy of
          galaxies  near  the QSO sightline should be able to distinguish
          between these two possibilities.

          It  is  argued  that there is a linear correlation between star
          formation  rate  (SFR)  and  accretion  rate  for normal bright
          active  galactic  nuclei  (AGNs).  However, it is still unclear
          whether  this  correlation  holds  for  LINERs,  of  which  the
          accretion  rates  are  relatively  lower  than  those of normal
          bright   AGNs.  The  radiatively  inefficient  accretion  flows
          (RIAFs)  are  believed  to  be present in these LINERs. In this
          work,  we  derive  accretion  rates for a sample of LINERs from
          their  hard  X-ray  luminosities based on spectral calculations
          for  RIAFs.  We  find  that  LINERs follow the same correlation
          between  star  formation  rate  and  accretion  rate defined by
          normal  bright AGNs, when reasonable parameters are adopted for
          RIAFs.  It  means  that  the gases feed the black hole and star
          formation  in  these  low-luminosity LINERs may follow the same
          way  as that in normal bright AGNs, which is roughly consistent
          with recent numerical simulations on quasar evolution.

          Title: Constraints on Physical Properties of z~6 Galaxies Using
          Cosmological Hydrodynamic Simulations
          Authors: K. Finlator, R. Dave', B. Oppenheimer
          Comments: 18 pages, 9 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  introduce  SPOC,  a  new code for constraining the physical
          properties  of  observed galaxies through a Bayesian likelihood
          comparison with galaxies drawn from simulations. SPOC inputs an
          object's  photometry  and  outputs probability distributions of
          stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), age, metallicity, dust
          extinction, and redshift (if none is given) for that galaxy. We
          apply  SPOC,  employing  model galaxies drawn from cosmological
          hydrodynamic  simulations,  to Abell 2218 KESR (z~6.7) and five
          other z>5.5 galaxies for which published rest-frame ultraviolet
          and  optical measurements are available. We compare the outcome
          of  using  our  simulated  galaxies'  star  formation histories
          (SFHs) versus using simple one-parameter SFHs such as constant,
          exponentially-decaying,  and  rising  (a  new form we introduce
          motivated  by  typical SFHs seen in our simulated galaxies). We
          show  that simulated galaxies match these observations at least
          as  well  as  simple SFHs, with similar favored values obtained
          for  the intrinsic physical parameters such as stellar mass and
          SFR,  but  with substantially smaller uncertainties. This shows
          that  the  existence  of  galaxies  at z>5.5 with properties as
          observed   is   straightforwardly  accomodated  within  current
          hierarchical  structure  formation  scenarios. Our SPOC-derived
          photometric   redshifts   agree   well   with   the   available
          spectroscopic redshifts. We examine several models for galactic
          outflows  and  reddening,  and show that most inferred physical
          properties   are  insensitive  to  these  choices.  Hence  SPOC
          provides  a  robust  tool  for optimally utilizing hydrodynamic
          simulations  (or  any  model  that  predicts  galaxy  SFHs)  to
          constrain the physical properties of individual galaxies having
          only photometric data.

          methods    of   analysis,   their   relative   advantages   and
          disadvantages,  and  their  reliabilities. I summarize the most
          recent  and  important  results  on  the  mass distributions of
          galaxy systems, from nearby to medium-distant systems, and from
          groups to clusters. In particular I consider how well different
          proposed models fit the observed cluster mass distribution, and
          which  are the relative distributions of galaxies, baryons, and
          dark  or  total  mass  in  clusters. I also discuss the current
          observational  evidence for mass accretion onto galaxy systems,
          coming  mostly  from  the  analysis  of the velocity anisotropy
          profiles.

          Comments: 51 pages, 20 figures, Submitted MNRAS
          In  this  work  we  present the first results of a study of BAL
          QSOs (at low and high redshift), based on very deep Gemini GMOS
          integral   field   spectroscopy.  In  particular,  the  results
          obtained for the nearest BAL IR QSO Mrk 231 are presented. Very
          deep  three-dimensional  spectra and maps clearly show that the
          BAL  systems I and II are extended (reaching 1.4-1.6" = 1.2-1.3
          kpc,  from  the  nucleus) and clearly elongated at the position
          angle  close  to  the  radio jet PA. Which suggest that the BAL
          systems  I  and  II are both associated with the radio jet, and
          supporting  the  bipolar  jet-wind model for some BALs. For the
          nuclear  region  of Mrk 231, the QSO and host-galaxy components
          were  modelled, using a new technique of decoupling 3D spectra.
          From  this study, the following main results were found: (i) in
          the  pure  host  galaxy  spectrum  an extreme nuclear starburst
          component  was  clearly  observed,  mainly  as  a  very  strong
          increase  in  the  flux,  at the blue wavelengths; (ii) the BAL
          system  I is observed in the spectrum of the host galaxy; (iii)
          in  the clean/pure QSO emission spectrum, only broad lines were
          detected. 3D GMOS individual spectra (specially in the IR Ca II
          triplet)  and maps confirm the presence of an extreme and young
          nuclear starburst (8 < age < 15 Myr), which was detected mainly
          in a ring or toroid with a radius r = 0.3" = 200 pc, around the
          very  nucleus.  The  physical  properties of the four expanding
          nuclear  bubbles  were  analysed, using the GMOS 3D spectra and
          maps.  These  results  suggest  that  an  important part of the
          nuclear  NLR  is generated by the OF process and the associated
          low velocity ionizing shocks.

          We present high-speed, three-colour photometry of the eclipsing
          cataclysmic  variable  SDSS J170213.26+322954.1 (hereafter SDSS
          J1702+3229).  This  system  has an orbital period of 2.4 hours,
          placing it within the ``period gap'' for cataclysmic variables.
          We determine the system parameters via a parameterized model of
          the  eclipse  fitted to the observed light curve by chi-squared
          minimization. We obtain a mass ratio of q = 0.215 +/- 0.015 and
          an  orbital  inclination  i  = 82.4 +- 0.4 degrees. The primary
          mass is M_w = 0.94 +/- 0.01 Msun. The secondary mass and radius
          are  found  to  be  Mr  = 0.20 +/- 0.01 Msun and Rr = 0.243 +/-
          0.013  Rsun  respectively.  We find a distance to the system of
          440  +/-  30 pc, and an effective temperature for the secondary
          star  of 3800 +/- 100 K (corresponding to a spectral type of M0
          +/-  0.5V).  Both  the  distance  and effective temperature are
          consistent with previous values derived via spectroscopy of the
          red star.
          The  secondary star is significantly less massive than expected
          for  the orbital period, and significantly warmer than expected
          for  its  mass.  This can be explained if the secondary star is
          significantly  evolved:  the mass and effective temperature are
          consistent  with a secondary star that began mass transfer with
          a  greatly reduced central hydrogen fraction. The nature of the
          secondary star in SDSS J1702+3229 supports predictions that CVs
          with  evolved  secondary  stars might be found accreting within
          the period gap.

          Evidence  of  secular  dynamical  evolution for detached active
          binary  orbits  are  presented. First order decreasing rates of
          orbital angular momentum (OAM), systemic mass ($M=M_{1}+M_{2}$)
          and  orbital  period  of  detached  active  binaries  have been
          determined as $\dot J/J = 3.48 \times 10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$, $\dot
          M/M = 1.30 \times 10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$ and $\dot P/P = 3.96\times
          10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$  from  the  kinematical  ages  of  62  field
          detached  systems.  The  ratio  of  $d \log J/ d \log M = 2.68$
          implies  that either there are mechanisms which amplify AM loss
          $\delta=2.68$  times  with  respect  to  isotropic  AM  loss of
          hypothetical  isotropic  winds  or  there exist external causes
          contributing  AM  loss  in  order  to produce this mean rate of
          decrease  for  orbital periods. Various decreasing rates of OAM
          ($d  \log J / dt$) and systemic mass ($d \log M/ dt$) determine
          various  speeds  of  dynamical  evolutions  towards  a  contact
          configuration.  According  to  average dynamical evolution with
          $\delta  =  2.68$,  the  fraction  of 10, 22 and 39 per cent of
          current detached sample is expected to be contact system within
          2, 4 and 6 Gyr respectively.

          parts. In press, Astrophysical Journal, Suppl
          We  present a 1.4-GHz catalog of 810 radio sources (560 sources
          in the complete sample) with 1.8" resolution found within a 17'
          radius  in  the  SSA13  field (RA=13h12m,DEC=42d38'). The radio
          image  from the VLA has an rms noise level of 4.82 microJy/beam
          at  the  field  center,  and  Subaru  optical  images in r-band
          (6300A)   and  z-band  (9200A)  have  a  three-sigma  detection
          magnitude  of  26.1  and  24.9,  respectively. 88% of the radio
          sources  are  identified with an optical counterpart, and there
          is  significantly  more  reddening  for  objects  fainter  than
          24-mag.  The  radio  and  optical parameters are tabulated, and
          source  morphologies are displayed by radio contours overlaying
          optical  false-color images. The radio structures show a wealth
          of  complexity  and these are classified into a small number of
          categories.  About  one-third  of  the radio sources are larger
          than 1.2" and their orientation is often similar to that of the
          associated  galaxy  or  binary-galaxy  system.  The  density of
          sources  in the SSA13 field above 75 microJy is 0.40 per square
          arcmin,  with  a slope of -2.43 in the differential counts. The
          radio  spectral index may steepen for sources below 75 microJy.
          We  estimate  that at most 40% of the microJansky radio sources
          are dominated by AGN processes.

          Title:  CXOU  J121538.2+361921 in the galaxy NGC 4214: a double
          neutron star in the making?
          Authors: J. Dewi
          Comments: MNRAS Lett., accepted
          CXOU  J121538.2+361921  is  the  brightest  X-ray source in the
          galaxy  NGC 4214, with an X-ray luminosity of up to 0.7 x 10^39
          erg/s.  The  observed  periodicity of 3.62 hr is interpreted as
          the  orbital  period  of the system. It has been suggested that
          the  system is a low-mass helium star with a lower-mass compact
          companion.  If this idea is correct, then CXOU J121538.2+361921
          will  evolve into a double neutron star, a binary consisting of
          a  radio  pulsar  and  another  neutron  star. In this study we
          investigate  further  this  possibility. We find that the X-ray
          luminosity  is  consistent  with super-Eddington accretion in a
          helium  star-neutron  star  binary. The binary is in a state of
          mass  transfer  phase  which  is initiated when the helium-star
          donor is on the helium shell burning stage. A donor star with a
          current  mass in the range of around 2.2 - 3.6 Msun is required
          to  explain  the  observed orbital period. Helium stars in this
          mass  range  are  massive  enough  to  collapse  in a supernova
          explosion,   making   CXOU   J121538.2+361921   the   immediate
          progenitor of a double neutron star.

          inner-most jet region with an angular resolution of approx. 300
          x  60  micro-arcseconds.  In terms of Schwarzschild radii, this
          leads  to  an  upper  limit of the jet base of approx. 100 x 20
          Schwarzschild    radii.    We   also   report   on   two   VLBI
          pilot-experiments,  which demonstrate the technical feasibility
          of  global  VLBI  at  150  and  230  GHz (2 mm and 1.3 mm). The
          experiments  lead to upper limits to the size of the unresolved
          AGN-cores   in   the   25   -  30  micro-arcsecond  range.  The
          participation  of new and near-future mm-telescopes (like APEX,
          CARMA, SMA, LMT, ALMA, etc.) in global mm-VLBI will provide the

          We  report  the  discovery  of excess 4.5 and 8 micron emission
          from  three  quiescent  black  hole  low-mass X-ray binaries, A
          0620-00,  GS  2023+338,  and  XTE  J1118+480.  The mid-infrared
          emission  from GS 2023+338 probably originates in the accretion
          disk.  However,  the  excess  emission  from  A 0620-00 and XTE
          J1118+480  is  brighter and peaks at longer wavelengths, and so
          probably  originates  from  circumbinary dust that is heated by
          the light of the secondary star. We find that the inner edge of
          the   dust   distribution   lies  near  1.7  times  the  binary
          separation, which is the minimum radius at which a circumbinary
          disk  would  be  stable  against  tidal  disruption. The excess
          infrared  emission  is not detected at 24 micron, which implies
          that  the  dust does not extend beyond about 3 times the binary
          separation.  The  total  masses  of  circumbinary  material are
          between 10^22 and 10^24 g. The material could be the remains of
          fall-back  disks  produced  in supernovae, or material from the
          companions   injected  into  circumbinary  orbits  during  mass
          transfer.

          Title:    Goodness-of-Fit    Tests    DIFF1   and   DIFF2   for
          Locally-Normalized Supernova Spectra

          Two   quantitative   tests   DIFF1   and  DIFF2  for  measuring
          goodness-of-fit   between   two   locally-normalized  supernova
          spectra  are presented. Locally-normalized spectra are obtained
          by  dividing  a  spectrum  by the same spectrum smoothed over a
          wavelength interval relatively large compared to line features,
          but  relatively  small  compared  to  continuum features. DIFF1
          essentially  measures  the mean relative difference between the
          wave  patterns of locally-normalized spectra and DIFF2 is DIFF1
          minimized  with  respect  to  a relative logarithmic wavelength
          shift  between the spectra: the shift is an artificial relative
          Doppler  shift.  Both DIFF1 and DIFF2 measure the similarity of
          spectra:  DIFF1 puts more weight on overall physical similarity
          in  spectrum  formation;  DIFF2,  just on the similarity of the
          line  patterns in the spectra because the shift compensates for
          some  physical  distinction  in  the supernovae. Both tests are
          useful  in  ordering  supernovae  into  empirical groupings for
          further    analysis.    We    present    some    examples    of
          locally-normalized spectra for Type IIb supernova SN 1993J with
          some  analysis  of  these  spectra. The spectra include two HST
          spectra  that  have  not been published before. We also give an
          example of fitted locally-normalized spectra and, as an example
          of the utility of DIFF1 and DIFF2, some preliminary statistical
          results  for  hydrogen-deficient core-collapse (HDCC) supernova
          spectra.  This  paper  makes  use  of and refers to material to
          found  at the first author's online supernova spectrum database

          Subj-class:  Superconductivity;  Strongly Correlated Electrons;
          Statistical Mechanics; Chemical Physics
          A  new  critical behavior in unconventional superconductors and
          superfluids  is  established and described by the Wilson-Fisher
          renormalization-group method. For certain symmetries of order a
          new type of fluctuation-driven first order phase transitions at
          finite  and  zero temperature are predicted. The results can be
          applied  to  a  wide class of ferromagnetic superconductive and
          superfluid systems, in particular, to itinerant ferromagnets as
          UGe_2 and URhGe.

          We  have  undertaken  a new ground-based monitoring campaign to
          improve  the estimates of the mass of the central black hole in
          NGC  4151.  We  measure  the  lag time of the broad H beta line
          response compared to the optical continuum at 5100 A and find a
          lag  of  6.6  (+1.1/-0.8)  days.  We  combine our data with the
          recent  reanalysis  of  UV emission lines by Metzroth et al. to
          calculate  a  weighted mean of the black hole mass, M_BH = 4.57
          (+0.57/-0.47)  x  10^7  M_sun.  The absolute calibration of the
          black hole mass is based on normalization of the AGN black hole
          mass   -   stellar   velocity   dispersion   (M_BH  -  sigma_*)
          relationship  to that of quiescent galaxies by Onken et al. The
          scatter  in  the  M_BH  -  sigma_*  relationship  suggests that
          reverberation-mapping  based  mass  measurements  are typically
          uncertain by a factor of 3-4.

          We  take  advantage of all available deep HST NICMOS data (~700
          orbits) over the Extended CDF-South and HDF-North GOODS regions
          with  overlapping ACS data to conduct a search for starbursting
          galaxies  at  z~7-8 using a z-dropout technique. We only find 1
          object  in  our  most  conservative  selection  and 4 in a less
          conservative  selection, but expect 10 and 17, respectively, if
          we  assume no-evolution relative to the large samples available
          at  z~6.  This  is  inconsistent  with  no-evolution at >=99.9%
          confidence  assuming  simple Poissonian statistics (and >=99.4%
          confidence  if we include the effects of large-scale structure)
          and  indicates  that the volume density of bright (~0.6-2.5 L*)
          galaxies  at z~7-8 was much lower than at z~6, just 200 million
          years   later.  The  discovery  shows  that  luminous,  massive
          galaxies   are   quite   deficient   700  million  years  after
          recombination,  and  provides  key  evidence  for  hierarchical

          NGC  3310  is a local galaxy with an intense, ongoing starburst
          thought to result from a merger with a companion galaxy. It has
          several  known  tidal  features  in  the northwest and southern
          regions  around  the  main  galactic disc, as well as a closed,
          tidal  loop  emerging  from  the  eastern  side of the disc and
          rejoining  in  the north. This loop appears to be distinct from
          the  rest of the shells surrounding NGC3310 and is the first of
          its kind to be detected in a starburst galaxy. In this work, we
          present  UBVR  photometry to faint surface brightness levels of
          this  debris  network,  and  we  explore various strategies for
          modelling NGC 3310's disc and subtracting its contribution from
          each  region  of  debris.  We  then  compare  these photometric
          results  with  the  GALEV  spectral  synthesis models, and find
          possible material from the intruder galaxy, suggesting that the
          recent  accretion  of  several  small  galaxies  is driving the
          evolution of NGC 3310.

          Title: Quasars at z=6: the survival of the fittest
          Authors: M. Volonteri, M. J. Rees
          Comments:  Accepted  for publication in the ApJ. 9 pages, 6 b/w
          figures
          The  Sloan Digital Sky survey detected luminous quasars at very
          high  redshift,  z>6.  Follow-up observations indicated that at
          least  some  of these quasars are powered by supermassive black
          holes  (SMBHs)  with  masses in excess of billion solar masses.
          SMBHs,  therefore,  seem  to  have  already  existed  when  the
          Universe  was  less  than  1  Gyr  old,  and the bulk of galaxy
          formation still has to take place. We investigate in this paper
          to which extent accretion and dynamical processes influence the
          early  growth  of SMBHs. We assess the impact of (i) black hole
          mergers, (ii) the influence of the merging efficiency and (iii)
          the  negative  contribution  due to dynamical effects which can
          kick  black  holes  out  of  their  host  halos  (gravitational
          recoil).  We  find  that  if accretion is always limited by the
          Eddington   rate   via  a  thin  disc,  the  maximum  radiative
          efficiency  allowed to reproduce the LF at z=6 is of order 12%,
          when  the  adverse  effect of the gravitational recoil is taken
          into  consideration.  Dynamical  effects cannot be neglected in
          studies  of  high-redshift SMBHs. If black holes can accrete at
          super-critical  rate  during  an  early  phase, reproducing the
          observed  SMBH  mass  values  is not an issue, even in the case
          that  the  recoil velocity is in the upper limits range, as the
          mass  ratios of merging binaries are skewed towards low values,
          where  the gravitational recoil effect is very mild. We propose
          that  SMBH  growth  at  early  times  is  very  selective,  and
          efficient  only  for  black  holes  hosted in high density peak
          halos.

          Title: Confirming the high velocity outflow in PG 1211+143
          Authors: K.A. Pounds, K.L. Page (University of Leicester)
          Comments: 4 pages, 5 figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          An  XMM-Newton  observation  of  the  bright QSO PG1211+143 was
          previously  reported  to show evidence for a massive, energetic
          outflow,  with  an  outflow  velocity  of v ~ 0.1c based on the
          identification  of  blue-shifted  absorption  lines detected in
          both  EPIC and RGS spectra. Subsequently, an order-of-magnitude
          lower velocity has been claimed from an ion-by-ion model fit to
          the  RGS  data.  We  show  here, in a re-analysis of the higher
          signal-to-noise EPIC data, that the high velocity is confirmed,
          with  the  resolution of additional absorption lines yielding a
          revised  outflow velocity of v = 0.130 +/- 0.003c. Confirmation
          of  a  massive  and  energetic  outflow  in  a  non-BAL AGN has
          important  implications for metal enrichment of the IGM and for
          the feedback mechanism implied by the correlation of black hole
          and   galactic   bulge   masses.  We  note  the  near-Eddington
          luminosity  of PG1211+143 may be the critical factor in driving
          such  an  energetic outflow, a situation likely to be common in
          AGN at higher redshift.

          publication in MNRAS
          We  present  the  rest-frame  optical and infrared colours of a
          complete  sample  of  1114  z<0.3  galaxies  from  the  Spitzer
          Wide-area  InfraRed Extragalactic Legacy Survey (SWIRE) and the
          Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS). We discuss the optical and
          infrared  colours  of  our  sample  and  analyse  in detail the
          contribution   of   dusty  star-forming  galaxies  and  AGN  to
          optically selected red sequence galaxies.
          We   propose   that  the  optical  (g-r)  colour  and  infrared
          log(L_{24}/L_{3.6})  colour  of  galaxies  in  our  sample  are
          determined primarily by a bulge-to-disk ratio. The (g-r) colour
          is  found  to  be  sensitive  to  the  bulge-to-disk  ratio for
          disk-dominated galaxies, whereas the log(L_{24}/L_{3.6}) colour
          is more sensitive for bulge-dominated systems.
          We  identify  ~18%  (195  sources)  of our sample as having red
          optical  colours  and  infrared excess. Typically, the infrared
          luminosities  of these galaxies are found to be at the high end
          of  star-forming  galaxies  with  blue  optical  colours. Using
          emission  line diagnostic diagrams, 78 are found to have an AGN
          contribution,  and  117 are identified as star-forming systems.
          The  red  (g-r)  colour  of  the star-forming galaxies could be
          explained   by   extinction.   However,   their   high  optical
          luminosities  cannot.  We conclude that they have a significant
          bulge component.
          The number densities of optically red star-forming galaxies are
          found  to correspond to ~13% of the total number density of our
          sample. In addition, these systems contribute ~13% of the total
          optical  luminosity  density,  and  28%  of  the total infrared
          luminosity  density of our SWIRE/SDSS sample. These objects may
          reduce the need for "dry-mergers".


   
astro-ph/0411750
          We  investigate  the damping of neutron star r-modes due to the
          presence  of  a viscous boundary (Ekman) layer at the interface
          between  the  crust and the core. Our study is motivated by the
          possibility  that  the gravitational-wave driven instability of
          the  inertial  r-modes  may  become  active in rapidly spinning
          neutron  stars,  eg.  in  low-mass X-ray binaries, and the fact
          that a viscous Ekman layer at the core-crust interface provides
          an  efficient  damping  mechanism  for  these  oscillations. We
          review  various  approaches  to  the  problem  and carry out an
          analytic  calculation of the effects due to the Ekman layer for
          a   rigid   crust.  Our  analytic  estimates  support  previous
          numerical   results,  and  provide  further  insight  into  the
          intricacies  of  the  problem.  We  add  to  previous  work  by
          discussing  the  effect  that  compressibility  and composition
          stratification  have  on  the  boundary  layer damping. We show
          that,  while  stratification  is  unimportant  for  the  r-mode
          problem,  composition  suppresses  the  damping rate by about a
          factor of two (depending on the detailed equation of state).

          The  highly  obscured radio-bright galaxy PKS1343-601 (l=309.7,
          b=+1.8)  has  been  suspected  to mark the centre of a hitherto
          unknown  cluster  in  the  Great  Attractor  region. As such it
          presents  an  ideal  region  for  a  search  of galaxies in the
          near-infrared (NIR) and an in-depth study of their colours as a
          function  of extinction. A visual search of a ~30 square-degree
          area  centered  on this radio galaxy on images of the NIR DENIS
          survey  (IJK)  revealed 83 galaxies (including two AGNs) and 39
          possible  candidates. Of these, 49 are also listed in the 2MASS
          Extended Source Catalog 2MASX. Taking the IRAS/DIRBE extinction
          values  (Schlegel et al. 1998) at face value, the absorption in
          the  optical  (A_B)  ranges  from  ~2m  to over 100m across the
          Galactic  Plane. Comparing the detections with other systematic
          surveys,  we conclude that this search is highly complete up to
          the   detection  limits  of  the  DENIS  survey  and  certainly
          surpasses  any  automatic  galaxy  finding algorithm applied to
          crowded areas. The NIR galaxy colours from the 7" aperture were
          used  as  a  probe  to  measure  total  Galactic  extinction. A
          comparison with the IRAS/DIRBE Galactic reddening maps suggests
          that  the  IRAS/DIRBE values result in a slight overestimate of
          the  true  extinction  at  such  low  Galactic  latitudes;  the
          inferred  extinction  from  the  galaxy  colours corresponds to
          about   87%   of  the  IRAS/DIRBE  extinctions.  Although  this
          determination   still   shows   some  scatter,  it  proves  the
          usefulness  of  NIR surveys for calibrating the IRAS/DIRBE maps
          in the extinction range of 2m < A_B < 12m.

          (GRBs   980425,   030329,   031203,   and   060218)  that  were
          spectroscopically   found   to   be  associated  with  type  Ic
          supernovae, and compare them to the general GRB population. For
          each   event,   we  investigate  the  spectral  and  luminosity
          evolution,  and  estimate  the  total  energy budget based upon
          broadband  observations.  The observational inventory for these
          events  has  become  rich  enough  to  allow estimates of their
          energy  content  in relativistic and sub-relativistic form. The
          result  is  a  global  portrait  of the effects of the physical
          processes   responsible   for   producing  long-soft  GRBs.  In
          particular,  we  find that the values of the energy released in
          mildly  relativistic  outflows  appears to have a significantly
          smaller scatter than those found in highly relativistic ejecta.
          This  is consistent with a picture in which the energy released
          inside  the  progenitor  star  is  roughly  standard, while the
          fraction  of  that  energy  that ends up in highly relativistic
          ejecta outside the star can vary dramatically between different
          events.

          We  present  the analysis of our 13 and 22 cm ATCA observations
          of  the  central  region  of  the  merging galaxy cluster A3921
          (z=0.094).  We  investigated  the  effects  of the major merger
          between  two  sub-clusters on the star formation (SF) and radio
          emission  properties  of  the  confirmed  cluster  members. The
          origin  of  SF  and  the  nature  of  radio emission in cluster
          galaxies was investigated by comparing their radio, optical and
          X-ray  properties. We also compared the radio source counts and
          the percentage of detected radio galaxies with literature data.
          We  detected  17  radio sources above the flux density limit of
          0.25  mJy/beam in the central field of A3921, among which 7 are
          cluster  members.  9 galaxies with star-forming optical spectra
          were   observed   in   the  collision  region  of  the  merging
          sub-clusters.  They  were  not  detected  at radio wavelengths,
          giving upper limits for their star formation rate significantly
          lower  than those typically found in late-type, field galaxies.
          Most of these star-forming objects are therefore really located
          in  the  high  density  part  of  the cluster, and they are not
          infalling  field  objects  seen  in  projection  at the cluster
          centre.  Their  SF  episode  is probably related to the cluster
          collision  that  we  observe in its very central phase. None of
          the  galaxies  with post-starburst optical spectra was detected
          down our 2$\sigma$ flux density limit, confirming that they are
          post-starburst  and  not dusty star-forming objects. We finally
          detected  a  narrow-angle tail (NAT) source associated with the
          second  brightest cluster galaxy (BG2), whose diffuse component
          is  a  partly  detached pair of tails from an earlier period of
          activity of the BG2 galaxy.

          We   present   new   numerical  simulations  in  the  thin-disk
          approximation which characterize the burst mode of protostellar
          accretion.  The  burst  mode  begins  upon  the  formation of a
          centrifugally balanced disk around a newly formed protostar. It
          is  comprised  of  prolonged quiescent periods of low accretion
          rate  (typically  $\la  10^{-7}  \Msun$  yr$^{-1}$)  which  are
          punctuated  by  intense  bursts  of  accretion  (typically $\ga
          10^{-4}  \Msun$  yr$^{-1}$,  with duration $\la 100$ yr) during
          which  most  of  the  protostellar  mass  is  accumulated.  The
          accretion  bursts  are  associated  with the formation of dense
          protostellar/protoplanetary  embryos,  which  are  later driven
          onto the protostar by the gravitational torques that develop in
          the  disk.  Gravitational  instability  in  the disk, driven by
          continuing  infall  from  the  envelope,  is  shown  to  be  an
          effective  means  of transporting angular momentum outward, and
          mass inward to the protostar. We show that the disk mass always
          remains  significantly  less  than  the  central protostar mass
          throughout  this process. The burst phenomenon is robust enough
          to  occur  for  a  variety  of initial values of rotation rate,
          frozen-in      (supercritical)      magnetic     field,     and
          density-temperature  relations.  Even in cases where the bursts
          are  nearly  entirely  suppressed, a moderate increase in cloud
          size  or  rotation rate can lead to vigorous burst activity. We
          conclude that most (if not all) protostars undergo a burst mode
          of  evolution during their early accretion history, as inferred
          empirically from observations of FU Orionis variables.

          2006; Bad Honnef, Germany
          The  supermassive  black  hole in the center of our Galaxy, Sgr
          A*, is unique because the angular size of the black hole is the
          largest  in the sky thus providing detailed boundary conditions
          on,  and  much less freedom for, accretion flow models. In this
          paper   I  review  advection-dominated  accretion  flow  (ADAF;
          another  name is radiatively inefficient accretion flow) models
          for  Sgr  A*.  This  includes  the developments and dynamics of
          ADAFs,  and  how to explain observational results including the
          multi-waveband  spectrum,  radio  polarization,  IR  and  X-ray
          flares, and the size measurements at radio wavebands.

          Journal
          Spectral  state  transitions  in neutron star LMXB systems have
          been widely observed yet not well understood. Here we report an
          abrupt  spectral  change in 4U 1608-52, a typical atoll source,
          during  its  decay  phase  of  the 2004 outburst. The source is
          found  to  undergo  sudden changes in its spectral hardness and
          other  properties.  The transition occurred when its luminosity
          is  between  (3.3-5.3)  E36  ergs/s, assuming a distance of 3.6
          kpc.  Interpreting this event in terms of the propeller effect,
          we  infer  the neutron star surface magnetic field as (1.4-1.8)
          E8  Gauss. We also briefly discuss similarities and differences
          between  the  spectral  states  of  neutron star and black hole
          binary systems.

          Title: Many binaries among NEAs

          "Near-Earth  Object  Detection,  Characterization,  and  Threat
          Mitigation" workhop, Colorado, June 2006
          The  number  of binary asteroids in the near-Earth region might
          be  significantly higher than expected. While Bottke and Melosh
          (1996)  suggested  that  about 15% of the NEAs are binaries, as
          indicated  from the frequency of double craters, and Pravec and
          Harris (2000) suggested that half of the fast-rotating NEAs are
          binaries,  our  recent study of Aten NEA lightcurves shows that
          the  fraction  of binary NEAs might be even higher than 50%. We
          found  two  asteroids  with asynchronous binary characteristics
          such  as  two additive periods and fast rotation of the primary
          fragment.  We  also identified three asteroids with synchronous
          binary  characteristics  such  as  amplitude  higher  than  one
          magnitude,  U-shaped  lightcurve maxima and V-shaped lightcurve
          minima.  These  five  binaries were detected out of a sample of
          eight  asteroids  observed,  implying a 63% binarity frequency.
          Confirmation  of this high binary population requires the study
          of  a  larger  representative  sample.  However, any mitigation
          program  that  requires the deflection or demise of a potential
          impactor will have to factor in the possibility that the target
          is a binary or multiple asteroid system.

          Comments: 19 pages, 9 figures, ApJ accepted paper
          We  report the results of H13CO+(1-0), CO(1-0), and 3.3 mm dust
          continuum  observations  toward  one  of  the strongest mm-wave
          sources  in  OMC-3,  MMS  7, with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array
          (NMA)  and  the  Nobeyama  45  m  telescope.  With  the NMA, we
          detected  centrally-condensed  3.3  mm  dust-continuum emission
          which  coincides with the MIR source and the free-free jet. Our
          combined   H13CO+   observations   have  revealed  a  disk-like
          envelope.  The  size and the mass of the disk-like envelope are
          0.15  times  0.11  pc  and  5.1  - 9.1 M_sun, respectively. The
          combined map also shows that the outer portion of the disk-like
          envelope has a fan-shaped structure which delineates the rim of
          the    CO(1-0)    outflow    observed   with   the   NMA.   The
          position-velocity  (P-V)  diagrams in the H13CO+ (1-0) emission
          show  that  the  velocity  field  in  the disk-like envelope is
          composed  of  a dispersing gas motion and a possible rigid-like
          rotation.  The  mass  dispersing rate is estimated to be (3.4 -
          6.0)  times  10^-5  M_sun/yr,  which  implies that MMS 7 has an
          ability   to   disperse   ~10  M_sun  during  the  protostellar
          evolutional  time  of a few times 10^5 yr. The specific angular
          momentum  of the possible rotation in the disk-like envelope is
          nearly  two  orders  of  magnitude larger than that in low-mass
          cores.  The  turn-over  point  of  the power law of the angular
          momentum  distribution  in the disk-like envelope (< 0.007 pc),
          which  is  likely  to  be  related  to  the outer radius of the
          central  mass  accretion,  is similar to the size of the 3.3 mm
          dust  condensation. The intermediate-mass protostar MMS 7 is in
          the  last  stage  of  the  main  accretion  phase  and that the
          substantial   portion   of  the  outer  gas  has  already  been
          dispersed,  while  the  mass accretion may still be on-going at
          the innermost region traced by the dusty condensation.

          We  have  searched  for  microlensing  variability in the light
          curves    of   five   gravitationally   lensed   quasars   with
          well-determined  time  delays:  SBS 1520+530, FBQ 0951+2635, RX
          J0911+0551,  B1600+434 and HE 2149-2745. By comparing the light
          curve  of  the  leading image with a suitably time offset light
          curve  of  a  trailing image we find that two (SBS 1520+530 and
          FBQ  0951+2635)  out  of  the  five  quasars  have  significant
          long-term   (years)   and   short-term  (100  days)  brightness
          variations   that   may   be   attributed  to  microlensing.The
          short-term  variations  may  be due to nanolenses, relativistic
          hot  or  cold  spots in the quasar accretion disks, or coherent
          microlensing at large optical depth.

          We  present the first systematic search for microlensing events
          with  variability  in their baselines using data from the third
          phase   of   the   Optical   Gravitational  Lensing  Experiment
          (OGLE-III).  A  total of 137 candidates (88 new) was discovered
          toward  the  Galactic  bulge.  Among  these,  21  have periodic
          oscillations  in  their  baselines, 111 are irregular variables
          and  5  are  potential long period detached eclipsing binaries.
          This  is  about  10%  of  the total number of constant baseline
          events.  They  are  hence quite common and can be regarded as a
          new  type  of  exotic  events, which allow the determination of
          extra  parameters  of  the events. We show that microlensing of
          variable stars may allow us to break the degeneracy between the
          blending  parameter  and  magnification.  We  note that in some
          cases variability hidden in the baseline due to strong blending
          may  be  revealed in highly magnified events and resemble other
          exotic  microlensing behavior, including planetary deviation. A
          new  system  (VEWS)  for  detecting  ongoing  variable baseline
          microlensing events is presented.

          sq.  deg. in the 0.5-2 keV and 2-10 keV bands down to fluxes of
          2x10^{-15}  and  8x10^{-15} erg/s/cm^2 respectively, as part of
          the  XMM  Large  Scale  Structure Survey. The logN-logS in both
          bands  shows  a  steep  slope at bright fluxes, but agrees well
          with  other  determinations  below  ~2x10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2. The
          detected  sources  resolve  close  to  30 per cent of the X-ray
          background in the 2-10 keV band. We study the two-point angular
          clustering  of  point  sources  using  nearest  neighbours  and
          correlation  function  statistics  and  find  a  weak, positive
          signal  for  ~1130  sources  in  the  0.5-2  keV  band,  but no
          correlation  for ~400 sources in the 2-10 keV band below scales
          of  100  arcsec.  A  sub-sample of ~200 faint sources with hard
          X-ray  count ratios, that is likely to be dominated by obscured
          AGN,  does  show a positive signal with the data allowing for a
          large  scaling  of  the angular correlation length, but only at
          the   ~2  (3)  sigma  level,  based  on  re-sampling  (Poisson)
          statistics.  We discuss possible implications and emphasize the
          importance  of  wider,  complete  surveys  in  order  to  fully
          understand the large scale structure of the X-ray sky.

          EF  Eri  is  a magnetic cataclysmic variable that has been in a
          low  accretion state for the past nine years. Low state optical
          spectra   reveal   the   underlying  Zeeman-split  white  dwarf
          absorption  lines. These features are used to determine a value
          of  13-14  MG  as the white dwarf field strength. Recently, 5-7
          years  into the low state, Balmer and other emission lines have
          appeared  in the optical. An analysis of the H$\alpha$ emission
          line  yields  the  first  radial  velocity solution for EF Eri,
          leading  to a spectroscopic ephemeris for the binary and, using
          the  best  available  white dwarf mass of 0.6M${\odot}$, a mass
          estimate  for  the  secondary  of  0.055M${\odot}$. For a white
          dwarf  mass  of  0.95M${\odot}$, the average for magnetic white
          dwarfs,  the secondary mass increases to 0.087M${\odot}$. At EF
          Eri's  orbital period of 81 minutes, this higher mass secondary
          could not be a normal star and still fit within the Roche lobe.
          The  source of the Balmer and other emission lines is confirmed
          to  be  from  the sub-stellar secondary and we argue that it is
          due  to  stellar  activity.  We  compare EF Eri's emission line
          spectrum  and activity behavior to that recently observed in AM
          Her  and  VV Pup and attributed to stellar activity. We explore
          observations  and models originally developed for V471 Tau, for
          the  RS  CVn binaries, and for extra-solar planets. We conclude
          that irradiation of the secondary in EF Eri and similar systems
          is  unlikely  and,  in  polars,  the magnetic field interaction
          between  the  two  stars (with a possible tidal component) is a
          probable   mechanism   which  would  concentrate  chromospheric
          activity  on  the  secondary  near the sub-stellar point of the
          white dwarf.

          Title:  Neutrino-Cooled  Accretion  Disks around Spinning Black
          Hole
          Authors:   Wen-Xin   Chen,   Andrei  M.  Beloborodov  (Columbia
          University)
          Comments:  35  pages,  18  figures,  submitted  to ApJ (revised
          version)
          We calculate the structure of accretion disks around Kerr black
          holes  for  accretion  rates 0.001 - 10 M_sun/s. Such disks are
          plausible  candidates  for  the  central  engine  of  gamma-ray
          bursts.  Our  disk  model  is  fully  relativistic  and  treats
          accurately  microphysics  of  the  accreting  matter:  neutrino
          emissivity,   opacity,   electron   degeneracy,   and   nuclear
          composition.  The  neutrino-cooled  disk forms above a critical
          accretion  rate  that  depends on the black hole spin. The disk
          has  the  ``ignition''  radius  r_ign where neutrino flux rises
          dramatically,    cooling    becomes    efficient,    and    the
          proton-to-nucleon  ratio  Y_e drops. Other characteristic radii
          are  r_alpha  where  most of alpha-particles are disintegrated,
          r_nu  where  the disk becomes neutrino-opaque, and r_trap where
          neutrinos get trapped and advected into the black hole. We find
          r_alpha,  r_ign,  r_nu, r_trap and show their dependence on the
          accretion rate. We discuss the qualitative picture of accretion
          and  present sample numerical models of the disk structure. All
          neutrino-cooled  disks  regulate themselves to a characteristic
          state such that: (1) electrons are mildly degenerate, (2) Y_e ~
          0.1, and (3) neutrons dominate the pressure in the disk.

          Comments: 11 pages, 6 figures, ApJ accepted, 2006
          We present first results of a campaign to find and identify new
          compact  objects  in  the Galactic Center. Selecting candidates
          from  a combination of Chandra and 2MASS survey data, we search
          for  accretion  disk  signatures  via infrared spectroscopy. We
          have  found  the infrared counterpart to the Chandra source CXO
          J174536.1-285638, the spectrum of which has strong Br-gamma and
          HeI  emission.  The presence of CIII, NIII, and HeII indicate a
          binary  system.  We  suspect  that  the  system is some form of
          high-mass  binary  system, either a high-mass X-ray binary or a
          colliding wind binary.

          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures, accepted to ApJL
          We present near-infrared $JHK_s$ photometry and light curves of
          the  candidate  magnetic  white  dwarf+brown  dwarf binary SDSS
          J121209.31+013627.7    and   report   on   the   detection   of
          near-infrared  excess  and  variability  in the $K_s-$band. The
          observed  near-infrared excess can be explained by the presence
          of  an L7 brown dwarf and an extra emission source. The $J$ and
          $H$  light  curves appear flat, which rules out eclipses deeper
          than  0.2  mag and the presence of an accretion hot spot on the
          white  dwarf.  From  the  variable  $K_s$  lightcurve, we get a
          refined period for the system of 88$\pm$1 minutes. We show that
          the  observed  variability  in  $K_s-$band  can be explained by
          cyclotron emission, which can be modeled by a small spot on the
          surface  of the white dwarf. SDSS 1212 exhibits similarities to
          the  ultra-short  period  polar EF Eridani, however the lack of
          evidence for Roche-lobe overflow accretion suggests it may be a
          pre-polar.

          Title:  Spectroscopy  of  Young  Planetary Mass Candidates with
          Disks
          Authors: Ray Jayawardhana, Valentin D. Ivanov
          Comments: to appear in The Astrophysical Journal Letters
          It is now well established that many young brown dwarfs exhibit
          characteristics  similar  to classical T Tauri stars, including
          infrared  excess  from  disks  and  emission  lines  related to
          accretion.  Whether  the  same  holds  true for even lower mass
          objects,  namely  those  near  and  below the Deuterium-burning
          limit,  is  an  important  question.  Here  we  present optical
          spectra of six isolated planetary mass candidates in Chamaeleon
          II,  Lupus  I  and  Ophiuchus  star-forming  regions,  recently
          identified  by  Allers  and collaborators to harbor substantial
          mid-infrared  excesses.  Our  spectra,  from  ESO's  Very Large
          Telescope  and  New Technology Telescope, show that four of the
          targets  have  spectral types in the ~M9-L1 range, and three of
          those  also  exhibit H_alpha. Their luminosities are consistent
          with  masses  of  ~5-15  M_{Jupiter}  according  to  models  of
          Chabrier,  Baraffe  and  co-workers,  thus  placing  these four
          objects  among  the  lowest  mass  brown  dwarfs  known  to  be
          surrounded  by  circum-sub-stellar  disks. Our findings bolster
          the  idea  that free-floating planetary mass objects could have
          infancies  remarkably  similar  to  those of Sun-like stars and
          suggest  the  intriguing possibility of planet formation around
          primaries  whose  masses are comparable to those of extra-solar
          giant planets. Another target appears to be a brown dwarf (~M8)
          with   prominent   H_alpha   emission,  possibly  arising  from
          accretion.  The  sixth candidate is likely a background source,
          underlining the need for spectroscopic confirmation.

          We  present  preliminary  results from the first X-ray gratings
          spectrometer  observations  of a planetary nebula (PN). We have
          used  the  Chandra  X-ray  Observatory  Low Energy Transmission
          Gratings  Spectrometer  (LETGS)  to observe the bright, diffuse
          X-ray  source  within  the  well-studied BD +30 3639. The LETGS
          spectrum  of  BD  +30 3639 displays prominent and well-resolved
          emission  lines  of  H-like  C, O, and Ne and He-like O and Ne.
          Initial  modeling indicates a plasma temperature T_x ~ 2.5x10^6
          K  and  abundance  ratios  of C/O ~ 20, N/O <~ 1, Ne/O ~ 4, and
          Fe/O  <~  0.1.  These  results  suggest that the X-ray-emitting
          plasma  is dominated by the shocked fast wind from the emerging
          PN  core,  where  this  wind  gas  likely  originated  from the
          intershell  region  of  the  progenitor asymptotic giant branch
          star.

          Title: Variability and multi-periodic oscillations in the X-ray
          light curve of the classical nova V4743 Sgr

          Comments: In press in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
          Society
          The  classical  nova V4743 Sgr was observed with XMM-Newton for
          about  10  hours  on  April  4  2003,  6.5 months after optical
          maximum.  At  this  time,  this  nova  had become the brightest
          supersoft X-ray source ever observed. We present the results of
          a  time  series  analysis  performed  on  the X-ray light curve
          obtained  in  this  observation,  and  in  a  previous  shorter
          observation   done   with  Chandra  16  days  earlier.  Intense
          variability,  with amplitude as large as 40% of the total flux,
          was  observed both times. Similarities can be found between the
          two  observations  in  the structure of the variations. Most of
          the  variability  is  well  represented  as  a  combination  of
          oscillations  at  a  set of discrete frequencies lower than 1.7
          mHz.  At  least  five  frequencies are constant over the 16 day
          time  interval  between the two observations. We suggest that a
          periods  in  the  power  spectrum  of  both light curves at the
          frequency of 0.75 mHz and its first harmonic are related to the
          spin  period  of  the white dwarf in the system, and that other
          observed  frequencies  are  signatures of nonradial white dwarf
          pulsations.  A  possible signal with a 24000 sec period is also
          found  in  the  XMM-Newton  light curve: a cycle and a half are
          clearly  identified. This period is consistent with the 24278 s
          periodicity discovered in the optical light curve of the source
          and thought to be the orbital period of the nova binary system.

          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, to appear in MNRAS
          We  re-investigate the gravitationally lensed system Q2237+0305
          data  record  to  quantify  the probability of having a caustic
          crossing  in the A component. Several works assume that this is
          the  case,  but  no  quantitative  analysis is available in the
          literature.  We  combine  the  datasets from the OGLE and GLITP
          collaborations  to  accurately trace the prominent event in the
          lightcurve for the A component of the system. Then the observed
          event  is  compared  with  synthetic  light curves derived from
          trajectories  in  magnification  maps. These maps are generated
          using   a   ray-tracing  technique.  We  take  more  than  10^9
          trajectories  and  test  a  wide  range  of  different physical
          properties  of  the  lensing galaxy and the source quasar (lens
          transverse  velocity,  microlens mass, source intensity profile
          and  source  size).  We  found  that  around  75%  of  our good
          trajectories  (i.e.  that are consistent with the observations)
          are  caustic crossings. In addition, a high transverse velocity
          exceeding  300  km/s, a microlens mass of about 0.1 M_sun and a
          small   standard   accretion   disk   is   the  best  parameter
          combination.  The  results  justify  the  interpretation of the
          OGLE-GLITP   event   in  Q2237+0305A  as  a  caustic  crossing.
          Moreover, the physical properties of the lens and source are in
          very  good agreement with previous works. We also remark that a
          standard   accretion   disk   is   prefered  to  those  simpler
          approaches,  and  that  the former should be used in subsequent
          simulations.

          We  investigate in details the kinematics and morphology of the
          Seyfert  galaxy  NGC6104  in order to identify the mechanism of
          gas  transportation  to  the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Our
          observational   data   were   obtained   at   the  6-m  Special
          Astrophysical    Observatory    telescope    with    the   MPFS
          integral-field spectrograph and the SCORPIO universal device in
          three   modes:   direct   imaging,   a   scanning   Fabry-Perot
          interferometer, and long-slit spectroscopy. Images from the HST
          archive   were   invoked   to   study   the  structure  of  the
          circumnuclear  region.  An analysis of deep images has revealed
          that NGC6104 is in the phase of active merging with a companion
          galaxy.  We  have  been  able  to study the detailed picture of
          ionized  gas  motions  up to galactocentric distances of 14 kpc
          and  to  construct  the  stellar  velocity  field for the inner
          region. The radial gas motions toward the AGN along the central
          bar  play a significant role at galactocentric distances of 1-5
          kpc.  In  addition,  we have detected an outflow of ionized gas
          from the nucleus that presumably resulted from the intrusion of
          a  radio  jet  into  the  ambient  interstellar  medium.  Using
          diagnostic diagrams, we estimate the contributions from the AGN
          and  star formation to the galactic gas ionization. We estimate
          the  bar pattern speed by the Tremaine-Weinberg method and show
          that  the  inner  ring  observed  in  the galactic images has a
          resonant  nature. Two possible ring formation scenarios (before
          and during the interaction with a companion) are discussed.

          We  report the serendipitous discovery of the Sloan Digital Sky
          Survey  star,  SDSS  J160043.6+074802.9  to  be  a  very  rapid
          pulsator.  The  variation is dominated by a frequency near 8380
          microHz  (period  = 119.33 s) with a large amplitude (0.04 mag)
          and  its  first harmonic at 16760 microHz (59.66 s; 0.005 mag).
          In  between  these  frequencies,  we  find  at  least another 8
          variations   with  periods  between  62  and  118  seconds  and
          amplitudes   between   about   0.007   and  0.003  mag;  weaker
          oscillations  might  also  be present. Preliminary spectrograms
          from the performance verification phase of the Southern African
          Large  Telescope  indicate  that  SDSS  J160043.6+074802.9 is a
          spectroscopic  binary consisting of an sdO star and a late-type
          main-sequence  companion.  This  makes it the first unambiguous
          detection  of  such  an  sdO star to pulsate, and certainly the
          first found to exhibit multi-frequency variations.

          remnant RCW 103. No fast pulsations are visible. If genetically
          tied  to  the  supernova remnant, the source could either be an
          X-ray  binary,  comprising a compact object and a low-mass star
          in  an  eccentric  orbit,  or  an isolated neutron star. In the

          Since the discovery of the first giant planet outside the solar
          system  in 1995 (Mayor & Queloz 1995), more than 180 extrasolar
          planets   have   been   discovered.  With  improving  detection
          capabilities,  a  new  class  of planets with masses 5-20 times
          larger than the Earth, at close distance from their parent star
          is  rapidly  emerging.  Recently,  the  first  system  of three
          Neptune-mass  planets has been discovered around the solar type
          star  HD69830 (Lovis et al. 2006). Here, we present and discuss
          a  possible  formation scenario for this planetary system based
          on  a  consistent  coupling between the extended core accretion
          model and evolutionary models (Alibert et al. 2005a, Baraffe et
          al.  2004,2006).  We show that the innermost planet formed from
          an  embryo  having  started  inside  the  iceline  is  composed
          essentially  of  a  rocky  core  surrounded  by  a tiny gaseous
          envelope.  The  two  outermost  planets started their formation
          beyond the iceline and, as a consequence, accrete a substantial
          amount  of  water  ice during their formation. We calculate the
          present  day thermodynamical conditions inside these two latter
          planets  and show that they are made of a rocky core surrounded
          by a shell of fluid water and a gaseous envelope.

          Title:  Modelling  spectral  line  profiles  of wind-wind shock
          emissions from massive binary systems
          Authors:  D. Falceta-Goncalves (IAG/USP), Z. Abraham (IAG/USP),
          V. Jatenco-Pereira (IAG/USP)
          Comments: To appear in the MNRAS
          One of the most intriguing spectral features of WR binary stars
          is  the  presence  of  time-dependent  line profiles. Long term
          observations  of  several  systems  revealed the periodicity of
          this  variability,  synchronized  with  the  orbital  movement.
          Several  partially  successful  models  have  been  proposed to
          reproduce the observed data. The most promising assume that the
          origin  of  the  emission is the wind-wind interaction zone. In
          this  scenario,  two  high  velocity  and dense winds produce a
          strong shock layer, responsible for most of the X-rays observed
          from  these  systems.  As  the  secondary  star moves along its
          orbital  path,  the  shock region of conical shape, changes its
          position  with relation to the line of sight. As a consequence,
          the  stream  measured  Doppler  shift  presents time variations
          resulting  in  position  changes  of  the spectral line. In our
          work,  we  present an alternative model, introducing turbulence
          in  the  shock  layer  to  account  for the line broadening and
          opacity  effects  for  the  asymmetry  in the line profiles. We
          showed   that   the  gas  turbulence  avoids  the  need  of  an
          unnaturally  large  contact  layer  thickness to reproduce line
          broadening. Also, we demonstrated that if the emission from the
          opposing  cone  surface  is  absorbed,  the  result is a single
          peaked  profile.  This  result  fully satisfies the recent data
          obtained  from  massive  binary  systems,  and  can help on the
          determination   of   both  winds  and  orbital  parameters.  We
          successfully   applied  this  model  to  the  Br22  system  and
          determined its orbital parameters.

          We present the results of XMM-Newton observations of two AM CVn
          systems - V396 Hya and SDSS J1240-01. Both systems are detected
          in  X-rays and in the UV: neither shows coherent variability in
          their light curves. We compare the rms variability of the X-ray
          and  UV  power  spectra  of  these  sources  with  other AM CVn
          systems.  Apart  from  ES  Cet, AM CVn sources are not strongly
          variable  in  X-rays, while in the UV the degree of variability
          is  related  to  the  systems  apparent  brightness.  The X-ray
          spectra  of  V396  Hya  and SDSS J1240-01 show highly non-solar
          abundances, requiring enhanced nitrogen to obtain good fits. We
          compare  the  UV  and  X-ray  luminosities for 7 AM CVn systems
          using  recent  distances.  We find that the X-ray luminosity is
          not  strongly  dependent  upon  orbital period. However, the UV
          luminosity is highly correlated with orbital period with the UV
          luminosity decreasing with increasing orbital period. We expect
          that  this  is due to the accretion disk making an increasingly
          strong  contribution to the UV emission at shorter periods. The
          implied  luminosities  are  in  remarkably  good agreement with
          predictions.

          $\omega$   and   its   time   derivative  $\frac{d\omega}{dt}$.
          According  to  our  accuracy  there is no evidence that average

          We  present  analysis  of  extensive monitoring of SS433 by the
          RXTE  observatory  collected  over  the  period  1996-2005. The
          difference   between   energy   spectra   taken   at  different
          precessional  and orbital phases shows the presence of a strong
          photoabsorption  near  the  optical  star,  probably due to its
          powerful  dense wind. Assuming that a precessing accretion disk
          is  thick,  we  recover  the  temperature  profile in the X-ray
          emitting   jet   that   best  fits  the  observed  precessional
          variations  of  the  X-ray  emission  temperature.  The hottest
          visible  part  of  the  X-ray  jet  is located at a distance of
          $l_0/a\sim0.06-0.09$,   or  $\sim2-3\times10^{11}$cm  from  the
          central  compact  object and has a temperature of about $T_{\rm
          max}\sim30$   keV.  We  discovered  appreciable  orbital  X-ray
          eclipses  at the ``crossover'' precessional phases (jets are in
          the  plane of the sky, disk is edge-on) which put a lower limit
          on  the  size of the optical component $R/a\ga0.5$ and an upper
          limit  on a mass ratio of binary companions $q=M_{\rm x}/M_{\rm
          opt}\la0.3-0.35$.  The  size  of  the  eclipsing  region can be
          larger  than  secondary's  Roche  lobe  because  of substantial
          photoabsorption  by dense stellar wind. This must be taken into
          account  when  evaluating the mass ratio from analysis of X-ray
          eclipses.

          We  investigate  spherical  accretion  to a rotating magnetized
          star  in  the  "propeller"  regime using axisymmetric resistive
          magnetohydrodynamic  simulations.  The  regime  is predicted to
          occur   if   the  magnetospheric  radius  is  larger  than  the
          corotation  radius  and smaller than the light cylinder radius.
          The simulations show that accreting matter is expelled from the
          equatorial  region  of the magnetosphere and that it moves away
          from  the  star in a supersonic, disk-shaped outflow. At larger
          radial  distances  the outflow slows down and becomes subsonic.
          The  equatorial  matter  outflow  is  initially  driven  by the
          centrifugal   force,  but  at  larger  distances  the  pressure
          gradient force becomes significant. We find the fraction of the
          Bondi accretion rate which accretes to the surface of the star.

          Title: 3.9 day orbital modulation in the TeV gamma-ray flux and
          spectrum from the X-ray binary LS 5039
          Authors: The H.E.S.S. Collaboration: F.A. Aharonian, et al
          Comments:   8  pages,  8  figures,  submitted  to  Astronomy  &
          Astrophysics
          New   observations  of  LS  5039,  a  High  Mass  X-ray  Binary
          comprising  a massive star and compact object, were carried out
          with   the   High   Energy  Stereoscopic  System  of  Cherenkov
          Telescopes  (H.E.S.S.)  in  2005  at  very  high  energy  (VHE)
          gamma-ray energies. These observations reveal that its flux and
          energy  spectrum  are modulated with the 3.9 day orbital period
          of  the  binary  system.  This  is  the first time in gamma-ray
          astronomy  that  orbital  modulation  has  been  observed,  and
          periodicity  clearly  established  using ground-based gamma-ray
          detectors.  The  VHE  gamma-ray emission is largely confined to
          half  of  the  orbit,  peaking  around the inferior conjunction
          epoch  of  the  compact object. For this epoch, there is also a
          hardening  of  the  energy spectrum in the energy range between
          0.2  TeV  and  a  few  TeV.  The flux vs. orbital phase profile
          provides the first clear indication of gamma-ray absorption via
          pair production within an astrophysical source, a process which
          is  expected  to  occur  if  the  gamma-ray  production site is
          situated  within  ~1  AU  of  the  compact object. Moreover the
          production  region  size must be not significantly greater than
          the  binary  separation  (~0.15 AU). Notably, these constraints
          are  also  considerably smaller than the collimated outflows or
          jets  (extending  out  to  ~1000  AU)  observed in LS 5039. The
          spectral  hardening  could  arise from variations with phase in
          the   maximum   electron  energies,  and/or  the  dominant  VHE
          gamma-ray production mechanism.

          Title:   Are  Diffuse  High  Energy  Neutrinos  from  Starburst
          Galaxies Observable?
          Authors: F.W. Stecker (NASA/GSFC)
          Comments: 5 pages
          Loeb and Waxman have argued that high energy neutrinos from the
          decay  of  pions  produced  in interactions of cosmic rays with
          interstellar gas in starburst galaxies would be produced with a
          large  enough  flux to be observable. Their model is reexamined
          here  and it is shown that the the neutrino flux from starburst
          galaxies,  even  given the various assumptions made by them, is
          more  than an order of magnitude lower than the flux which they
          predict.  The  predicted  neutrino  flux  would  be  below  the
          atmospheric  neutrino foreground flux at energies below 300 TeV
          and   therefore  would  be  unobservable.  PeV  neutrinos  from
          starburst  galaxies  are also unlikely to be detected. Compared
          with  predicted  fluxes  from  other  extragalactic high energy
          neutrino  sources,  PeV  starburst  neutrinos would have a flux
          considerably below that predicted for AGN models.

          Title:   Testing  the  Disk-Locking  Paradigm:  An  Association
          Between U-V Excess and Rotation in NGC 2264
          Authors: Cassandra Fallscheer, William Herbst
          Comments: Accepted by ApJ Letters
          We present some results from a UVI photometric study of a field
          in  the  young open cluster NGC 2264 aimed, in part, at testing
          whether  accretion  in  pre-main  sequence  stars  is linked to
          rotation.  We  confirm  that U-V excess is well correlated with
          H-alpha  equivalent  width for the stars in our sample. We show
          that  for the more massive stars in the cluster sample (roughly
          0.4-1.2  M_sun) there is also a significant association between
          U-V  excess  and  rotation, in the sense that slow rotators are
          more  likely  to  show  excess U-band emission and variability.
          This  constitutes  significant  new  evidence in support of the
          disk-locking paradigm.

          Authors: M. Ikoma, T. Guillot, H. Genda, T. Takayuki, S. Ida
          Comments: 29 pages, 8 figures, to appear in the 10 October 2006
          issue of ApJ
          The  high  density  of the close-in extrasolar planet HD149026b
          suggests  the  presence  of  a  huge  core in the planet, which
          challenges planet formation theory. We first derive constraints
          on  the amount of heavy elements and hydrogen/helium present in
          the  planet: We find that preferred values of the core mass are
          between  50  and 80 M_E. We then investigate the possibility of
          subcritical core accretion as envisioned for Uranus and Neptune
          and find that the subcritical accretion scenario is unlikely in
          the case of HD149026b for at least two reasons: (i) Subcritical
          planets  are  such  that  the ratio of their core mass to their
          total mass is above ~0.7, in contradiction with constraints for
          all  but  the  most  extreme interior models of HD149026b; (ii)
          High  accretion rates and large isolation mass required for the
          formation  of a subcritical core of 30 M_E are possible only at
          specific  orbital distances in a disk with a surface density of
          dust  equal to at least 10 times that of the minimum mass solar
          nebula. This value climbs to 30 when considering a 50 M_E core.
          These  facts  point toward two main routes for the formation of
          this  planet:  (i)  Gas  accretion  that  is  limited by a slow
          viscous   inflow   of  gas  in  an  evaporating  disk;  (ii)  A
          significant modification of the composition of the planet after
          as  accretion  has  stopped.  These two routes are not mutually
          exclusive.  Illustrating  the  second route, we show that for a
          wide  range  of impact parameters, giant impacts lead to a loss
          of the gas component of the planet and thus may lead to planets
          that are highly enriched in heavy elements. In the giant impact
          scenario,  we  expect  an  outer  giant  planet  to be present.
          Observational  studies  by  imaging,  astrometry  and long term
          interferometry  of this system are needed to better narrow down
          the ensemble of possibilities.

          accretion-powered millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658

          Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures, accepted by ApJ
          We  analysed  Rossi  X-ray  Timing Explorer observations of the
          accretion-powered  401  Hz pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658, in order to
          precisely determine the source distance. While the fluences for
          the  five  transient outbursts observed from 1996 were constant
          to  within  the  uncertainties,  the  outburst  interval varied
          signficantly,  so  that  the  time-averaged flux (and accretion
          rate)  decreased  by  around 40%. By equating the time-averaged
          X-ray   flux   with   the  expected  mass  transfer  rate  from
          gravitational  radiation,  we  derived  a  lower  limit  on the
          distance of 3.4 kpc. Combined with an upper limit from assuming
          that  the  four  radius-expansion thermonuclear bursts observed
          during  the 2002 October outburst reached at most the Eddington
          limit  for  a  pure  He  atmosphere, we found that the probable
          distance  range  for  the  source  is  3.4-3.6 kpc. The implied
          inclination,   based   on  the  optical/IR  properties  of  the
          counterpart, is i<~30 degrees.
          We  compared  the  properties  of  the  bursts with an ignition
          model.  The  time  between  bursts  was long enough for hot CNO
          burning to significantly deplete the accreted hydrogen, so that
          ignition  occurred  in  a pure helium layer underlying a stable
          hydrogen  burning  shell.  This  is  the  first  time that this
          burning  regime  has  been securely observationally identified.
          The  observed  energetics  of  the  bursts give a mean hydrogen
          fraction  at  ignition of <X> approx. 0.1, and require that the
          accreted  hydrogen  fraction  X_0 and the CNO metallicity Z_CNO
          are  related  by Z_CNO approx. 0.03(X_0/0.7)^2. We show that in
          this burning regime, a measurement of the burst recurrence time
          and energetics allows the local accretion rate onto the star to
          be determined independently of the accreted composition, giving
          a  new  method  for  estimating the source distance which is in
          good agreement with our other estimates.

          $\Ma  \gtrsim  10^{-5}\Msun$,  the  maximum  field strength and
          latitudinal  half-width  of  the  equatorial  magnetic belt are
          $B_{\rm  max}  = 5.6\times 10^{15} (\Ma/10^{-4}\Msun)^{0.32}$ G
          and $\Delta\theta = \max[3^{\circ}
          (\Ma/10^{-4}\Msun)^{-1.5},3^{\circ}
          (\Ma/10^{-4}\Msun)^{0.5}(\dot{M}_{\rm    a}/10^{-8}\Msun   {\rm
          yr}^{-1})^{-0.5}]$  respectively,  where  $\Ma$  is  the  total
          accreted  mass  and $\dot{M}_{\rm a}$ is the accretion rate. It
          is  shown  that the belt prevents north-south heat transport by
          conduction, convection, radiation, and ageostrophic shear. This
          may  explain why millisecond oscillations observed in the tails
          of  thermonuclear  (type  I)  X-ray  bursts  in  low-mass X-ray
          binaries  are  highly  sinusoidal:  the  thermonuclear flame is
          sequestered in the magnetic hemisphere which ignites first. The
          model  is  also  consistent  with  the occasional occurrence of
          closely     spaced    pairs    of    bursts.    Time-dependent,
          ideal-magnetohydrodynamic    simulations   confirm   that   the
          equatorial  belt  is  not  disrupted  by Parker and interchange
          instabilities.

          Ferreira, C. Dougados and E. Whelan (eds), Springer Verlag
          This  is  a doctorate level lecture on the physics of accretion
          discs driving magnetically self-confined jets, usually referred
          to  in  the  literature  as disc winds. I will first review the
          governing  magnetohydrodynamic equations and then discuss their
          physical  content. At that level, necessary conditions to drive
          jets  from  keplerian  accretion  discs can already be derived.
          These  conditions  are validated with self-similar calculations
          of  accretion-ejection  structures.  In  a  second part, I will
          critically   discuss   the   biases   introduced   when   using
          self-similarity  as  well  as some other questions such as: Are
          these  systems  really  unstable? Can a standard accretion disc
          provide  the  conditions to launch jets in its innermost parts?
          What is the difference between X-winds and disc-winds? Finally,
          the   magnetic   interaction   between   a  protostar  and  its
          circumstellar  disc  will  be discussed with a focus on stellar
          spin down.

          Most  population  I  Wolf-Rayet  (WR)  stars  are  the  He-rich
          descendants  of  the most massive stars (M_i = 25 - 100 M_sun).
          Evidence  has  been  accumulating over the years that among all
          pop  I  WR  stars, those of the relatively cool, N-rich subtype
          "WN8" are among the most peculiar: 1. They tend to be runaways,
          with  large  space  velocity  and/or  avoid clusters. 2. Unlike
          their  equally luminous WN6,7 cousins, only a very small number
          of  WN8  stars are known to belong to a close binary with an OB
          companion.   3.   They   are  the  systematically  most  highly
          stochastically  variable  among  all  (single)  WR stars. Taken
          together, these suggest that many WN8 stars may originally have
          been  in  close binaries (like half of all stars), in which the
          original primary exploded as a supernova, leaving behind a very
          close   binary   containing  a  massive  star  with  a  neutron
          star/black  hole  companion  (like  Cyg  X-3). When the massive
          remaining  star  evolved  in  turn,  it engulfed and eventually
          swallowed  the  compact  companion,  leading  to  the presently
          puffed-up,  variable  WN8  star.  Such  stars could fall in the
          realm of the exotic Thorne-Zytkow objects.

          Disk  material has been observed around both components of some
          young  close  binary  star  systems.  It has been shown that if
          planets  form  at  the right places within such disks, they can
          remain  dynamically  stable  for  very  long  times. Herein, we
          numerically  simulate  the  late  stages  of terrestrial planet
          growth in circumbinary disks around 'close' binary star systems
          with  stellar separations between 0.05 AU and 0.4 AU and binary
          eccentricities  up  to  0.8. In each simulation, the sum of the
          masses  of the two stars is 1 solar mass, and giant planets are
          included.  Our  results  are statistically compared to a set of
          planet  formation  simulations in the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system
          that   begin   with   essentially  the  same  initial  disk  of
          protoplanets. The planetary systems formed around binaries with
          apastron distances less than ~ 0.2 AU are very similar to those
          around   single   stars,  whereas  those  with  larger  maximum
          separations  tend to be sparcer, with fewer planets, especially
          interior  to 1 AU. We also provide formulae that can be used to
          scale  results  of  planetary  accretion simulations to various
          systems  with  different  total  stellar  mass, disk sizes, and
          planetesimal masses and densities.

          Starting  with  the  first  detection  of  an  afterglow from a
          short-duration  hard-spectrum  gamma-ray  burst  (SHB) by Swift
          last  year,  a growing body of evidence has suggested that SHBs
          are  associated  with  an  older  and  lower-redshift  galactic
          population  than long-soft GRBs and, in a few cases, with large
          (>~  10  kpc)  projected  offsets  from  the  centers  of their
          putative  host  galaxies.  Here  we present observations of the
          field  of GRB 060502B, a SHB detected by Swift and localized by
          the  X-ray  Telescope  (XRT). We find a massive red galaxy at a
          redshift  of  z=0.287  at an angular distance of 17.5" from our
          revised  XRT  position.  Using  associative  and  probabilistic
          arguments  we suggest that this galaxy hosted the progenitor of
          GRB  060502B.  If  true,  this  offset  would  correspond  to a
          physical  displacement  of  73  +/- 15 kpc in projection, about
          twice  the  largest  offset  inferred  for  any SHB to date and
          almost  an  order  of magnitude larger than a typical long-soft
          burst  offset.  Spectra  and  modeling  of  the  star-formation
          history of this possible host show it to have undergone a large
          ancient  starburst. If the progenitor of GRB 060502B was formed
          in  this  starburst  episode,  this  would  be the first direct
          constraint  on  the  age  and  minimum  kick  velocity of a SHB
          progentior  from its birthsite. In particular, tau = 1.3 +- 0.2
          Gyr and v_kick_min = 55 +- 15 km/s.

          Title:  Gravitational  Radiation  from Standing Accretion Shock
          Instability in Core-Collapse Supernovae
          Authors: Kei Kotake, Naofumi Ohnishi, Shoichi Yamada
          Comments: 21 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  perform  long-term two dimensional axisymmetric simulations
          in  the  postbounce  phase of core-collapse supernovae to study
          how  the  asphericities  induced  by the growth of the standing
          accretion  shock  instability  (SASI) produce the gravitational
          waveforms.   To   obtain  the  neutrino-driven  explosions,  we
          parameterize  the  neutrino  fluxes  emitted  from  the central
          protoneutron  star  and  approximate the neutrino transfer by a
          light-bulb  scheme.  We  find  that  the  waveforms  due to the
          anisotropic neutrino emissions show the monotonic increase with
          time, whose amplitudes are up to two order-of-magnitudes larger
          than  the  ones  from the convective matter motions outside the
          protoneutron stars.
          We  point  out  that the amplitudes begin to become larger when
          the growth of the SASI enters the nonlinear phase, in which the
          deformation  of  the  shocks and the neutrino anisotropy become
          large.
          From  the  spectrum analysis of the waveforms, we find that the
          amplitudes  from  the neutrinos are dominant over the ones from
          the  matter motions at the frequency below $\sim 100$ Hz, which
          are  suggested  to  be  within  the  detection  limits  of  the
          detectors  in the next generation such as LCGT and the advanced
          LIGO for a supernova at 10 kpc.
          As a contribution to the gravitational wave background, we show
          that  the  amplitudes  from  this source could be larger at the
          frequency  above  $\sim$ 1 Hz than the primordial gravitational
          wave  backgrounds, but unfortunately, invisible to the proposed
          space-based detectors.

          Title: Spectroscopic binaries with components of similar mass

          Comments:   8   pages,  8  figures.  Accepted  by  Astronomy  &
          astrophysics
          The  assertion  that  there  is an intrinsic excess of binaries
          with  mass  ratios  q  \simeq  1  -  the  twin  hypothesis - is
          investigated. A strong version of this hypothesis (H_s), due to
          Lucy  &  Ricco  (1979) and Tokovinin (2000), refers to a narrow
          peak in the distribution function psi(q) for q \ga 0.95. A weak
          version  (H_w),  due  to  Halbwachs  et al. (2003), refers to a
          broad peak for q \ga 0.8. Current data on SB2's is analysed and
          H_s  is  found  to  be  statistically  significant for a sample
          restricted  to orbits of high precision. But claims that H_s is
          significant  for  binaries with special characteristics are not
          confirmed  since  the  sample  sizes are well below the minimum
          required  for  a  reliable test. With regard to H_w, additional
          observational  evidence  is  not presented, but evidence to the
          contrary  in  the  form  of  Hogeveen's (1992b) model of biased
          sampling  with  psi \propto q^{-2} is criticized. Specifically,
          his   success  in  thus  fitting  catalogued  data  depends  on
          implausible  assumptions  about  the  research methodologies of
          binary-star spectroscopists.

          Comments: 19 pages, 12 figures, accepted by ApJ
          Double-peaked  Balmer-line  profiles originate in the accretion
          disks  of  a few percent of optically selected AGN. The reasons
          behind   the  strong  low-ionization  line  emission  from  the
          accretion  disks  of  these objects is still uncertain. In this
          paper, we characterize the X-ray properties of 39 double-peaked
          Balmer  line  AGN,  29 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 10
          low  optical-luminosity  double-peaked  emitters  from  earlier
          radio-selected  samples.  We find that the UV-to-X-ray slope of
          radio-quiet  (RQ)  double-peaked  emitters  as a class does not
          differ substantially from that of normal RQ AGN with similar UV
          monochromatic  luminosity.  The  radio-loud  (RL) double-peaked
          emitters,  with  the  exception  of  LINER  galaxies,  are more
          luminous  in  the  X-rays than RQ AGN, as has been observed for
          other  RL  AGN  with single-peaked profiles. The X-ray spectral
          shapes  of  double-peaked  emitters, measured by their hardness
          ratios or power-law photon indices, are also largely consistent
          with   those  of  normal  AGN  of  similar  radio-loudness.  In
          practically  all  cases  studied here, external illumination of
          the  accretion  disk  is  necessary  to produce the Balmer-line
          emission,  as  the gravitational energy released locally in the
          disk  by  viscous  stresses is insufficient to produce lines of
          the observed strength. In the Appendix we study the variability
          of  Mrk  926, a double-peaked emitter with several observations
          in the optical and X-ray bands.

          non-simultaneous  spectra are consistent with the same spectral
          shape  and  flux, suggesting little variability over the period
          July  to  October  2005,  but the analysis of archival INTEGRAL
          data  shows  that  the  source  was  not detected in 2003-2004,

          Authors: The IceCube Collaboration
          Comments: 14 pages, 3 figures
          On  December  27th  2004,  a  giant  gamma  flare from the Soft
          Gamma-ray  Repeater  1806-20 saturated many satellite gamma-ray
          detectors.  This event was by more than two orders of magnitude
          the  brightest  cosmic  transient  ever  observed. If the gamma
          emission  extends  up  to  TeV  energies  with a hard power law
          energy  spectrum,  photo-produced  muons  could  be observed in
          surface and underground arrays. Moreover, high-energy neutrinos
          could  have  been  produced during the SGR giant flare if there
          were  substantial  baryonic  outflow  from  the magnetar. These
          high-energy  neutrinos  would  have  also  produced muons in an
          underground  array.  AMANDA-II was used to search for downgoing
          muons  indicative  of  high-energy gammas and/or neutrinos. The
          data  revealed  no  significant  signal. The upper limit on the
          gamma flux at 90% CL is dN/dE < 0.05 (0.5) TeV^-1 m^-2 s^-1 for
          gamma=-1.47 (-2). Similarly, we set limits on the normalization
          constant  of  the  high-energy  neutrino  emission of 0.4 (6.1)
          TeV^-1 m^-2 s^-1 for gamma=-1.47 (-2).

          The  Local  Group galaxies constitute a fundamental step in the
          definition  of  cosmic  distance  scale.  Therefore,  obtaining
          accurate  distance  determinations to the galaxies in the Local
          Group,  and notably to the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), is essential
          to determining the age and evolution of the Universe. With this
          ultimate  goal  in  mind, we started a project to use eclipsing
          binaries as distance indicators to M31. Eclipsing binaries have
          been  proved  to  yield  direct  and precise distances that are
          essentially assumption free. To do so, high-quality photometric
          and  spectroscopic  data  are  needed.  As  a first step in the
          project,  broad  band  photometry (in Johnson B and V) has been
          obtained in a region (34'x34') at the North-Eastern quadrant of
          the  galaxy  over  5  years. The data, containing more than 250
          observations  per  filter,  have  been  reduced by means of the
          so-called  difference  image analysis technique and the DAOPHOT
          program.  A catalog with 236238 objects with photometry in both
          B and V passbands has been obtained. The catalog is the deepest
          (V<25.5 mag) obtained so far in the studied region and contains
          3964 identified variable stars, with 437 eclipsing binaries and
          416 Cepheids. The most suitable eclipsing binary candidates for
          distance  determination  have  been selected according to their
          brightness and from the modelling of the obtained light curves.
          The  resulting  sample  includes  24  targets  with photometric
          errors   around   0.01   mag.   Detailed   analysis  (including

          Title:  Possibilities  of  analysis of brightness distributions
          for  components  of  eclipsing  variables  from  data  of space
          photometry
          Authors: M.B.Bogdanov, A.M.Cherepashchuk
          Comments:  12  pages LaTeX, 6 figures, Contributed paper at the
          All-Russian  Astronomical  conference  "Close  Binary  Stars in
          Modern Astrophysics (MARTYNOV-2006)" held in Moscow, Russia May
          22 - 24, 2006
          We  carried  out numerical experiments on the evaluation of the
          possibilities  of  obtaining  the  information about brightness
          distributions  for  the  components of eclipsing variables from
          the  data  of  high-precision  photometry  expected for planned
          satellites  COROT and Kepler. We examined a simple model of the
          eclipsing  binary  with  the  spherical  components on circular
          orbits  and the linear law of the limb darkening. The solutions
          of  light  curves  have  been  obtained  as  by  fitting of the
          nonlinear  model,  into  the  number  of  parameters  of  which
          included  the  limb  darkening  coefficients,  so  also  by the
          solution  of  the  ill-posed  inverse problem of restoration of
          brightness  distributions  across  the  disks  of stars without
          rigid  model  constraints  on  the form of these functions. The
          obtained  estimations  show  that if the observational accuracy
          amounts  to  0.0001 then the limb darkening coefficients can be
          found   with  the  relative  error  approximately  0.01  .  The
          brightness  distributions across the disks of components can be
          restored also nearly with the same accuracy.

          Comments: 7 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          In  this  work we study the physical and kinematical properties
          of the emission line region of Seyfert 1.5 galaxy Mrk 817 using
          three  sets  of  observations,  among which are high-resolution
          spectra  obtained  with  the  Isaac  Newton Telescope on Canary
          Islands.  We  find  that  in Mrk 817 the Narrow (NEL) and Broad
          Emission   Lines   (BEL)  are  very  complex,  indicating  that
          structure  of both the Narrow (NLR) and Broad Line Region (BLR)
          is  complex  and  consists  of  at  least  two sub-regions with
          different  kinematical  properties. We find that the BEL can be
          fitted with the two-component model, where the core of the line
          is  coming  from  a  spherical  region  with isotropic velocity
          distribution,  and  wings  might  be affected by a low inclined
          accretion disc (or disc-like emitting region). Also, we discuss
          the  physical  properties of the BLR. Moreover, we find that an
          outflow  is  present  in  the  NLR,  that  may  be driven by an
          approaching jet.

          We  describe  briefly  the properties of the recently completed
          Southern  African  Large Telescope (SALT), along with its first
          light imager SALTICAM. Using this instrument, we present 4.3 hr
          of  high  speed  unfiltered  photometric  observations  of  the
          eclipsing polar SDSSJ015543.40+002807.2 with time resolution as
          short  as 112 ms, the highest quality observations of this kind
          of  any  polar to date. The system was observed during its high
          luminosity  state.  Two accreting poles are clearly seen in the
          eclipse  light  curve.  The  binary system parameters have been
          constrained:  the  white  dwarf  mass  is at the low end of the
          range  expected for cataclysmic variables. Correlations between
          the  positions  of the accretion regions on or near the surface
          of  the  white  dwarf  and  the  binary  system parameters were
          established.  The  sizes  of  the  accretion  regions and their
          relative  movement from eclipse to eclipse were estimated: they
          are typically 4-7 deg depending on the mass of the white dwarf.
          The potential of these observations will only fully be realised
          when  low  state  data  of  the  same kind are obtained and the
          contact phases of the eclipse of the white dwarf are measured.

          Title:    Planetesimal    formation    via   fragmentation   in
          self-gravitating protoplanetary discs

          Comments: 5 pages, Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          An  unsolved  issue  in  the  standard core accretion model for
          gaseous  planet  formation is how kilometre-sized planetesimals
          form  from,  initially,  micron-sized dust grains. Solid growth
          beyond  metre  sizes can be difficult both because the sticking
          efficiency  becomes  very  small,  and  because these particles
          should  rapidly migrate into the central star. We consider here
          how  metre-sized particles evolve in self-gravitating accretion
          discs using simulations in which the gravitational influence of
          the  solid  particles  is  also included. Metre-sized particles
          become  strongly  concentrated in the spiral structures present
          in  the  disc  and,  if  the  solid  to  gas  density  ratio is
          sufficiently  high,  can fragment due to their own self-gravity
          to  form  planetesimals  directly.  This  result  suggests that
          planetesimal  formation  may  occur  very  early  in  the  star
          formation  process  while  discs are still massive enough to be
          self-gravitating. The dependence of this process on the surface
          density  of  the solids is also consistent with the observation
          that  extrasolar  planets  are preferentially found around high
          metallicity stars.

          We  discuss  the  relationship  between  rest-frame  color  and
          optical  luminosity  for  X-ray  sources in the range 0.6<z<1.4
          selected  from  the  Chandra survey of the Extended Groth Strip
          (EGS).  These  objects  are  almost exclusively active galactic
          nuclei  (AGN).  While  there  are a few luminous QSOs, most are
          relatively  weak or obscured AGN whose optical colors should be
          dominated  by host galaxy light. The vast majority of AGN hosts
          at z~1 are luminous and red, with very few objects fainter than
          M_{B}=-20.5  or  bluer  than  U-B=0.6. This places the AGN in a
          distinct   region   of  color-magnitude  space,  on  the  ``red
          sequence''  or  at  the top of the ``blue cloud'', with many in
          between  these  two  modes  in galaxy color. A key stage in the
          evolution  of  massive  galaxies  is  when  star  formation  is
          quenched,  resulting  in a migration from the blue cloud to the
          red  sequence.  Our  results  are  consistent with scenarios in
          which  AGN  either  cause or maintain this quenching. The large
          numbers  of  red  sequence  AGN imply that strong, ongoing star
          formation  is  not  a necessary ingredient for AGN activity, as
          black  hole  accretion  appears  often  to  persist  after star
          formation has been terminated.

          We  describe  AEGIS20  -  a  radio survey of the Extended Groth
          Strip  (EGS)  conducted  with  the  Very  Large  Array (VLA) at
          1.4GHz.  The  resulting  catalog contains 1,123 emitters and is
          sensitive  to  ultraluminous starbursts to z<=1.1, well matched
          to the redshift range of the DEEP2 spectroscopic survey in this
          region.  We  use  stacking  techniques to explore the uJy-level
          emission  from  a  variety  of  galaxy populations selected via
          conventional  criteria  -  Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs), distant
          red  galaxies  (DRGs),  UV-selected  galaxies and extremely red
          objects  (EROs) - determining their properties as a function of
          color,   magnitude   and  redshift  and  their  extinction-free
          contributions  to the history of star formation. We confirm the
          familiar  pattern  that  the star-formation-rate (SFR) density,
          SFRD,  rises  by  at  least  ~10x  from z=0-1, although we note
          highly  discrepant  UV-  and  radio-based  SFR  estimates.  Our
          radio-based  SFRs  become  more  difficult  to interpret at z>1
          where   correcting   for  contamination  by  radio-loud  active
          galactic  nuclei (AGN) comes at the price of rejecting luminous
          starbursts. Whilst stacking radio images is a useful technique,
          accurate  radio-based  SFRs  for  z>>1 galaxies require precise
          redshifts  and  extraordinarily  high-fidelity  radio  data  to
          identify and remove accretion-related emission.

          Using  data  from  the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey and HST/ACS
          imaging  in  the  Extended  Groth  Strip,  we select nearly 100
          interacting  galaxy systems including kinematic close pairs and
          morphologically-identified  merging  galaxies.  Spitzer MIPS 24
          micron  fluxes  of these systems reflect the current dusty star
          formation  activity,  and  at  fixed  stellar  mass (M_{*}) the
          median  infrared luminosity (L_{IR}) among merging galaxies and
          close  pairs  of  blue  galaxies is twice (1.9 +/- 0.4) that of
          control  pairs  drawn  from isolated blue galaxies. Enhancement
          declines with galaxy separation, being strongest in close pairs
          and  mergers  and  weaker in wide pairs compared to the control
          sample.  At  z  ~  0.9,  7.1  +/-  4.3 % of massive interacting
          galaxies  (M_{*} > 2*10^{10} M_{solar}) are found to be ULIRGs,
          compared  to  2.6  +/-  0.7  % in the control sample. The large
          spread of IR luminosity to stellar mass ratio among interacting
          galaxies  suggests  that  this  enhancement  may  depend on the
          merger  stage  as  well  as  other  as yet unidentified factors
          (e.g.,  galaxy  structure, mass ratio, orbital characteristics,
          presence  of  AGN  or  bar).  The  contribution  of interacting
          systems  to  the total IR luminosity density is moderate (<= 36
          %).

          We  explore  the  environment  of  z~1 AGN using a sample of 53
          spectroscopically    identified    X-ray    sources    in   the
          All-wavelength  Extended  Groth  strip International Survey. We
          quantify  the  local density in the vicinity of an X-ray source
          by measuring the projected surface density of spectroscopically
          identified  optical galaxies within a radius defined by the 3rd
          nearest  neighbour.  Our main result is that X-ray selected AGN
          at z~1 avoid underdense regions at the 99.89% confidence level.
          Moreover,  although  we find that the overall population shares
          the  same  (rich)  environment with optical galaxies of similar
          U-B  and  M_B,  there is also tentative evidence (96%) that AGN
          with blue colors (U-B<1) reside in denser environments compared
          to  optical  galaxies.  We  argue  that the results above are a
          consequence  of the whereabouts of massive galaxies, capable of
          hosting   supermassive  black  holes  at  their  centers,  with
          available  cold  gas  reservoirs, the fuel for AGN activity. At
          z~1  an  increasing fraction of such systems are found in dense
          regions.

          Submilliarcsecond  astrometry and imaging of the black hole Sgr
          A*  at  the  Galactic  Center  may  become possible in the near

          background  emission. However, more exciting is the prospect of
          observing  ``hot spots'' in the accretion flow. Here we discuss

          We  present  deep  Hubble  Space  Telescope Advanced Camera for
          Surveys  / High Resolution Channel U, narrow-V, and I images of
          nine  "ultracompact"  blue dwarf galaxies (UCBDs) selected from
          the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey. We define UCBDs as local (z <
          0.01)  star-forming  galaxies having angular diameters < 6" and
          physical sizes < 1 kpc. They are also among the most metal-poor
          galaxies  known, and are found to reside within voids. Both the
          HST  images  and  the objects' optical spectra reveal that they
          are  composites  of  young  (~1  Myr) populations that dominate
          their  light,  and  older  (~10  Gyr) populations that dominate
          their  stellar  masses,  which  we  estimate to be ~10^7 - 10^8
          Msol.  An intermediate-age population is also indicated in most
          cases.  The  objects  are  not  as dynamically disturbed as the
          prototype  UCBD,  POX 186, but the structure of several of them
          suggests  that  their current starbursts have been triggered by
          the collisions/mergers of smaller clumps of stars. In one case,
          HS  0822+3542,  the  ACS/HRC images resolve the object into two
          small  (~100  pc)  components  which  appear  to  have recently
          collided, supporting this interpretation. In six of the objects
          much  of  their star formation is concentrated in Young Massive
          Star clusters. The evidence that the galaxies consist mainly of
          ~10  Gyr old stars establishes that they are not protogalaxies;
          their low metallicities are more likely to be the result of the
          escape  of supernova ejecta, as opposed to youth. These results
          are  consistent  with recent galaxy formation simulations which
          predict  that  cosmic  re-ionization  at  z  ~  6 significantly
          limited  the  subsequent  star  formation  of dwarf galaxies in
          voids  due  to the photo-evaporation of baryons from their cold
          dark matter halos (Abridged).

          Title:  Local hydrodynamics and operator stability of Keplerian
          accretion disks
          Authors: Peter Todd Williams
          Comments:  Old (October 2000) manuscript submitted to ApJL. See
          discussion in postscript. Posted for archival purposes only
          We  discuss non-self-gravitating hydrodynamic disks in the thin
          disk  limit. These systems are stable according to the Rayleigh
          criterion,  and yet there is some evidence that the dissipative
          and  transport  processes  in  these  disks are hydrodynamic in
          nature at least some of the time. We draw on recent work on the
          hydrodynamics  of  laboratory shear flows. Such flows are often
          experimentally  unstable  even  in  the  absence  of  a  linear
          instability.  The transition to turbulence in these systems, as
          well  as  the  large  linear transient amplification of initial
          disturbances,  may  depend  upon the non-self-adjoint nature of
          the  differential  operator  that  describes  the  dynamics  of
          perturbations  to  the  background  state.  We  find that small
          initial  perturbations  can  produce  large growth in accretion
          disks  in  the  shearing  sheet approximation with shearing box
          boundary   conditions,   despite  the  absence  of  any  linear
          instability.   Furthermore,   the  differential  operator  that
          propagates initial conditions forward in time is asymptotically
          close  (as a function of Reynolds number) to possessing growing
          eigenmodes.  The similarity to the dynamics of laboratory shear
          flows   is   suggestive   that   accretion   disks   might   be
          hydrodynamically   unstable  despite  the  lack  of  any  known
          instability mechanism.

          Title: Two-dimensional MHD simulations of relativistic magnetic
          reconnection
          Authors: Naoyuki Watanabe, Takaaki Yokoyama
          Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures, accepted by ApJL
          It has been recognized that magnetic reconnection process is of
          great  importance in high-energy astrophysics. We develop a new
          two-dimensional   relativistic   resistive  magnetohydrodynamic
          (R$^2$MHD)   code,  and  carry  out  numerical  simulations  of
          magnetic  reconnection.  We  find that outflow velocity reaches
          Alfv\'{e}n  velocity  in  the  inflow  region,  and that higher
          Alfv\'{e}n  velocity provides higher reconnection rate. We also
          find Lorentz contraction plays an important role in enhancement
          of reconnection rate.

          Title:  Ionization of large-scale absorbing haloes and feedback
          events from high-redshift radio galaxies

          We     present    photoionization    calculations    for    the
          spatially-extended  absorbers  observed  towards  the  extended
          emission  line  spectrum  of  two high-redshift radio galaxies:
          0943-242  (z=2.922)  and  0200+015  (z=2.230),  with the aim of
          reproducing the absorber column ratio, N(CIV)/N(HI). We explore
          the   effects   of   using   different   UV   continua  in  the
          photoionization calculations. A comparison is drawn between the
          absorber  in  0200+015 and the two absorbers in the lensed Lynx
          Arc  Nebula  at  z=3.36,  which  present  similar  N(CIV)/N(HI)
          ratios.  We find that hot stars from a powerful starburst, or a
          metagalactic background radiation (MBR) in which stars dominate
          over  quasars, are equally successful in producing the observed
          N(CIV)/N(HI),  assuming  subsolar absorber metallicities. These
          softer SEDs eliminate the factor 1000 difference in metallicity
          between  the two absorbers encountered in earlier work assuming
          a  powerlaw  SED.  The  detected  level  of  continuum  flux in
          0943-242  is  consistent with stellar ionization. If the MBR is
          responsible  for  the  ionization of the radio galaxy absorbing
          shells,  their  radii (if spherical) would be large (> 100 kpc)
          and  their  mass  would  be huge (>1E12 M_Sun), implying that a
          feedback   event  within  the  radiogalaxy  has  expelled  more
          baryonic  material  than left within it. If, as we believe more
          likely,  stellar sources within the radiogalaxy are responsible
          for  the  absorber's  ionization,  smaller radii of ~25 kpc and
          much smaller masses (~1E8-1E10 M_Sun) are inferred. This radius
          is consistent with the observed transition in radio source size
          between  smaller  sources  where strong HI absorption is almost
          ubiquitous,  and the larger sources where it is mostly lacking.
          Finally,  we  outline  additional  absorption  line diagnostics
          which  could further constrain the properties of the haloes and
          their ionization sources.

          Title:   TIRAVEL   -   Template   Independent  RAdial  VELocity
          measurement
          Authors:  Shay  Zucker,  Tsevi  Mazeh (Tel Aviv University, Tel
          Aviv, Israel)
          Comments:  6  pages,  11  figures,  to  be published in Monthly
          Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
          We  propose  a  new  approach  to  measure  differential radial
          velocities, mainly for single-lined spectroscopic binaries. The
          proposed  procedure  -  TIRAVEL  (Template  Independent  RAdial
          VELocities)  - does not rely on a prior theoretical or observed
          template,  but  instead  looks  for  a  set of relative Doppler
          shifts  that  simultaneously optimizes the alignment of all the
          observed  spectra. We suggest a simple measure to quantify this
          overall  alignment  and use its maximum to measure the relative
          radial  velocities. As a demonstration, we apply TIRAVEL to the
          observed  spectra  of  three  known spectroscopic binaries, and
          show that in two cases TIRAVEL performs as good as the commonly
          used  approach,  while  in  one  case  TIRAVEL yielded a better
          orbital solution.

          Title: PVLAS Experiment: Some Astrophysical Consequences
          Authors: Yu.N. Gnedin, M.Yu. Piotrovich, T.M. Natsvlishvili
          The   birefringent   effects   of   photon-pseudoscalar   boson
          (Goldstone) particle mixing in intergalactic magnetic field are
          calculated  for cosmological objects. We use the recent results
          of  PVLAS  collaboration that reported recently the observation
          of  a  rotation  of the polarization plane of light propagating
          through  a transverse static magnetic field. Such results which
          were  interpretated as arising due to conversion of photon into
          pseudoscalar  with  coupling  strength $g_{a\gamma}\sim 4\times
          10^{-6}  GeV^{-1}$  allows  us  to  estimate  the intergalactic
          magnetic   field  magnitude  as  $\sim  10^{-16}  G$  based  on
          Hatsemekers  et al. observations of extreme-scale alignments of
          quasar  polarization  vectors. We have analyzed some additional
          results of astronomical observations that could be explained by
          axion  interpretation  of the PVLAS data: a sharp steepening of
          the  QSO  continuum  short  ward  of $\simeq 1100$\AA, observed
          circular  polarization  of  AGNs  and QSOs, discrepancy between
          observed  intrinsic  polarization  of stars in the Local Bubble
          and  stellar spectral classification. The observed polarization
          of stars in the Local Bubble can't be explained by interstellar
          origin.

          We  consider  the production of positrons in microquasars, i.e.
          X-ray  binary  systems  that  exhibit  jets frequently, but not
          continuously.  We  estimate the production rate of positrons in
          microquasars,  both  by simple energy considerations and in the
          framework  of  various  proposed  models.  We then evaluate the
          collective emissivity of the annihilation radiation produced by
          Galactic  microquasars  and  we find that it might constitute a
          substantial  contribution  to the annihilation flux measured by
          INTEGRAL/SPI. We also discuss the possible spatial distribution
          of   Galactic  microquasars,  on  the  basis  of  the  (scarce)
          available  data  and  the  resulting  morphology  of  the  flux
          received  on  Earth.  Finally,  we consider nearby 'misaligned'
          microquasars,  with jets occasionally hitting the atmosphere of
          the  companion  star;  these  would represent interesting point
          sources,  for  which we determine the annihilation flux and the
          corresponding  light  curve,  as  well  as  the line's spectral
          profile.  We discuss the possibility of detection of such point
          sources by future instruments.

          The  results  of  27  hours  of  time series photometry of SDSS
          121209.31+013627.7 are presented. The binary period established
          from spectroscopy is confirmed and refined to 0.061412 d (88.43
          minutes).   The  photometric  variations  are  dominated  by  a
          brightening of about 16 mmag, lasting a little less than half a
          binary  cycle.  The amplitude is approximately the same in V, R
          and  white  light. A secondary small brightness increase during
          each  cycle  may  also  be  present.  We  speculate  that  SDSS
          121209.31+013627.7 may be a polar in a low state.

          interpretation  of  the  central  soft  X-ray excess and WMAP's
          non-detection of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect
          Authors: Richard Lieu, John Quenby
          Comments: ApJ submitted
          WMAP's  first  year  non-detection  of  the  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
          effect  (SZE)  among  a  sample  of  31  rich Abell clusters is
          interpreted  in  terms  of  conventional physics. It is already
          widely  believed  that  the  central soft X-ray excess found in
          some clusters cannot be of thermal origin, due to problems with
          rapid   gas   cooling,   but  may  arise  from  inverse-Compton
          scattering  between intracluster relativistic electrons and the
          cosmic  microwave background. We demonstrate that higher energy
          electrons  drawn  from  the  same  power-law  spectrum  as that
          responsible for the soft excess may also synchrotron radiate in
          the  intracluster  magnetic  field  of  strength  B  $\lesssim$
          1~$\mu$G  to  produce  cluster  microwave emissions in the WMAP
          passbands  that  account  for the missing SZE flux. There is in
          fact  no  significant  discrepancy between the model parameters
          that   account  for  either  phenomena.  This  strengthens  the
          likelihood  of  prevailing  non-thermal  activities in at least
          some  clusters.  The  key  point  is that by merely invoking an
          intracluster   population   of  cosmic  rays  having  the  same
          properties  as  those  of our Galaxy, the microwave synchrotron
          flux  is  already within a factor of five from the expected SZE
          flux.  The electrons may originate from AGN jet injection, then
          distributed  cluster-wide with accompanying {\it in situ} Fermi
          acceleration, by Alfven waves.

          A  key  process  within  astronomy  is  the  exchange  of mass,
          momentum,  and  energy between diffuse plasmas in many types of
          astronomical  sources  (including planetary nebulae, wind-blown
          bubbles,  supernova  remnants,  starburst  superwinds,  and the
          intracluster medium) and dense, embedded clouds or clumps. This
          transfer  affects  the large scale flows of the diffuse plasmas
          as  well  as  the evolution of the clumps. I review our current
          understanding   of   mass-injection   processes,   and  examine
          intermediate-scale   structure   and   the   global  effect  of
          mass-loading  on  a  flow.  I  then  discuss  mass-loading in a
          variety of diffuse sources.

          Current  emission-line  based  estimates  of the metallicity of
          active  galactic  nuclei  (AGN)  at both high and low redshifts
          indicate  that  AGN  have  predominantly  solar  to  supersolar
          metallicities.  This  leads to the question: do low metallicity
          AGN  exist?  In  this  paper  we  use photoionization models to
          examine  the  effects  of  metallicity variations on the narrow
          emission   lines   from   an  AGN.  We  explore  a  variety  of
          emission-line  diagnostics  that are useful for identifying AGN
          with  low  metallicity  gas. We find that line ratios involving
          [NII]  are  the  most robust metallicity indicators in galaxies
          where  the  primary  source  of  ionization  is from the active
          nucleus.  Ratios involving [SII] and [OI] are strongly affected
          by  uncertainties  in  modelling  the  density structure of the
          narrow  line  clouds.  To  test  our diagnostics, we turn to an
          analysis of AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find
          a  clear  trend in the relative strength of [NII] with the mass
          of  the AGN host galaxy. The metallicity of the ISM is known to
          be  correlated  with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies; our
          results  indicate  that a similar trend exists for AGN. We also
          find  that  the best-fit models for typical Seyfert narrow line
          regions   have  supersolar  abundances.  Although  there  is  a
          mass-dependent   range   of   a   factor  of  2-3  in  the  NLR
          metallicities  of  the  AGN  in  our sample, AGN with sub-solar
          metallicities  are  very  rare  in the SDSS. Out of a sample of
          ~23000 Seyfert 2 galaxies we find only ~40 clear candidates for
          AGN with NLR abundances that are below solar.

          Title:  Meteoritical  and  dynamical  constraints on the growth
          mechanisms and formation times of asteroids and Jupiter
          Authors: Edward R. D. Scott
          Comments: Accepted for publication in Icarus
          Peak  temperatures  inside  meteorite parent bodies are closely
          linked  to  accretion  times.  Most  iron  meteorites come from
          bodies that accreted <0.5 Myr after CAIs formed and were melted
          by  26Al  and  60Fe,  probably  inside  2  AU. Chondrite groups
          accreted  intermittently  over  4 Myr starting 1 Myr after CAIs
          formed when planetary embryos may already have formed at ~1 AU.
          Meteorite   evidence   precludes   accretion   of  late-forming
          chondrites  on  the  surface  of  early-formed  bodies; instead
          chondritic  and  non-chondritic  meteorites  probably formed in
          separate  planetesimals.  Maximum  metamorphic  temperatures in
          chondrite  groups  correlate inversely with mean chondrule age,
          as  expected  for  26Al  heating. Dynamical models suggest that
          asteroids  accreted  before Jupiter. Therefore Jupiter probably
          reached  its  current  mass  >3-5  Myr  after CAIs formed. This
          precludes  formation of Jupiter via a gravitational instability
          <1  Myr after the solar nebula formed, and strongly favors core
          accretion.  Shocks formed by gravitational instabilities in the
          disk,  proto-Jupiter, or by planetary embryos may have produced
          some  chondrules.  The minimum lifetime for the solar nebula of
          3-5  Myr  inferred  from  CAI and chondrule ages may exceed the
          median  3  Myr  lifetime  for protoplanetary disks, but is well
          within  the  total  1-10 Myr range. Shorter formation times for
          extrasolar  planets  may  help  to explain why their orbits are
          unlike those of solar giant planets.

          Limber's   inversion   equation,   are  ~16  and  ~19  h-1  Mpc
          respectively  (for  the  comoving  clustering  evolution model)
          while  the  median redshifts of the soft and hard X-ray sources
          are z~ 1.2 and 0.75, respectively. Within the framework of flat
          cosmological  models we find that these results support a model
          with   Omega_m=0.26,   \sigma_8=0.75,   w=-0.9   (in  excellent
          agreement  with  the  3  year  WMAP  results). We also find the
          present day bias of X-ray AGNs to be b_o=2.

          Title:  Collapse  of  rotating  stars  in  the Universe and the
          cosmic gamma ray bursts
          Authors: A.I. Bogomazov, V.M. Lipunov, A.V. Tutukov
          Comments: 18 pages, 3 figures
          We  analyze  here  late  evolutionary  stages  of massive (with
          initial  mass  higher  than  8  masses of the Sun) close binary
          stars.  Our  purposes are to study possible mechanisms of gamma
          ray  bursts  (GRBs)  origin.  We suppose in this paper that GRB
          phenomenon  require  formation  of  massive  (approx.  1 M_sun)
          compact (approx. 10 km) accretion disks around Kerr black holes
          and  neutron  stars.  Such  Kerr  black  holes  are products of
          collapse  of  Wolf-Rayet  stars in extremely close binaries and
          merging  of  neutron  stars  with black holes and neutron stars
          with  neutron stars in close binary systems. Required accretion
          disks also can be formed around neutron stars which were formed
          during  collapse of accreting oxygen-neon white dwarfs. We have
          estimated  frequencies  of  events  which  lead to a rotational
          collapse   concerned   with   formation   of  rapidly  rotating
          relativistic  objects  in  the Galaxy. We made our calculations
          using the "Scenario Machine".

          4U~1728-34 observed with INTEGRAL

          Comments:  11  pages,  7  figures,  and  2 tables. Accepted for
          publication in A&A
          We  present  for  the first time a study of the 3-200 keV broad
          band spectra of the bursting atoll source 4U 1728-34 (GX 354-0)
          along  its  hardness  intensity  diagram. The analysis was done
          using  the  INTEGRAL  public  and Galactic Center deep exposure
          data  ranging  from  February 2003 to October 2004. The spectra
          are  well  described  by a thermal Comptonization model with an
          electron  temperature  from 35 keV to 3 keV and Thomson optical
          depth,  tau_T,  from  0.5  to  5 in a slab geometry. The source
          undergoes  a  transition  from  an  intermediate/hard to a soft
          state  where  the  source luminosity increases from 2 to 12% of
          Eddington.  We have also detected 36 type I X-ray bursts two of
          which  show photospheric radius expansion. The energetic bursts
          with  photospheric radius expansion occurred at an inferred low
          mass accretion rate per unit area of \dot m ~ 1.7x10E3 g/cm2/s,
          while  the  others  at a higher one between 2.4x10E3 - 9.4x10E3
          g/cm2/s.  For  4U1728-34  the  bursts'  total  fluence, and the
          bursts'  peak  flux are anti-correlated with the mass accretion
          rate.  The  type  I  X-ray  bursts  involve pure helium burning
          either  during  the hard state, or during the soft state of the
          source.

          Title:  Introducing  Powell's  Direction  Set Method to a Fully
          Automated Analysis of Eclipsing Binary Stars
          Authors: A. Prsa, T. Zwitter
          Comments:  6 pages, 2 Figures, 1 Table; to appear in the "Solar
          and Stellar Physics through Eclipses" Proceedings (accepted)
          With  recent observational advancements, substantial amounts of
          photometric  and  spectroscopic eclipsing binary data have been
          acquired.  As  part of an ongoing effort to assemble a reliable
          pipeline  for  fully  automatic  data analysis, we put Powell's
          direction set method to the test. The method does not depend on
          numerical  derivatives,  only  on  function evaluations, and as
          such  it  cannot  diverge. Compared to differential corrections
          (DC)  and  Nelder  &  Mead's  downhill  simplex  (NMS)  method,
          Powell's  method  proves  to  be  more  efficient  in  terms of
          solution  determination  and the required number of iterations.
          However,  its application is still not optimal in terms of time
          cost.  Causes  for this deficiency are identified and two steps
          toward  the  solution  are  proposed:  non-ortogonality  of the
          parameter  set  should be removed and better initial directions
          should be determined before the minimization is initiated. Once
          these  setbacks  are  worked out, Powell's method will probably
          replace  DC  and  NMS  as  the  default minimizing algorithm in
          PHOEBE modeling package.

          Title: Astrophysical Effects of Scalar Dark Matter Miniclusters
          Authors: Kathryn M. Zurek, Craig J. Hogan, Thomas R. Quinn (UW,
          Physics and Astronomy Departments)
          Comments: 13 pages, 12 figures
          We  model the formation, evolution and astrophysical effects of
          dark  compact  Scalar  Miniclusters  (``ScaMs''). These objects
          arise  when  a  scalar  field, with an axion-like or Higgs-like
          potential,  undergoes a second order phase transition below the
          QCD  scale.  Such  a  scalar field may couple too weakly to the
          standard  model  to  be  detectable  directly  through particle
          interactions,  but  may  still  be  detectable by gravitational
          effects,  such  as  lensing  and  baryon  accretion  by  large,
          gravitationally bound miniclusters. The masses of these objects
          are shown to be constrained by the Ly$\alpha$ power spectrum to
          be  less  than $\sim 10^4 M_\odot$, but they may be as light as
          classical   axion  miniclusters,  of  the  order  of  $10^{-12}
          M_\odot$. We simulate the formation and nonlinear gravitational
          collapse  of  these  objects  around  matter-radiation equality
          using  an  N-body  code,  estimate  their gravitational lensing
          properties,  and  assess the feasibility of studying them using
          current  and  future  lensing  experiments.  Future  MACHO-type
          variability  surveys  of  many  background  sources  can reveal
          either  high-amplification,  strong  lensing events, or measure
          density   profiles   directly   via  weak-lensing  variability,
          depending  on  ScaM parameters and survey depth. However, ScaMs
          are  unlikely  to  be  responsible  for  apparent  MACHO events
          already  detected  in  the  Galactic halo. A simple estimate is
          made  of  parameters  that  would  give rise to early structure
          formation;  in  principle,  early  stellar  collapse  could  be
          triggered by ScaMs as early as recombination, and significantly
          affect cosmic reionization.

          Title: Self-Similar Evolutionary Solutions of Self-Gravitating,
          Polytropic $\beta$-Viscous Disks
          Authors: Shahram Abbassi, Jamshid Ghanbari, Fatemeh Salehi
          Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures, accepted by A&A
          We  carry  out the effect of $\beta$-prescription for viscosity
          which  introduced by Duschel et al. 2000 & Hure, Richard & Zhan
          2001,  in  a  standard  self-gravitating  thin  disks.  We were
          predicted  in  a  self-gravitating  thin disk the $\beta$-model
          will  have  different dynamical behavior compare the well known
          $\alpha$-prescriptions.   We   used  self-similar  methods  for
          solving  the  integrated  equations  which govern the dynamical
          behavior   of  the  thin  disks.  We  present  the  results  of
          self-similar  solutions  of the time evolution of axisymmetric,
          polytropic,  self-gravitating  viscous  disks around a new born
          central object. We apply a $\beta$-viscosity prescription which
          has   been   derived   from  rotating  shear  flow  experiments
          ($\nu=\beta  r^2\Omega$).  Using  reduced  equations  in a slow
          accretion   limit,   we   demonstrate  inside-out  self-similar
          solutions  after  core  formation  in the center. Some physical
          quantities for $\beta$-disks are determined numerically.We have
          compared our results with $\alpha$-disks under the same initial
          conditions.  It has been found that the accretion rate onto the
          central  object  for  $\beta$-disks more than $\alpha$-disks at
          least  in  the  outer  regions  where  $\beta$-disks  are  more
          efficient.  Our  results show that Toomre instability parameter
          is  less  than  one  everywhere on the $\beta$-disk which means
          that in such disks gravitational instabilities can be occurred,
          so  the  $\beta$-disk  model  can  be  a good candidate for the
          origin   of  planetary  systems.  Our  results  show  that  the
          $\beta$-disks will decouple in the outer part of the disk where
          the  self-gravity plays an important role which is in agreement
          with Duschl predictions.

          Title:  Numerical  simulations  on  the  relative importance of
          starbursts and AGN in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies
          Authors: Kenji Bekki, Yashuhiro Shioya, Matthew Whiting
          Comments:  18  pages,  15  figures  (f1.jpg for color figure of
          figure 1), accepted in MNRAS
          We investigate the relative importance of starbursts and AGN in
          nuclear activities of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs)
          based    on    chemodynamical    simulations    combined   with
          spectrophotometric  synthesis codes. We numerically investigate
          both  the  gas accretion rates (m_acc) onto super massive black
          holes  (SMBHs)  and  the  star formation rates (m_sf) in ULIRGs
          formed  by  gas-rich  galaxy  mergers  and thereby discuss what
          powers  ULIRGs.  Our  principal  results,  which  can be tested
          against observations, are as follows. (1) ULIRGs powered by AGN
          can  be formed by major merging between luminous, gas-rich disk
          galaxies  with  prominent bulges containing SMBHs, owing to the
          efficient  gas  fuelling m_acc > 1 M_sun/yr of the SMBH. AGN in
          these ULIRGs can be surrounded by compact poststarburst stellar
          populations   (e.g.,  A-type  stars).  (2)  ULIRGs  powered  by
          starbursts  with  m_sf  ~ 100 M_sun/yr can be formed by merging
          between  gas-rich  disk  galaxies  with small bulges having the
          bulge-to-disk-ratio  (f_b)  as  small  as 0.1. (3) The relative
          importance  of  starbursts  and  AGN  can  depend  on  physical
          properties  of  merger  progenitor disks, such as f_b, gas mass
          fraction,  and  total  masses. For example, more massive galaxy
          mergers are more likely to become AGN-dominated ULIRGs. (4) For
          most models, major mergers can become ULIRGs, powered either by
          starbursts  or  by AGN, only when the two bulges finally merge.
          Interacting disk galaxies can become ULIRGs with well separated
          two  cores  (>  20kpc)  at  their pericenter when they are very
          massive  and  have small bulges. (5) Irrespective of the choice
          of   model,   interacting/merging  galaxies  show  the  highest
          accretion rates onto the central SMBHs, and the resultant rapid
          growth  of  the SMBHs occur when their star formation rates are
          very high.

          Title: Interferometric Mapping of Magnetic fields: NGC2071IR
          Authors: P.C. Cortes, R.M. Crutcher, B.C. Matthews
          Comments: 17 pages, 4 Figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  present  polarization  maps  of NGC2071IR from thermal dust
          emission  at  1.3 mm and from CO J=$2 \to 1$ line emission. The
          observations were obtained using the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland
          Association array in the period 2002-2004. We detected dust and
          line   polarized  emission  from  NGC2071IR  that  we  used  to
          constrain  the  morphology  of the magnetic field. From CO J=$2
          \to  1$  polarized  emission  we  found evidence for a magnetic
          field  in  the powerful bipolar outflow present in this region.
          We  calculated  a visual extinction $A_{\rm{v}} \approx 26$ mag
          from  our  dust  observations.  This result, when compared with
          early  single  dish  work,  seems to show that dust grains emit
          polarized   radiation  efficiently  at  higher  densities  than
          previously  thought.  Mechanical  alignment  by  the outflow is
          proposed  to  explain  the  polarization  pattern  observed  in
          NGC2071IR,  which is consistent with the observed flattening in
          this source.

          Aims. We present a detailed study of the infrared line emission
          (1-200  micron)  in  the  Herbig-Haro object HH54. Our database
          comprises:   high-   (R~9000)   and   low-  (R~600)  resolution
          spectroscopic  data  in  the near-infrared band (1-2.5 micron);
          mid-infrared  spectrophotometric  images  (5-12  micron);  and,
          far-IR  (45-200  micron,  R~200)  spectra acquired with the ISO
          satellite.  As  a  result,  we provide the detection of and the
          absolute  fluxes  for  more  than 60 molecular features (mainly
          from  H2  in the near- and mid-infrared and from H2O, CO and OH
          in the far-infrared) and 23 ionic lines. Methods. The H2 lines,
          coming from levels from v=0 to v=4 have been interpreted in the
          context  of  a state-of-art shock code, whose output parameters
          are  adopted  as input to a Large Velocity Gradient computation
          in  order  to  interpret  the  FIR  emission of CO, H2O and OH.
          Results.  The  H2 emission can be interpreted as originating in
          either  steady-state  J-type  shocks  or in quasi-steady J-type
          shocks  with  magnetic  precursor.  However,  our multi-species
          analysis  shows  that  only  a  model  of  a  J-type shock with
          magnetic  precursor  (v_shock=18  km/s,  n_H=10^4  cm^-3, B=100
          microG,  age=400  yr)  can  account  for  both  the observed H2
          emission  and the CO and H2O lines. Such a model predicts a H2O
          abundance  of  ~  7  10^-5,  in agreement with estimations from
          other  shock  models  for  outflows  associated  with  low mass
          protostars.  We  can  exclude the possibility that the observed
          atomic  lines  arise  in the same shock as the molecular lines,
          and  give  arguments  in  favour  of  the presence of a further
          high-velocity,   fully  dissociative  shock  component  in  the
          region.  Finally,  in  view  of  the  forthcoming spectroscopic
          facilities  on  board  of  the  Herschel  satellite, we provide
          predictions  for  H2O  lines considered to be the most suitable
          for diagnostic purposes.

          Title: On the angular momentum evolution of merged white dwarfs
          Authors: K.N. Gourgouliatos, C.S. Jeffery
          Comments: 11 pages, 11 figures, MNRAS in press
          We  study the angular momentum evolution of binaries containing
          two  white  dwarfs  which  merge  and  become  cool helium-rich
          supergiants.  Our  object  is  to  compare  predicted  rotation
          velocities  with  observations of highly evolved stars believed
          to  have  formed from such a merger, including RCrB and extreme
          helium  stars. The principal study involves a binary containing
          a  0.6 solar mass CO white dwarf, and a 0.3 solar mass He white
          dwarf.   The   initial   condition  for  the  angular  momentum
          distribution  is  defined  where  the secondary fills its Roche
          Lobe. We assume conservation of angular momentum to compute the
          angular  momentum  distribution  in  a  collisionless  disk and
          subsequently  in the giant envelope. At the end of shell-helium
          burning,  the  giant contracts to form a white dwarf. We derive
          the  surface  rotation  velocity  during  this contraction. The
          calculation is repeated for a range of initial mass ratios, and
          also  for  the case of mergers between two helium white dwarfs;
          the  latter  will  contract  to the helium main-sequence rather
          than  the  white dwarf sequence. Assuming complete conservation
          of  angular  momentum,  we  predict acceptable angular rotation
          rates  for  cool  giants  and  during  the  initial  subsequent
          contraction.  However  such  stars will only survive spin-up to
          reach  the  white  dwarf sequence (CO+He merger) if the initial
          mass  ratio  is close to unity. He+He merger products must lose
          angular  momentum  in  order to reach the helium main sequence.
          Minimum  observed  rotation  velocities in extreme helium stars
          are lower than our predictions by at least one half, indicating
          that CO+He mergers must lose at least one half of their angular
          momentum.

          Title:  Trapping  of  magnetic  flux  by the plunge region of a
          black hole accretion disk

          Garofalo  (Univ.  of  Maryland), Mitchell C. Begelman (Univ. of

          Comments:  18 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal. See this http URL for animations
          The  existence  of  the radius of marginal stability means that
          accretion   flows  around  black  holes  invariably  undergo  a
          transition  from  a  MHD  turbulent disk-like flow to an inward
          plunging  flow.  We  argue that the plunging inflow can greatly
          enhance the trapping of large scale magnetic field on the black
          hole,   and  therefore  may  increase  the  importance  of  the
          Blandford-Znajek  (BZ)  effect  relative  to previous estimates
          that  ignore  the  plunge region. We support this hypothesis by
          constructing  and  analyzing  a  toy-model  of the dragging and
          trapping of a large scale field by a black hole disk, revealing
          a  strong  dependence  of this effect on the effective magnetic
          Prandtl  number of the MHD turbulent disk. Furthermore, we show
          that  the enhancement of the BZ effect depends on the geometric
          thickness of the accretion disk. This may be, at least in part,
          the  physical  underpinnings  of the empirical relation between
          the  inferred  geometric thickness of a black hole disk and the
          presence of a radio jet.

          interpreted.  We  separate the contributions from the secondary
          star  and  from  other  sources  with  the aim of determining a
          photometric  distance.  Simple model calculations show that the
          accretion  stream  and  the  cyclotron  source on the accreting
          white  dwarf  are  minor  contributors  to  the infrared light,
          allowing   an  accurate  determination  of  spectral  type  and
          absolute flux of the secondary star. The unilluminated backside
          of  the secondary star as seen in eclipse has spectral type dM0
          to dM0+. Its dereddened magnitude is K = 13.58 at orbital phase
          phi  =  0 (eclipse). Using the calibrated surface brightness of
          M-stars  and  the  published  mass  of the secondary, M2 = 0.46
          Msun,  we  obtain  a distance d = 600 +/- 25 pc which scales as
          M2^(1/2).  The  radius  of  the  Roche-lobe  filling  secondary
          exceeds  the main-sequence radius of an M0 star by 21 +11/-6 %.
          The  debated origin of the infrared light of V1309 Ori has been
          settled  in favor of the secondary star as the main contributor
          and  an  accurate  distance  has  been  derived that will place
          estimates of the luminosity and synchronization time scale on a
          more secure basis.

          We  report  on observations of circumstellar disks around young
          stars  that  have been obtained with the MIDI instrument, which
          is  mounted  on  the  VLT Interferometer and operates in the 10
          micrometer  atmospheric  window. The maximum spatial resolution
          of  5 milli-arcsec corresponds to sub-AU scales at the distance
          to  nearby star formation regions. Thus, we can study the disks
          on  the spatial scales at which important processes occur, such
          as  accretion,  dust processing, and planet formation. The main
          results  obtained  so  far can be summarized as follows: 1. The
          measured  interferometric  visibilities are in good qualitative
          agreement  with  those  predicted  by  models  of circumstellar
          disks.  In  particular,  a  predicted  correlation  between the
          strength  of  the far-infrared excess and the spatial structure
          of  the disk is confirmed by direct measurements; 2. In several
          objects  strong  evidence for deviations from circular symmetry
          is  present,  indicating  that  an  inclined disk is indeed the
          dominant  component  seen  in  the  mid-infrared;  3.  The dust
          properties  are  not  uniform  over the disk, but are instead a
          strong  function  of  distance to the central star. The dust in
          the innermost disk regions is observed to be more ``processed''
          than  the dust further out, both in Herbig Ae star disks and in
          those around T-Tauri stars.

          Title:  First  broad  band  study  of  the mysterious source 1E
          1743.1-2843

          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          In  the  last  years,  the persistent source 1E 1743.1-2843 has
          been  observed  in  the  X-rays,  but  never  above  20 keV. In
          previous  works,  it  was  stressed that a possible high energy
          emission could give further indications on the accreting object
          nature  which  remains still unknown. We present here more than
          two  years  of  1E 1743.1-2843 monitoring with INTEGRAL/IBIS as
          well  as  public XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray observations. The
          temporal  study  in  the 20-40 keV band shows a rather constant
          flux  on  few  months  time scale. Based on this result we have
          performed  the broad-band spectral analysis using EPIC/IBIS non
          simultaneous  data  and ACIS-I/IBIS data collected during 2004.
          In  ~2 Ms, we report a detection of 6 sigma in the energy range
          35-70  keV. The first broad-band study (2-70 keV) shows a steep
          slope  (~3)  and a black body temperature of 1.7 keV. Combining
          spectral   parameters   and  discussion  about  the  luminosity
          evaluations  for  different possible distances, our conclusions
          are  in favour of a LMXB system with a neutron star at distance
          higher  than the Galactic Centre, even though a firm conclusion
          can not be stated.

          Optical  time  series  photometry  of the short period magnetic
          white    dwarf    +    probable   brown   dwarf   binary   SDSS
          121209.31+013627.7  reveals pulse-like variability in all bands
          from i' to u', peaking at u'. These modulations are most likely
          due  to a self-eclipsing accretion hot spot on the white dwarf,
          rotating   into  view  every  88.43  minutes.  This  period  is
          commensurate  with  the  radial  velocity  period determined by
          Schmidt  et  al.  2005  of ~90 minutes, and consistent with the
          rotation  period  of  the  accretor  being  equal to the binary
          orbital period. We combine our observations with those recently
          published  by  Koen  and  Maxted  2006  to  provide an accurate
          ephemeris.  We also detect the system in X-rays with Swift, and
          estimate  the  accretion  rate  at  ~1x10^-13Msun  per year. We
          suggest  that  SDSS1212  is  most likely a magnetic cataclysmic
          variable in an extended state of very low accretion, similar to
          the  well-studied  Polar  EF  Eri.  Alternatively, the putative
          brown  dwarf  is not filling its Roche Lobe and the system is a
          detached  binary  in  which  the  white  dwarf  is  efficiently
          accreting  from the wind of the secondary. Six such post-common
          envelope,  ``pre-Polar''  systems - termed ``low accretion rate
          Polars  (LARPs)'' by Schwope et al. 2002 - have previously been
          identified  through optical cyclotron emission lines. Cyclotron
          emission  from  SDSS1212  has  recently  been  detected  in the
          near-IR  Debes  et  al.  2006 but, if detached, it would be the
          first  ``LARP''  with  a  probably sub-stellar secondary. It is
          unclear whether an L-dwarf wind is strong enough to provide the
          measured  accretion  rate.  We  suggest further observations to
          distinguish between the Roche Lobe over-flow and wind accretion
          scenarios.

          Analysis  of  the frequency and physical properties of galaxies
          with  star-formation and AGN activity in different environments
          in  the  local  universe  is  a  cornerstone  for understanding
          structure  formation  and galaxy evolution. We have built a new
          multiwavelength  catalog  for  galaxies  in a complete redshift
          survey   (the  15R  Survey),  gathering  information  on  their
          H-alpha,  R-band,  radio,  far-infrared, and X-ray emission, as
          well   as  their  radio  and  optical  morphologies,  and  have
          developed   a   classification   scheme  to  compare  different
          selection  methods  and  to  select accurately samples of radio
          emitting  galaxies  with  AGN  and star-forming activity. While
          alternative   classification  schemes  do  not  lead  to  major
          differences   for   star-forming   galaxies,   we   show   that
          spectroscopic  and  photometric  classifications of AGN lead to
          incomplete  samples.  In  particular,  a  large  population  of
          AGN-containing  galaxies  with  absorption-line spectra, and in
          many  cases  extended radio structures (jets, lobes), is missed
          in   the   standard   Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich  emission-line
          classification of active galaxies. This missed class of objects
          accounts   for  roughly  half  of  the  radio  AGN  population.
          Similarly,  for  X-ray selected AGN in our sample, we find that
          absorption-line   AGN   account   for   half   of  the  sample.
          Spectroscopically   unremarkable,  passive  galaxies  with  AGN
          activity  are  not an exception, but the norm, and we show that
          although   they   exist  in  all  environments,  these  systems
          preferentially reside in higher density regions. Because of the
          existence  of  this population, the fractional abundance of AGN
          increases   with   increasing  density,  in  contrast  to  some
          published results based on emission-line AGN extracted from the
          15R, Sloan and 2DF redshift surveys.

          Title: The Remarkable Stability of Probable Black Hole Low-Mass
          X-ray Binaries in Nearby Galaxies
          Authors: Jimmy A. Irwin
          Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          The  most  luminous X-ray sources in nearby elliptical galaxies
          are likely black hole low-mass X-ray binaries (BHLMXBs). In the
          Milky  Way,  such  systems  are  always transient, and with the
          exception  of  GRS1915+105 have burst durations on the order of
          weeks  or months. However, the low duty cycle of short-duration
          outburst  BHLMXBs makes it improbable that any one source would
          be  caught in an outburst during a single snapshot observation.
          Long-duration  outburst  BHLMXBs, although much rarer, would be
          detectable  in  a  series of snapshot observations separated by
          several years. Our analysis of multi-epoch Chandra observations
          of  the  giant elliptical galaxies NGC1399 and M87 separated by
          3.3  and 5.3 yr, respectively, finds that all 37 luminous (>8 x
          10^38  ergs/s)  X-ray  sources  that  were present in the first
          epoch  observations  were  still  in  outburst  in  all  of the
          following  observations.  Many  of these probable long-duration
          outburst   BHLMXBs  reside  within  globular  clusters  of  the
          galaxies.  Conversely,  no  definitive  short-duration outburst
          BHLMXBs  were  detected in any of the observations. This places
          an   upper  limit  on  the  ratio  of  short--to--long-duration
          outbursters that is slightly lower, but consistent with what is
          seen  in  the  Milky  Way.  The  fact that none of the luminous
          sources  turned  off between the first and last epochs places a
          95  per cent lower limit of 50 yr on the mean burst duration of
          the  long-duration  outburst  sources. The most likely scenario
          for  the  origin  of these sources is that they are long-period
          (>30  d)  black hole binaries with a red giant donor, much like
          GRS1915+105.  However,  unlike GRS1915+105, most of the sources
          show only modest variability from epoch to epoch.

          Title: Phases of Swift X-ray Afterglows
          Authors: A. Panaitescu
          Comments:  18 pages, shorter version will appear in proceedings
          of Swift-Venice meeting
          The   X-ray   afterglows   observed   by   Swift  exhibit  rich
          light-curves,  with  four  phases  of different decay rate. The
          temporal  and  spectral  properties  for a set of 47 bursts are
          used  to  identify  the mechanisms which can explain these four
          phases. The early, fast-decaying phase can be attributed to the
          same  mechanism  which  generated  the burst emission (internal
          shocks  in  a relativistic outflow), while the following phases
          of  slower  decay  can  be identified with synchrotron emission
          from  the  forward  shock sweeping the circumburst medium. Most
          likely,  the  phase  of  slowest  decay  is due to a continuous
          energy  injection  in  the  forward  shock.  That  the  optical
          power-law  decay  continues  unabated  after  the end of energy
          injection  requires  an ambient medium with a wind-like density
          structure  (n  propto  r^{-2})  and forward shock microphysical
          parameters that change with the shock's Lorentz factor. A later
          break   of  the  X-ray  light-curve  can  be  attributed  to  a
          collimated  outflow  whose  boundary  becomes  visible  to  the
          observer  (a  jet)  but  the  optical  and X-ray decays are not
          always consistent with the standard jet model expectations.

          Comments: Accepted by Astrophysical Journal Letters
          Following  the  recent outburst of the recurrent nova RS Oph on
          2006 Feb 12, we measured its near-infrared size using the IOTA,
          Keck,   and   PTI   Interferometers  at  multiple  epochs.  The
          characteristic  size  of ~3 milliarcseconds hardly changed over
          the first 60 days of the outburst, ruling out currently-popular
          models  whereby  the near-infrared emission arises from hot gas
          in  the  expanding  shock.  The  emission  was also found to be
          significantly  asymmetric, evidenced by non-zero closure phases
          detected  by  IOTA.  The  physical interpretation of these data
          depend strongly on the adopted distance to RS Oph. Our data can
          be  interpreted as the first direct detection of the underlying
          RS  Oph  binary,  lending  support  to  the recent ``reborn red
          giant''  models  of Hachisu & Kato. However, this result hinges
          on an RS Oph distance of ~< 540 pc, in strong disagreement with
          the  widely-adopted  distance  of  ~1.6  kpc.  At  the  farther
          distance,  our  observations  imply  instead the existence of a
          non-expanding,  dense  and ionized circumbinary gaseous disk or
          reservoir   responsible  for  the  bulk  of  the  near-infrared
          emission.  Longer-baseline  infrared interferometry is uniquely
          suited  to  distinguish  between these models and to ultimately
          determine  the distance, binary orbit, and component masses for
          RS  Oph,  one  of the closest-known (candidate) SNIa progenitor
          systems.

          Origins Deep Survey Fields

          Journal
          We  present  an Ultraviolet (UV) selected sample of 268 objects
          in  the  two  fields  of  the  Great Observatories Origins Deep
          Survey  (GOODS).  We  used the parallel observations taken with
          WFPC2  in  the  U--band  (F300W) which covered 88% of the GOODS
          fields  to  identify  sources  and  selected  only objects with
          GOODS/ACS counterparts. Spectroscopic redshifts for 95 of these
          sources  are  available  and  we  have used the multiwavelength
          GOODS  data  to  estimate photometric redshifts for the others.
          Most of the objects are between 0.2<z<0.8. We used the spectral
          types  obtained by the photometric redshift fitting to identify
          the  starburst  galaxies.  We  have  also  visually checked all
          objects  and looked for tidal effects and nearby companions. We
          find  that  (i) 45% of the UV-selected galaxies are starbursts,
          (ii) nearly 75% of the starbursts have tidal tails or show some
          peculiarity typical of interactions or mergers, (iii) ~50% have
          companions within an area of 5x5 arcsec. The UV-selected sample
          has an average rest-frame M_B=--19.9 +- 0.1. The bluest objects
          in  the  sample  (U-B < 0.2 and B-V < 0.1) are at 1.1<z<1.9 and
          have  peculiar  morphologies  that  resembles  either tadpoles,
          chains,  or  double-clump  galaxies. Starbursts with tadpole or
          clump morphology at z=0.8-1.3 have sizes comparable to LBGs and
          compact Ultraviolet-luminous galaxies (UVLGs).

          Title:  A  RIAF  Interpretation for the Past Higher Activity of
          the  Galactic  Center  Black  Hole and the 511 keV Annihilation
          Emission
          Authors: Tomonori Totani (Kyoto)
          Comments: 11 pages including 1 figure, submitted to PASJ
          There  are  several  lines  of  evidence that the super-massive
          black  hole at the Galactic center had higher activities in the
          past  than directly observed at present. Here I show that these
          lines  of  evidence  can  quantitatively  and  consistently  be
          explained  if the mean accretion rate during the past ~10^7 yrs
          has  been  ~10^{3-4} times higher than the current rate, by the
          picture  of  radiatively  inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and
          associated  outflow  that  has been successfully applied to Sgr
          A*.  I  argue  that  this  increased  rate and its duration are
          theoretically  reasonable  in  the Galactic center environment,
          while  the  accretion rate suddenly dropped about 300 years ago
          most  likely  because  of  the  shell  passage of the supernova
          remnant  Sgr  A  East. Then I show that a significant amount of
          positrons  should  have  been  created around the event horizon
          during   the   higher   activity   phase,   and  injected  into
          interstellar  medium  by  the  outflow.  The predicted positron
          production  rate  and  propagation  distance are close to those
          required  to  explain  the  observed  511 keV annihilation line
          emission  from the Galactic bulge, giving a natural explanation
          for the large bulge-to-disk ratio of the emission. The expected
          injection  energy  is  ~MeV,  which  is  also  favorable  as an
          explanation of the 511 keV line emission.

          Title:  Inhomogeneous surface distribution of chemical elements
          in  the  eclipsing  binary  AR  Aur:  A  new  challenge for our
          understanding of HgMn stars
          Authors: S. Hubrig, J.F. Gonzalez, I. Savanov, M. Schoeller, N.

          Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  present  the results of a high spectral resolution study of
          the eclipsing binary AR Aur. AR Aur is the only known eclipsing
          binary  with  a  HgMn  primary  star  exactly on the ZAMS and a
          secondary  star  still  contracting towards the ZAMS. We detect
          for  the first time in the spectra of the primary star that for
          many  elements the line profiles are variable over the rotation
          period.  The  strongest  profile  variations  are found for the
          elements  Pt, Hg, Sr, Y, Zr, He and Nd, while the line profiles
          of  O,  Na,  Mg,  Si, Ca, Ti, and Fe show only weak distortions
          over the rotation period. The slight variability of He and Y is
          also  confirmed  by  the  study  of  high resolution spectra of
          another  HgMn  star:  alpha And. A preliminary modelling of the
          inhomogeneous  distribution  has been carried out for Sr and Y.
          Our   analysis  shows  that  these  elements  are  very  likely
          concentrated  in a fractured ring along the rotational equator.
          It  may  be an essential clue for the explanation of the origin
          of  the  chemical  anomalies  in  HgMn  stars  (which  are very
          frequently found in binary and multiple systems) that one large
          fraction  of  the  ring  is missing exactly on the surface area
          which  is  permanently  facing the secondary, and another small
          one  on  the  almost opposite side. The results presented about
          the  inhomogeneous  distribution  of  various chemical elements
          over  the stellar surface of the primary suggest new directions
          for  investigations  to  solve  the  question  of the origin of
          abundance anomalies in B-type stars with HgMn peculiarity.

          Title:  The  energy  dependence  of burst oscillations from the
          accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338
          Authors: Anna L. Watts (MPA), Tod E. Strohmayer (NASA GSFC)
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS
          The  nature  of  the  asymmetry that gives rise to Type I X-ray
          burst  oscillations on accreting neutron stars remains a matter
          of   debate.  Of  particular  interest  is  whether  the  burst
          oscillation  mechanism differs between the bursting millisecond
          pulsars and the non-pulsing systems. One means to diagnose this
          is  to  study  the energy dependence of the burst oscillations:
          here  we  present  an  analysis  of oscillations from 28 bursts
          observed  during the 2003 outburst of the accreting millisecond
          pulsar  XTE J1814-338. We find that the fractional amplitude of
          the  burst  oscillations  falls with energy, in contrast to the
          behaviour found by Muno et al. (2003) in the burst oscillations
          from a set of non-pulsing systems. The drop with energy mirrors
          that  seen in the accretion-powered pulsations; in this respect
          XTE  J1814-338  behaves  like  the  other accreting millisecond
          pulsars.  The  burst  oscillations  show no evidence for either
          hard  or  soft  lags, in contrast to the persistent pulsations,
          which  show soft lags of up to 50 $\mu$s. The fall in amplitude
          with  energy  is  inconsistent  with  current  surface mode and
          simple  hot  spot  models  of  burst  oscillations.  We discuss
          improvements  to  the  models  and uncertainties in the physics
          that might resolve these issues.

          Authors:  Rowena K. Malbon (1), C.M. Baugh (1), C.S. Frenk (1),
          C.G.Lacey (1) ((1) ICC-Durham)
          Comments: 24 pages, 16 figures, MNRAS submitted
          We  incorporate  a  model  for  black hole growth during galaxy
          mergers  into  the semi-analytical galaxy formation model based
          on  Lambda-CDM  proposed by Baugh et al. (2005). Our black hole
          model  has  one  free  parameter,  which we set by matching the
          observed  zeropoint of the local correlation between black hole
          mass  and  bulge  luminosity.  We  present  predictions for the
          evolution with redshift of the relationships between black hole
          mass  and  bulge  properties.  Our  simulations  reproduce  the
          evolution  of  the  optical  luminosity function of quasars. We
          study the demographics of the black hole population and address
          the  issue  of how black holes acquire their mass. We find that
          the  direct  accretion  of  cold  gas  during  starbursts is an
          important  growth  mechanism  for lower mass black holes and at
          high   redshift.   On   the  other  hand,  the  re-assembly  of
          pre-existing  black  hole  mass  into  larger units via merging
          dominates  the  growth  of  more  massive  black  holes  at low
          redshift.   This   prediction   could   be   tested  by  future
          gravitational   wave   experiments.   As   redshift  decreases,
          progressively   less  massive  black  holes  have  the  highest
          fractional   growth  rates,  in  line  with  recent  claims  of
          "downsizing" in quasar activity.

          Title:  Astrophysical  implications  of  high  energy  neutrino
          limits I. Overall diffuse limits
          Authors:  Julia  K.  Becker, Wolfgang Rhode, Peter L. Biermann,
          Kirsten Muenich
          Comments:  submitted  to  Astroparticle  Physics;  16  pages, 6
          figures
          Recently,   improved  quasi-isotropic  limits  to  the  diffuse
          extragalactic   high   energy   neutrino  component  have  been
          presented  by  AMANDA (Hill et al., 2006). In this paper, these
          limits  will  be discussed with respect to the consequences for
          various  models  of  hadronic  acceleration.  Previous  results
          showed  that  top-down  scenarios  explaining a possible proton
          flux  above  the  Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) Cutoff could be
          excluded  since  these calculations result in an overproduction
          of  neutrinos  (Semikoz  and  Sigl,  2004).  Here,  we focus on
          neutrino  production  scenarios  in  different  types of Active
          Galactic  Nuclei  (AGN).  The  new  limits can exclude neutrino
          emission in correlation with X-ray emission from ROSAT detected
          AGN,  which  makes  the  Inverse Compton scenario for the X-ray
          emission  more favorable. The implications of the limits to the
          neutrino  flux  from  FR-II  galaxies  are discussed. It can be
          shown  that  current experimental limits to the quasi-isotropic
          neutrino  flux  give  constraints to the optical depth of FR-II
          galaxies.  Also,  the  special case of TeV blazars is examined.
          The  general  diffuse limit can be used to estimate the maximum
          contribution  of  photon-resolved  TeV  blazars  to  the  total
          diffuse  flux. It is shown that the observation of neutrinos is
          essential  to get an understanding of high energy emission from
          extragalactic  sources, since TeV photons only give a glance of
          the near Universe.

          Title:  High  Mass  Star Formation by Gravitational Collapse of
          Massive Cores
          Authors: Mark R. Krumholz (Princeton University)
          Comments:  25  pages, 10 figures, CUP conference format. Review
          to  be  published  in  the  proceedings  of  the 2006 STScI May
          Symposium  "Massive  Stars:  From Pop III and GRBs to the Milky
          Way".  Resolution  of  some figures degraded to fit within size
          restrictions
          The  current  generation  of  millimeter  interferometers  have
          revealed  a  population  of compact (r <~ 0.1 pc), massive (M ~
          100  Msun) gas cores that are the likely progenitors of massive
          stars.  I review models for the evolution of these objects from
          the  observed  massive  core  phase  through  collapse and into
          massive  star formation, with particular attention to the least
          well-understood  aspects  of  the problem: fragmentation during
          collapse,  interactions  of  newborn stars with the gas outside
          their  parent  core,  and  the  effects  of  radiation pressure
          feedback.   Through  a  combination  of  observation,  analytic
          argument,  and  numerical  simulation,  I  develop  a model for
          massive  star  formation  by  gravitational  collapse  in which
          massive  cores  collapse  to  produce  single  stars  or  (more
          commonly)  small-multiple  systems, and these stars do not gain
          significant mass from outside their parent core by accretion of
          either  gas  or  other  stars.  Collapse  is only very slightly
          inhibited  by feedback from the massive star, thanks to beaming
          of  the radiation by a combination of protostellar outflows and
          radiation-hydrodynamic  instabilities. Based on these findings,
          I  argue  that  many  of  the observed properties of young star
          clusters  can  be  understood  as  direct  translations  of the
          properties  of  their gas phase progenitors. Finally, I discuss
          unsolved  problems in the theory of massive star formation, and
          directions for future work on them.

          Comments:  Invited  contribution  to  the  proceedings  of  the
          Galactic Center Workshop 2006
          We  report  on  the  submillimeter properties of Sagittarius A*
          derived  from observations with the Submillimeter Array and its
          polarimeter.  We  find  that the spectrum of Sgr A* between 230
          and    690   GHz   is   slightly   decreasing   when   measured
          simultaneously,  indicating  a  transition  to  optically  thin
          emission around 300-400 GHz. We also present very sensitive and
          well  calibrated  measurements of the polarization of Sgr A* at
          230  and  345  GHz. With these data we are able to show for the
          first  time  that  the  polarization  of  Sgr A* varies on hour
          timescales,  as  has  been observed for the total intensity. On
          one  night  we find variability that may arise from a polarized
          "blob" orbiting the black hole. Finally, we use the ensemble of
          observations to determine the rotation measure. This represents
          the    first   statistically   significant   rotation   measure
          determination  and  the  only  one  made  without  resorting to
          comparing  position angles measured at separate epochs. We find
          a  rotation  measure  of  (-5.6+/-0.7)x10^5  rad/m^2,  with  no
          evidence  for  variability on inter-day timescales at the level
          of  the  measurement  error.  The stability constrains interday
          fluctuations  in  the  accretion rate to 8%. The mean intrinsic
          polarization  position  angle  is 167+/-7 degrees and we detect
          variations  of  31+18/-9  degrees. This separation of intrinsic
          polarization changes and possible rotation measure fluctuations
          is   now   possible  because  of  the  frequency  coverage  and
          sensitivity  of  our  data.  The  observable  rotation  measure
          restricts  the accretion rate to the range 2x10^{-7} Msun/yr to
          2x10^{-9}  Msun/yr, if the magnetic field is near equipartition
          and ordered.

          Title:  On the maximum amplitude and coherence of the kilohertz
          quasi-periodic oscillations in low-mass X-ray binaries

          Comments:  Accepted  for  publication  in  MNRAS. 16 pages + 10
          figures. Uses mn2e.cls
          I  study the behaviour of the maximum rms fractional amplitude,
          $r_{\rm  max}$ and the maximum coherence, $Q_{\rm max}$, of the
          kilohertz  quasi-periodic  oscillations  (kHz  QPOs) in a dozen
          low-mass  X-ray  binaries.  I  find  that:  (i) The maximum rms
          amplitudes  of  the lower and the upper kHz QPO, $r^{\ell}_{\rm
          max}$ and $r^{\rm u}_{\rm max}$, respectively, decrease more or
          less  exponentially  with  increasing luminosity of the source;
          (ii) the maximum coherence of the lower kHz QPO, $Q^{\ell}_{\rm
          max}$,  first  increases  and then decreases exponentially with
          luminosity, at a faster rate than both $r^{\ell}_{\rm max}$ and
          $r^{\rm u}_{\rm max}$; (iii) the maximum coherence of the upper
          kHz  QPO, $Q^{\rm u}_{\rm max}$, is more or less independent of
          luminosity;  and  (iv) $r_{\rm max}$ and $Q_{\rm max}$ show the
          opposite behaviour with hardness of the source, consistent with
          the  fact  that  there  is  a  general  anticorrelation between
          luminosity and spectral hardness in these sources. Both $r_{\rm
          max}$  and  $Q_{\rm max}$ in the sample of sources, and the rms
          amplitude  and  coherence of the kHz QPOs in individual sources
          show  a similar behaviour with hardness. This similarity argues
          against  the  interpretation that the drop of coherence and rms
          amplitude  of  the  lower  kHz  QPO  at high QPO frequencies in
          individual  sources  is  a  signature  of  the innermost stable
          circular  orbit  around  a  neutron  star.  I  discuss possible
          interpretations  of  these  results  in terms of the modulation
          mechanisms   that   may   be   responsible   for  the  observed
          variability.

          Title:  A  physical  model  for  active  galactic  nuclei  with
          double-peaked broad emission lines
          Authors: Xinwu Cao, Ting-Gui Wang
          Comments: 7 pages, accepted for publication in ApJ
          The  double-peaked  broad emission lines are usually thought to
          be  linked  to  accretion  disks,  however,  the  local viscous
          heating   in   the   line-emitting   disk  portion  is  usually
          insufficient   for   the   observed   double-peaked  broad-line
          luminosity  in  most sources. Our calculations show that only a
          small  fraction (< 2.3 per cent) of the radiation from the RIAF
          in   the   inner  region  of  the  disk  can  photo-ionize  the
          line-emitting  disk  portion,  because  the  solid angle of the
          outer disk portion subtended to the inner region of the RIAF is
          too  small.  We  propose  that  only those AGNs with sufficient
          matter  above  the  disk  (slowly  moving jets or outflows) can
          scatter  enough  photons radiated from the inner disk region to
          the  outer  line-emitting  disk  portion.  Our model predicts a
          power-law r-dependent line emissivity with an index ~2.5, which
          is consistent with \beta~2-3 required by the model fittings for
          double-peaked  line  profiles.  Using  a  sample  of radio-loud
          double-peaked  line  emitters,  we  show  that  the  outer disk
          regions can be efficiently illuminated by the photons scattered
          from   the   electron-positron  jets  with  \gamma_j<2.  It  is
          consistent with the fact that no double-peaked emission line is
          present  in  strong  radio  quasars with relativistic jets. For
          radio-quiet counterparts, slow outflows with Thomson scattering
          depth  ~0.2 can scatter sufficient photons to the line-emitting
          regions.  This  model  can  therefore  solve  the energy budget
          problem for double-peaked line emitters.

          Title: Merger of Compact Objects
          Authors: C.-H. Lee, G.E. Brown, E. Park
          Comments: 11 pages
          Bethe  and  Brown  (1998)  suggested  that mergers resulting in
          short-hard  gamma-ray  bursts would be mainly those of low-mass
          black-hole(LMBH),  neutron-star  (NS)  binaries,  with those of
          NS-NS  binaries  down  by an order of magnitude from these. The
          lower number of the latter resulted from the necessity that the
          two  giant  progenitors be within 4% of each other in ZAMS mass
          so  that  they  burned He at the same time. Otherwise the first
          born  pulsar would find itself in the red giant envelope of the
          companion  giant  as it evolved and accrete enough matter to go
          into a black hole (BH).
          Using  a flat distribution in mass (constant dn/dm), favored by
          Duquennoy  and  Mayer  (1991), we calculated a ratio of LMBH-NS
          and NS-NS systems to be about 5, in agreement with Pinsonneault
          and  Stanek  (2006).  These authors emphasize the importance of
          "twins",  which  we discuss. The two NS's in the twins would be
          close in mass and further increase the number of mergings.

          Authors: Yuexing Li, Zoltn Haiman, Mordecai-Mark Mac Low

          Recent     observations     by     \citet{Ferrarese2006}    and
          \citet{Wehner2006} reveal that a majority of galaxies contain a
          central  massive object (CMO), either a supermassive black hole
          (SMBH)  or  a compact stellar nucleus, regardless of the galaxy
          mass  or morphological type, and that there is a tight relation
          between  the  masses  of  CMOs  and those of the host galaxies,
          $\mcmogal$.  Several  recent  studies  show  that feedback from
          black  holes can successfully explain the $\msigma$ correlation
          in  massive  elliptical  galaxies  that contain SMBHs. However,
          puzzles remain in spirals or dwarf spheroids that do not appear
          to  have  black  holes  but  instead  harbor  a compact central
          stellar   cluster.  Here  we  use  three-dimensional,  smoothed
          particle  hydrodynamics  simulations  of  isolated  galaxies to
          study  the  formation  and  evolution of CMOs in bulgeless disk
          galaxies,  and  simulations  of  merging  galaxies to study the
          transition  of  the  CMO--host  mass  relation  from  late-type
          bulgeless   spirals  to  early-type  ellipticals.  Our  results
          suggest  that  the  observed  correlations  may  be established
          primarily  by  the  depletion  of  gas in the central region by
          accretion  and  star-formation,  and  may  hold  for all galaxy
          types.  A systematic search for CMOs in the nuclei of bulgeless
          disk galaxies would offer a test of this conclusion. (Abridged)

          Title: The Discovery of a Neutron Star with a Spin Frequency of
          530 Hz in A1744-361

          We  report  the  detection with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
          (RXTE)  Proportional  Counter  Array  (PCA)  of  530  Hz  burst
          oscillations  in  a  thermonuclear  (type  I)  burst  from  the
          transient X-ray source A1744-361. This is only the second burst
          ever observed from this source, and the first to be seen in any
          detail.  Our results confirm that A1744-361 is a low mass X-ray
          binary (LMXB) system harboring a rapidly rotating neutron star.
          The  oscillations  are  first detected along the rising edge of
          the  burst, and they show evidence for frequency evolution of a
          magnitude  similar  to  that  seen  in other burst sources. The
          modulation  amplitude  and  its increase with photon energy are
          also  typical  of  burst  oscillations.  The lack of any strong
          indication  of  photospheric  radius expansion during the burst
          suggests  a  9  kpc upper limit of the source distance. We also
          find  energy  dependent  dips, establishing A1744-361 as a high
          inclination,  dipping  LMXB.  The  timescale  between  the  two
          episodes  of  observed  dips suggests an orbital period of ~ 97
          minutes.    We    have    also    detected   a   2   -   4   Hz
          quasi-periodic-oscillation  (QPO)  for the first time from this
          source.  This QPO appears consistent with ~ 1 Hz QPOs seen from
          other high-inclination systems. We searched for kilohertz QPOs,
          and  found  a  suggestive  2.3  sigma  feature at 800 Hz in one
          observation.  The  frequency,  strength, and quality factor are
          consistent  with  that  of a lower frequency kilohertz QPO, but
          the  relatively  low  significance  argues  for  caution, so we
          consider this a tentative detection requiring confirmation.

          Accurate   photometric  redshifts  are  calculated  for  nearly
          200,000  galaxies  to a 4.5 micron flux limit of ~13 uJy in the
          8.5   deg^2   Spitzer/IRAC   Shallow  survey.  Using  a  hybrid
          photometric  redshift  algorithm  incorporating both neural-net
          and  template-fitting  techniques,  calibrated with over 15,000
          spectroscopic  redshifts,  a  redshift  accuracy  of  \sigma  =
          0.06(1+z)  is  achieved  for  95%  of  galaxies at 0<z<1.5. The
          accuracy  is  \sigma  =  0.12(1+z)  for  95%  of  AGN at 0<z<3.
          Redshift  probability  functions,  central  to  several ongoing
          studies  of  the  galaxy  population, are computed for the full
          sample.   We   demonstrate   that  these  functions  accurately
          represent  the  true redshift probability density, allowing the
          calculation  of  valid  confidence  intervals  for all objects.
          These   probability   functions   have  already  been  used  to
          successfully  identify  a  population  of Spitzer-selected high
          redshift   (z>1)   galaxy   clusters.   We   present  one  such
          spectroscopically   confirmed   cluster   at   <z>=1.24,   ISCS
          J1434.5+3427.  Finally,  we  present  a  measurement of the 4.5
          micron-selected galaxy redshift distribution.

          Title:   Critical   properties   and  stability  of  stationary
          solutions in multi-transonic pseudo-Schwarzschild accretion
          Authors: Soumini Chaudhury, Arnab K. Ray, Tapas Kumar Das
          Comments: 12 pages, one colour and 3 black and white figures
          For  inviscid,  rotational accretion flows, both isothermal and
          polytropic, a simple dynamical systems analysis of the critical
          points  has  given  a  very  accurate  mathematical  scheme  to
          understand   the   nature   of  these  points,  for  {\em  any}
          pseudo-potential  by  which  the  flow  may  be  driven on to a
          Schwarzschild   black   hole.   This   allows  for  a  complete
          classification  of the critical points for a wide range of flow
          parameters,  and  shows  that the only possible critical points
          for this kind of flow are saddle points and centre-type points.
          A  restrictive  upper bound on the angular momentum of critical
          solutions  has  been established. A time-dependent perturbative
          study  reveals  that the form of the perturbation equation, for
          both  isothermal  and  polytropic flows, is invariant under the
          choice  of  any  particular pseudo-potential. Under generically
          true  outer  boundary  conditions,  the  inviscid flow has been
          shown  to be stable under an adiabatic and radially propagating
          perturbtion. The perturbation equation has also served the dual
          purpose  of  enabling an understanding of the acoustic geometry
          for inviscid and rotational flows.

          Title:  Ejection  of  Hyper-Velocity  Stars  from  the Galactic
          Centre by Intermediate-Mass Black Holes
          Authors:  Holger Baumgardt, Alessia Gualandris, Simon Portegies
          Zwart
          Comments: 10 pages, 10 figures, MNRAS in press
          We  have  performed  N-body  simulations  of  the  formation of
          hyper-velocity  stars  (HVS) in the centre of the Milky Way due
          to  inspiralling  intermediate-mass  black  holes  (IMBHs).  We
          considered   IMBHs  of  different  masses,  all  starting  from
          circular orbits at an initial distance of 0.1 pc.
          We  find that the IMBHs sink to the centre of the Galaxy due to
          dynamical  friction,  where  they  deplete  the central cusp of
          stars.  Some  of  these  stars  become HVS and are ejected with
          velocities  sufficiently  high  to escape the Galaxy. Since the
          HVS   carry  with  them  information  about  their  origin,  in
          particular in the moment of ejection, the velocity distribution
          and  the direction in which they escape the Galaxy, detecting a
          population   of  HVS  will  provide  insight  in  the  ejection
          processes and could therefore provide indirect evidence for the
          existence of IMBHs.
          Our  simulations  show  that  HVS are generated in short bursts
          which  last  only a few Myrs until the IMBH is swallowed by the
          supermassive   black   hole  (SMBH).  HVS  are  ejected  almost
          isotropically,  which  makes  IMBH  induced  ejections  hard to
          distinguish   from  ejections  due  to  encounters  of  stellar
          binaries  with  a SMBH. After the HVS have reached the galactic
          halo,  their escape velocities correlate with the distance from
          the  Galactic  centre  in the sense that the fastest HVS can be
          found  furthest away from the centre. The velocity distribution
          of   HVS   generated  by  inspiralling  IMBHs  is  also  nearly
          independent  of  the mass of the IMBH and can be quite distinct
          from one generated by binary encounters.
          Finally,  our  simulations show that the presence of an IMBH in
          the  Galactic  centre  changes the stellar density distribution
          inside  r<0.02 pc into a core profile, which takes at least 100
          Myrs to replenish.

          Title:  The  formation  of higher-order hierarchical systems in
          star clusters
          Authors: Jelle van den Berk (UVA), Simon Portegies Zwart (UVA),
          Steve McMillan (Drexel)
          Comments: submitted to MNRAS
          We  simulate open clusters containing up to 182 stars initially
          in  the  form of singles, binaries and triples. Due to the high
          interaction   rate   a   large  number  of  stable  quadruples,
          quintuples, sextuples, and higher-order hierarchies form during
          the  course  of  the  simulations.  For  our  choice of initial
          conditions, the formation rate of quadruple systems after about
          2Myr  is  roughly constant with time at about 0.008 per cluster
          per  Myr.  The formation rate of quintuple and sextuple systems
          are  about half and one quarter, respectively, of the quadruple
          formation  rate, and both rates are also approximately constant
          with   time.   We   present   reaction  channels  and  relative
          probabilities   for   the   formation   of  persistent  systems
          containing  up  to  six  stars.  The  reaction networks for the
          formation and destruction of quintuple and sextuple systems can
          become  quite complicated, although the branching ratios remain
          largely  unchanged  during the course of the cluster evolution.
          The  total  numbers  of  quadruples  is about a factor of three
          smaller than observed in the solar neighborhood.

          Title:  Star  Cluster Ecology: VII The evolution of young dense
          star clusters containing primordial binaries
          Authors:  Simon Portegies Zwart (UVA), Steve McMillan (Drexel),
          Jun Makino (Tokyo)
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS
          We  study  the  first  100Myr of the evolution of isolated star
          clusters  initially  containing  144179  stars, including 13107
          (10%)  primordial  hard  binaries. Our calculations include the
          effects  of  both  stellar  and binary evolution. Gravitational
          interactions  among  the  stars  are  computed by direct N-body
          integration   using   high   precision  GRAPE-6  hardware.  The
          evolution  of  the core radii and central concentrations of our
          simulated  clusters  are  compared  with the observed sample of
          young  (about  100Myr)  star  clusters  in the large Magellanic
          cloud. Even though our simulations start with a rich population
          of primordial binaries, core collapse during the early phase of
          the   cluster   evolution  is  not  prevented.  Throughout  the
          simulations,  the fraction of binaries remains roughly constant
          (about  10%).  Due  to the effects of mass segregation the mass
          function  of  intermediate-mass  main-sequence stars becomes as
          flat as $\alpha=-1.8$ in the central part of the cluster (where
          the  initial  Salpeter mass function had $\alpha=-2.35$). About
          6--12%  of  the neutron stars were retained in our simulations;
          the  fraction  of  retained  black  holes  is  40--70%. In each
          simulation  about  three  neutron stars become members of close
          binaries  with  a  main-sequence  companion. Such a binary will
          eventually  become an x-ray binary, when the main-sequence star
          starts  to  fill  its  Roche  lobe.  Black holes are found more
          frequently in binaries; in each simulated cluster we find about
          11  potential  x-ray binaries containing a black hole. Abstract

          Title: Broad H-alpha wings from the optically thin stellar wind
          of the hot components in symbiotic binaries

          (13/07/2006)
          Aims:  To  model  broad  H-alpha  wings  observed  in symbiotic
          binaries  by an optically thin, bipolar stellar wind from their
          hot  components as an alternative to that considering the Raman
          scattering  of  Ly-beta  photons  on  atomic hydrogen. Methods:
          Profile-fitting  analysis.  Comparison  of  the  observed broad
          H-alpha  wings and their luminosity with those predicted by the
          model.  Results: Synthetic H-alpha profiles fit excellently the
          observed  wings  for  |RV|  >  200  km/s  in  our  sample of 10
          symbiotic  stars during the quiescent as well as active phases.
          The wing profile formed in the stellar wind can be approximated
          by  a  function  f(RV) proportional to RVexp-2, which is of the
          same  type as that arising from the Raman scattering. Therefore
          it  is  not possible to distinguish between these two processes
          only   by   modeling   the  line  profile.  Some  observational
          characteristics  of  the  H-alpha  emission suggest the ionized
          stellar  wind  from the hot component to be the dominant source
          contributing  to  the  H-alpha  wings during active phases. The
          model corresponding mass-loss rates from the hot components are
          of  a  few  x  10exp(-8)  M(Sun)/yr and of a few x (10exp(-7) -
          10exp(-6))   M(Sun)/yr  during  quiescent  and  active  phases,
          respectively.

          Detection of Binary Massive Black Holes

          Comments:  9 pages; a large mpeg animation is available at this
          http URL
          We present a two-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamic simulation
          of a thin, viscous, locally-isothermal corotating disk orbiting
          an  equal-mass  Newtonian binary point mass on a fixed circular
          orbit.  We  study  the  structure  of  the  disk after multiple
          viscous  times.  The  binary  maintains  a  central hole in the
          viscously-relaxed  disk  with  radius  equal to about twice the
          binary  semimajor axis. Disk surface density within the hole is
          reduced  by  orders of magnitude relative to the density in the
          disk  bulk.  The  inner  truncation  of  the disk resembles the
          clearing  of  a  gap  in  a  protoplanetary  disk. An initially
          circular   disk   becomes   elliptical   and   then  eccentric.
          Disturbances in the disk contain a component that is stationary
          in  the  rotating  frame  in  which the binary is at rest; this
          component  is  a  two-armed spiral density wave. We measure the
          distribution of the binary torque in the disk and find that the
          strongest   positive  torque  is  exerted  inside  the  central
          low-density  hole.  We  offer a tentative interpretation of the
          binary-disk  torque  coupling  in  the simulation in terms of a
          mean-motion  resonance  experienced by the low-density fluid in
          the  central  hole  in  the  disk.  The  fluid  inside the hole
          mediates  the  binary-disk  torque.  We  also  measure the time
          dependence  of  the  rate at which gas accretes across the hole
          and  find  quasiperiodic structure. We discuss implications for
          variability  and detection of active galactic nuclei containing
          a binary massive black hole.

          We  present results from our Very Large Telescope large program
          to   study  the  dynamical  evolution  of  local  Ultraluminous
          Infrared  Galaxies  (ULIRGs) and QSOs. This paper is the second
          in  a  series  presenting  the stellar kinematics of 54 ULIRGs,
          derived   from   high   resolution,  long-slit  H-  and  K-band
          spectroscopy.  The  data presented here, including observations
          of  17  new  targets,  are  mainly focused on sources that have
          coalesced  into  a  single  nucleus.  The  stellar  kinematics,
          extracted  from the CO ro-vibrational bandheads in our spectra,
          indicate  that  ULIRG  remnants  are dynamically heated systems
          with  a  mean  dispersion  of  161  km/s.  The  combination  of
          kinematic,   structural,  and  photometric  properties  of  the
          remnants indicate that they mostly originate from major mergers
          and  that  they result in the formation of systems supported by
          random motions, therefore, elliptical galaxies. The peak of the
          velocity dispersion distribution and the locus of ULIRGs on the
          fundamental  plane of early-type galaxies indicate that the end
          products  of  ultraluminous mergers are typically moderate-mass
          ellipticals  (of stellar mass ~10^10 - 10^11 M_sun). Converting
          the  host  dispersion  into black hole mass with the aid of the
          M_BH-sigma  relation  yields  black  hole mass estimates of the
          order 10^7 - 10^8 M_sun and high accretion rates with Eddington
          efficiencies often >0.5.

          in the INTEGRAL/IBIS survey

          publication in MNRAS
          Analysis of INTEGRAL/IBIS survey observations has revealed that
          the  rare intermediate polar and asynchronous polar cataclysmic
          variables  are  consistently  found  to  emit in the 20-100 keV
          energy   band,   whereas  synchronous  polars  and  the  common
          non-magnetic  CVs  rarely  do  so.  From  the  correlation of a
          candidate INTEGRAL/IBIS survey source list with a CV catalogue,
          15  CV detections by IBIS have been established including a new
          INTEGRAL  source  IGR  J06253+7334.  The  properties  of  these
          sources  and  4  additional  CV candidates are discussed in the
          context  of  their  20-100  keV emission characteristics and we
          conclude  that the INTEGRAL mission is an important tool in the
          detection  of new magnetic CV systems. Furthermore, analysis of
          the  time-averaged spectra of CVs detected by INTEGRAL indicate
          that  although  there is little difference between the spectral
          slopes  of  the different sub-types, intermediate polars may be
          considerably  more  luminous  than polars in the soft gamma-ray
          regime. We also present the detection of an unusual high-energy
          burst  from  V1223  Sgr  discovered  by  inspection of the IBIS
          light-curve.  Additionally,  we  have  compared  the  IBIS  and
          optical AAVSO light-curves of SS Cyg and extracted IBIS spectra
          during  single  periods  of optical outburst and quiescence. We
          find  that the 20-100 keV flux is an order of magnitude greater
          during  optical  quiescence. This is in agreement with previous
          studies  which  show that the hard X-ray component of SS Cyg is
          suppressed during high accretion states

          We  analyze  Rossi  X-ray  Timing  Explorer (RXTE) Proportional
          Counter Array (PCA) data of the transient low mass X-ray binary
          (LMXB)  system  1A 1744-361. We explore the X-ray intensity and
          spectral  evolution of the source, perform timing analysis, and
          find  that  1A  1744-361  shows  `atoll'  behavior  during  the
          outbursts. The color-color diagram indicates that this LMXB was
          observed  in  a  low intensity spectrally hard (low-hard) state
          and  in  a  high  intensity  `banana' state. The low-hard state
          shows  a horizontal pattern in the color-color diagram, and the
          previously  reported  `dipper  QPO'  appears  only  during this
          state. We also perform energy spectral analyses, and report the
          first detection of broad iron emission line and iron absorption

          Comments: 13 pages, 25 figures, accepted in MNRAS
          We  present  multi-frequency  radio  continuum  as  well  as HI
          observations  of  the  composite  galaxy  NGC6764,  which has a
          young,  circumnuclear  starburst  and  also  harbours an active
          galactic  nucleus (AGN). These observations have been made at a
          number  of  frequencies  ranging  from ~600 MHz to 15 GHz using
          both  the  GMRT  and  the VLA. They reveal the structure of the
          bipolar  bubbles of non-thermal, radio emission which are along
          the  minor axis of the galaxy and extend up to ~1.1 and 1.5 kpc
          on  the  northern  and southern sides respectively. Features in
          the  radio  bubbles appear to overlap with filaments of H_alpha
          emission.  The  high-resolution  observations  reveal a compact
          source, likely to be associated with the nucleus of the galaxy,
          and  a  possible  radio  jet  towards  the  south-west. We have
          compiled  a  representative  sample of galaxies with bubbles of
          non-thermal  radio  emission  and  find that these are found in
          galaxies with an AGN.
          The HI observations with the GMRT show two peaks of emission on
          both ends of the stellar-bar and depletion of HI in the central
          region  of  the galaxy. We also detect HI in absorption against
          the  central radio peak at the systemic velocity of the galaxy.
          The  HI-absorption  spectrum  also  suggests  a  possible  weak
          absorption  feature  blue-shifted  by ~120 km/s, which requires
          confirmation.  A  similar  feature  has also been reported from
          observations   of   CO   in   emission,   suggesting  that  the
          circumnuclear   starburst   and  nuclear  activity  affect  the
          kinematics  of  the  atomic  and  molecular  gas components, in
          addition to the ionised gas seen in H_alpha and [N II].

          solutions in multi-transonic pseudo-Schwarzschild accretion
          Authors: Soumini Chaudhury, Arnab K. Ray, Tapas Kumar Das
          Comments: 12 pages, one colour and 3 black and white figures
          For  inviscid,  rotational accretion flows, both isothermal and
          polytropic, a simple dynamical systems analysis of the critical
          points  has  given  a  very  accurate  mathematical  scheme  to
          understand   the   nature   of  these  points,  for  {\em  any}
          pseudo-potential  by  which  the  flow  may  be  driven on to a
          Schwarzschild   black   hole.   This   allows  for  a  complete
          classification  of the critical points for a wide range of flow
          parameters,  and  shows  that the only possible critical points
          for this kind of flow are saddle points and centre-type points.
          A  restrictive  upper bound on the angular momentum of critical
          solutions  has  been established. A time-dependent perturbative
          study  reveals  that the form of the perturbation equation, for
          both  isothermal  and  polytropic flows, is invariant under the
          choice  of  any  particular pseudo-potential. Under generically
          true  outer  boundary  conditions,  the  inviscid flow has been
          shown  to be stable under an adiabatic and radially propagating
          perturbtion. The perturbation equation has also served the dual
          purpose  of  enabling an understanding of the acoustic geometry
          for inviscid and rotational flows.

          Title:  Ejection  of  Hyper-Velocity  Stars  from  the Galactic
          Centre by Intermediate-Mass Black Holes
          Authors:  Holger Baumgardt, Alessia Gualandris, Simon Portegies
          Zwart
          Comments: 10 pages, 10 figures, MNRAS in press
          We  have  performed  N-body  simulations  of  the  formation of
          hyper-velocity  stars  (HVS) in the centre of the Milky Way due
          to  inspiralling  intermediate-mass  black  holes  (IMBHs).  We
          considered   IMBHs  of  different  masses,  all  starting  from
          circular orbits at an initial distance of 0.1 pc.
          We  find that the IMBHs sink to the centre of the Galaxy due to
          dynamical  friction,  where  they  deplete  the central cusp of
          stars.  Some  of  these  stars  become HVS and are ejected with
          velocities  sufficiently  high  to escape the Galaxy. Since the
          HVS   carry  with  them  information  about  their  origin,  in
          particular in the moment of ejection, the velocity distribution
          and  the direction in which they escape the Galaxy, detecting a
          population   of  HVS  will  provide  insight  in  the  ejection
          processes and could therefore provide indirect evidence for the
          existence of IMBHs.
          Our  simulations  show  that  HVS are generated in short bursts
          which  last  only a few Myrs until the IMBH is swallowed by the
          supermassive   black   hole  (SMBH).  HVS  are  ejected  almost
          isotropically,  which  makes  IMBH  induced  ejections  hard to
          distinguish   from  ejections  due  to  encounters  of  stellar
          binaries  with  a SMBH. After the HVS have reached the galactic
          halo,  their escape velocities correlate with the distance from
          the  Galactic  centre  in the sense that the fastest HVS can be
          found  furthest away from the centre. The velocity distribution
          of   HVS   generated  by  inspiralling  IMBHs  is  also  nearly
          independent  of  the mass of the IMBH and can be quite distinct
          from one generated by binary encounters.
          Finally,  our  simulations show that the presence of an IMBH in
          the  Galactic  centre  changes the stellar density distribution
          inside  r<0.02 pc into a core profile, which takes at least 100
          Myrs to replenish.

          Authors: Jelle van den Berk (UVA), Simon Portegies Zwart (UVA),
          Steve McMillan (Drexel)
          Comments: submitted to MNRAS
          We  simulate open clusters containing up to 182 stars initially
          in  the  form of singles, binaries and triples. Due to the high
          interaction   rate   a   large  number  of  stable  quadruples,
          quintuples, sextuples, and higher-order hierarchies form during
          the  course  of  the  simulations.  For  our  choice of initial
          conditions, the formation rate of quadruple systems after about
          2Myr  is  roughly constant with time at about 0.008 per cluster
          per  Myr.  The formation rate of quintuple and sextuple systems
          are  about half and one quarter, respectively, of the quadruple
          formation  rate, and both rates are also approximately constant
          with   time.   We   present   reaction  channels  and  relative
          probabilities   for   the   formation   of  persistent  systems
          containing  up  to  six  stars.  The  reaction networks for the
          formation and destruction of quintuple and sextuple systems can
          become  quite complicated, although the branching ratios remain
          largely  unchanged  during the course of the cluster evolution.
          The  total  numbers  of  quadruples  is about a factor of three
          smaller than observed in the solar neighborhood.

          Title:  Star  Cluster Ecology: VII The evolution of young dense
          star clusters containing primordial binaries
          Authors:  Simon Portegies Zwart (UVA), Steve McMillan (Drexel),
          Jun Makino (Tokyo)
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS
          We  study  the  first  100Myr of the evolution of isolated star
          clusters  initially  containing  144179  stars, including 13107
          (10%)  primordial  hard  binaries. Our calculations include the
          effects  of  both  stellar  and binary evolution. Gravitational
          interactions  among  the  stars  are  computed by direct N-body
          integration   using   high   precision  GRAPE-6  hardware.  The
          evolution  of  the core radii and central concentrations of our
          simulated  clusters  are  compared  with the observed sample of
          young  (about  100Myr)  star  clusters  in the large Magellanic
          cloud. Even though our simulations start with a rich population
          of primordial binaries, core collapse during the early phase of
          the   cluster   evolution  is  not  prevented.  Throughout  the
          simulations,  the fraction of binaries remains roughly constant
          (about  10%).  Due  to the effects of mass segregation the mass
          function  of  intermediate-mass  main-sequence stars becomes as
          flat as $\alpha=-1.8$ in the central part of the cluster (where
          the  initial  Salpeter mass function had $\alpha=-2.35$). About
          6--12%  of  the neutron stars were retained in our simulations;
          the  fraction  of  retained  black  holes  is  40--70%. In each
          simulation  about  three  neutron stars become members of close
          binaries  with  a  main-sequence  companion. Such a binary will
          eventually  become an x-ray binary, when the main-sequence star
          starts  to  fill  its  Roche  lobe.  Black holes are found more
          frequently in binaries; in each simulated cluster we find about
          11  potential  x-ray binaries containing a black hole. Abstract

          Aims:  To  model  broad  H-alpha  wings  observed  in symbiotic
          binaries  by an optically thin, bipolar stellar wind from their
          hot  components as an alternative to that considering the Raman
          scattering  of  Ly-beta  photons  on  atomic hydrogen. Methods:
          Profile-fitting  analysis.  Comparison  of  the  observed broad
          H-alpha  wings and their luminosity with those predicted by the
          model.  Results: Synthetic H-alpha profiles fit excellently the
          observed  wings  for  |RV|  >  200  km/s  in  our  sample of 10
          symbiotic  stars during the quiescent as well as active phases.
          The wing profile formed in the stellar wind can be approximated
          by  a  function  f(RV) proportional to RVexp-2, which is of the
          same  type as that arising from the Raman scattering. Therefore
          it  is  not possible to distinguish between these two processes
          only   by   modeling   the  line  profile.  Some  observational
          characteristics  of  the  H-alpha  emission suggest the ionized
          stellar  wind  from the hot component to be the dominant source
          contributing  to  the  H-alpha  wings during active phases. The
          model corresponding mass-loss rates from the hot components are
          of  a  few  x  10exp(-8)  M(Sun)/yr and of a few x (10exp(-7) -
          10exp(-6))   M(Sun)/yr  during  quiescent  and  active  phases,
          respectively.

          http URL
          We present a two-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamic simulation
          of a thin, viscous, locally-isothermal corotating disk orbiting
          an  equal-mass  Newtonian binary point mass on a fixed circular
          orbit.  We  study  the  structure  of  the  disk after multiple
          viscous  times.  The  binary  maintains  a  central hole in the
          viscously-relaxed  disk  with  radius  equal to about twice the
          binary  semimajor axis. Disk surface density within the hole is
          reduced  by  orders of magnitude relative to the density in the
          disk  bulk.  The  inner  truncation  of  the disk resembles the
          clearing  of  a  gap  in  a  protoplanetary  disk. An initially
          circular   disk   becomes   elliptical   and   then  eccentric.
          Disturbances in the disk contain a component that is stationary
          in  the  rotating  frame  in  which the binary is at rest; this
          component  is  a  two-armed spiral density wave. We measure the
          distribution of the binary torque in the disk and find that the
          strongest   positive  torque  is  exerted  inside  the  central
          low-density  hole.  We  offer a tentative interpretation of the
          binary-disk  torque  coupling  in  the simulation in terms of a
          mean-motion  resonance  experienced by the low-density fluid in
          the  central  hole  in  the  disk.  The  fluid  inside the hole
          mediates  the  binary-disk  torque.  We  also  measure the time
          dependence  of  the  rate at which gas accretes across the hole
          and  find  quasiperiodic structure. We discuss implications for
          variability  and detection of active galactic nuclei containing
          a binary massive black hole.

          coalesced  into  a  single  nucleus.  The  stellar  kinematics,
          extracted  from the CO ro-vibrational bandheads in our spectra,
          indicate  that  ULIRG  remnants  are dynamically heated systems
          with  a  mean  dispersion  of  161  km/s.  The  combination  of
          kinematic,   structural,  and  photometric  properties  of  the
          remnants indicate that they mostly originate from major mergers
          and  that  they result in the formation of systems supported by
          random motions, therefore, elliptical galaxies. The peak of the
          velocity dispersion distribution and the locus of ULIRGs on the
          fundamental  plane of early-type galaxies indicate that the end
          products  of  ultraluminous mergers are typically moderate-mass
          ellipticals  (of stellar mass ~10^10 - 10^11 M_sun). Converting
          the  host  dispersion  into black hole mass with the aid of the
          M_BH-sigma  relation  yields  black  hole mass estimates of the
          order 10^7 - 10^8 M_sun and high accretion rates with Eddington
          efficiencies often >0.5.

          publication in MNRAS
          Analysis of INTEGRAL/IBIS survey observations has revealed that
          the  rare intermediate polar and asynchronous polar cataclysmic
          variables  are  consistently  found  to  emit in the 20-100 keV
          energy   band,   whereas  synchronous  polars  and  the  common
          non-magnetic  CVs  rarely  do  so.  From  the  correlation of a
          candidate INTEGRAL/IBIS survey source list with a CV catalogue,
          15  CV detections by IBIS have been established including a new
          INTEGRAL  source  IGR  J06253+7334.  The  properties  of  these
          sources  and  4  additional  CV candidates are discussed in the
          context  of  their  20-100  keV emission characteristics and we
          conclude  that the INTEGRAL mission is an important tool in the
          detection  of new magnetic CV systems. Furthermore, analysis of
          the  time-averaged spectra of CVs detected by INTEGRAL indicate
          that  although  there is little difference between the spectral
          slopes  of  the different sub-types, intermediate polars may be
          considerably  more  luminous  than polars in the soft gamma-ray
          regime. We also present the detection of an unusual high-energy
          burst  from  V1223  Sgr  discovered  by  inspection of the IBIS
          light-curve.  Additionally,  we  have  compared  the  IBIS  and
          optical AAVSO light-curves of SS Cyg and extracted IBIS spectra
          during  single  periods  of optical outburst and quiescence. We
          find  that the 20-100 keV flux is an order of magnitude greater
          during  optical  quiescence. This is in agreement with previous
          studies  which  show that the hard X-ray component of SS Cyg is
          suppressed during high accretion states

          We  analyze  Rossi  X-ray  Timing  Explorer (RXTE) Proportional
          Counter Array (PCA) data of the transient low mass X-ray binary
          (LMXB)  system  1A 1744-361. We explore the X-ray intensity and
          spectral  evolution of the source, perform timing analysis, and
          find  that  1A  1744-361  shows  `atoll'  behavior  during  the
          outbursts. The color-color diagram indicates that this LMXB was
          observed  in  a  low intensity spectrally hard (low-hard) state
          and  in  a  high  intensity  `banana' state. The low-hard state
          shows  a horizontal pattern in the color-color diagram, and the
          previously  reported  `dipper  QPO'  appears  only  during this
          state. We also perform energy spectral analyses, and report the
          first detection of broad iron emission line and iron absorption

          Comments: 13 pages, 25 figures, accepted in MNRAS
          We  present  multi-frequency  radio  continuum  as  well  as HI
          observations  of  the  composite  galaxy  NGC6764,  which has a
          young,  circumnuclear  starburst  and  also  harbours an active
          galactic  nucleus (AGN). These observations have been made at a
          number  of  frequencies  ranging  from ~600 MHz to 15 GHz using
          both  the  GMRT  and  the VLA. They reveal the structure of the
          bipolar  bubbles of non-thermal, radio emission which are along
          the  minor axis of the galaxy and extend up to ~1.1 and 1.5 kpc
          on  the  northern  and southern sides respectively. Features in
          the  radio  bubbles appear to overlap with filaments of H_alpha
          emission.  The  high-resolution  observations  reveal a compact
          source, likely to be associated with the nucleus of the galaxy,
          and  a  possible  radio  jet  towards  the  south-west. We have
          compiled  a  representative  sample of galaxies with bubbles of
          non-thermal  radio  emission  and  find that these are found in
          galaxies with an AGN.
          The HI observations with the GMRT show two peaks of emission on
          both ends of the stellar-bar and depletion of HI in the central
          region  of  the galaxy. We also detect HI in absorption against
          the  central radio peak at the systemic velocity of the galaxy.
          The  HI-absorption  spectrum  also  suggests  a  possible  weak
          absorption  feature  blue-shifted  by ~120 km/s, which requires
          confirmation.  A  similar  feature  has also been reported from
          observations   of   CO   in   emission,   suggesting  that  the
          circumnuclear   starburst   and  nuclear  activity  affect  the
          kinematics  of  the  atomic  and  molecular  gas components, in
          addition to the ionised gas seen in H_alpha and [N II].

          We    present   an   emission-line   diagnostic   analysis   of
          integral-field   spectroscopic   observations  that  cover  the
          central  kiloparsec  of  NGC  7742.  This  Sa  galaxy  hosts  a
          spectacular   nuclear   starburst   ring  and  nuclear  regions
          characterized  by  low-ionization emission. The gas in the ring
          rotates  in  the  opposite  sense  to  the stars in the galaxy,
          suggesting   a   recent   merging  or  acquisition  event.  The
          combination  of  integral-field  measurements for the H-alpha +
          [NII]  emission  lines  from DensePak and the H-beta and [OIII]
          emission  from  Sauron  allow  the  construction  of diagnostic
          diagrams  that  highlight the transition from star formation in
          the  nuclear ring to excitation by high-velocity shocks or by a
          central  AGN  towards the center. DensePak measurements for the
          [SII]  line  ratio reveal very low gas densities in the nuclear
          ring, Ne < 100 per cm^3, characteristic of massive HII regions.
          Comparison with MAPPINGS III models for starbursts with low gas
          densities  show  that the ring is of roughly solar metallicity.
          This  suggests that the gas in the nuclear ring originated in a
          stellar  system  capable  of  substantially  enriching  the gas
          metallicity  through  sustained star formation. We suggest that
          NGC  7742 cannibalised a smaller galaxy rich in metal-poor gas,
          and  that  star  formation  episodes  in  the  ring  have since
          increased the metallicity to its present value.

          Authors: S.L. Skinner, R. Perna, S.A. Zhekov
          Comments: 14 pages, 5 figures; to appear in ApJ
          Two    sensitive    Chandra    X-ray    observations   of   the
          heavily-reddened galactic starburst cluster Westerlund 1 in May
          and  June  2005 detected a previously unknown X-ray pulsar (CXO
          J164710.20-455217).  Its slow 10.6 s pulsations, moderate X-ray
          temperature  kT  $\approx$  0.5  keV,  and  apparent  lack of a
          massive  companion  tentatively suggest that it is an Anomalous
          X-ray  Pulsar  (AXP).  An  isothermal blackbody model yields an
          acceptable  spectral fit but the inferred source radius is much
          less  than  that of a neutron star, a result that has also been
          found  for  other  AXPs. We analyze the X-ray spectra with more
          complex  models  including a model that assumes the pulsar is a
          strongly  magnetized  neutron  star (``magnetar'') with a light
          element   atmosphere.  We  conclude  that  the  observed  X-ray
          emission cannot be explained as global surface emission arising
          from  the  surface  of  a cooling neutron star or magnetar. The
          emission  likely arises in one or more localized regions (``hot
          spots'')  covering  a small fraction of the surface. We discuss
          these new results in the context of both accretion and magnetar
          interpretations for the X-ray emission.

          Using the Hectochelle multifiber spectrograph, we have obtained
          high-resolution  (R~34,000)  spectra in the Halpha region for a
          large  number  of  stars  in  the  4  Myr-old  cluster  Tr  37,
          containing 146 previously known members and 26 newly identified
          ones.  We  present  the  Halpha  line  profiles of all members,
          compare them to our IR observations of dusty disks (2MASS/JHK +
          IRAC  +  MIPS  24  micron),  use  the  radial  velocities  as a
          membership  criterion, and calculate the rotational velocities.
          We  find  a  good  correlation  between the accretion-broadened
          profiles  and the presence of protoplanetary disks, noting that
          a small fraction of the accreting stars presents broad profiles
          with  Halpha equivalent widths smaller than the canonical limit
          separating  CTTS  and  WTTS.  The  number  of  strong accretors
          appears to be lower than in younger regions, and a large number
          of   CTTS   have  very  small  accretion  rates  (dM/dt<10^{-9}
          Msun/yr).   Taking   into  account  that  the  spectral  energy
          distributions   are   consistent  with  dust  evolution  (grain
          growth/settling)   in  the  innermost  disk,  this  suggests  a
          parallel evolution of the dusty and gaseous components. We also
          observe that about half of the "transition objects" (stars with
          no  IR  excesses  at wavelengths shorter than ~6 micron) do not
          show  any  signs of active accretion, whereas the other half is
          accreting  with accretion rates <10^{-9} Msun/yr. These zero or
          very  low accretion rates reveal important gas evolution and/or
          gas  depletion in the innermost disk, which could be related to
          grain  growth up to planetesimal or even planet sizes. Finally,
          we  examine  the  rotational  velocities  of  accreting and non
          accreting  stars, finding no significant differences that could
          indicate disk locking at these ages.

          The  vertical  profiles  of  chain  and  spiral galaxies in the
          Hubble  Space  Telescope  Ultra  Deep  Field  (UDF)  are fit to
          sech^2(z/z_0)  functions  convolved  with  stellar  profiles in
          order  to measure the disk scale heights z_0 in four passbands.
          The  bulge  regions  of  the  spirals  are avoided. Photometric
          redshifts  give  absolute  scales. The rms heights of the giant
          clumps  in  these  galaxies  are  also  measured.  The  results
          indicate  that  UDF  disks  are  thick  with  an average z_0 of
          1.0\pm0.4  kpc. The ratio of radial exponential scale length to
          z_0  is  \~3\pm1.5.  The scale heights are only 20% larger than
          the  radii of the giant star-forming clumps and a factor of ~10
          larger than the rms clump deviations around the midplanes. This
          suggests  the  clumps formed from midplane gas and dissolved to
          make  the  thick  disks.  Redshifted  stellar population models
          suggest  ages  of  ~1 Gy and mass column densities from 4 to 40
          Msun  pc^{-2}. The UDF disks look like young versions of modern
          thick  disks.  This  resemblance  is difficult to understand if
          galaxies  grow  over  time  or  if subsequent accretion of thin
          disks  gravitationally  shrinks  the observed thick disks. More
          likely, high redshift disks are thick because their mass column
          densities  are  low;  a  velocity  dispersion  of  only 14 km/s
          reproduces  the  observed thickness. Modern thick disks require
          more heating at high redshift. This is possible if the gas that
          eventually  makes the thin disk is in place before the youngest
          age  of  a  modern  thick  disk,  and if the existing stars are
          heated during the delivery of this gas.

          We  investigate the dynamics of an injected outflow propagating
          in  a  progenitor  in  the  context  of the collapsar model for
          gamma-ray  bursts  (GRBs)  through two dimensional axisymmetric
          relativistic  hydrodynamic  simulations.  Initially, we locally
          inject an outflow near the center of a progenitor. We calculate
          25  models,  in  total,  by fixing its total input energy to be
          10^{51}  ergs  s^{-1}  and radius of the injected outflow to be
          $7\times  10^7$  cm  while  varying  its  bulk  Lorentz factor,
          $\Gamma_{0}  =  1.05\sim  5$, and its specific internal energy,
          $\epsilon_0/c^2  = 0.1\sim 30$. The injected outflow propagates
          in  the  progenitor and drives a large-scale outflow or jet. We
          find  a smooth but dramatic transition from a collimated jet to
          an  expanding  outflow  among  calculated  models.  The maximum
          Lorentz  factor  is,  on  the  other hand, sensitive to both of
          $\Gamma_0$  and  $\epsilon_0$;  roughly  $\Gamma_{\rm max} \sim
          \Gamma_0 (1+\epsilon_0/c^2)$. Our finding will explain a smooth
          transition  between  the GRBs, X-ray rich GRBs (XRRs) and X-ray
          Flashes   (XRFs)   by   the   same  model  but  with  different
          $\epsilon_0$ values.

          gravitational arcs
          Authors: Gregor Seidel, Matthias Bartelmann
          Comments: 12 pages, 12 figures
          We  present  an efficient algorithm designed for and capable of
          detecting  elongated, thin features such as lines and curves in
          astronomical  images,  and  its  application  to  the automatic
          detection  of gravitational arcs. The algorithm is sufficiently
          robust to detect such features even if their surface brightness
          is  near  the  pixel  noise  in  the  image,  yet the amount of
          spurious  detections is low. The algorithm subdivides the image
          into  a grid of overlapping cells which are iteratively shifted
          towards  a  local  centre  of  brightness  in  their  immediate
          neighbourhood.  It then computes the ellipticity for each cell,
          and  combines cells with correlated ellipticities into objects.
          These  are  combined  to  graphs in a next step, which are then
          further  processed  to  determine  properties  of  the detected
          objects. We demonstrate the operation and the efficiency of the
          algorithm applying it to HST images of galaxy clusters known to
          contain   gravitational   arcs.  The  algorithm  completes  the
          analysis  of  an image with 3000x3000 pixels in about 4 seconds
          on an ordinary desktop PC. We discuss further applications, the
          method's  remaining  problems  and possible approaches to their
          solution.

          the  nuclear ring to excitation by high-velocity shocks or by a
          central  AGN  towards the center. DensePak measurements for the
          [SII]  line  ratio reveal very low gas densities in the nuclear
          ring, Ne < 100 per cm^3, characteristic of massive HII regions.
          Comparison with MAPPINGS III models for starbursts with low gas
          densities  show  that the ring is of roughly solar metallicity.
          This  suggests that the gas in the nuclear ring originated in a
          stellar  system  capable  of  substantially  enriching  the gas
          metallicity  through  sustained star formation. We suggest that
          NGC  7742 cannibalised a smaller galaxy rich in metal-poor gas,
          and  that  star  formation  episodes  in  the  ring  have since
          increased the metallicity to its present value.

          Title:  The  Chandra  X-ray  Spectrum  of  the 10.6 s Pulsar in
          Westerlund 1: Testing the Magnetar Hypothesis
          Authors: S.L. Skinner, R. Perna, S.A. Zhekov
          Comments: 14 pages, 5 figures; to appear in ApJ
          Two    sensitive    Chandra    X-ray    observations   of   the
          heavily-reddened galactic starburst cluster Westerlund 1 in May
          and  June  2005 detected a previously unknown X-ray pulsar (CXO
          J164710.20-455217).  Its slow 10.6 s pulsations, moderate X-ray
          temperature  kT  $\approx$  0.5  keV,  and  apparent  lack of a
          massive  companion  tentatively suggest that it is an Anomalous
          X-ray  Pulsar  (AXP).  An  isothermal blackbody model yields an
          acceptable  spectral fit but the inferred source radius is much
          less  than  that of a neutron star, a result that has also been
          found  for  other  AXPs. We analyze the X-ray spectra with more
          complex  models  including a model that assumes the pulsar is a
          strongly  magnetized  neutron  star (``magnetar'') with a light
          element   atmosphere.  We  conclude  that  the  observed  X-ray
          emission cannot be explained as global surface emission arising
          from  the  surface  of  a cooling neutron star or magnetar. The
          emission  likely arises in one or more localized regions (``hot
          spots'')  covering  a small fraction of the surface. We discuss
          these new results in the context of both accretion and magnetar
          interpretations for the X-ray emission.

          Evolution in Evolved Dusty Disks

          AJ in press
          Using the Hectochelle multifiber spectrograph, we have obtained
          high-resolution  (R~34,000)  spectra in the Halpha region for a
          large  number  of  stars  in  the  4  Myr-old  cluster  Tr  37,
          containing 146 previously known members and 26 newly identified
          ones.  We  present  the  Halpha  line  profiles of all members,
          compare them to our IR observations of dusty disks (2MASS/JHK +
          IRAC  +  MIPS  24  micron),  use  the  radial  velocities  as a
          membership  criterion, and calculate the rotational velocities.
          We  find  a  good  correlation  between the accretion-broadened
          profiles  and the presence of protoplanetary disks, noting that
          a small fraction of the accreting stars presents broad profiles
          with  Halpha equivalent widths smaller than the canonical limit
          separating  CTTS  and  WTTS.  The  number  of  strong accretors
          appears to be lower than in younger regions, and a large number
          of   CTTS   have  very  small  accretion  rates  (dM/dt<10^{-9}
          Msun/yr).   Taking   into  account  that  the  spectral  energy
          distributions   are   consistent  with  dust  evolution  (grain
          growth/settling)   in  the  innermost  disk,  this  suggests  a
          parallel evolution of the dusty and gaseous components. We also
          observe that about half of the "transition objects" (stars with
          no  IR  excesses  at wavelengths shorter than ~6 micron) do not
          show  any  signs of active accretion, whereas the other half is
          accreting  with accretion rates <10^{-9} Msun/yr. These zero or
          very  low accretion rates reveal important gas evolution and/or
          gas  depletion in the innermost disk, which could be related to
          grain  growth up to planetesimal or even planet sizes. Finally,
          we  examine  the  rotational  velocities  of  accreting and non
          accreting  stars, finding no significant differences that could
          indicate disk locking at these ages.

          The  vertical  profiles  of  chain  and  spiral galaxies in the
          Hubble  Space  Telescope  Ultra  Deep  Field  (UDF)  are fit to
          sech^2(z/z_0)  functions  convolved  with  stellar  profiles in
          order  to measure the disk scale heights z_0 in four passbands.
          The  bulge  regions  of  the  spirals  are avoided. Photometric
          redshifts  give  absolute  scales. The rms heights of the giant
          clumps  in  these  galaxies  are  also  measured.  The  results
          indicate  that  UDF  disks  are  thick  with  an average z_0 of
          1.0\pm0.4  kpc. The ratio of radial exponential scale length to
          z_0  is  \~3\pm1.5.  The scale heights are only 20% larger than
          the  radii of the giant star-forming clumps and a factor of ~10
          larger than the rms clump deviations around the midplanes. This
          suggests  the  clumps formed from midplane gas and dissolved to
          make  the  thick  disks.  Redshifted  stellar population models
          suggest  ages  of  ~1 Gy and mass column densities from 4 to 40
          Msun  pc^{-2}. The UDF disks look like young versions of modern
          thick  disks.  This  resemblance  is difficult to understand if
          galaxies  grow  over  time  or  if subsequent accretion of thin
          disks  gravitationally  shrinks  the observed thick disks. More
          likely, high redshift disks are thick because their mass column
          densities  are  low;  a  velocity  dispersion  of  only 14 km/s
          reproduces  the  observed thickness. Modern thick disks require
          more heating at high redshift. This is possible if the gas that
          eventually  makes the thin disk is in place before the youngest
          age  of  a  modern  thick  disk,  and if the existing stars are
          heated during the delivery of this gas.

          We  investigate the dynamics of an injected outflow propagating
          in  a  progenitor  in  the  context  of the collapsar model for
          gamma-ray  bursts  (GRBs)  through two dimensional axisymmetric
          relativistic  hydrodynamic  simulations.  Initially, we locally
          inject an outflow near the center of a progenitor. We calculate
          25  models,  in  total,  by fixing its total input energy to be
          10^{51}  ergs  s^{-1}  and radius of the injected outflow to be
          $7\times  10^7$  cm  while  varying  its  bulk  Lorentz factor,
          $\Gamma_{0}  =  1.05\sim  5$, and its specific internal energy,
          $\epsilon_0/c^2  = 0.1\sim 30$. The injected outflow propagates
          in  the  progenitor and drives a large-scale outflow or jet. We
          find  a smooth but dramatic transition from a collimated jet to
          an  expanding  outflow  among  calculated  models.  The maximum
          Lorentz  factor  is,  on  the  other hand, sensitive to both of
          $\Gamma_0$  and  $\epsilon_0$;  roughly  $\Gamma_{\rm max} \sim
          \Gamma_0 (1+\epsilon_0/c^2)$. Our finding will explain a smooth
          transition  between  the GRBs, X-ray rich GRBs (XRRs) and X-ray
          Flashes   (XRFs)   by   the   same  model  but  with  different
          $\epsilon_0$ values.

          Title:  Arcfinder:  An algorithm for the automatic detection of
          gravitational arcs
          Authors: Gregor Seidel, Matthias Bartelmann
          Comments: 12 pages, 12 figures
          We  present  an efficient algorithm designed for and capable of
          detecting  elongated, thin features such as lines and curves in
          astronomical  images,  and  its  application  to  the automatic
          detection  of gravitational arcs. The algorithm is sufficiently
          robust to detect such features even if their surface brightness
          is  near  the  pixel  noise  in  the  image,  yet the amount of
          spurious  detections is low. The algorithm subdivides the image
          into  a grid of overlapping cells which are iteratively shifted
          towards  a  local  centre  of  brightness  in  their  immediate
          neighbourhood.  It then computes the ellipticity for each cell,
          and  combines cells with correlated ellipticities into objects.
          These  are  combined  to  graphs in a next step, which are then
          further  processed  to  determine  properties  of  the detected
          objects. We demonstrate the operation and the efficiency of the
          algorithm applying it to HST images of galaxy clusters known to
          contain   gravitational   arcs.  The  algorithm  completes  the
          analysis  of  an image with 3000x3000 pixels in about 4 seconds
          on an ordinary desktop PC. We discuss further applications, the
          method's  remaining  problems  and possible approaches to their
          solution.

          Order within Chaos
          Authors:  Jonathan  C.  McKinney (1), Ramesh Narayan (1,2) ((1)

          Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS main journal
          General   relativistic   numerical  simulations  of  magnetized
          accretion  flows  around  black  holes  show accreting gas with
          chaotic   motions  at  equatorial  latitudes  and  coronae  and
          outflows  with  chaotic  magnetic  field  at  higher latitudes.
          However, the same simulations also produce highly relativistic,
          Poynting-dominated  jets  that  are  nearly consistent with the
          stationary  paraboloidal Blandford-Znajek model of an organized
          field threading the polar regions of a rotating black hole. How
          can  a  disordered accretion disk and corona lead to an ordered
          jet?  We  show  that  the  accretion  disk  and corona, despite
          appearing  very  disordered,  have a strikingly simple toroidal
          current distribution of the form $dI_\phi/dr \propto r^{-5/4}$,
          where  $I_\phi(r)$  is  the  toroidal  current  enclosed inside
          radius  $r$. We demonstrate that the poloidal magnetic field in
          the  jet  agrees  well with the force-free field solution for a
          non-rotating  equatorial  current  sheet  with  the  $r^{-5/4}$
          current   distribution,   thus   confirming   a   close  causal
          relationship between the simple current seen in the numerically
          simulated disk and the ordered field in the jet. The $r^{-5/4}$
          current  is  associated  with  an  $r^{-5/4}$ dependence of the
          field  strength  in  the  disk, which is similar to the scaling
          assumed  in two accretion/outflow models in the literature: the
          magnetohydrodynamic disk wind model of Blandford & Payne (1982)
          and  the  advection-dominated accretion flow model of Narayan &
          Yi (1995) [abridged].

          Title:  Disk-Jet  Coupling  in Black Hole Accretion Systems II:
          Force-Free Models
          Authors:  Jonathan  C.  McKinney (1), Ramesh Narayan (1,2) ((1)
          Institute for Theory and Computation, (2) Harvard University)
          Comments: 18 pages, 14 figures, submitted to MNRAS main journal
          In  paper I, we showed that time-dependent general relativistic
          magnetohydrodynamic   (GRMHD)  numerical  models  of  accretion
          disks,  although  being  highly  turbulent,  have  surprisingly
          simple  electromagnetic properties. In particular, the toroidal
          current  density in the disk takes the form $dI_\phi/dr \propto
          r^{-5/4}$.  Guided  by this simplicity, we use a time-dependent
          general relativistic force-free electrodynamics (GRFFE) code to
          study  an  idealized  problem  in  which  the accretion disk is
          replaced  by  an  infinitely  thin  rotating equatorial current
          sheet.  We  consider  both an $r^{-5/4}$ current profile and an
          $r^{-1}$  profile, the latter corresponding to the paraboloidal
          model   of   Blandford   &   Znajek   (1977).   The  force-free
          magnetosphere  we  obtain  with  the  $r^{-5/4}$  current sheet
          matches  remarkably  well to the Poynting-dominated jet seen in
          GRMHD  numerical  models.  In  order  to study the process that
          generates  the  corona  and  disk wind and destroys the ordered
          field  in  the corona in GRMHD numerical models, the force-free
          field  with  the $r^{-5/4}$ current distribution is embedded in
          an   accretion   disk  and  followed  in  a  GRMHD  simulation.
          Reconnection   and  magnetic  stresses  contribute  to  a  hot,
          magnetized  wind  without the aid of an ordered field threading
          the disk [abridged].

          The   statistical   expectation   values   of  the  temperature
          fluctuations  and  polarization  of cosmic microwave background
          (CMB)  are  assumed to be preserved under rotations of the sky.
          We  investigate  the  statistical isotropy (SI) of the CMB maps
          recently  measured  by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
          (WMAP)  using the bipolar spherical harmonic formalism proposed
          in  Hajian  & Souradeep 2003 for CMB temperature anisotropy and
          extended to CMB polarization in Basak, Hajian & Souradeep 2006.
          The  Bipolar  Power  Spectrum  (BiPS) had been measured for the
          full  sky  CMB  anisotropy maps of the first year WMAP data and
          now for the recently released three years of WMAP data. We also
          introduce  and  measure  directional  sensitive reduced Bipolar
          coefficients  on  the  three year WMAP ILC map. Consistent with
          our  published  results  from  first  year WMAP data we have no
          evidence for violation of statistical isotropy on large angular
          scales.  Preliminary  analysis  of  the recently released first
          WMAP polarization maps, however, indicate significant violation
          of  SI even when the foreground contaminated regions are masked
          out.  Further  work  is  required  to confirm a possible cosmic
          origin  and  rule out the (more likely) origin in observational
          artifact   such   as  foreground  residuals  at  high  galactic
          latitude.

          We   report   the   results   of   a  systematic  near-infrared
          spectroscopic  survey using the Subaru, VLT and Keck Telescopes
          of  a  sample of high redshift Ultra-luminous Infrared Galaxies
          (ULIRGs)  mainly  composed  of submillimeter-selected galaxies.
          Our  observations  span  the restframe optical range containing
          nebular emission lines such as H_beta, [OIII], and [OII], which
          are  essential  for  making  robust diagnostics of the physical
          properties  of  these ULIRGs. Using the H_alpha/H_beta emission
          line  ratios, we derive internal extinction estimates for these
          galaxies   similar   to  those  of  local  ULIRGs:A_v~2.9+-0.5.
          Correcting the H_alpha estimates of the star formation rate for
          dust  extinction  using  the Balmer decrement, results in rates
          which are consistent with those estimated from the far-infrared
          luminosity.  The  majority  (>60%)  of our sample show spectral
          features  characteristic  of  AGN,  with  ~65% exhibiting broad
          Balmer  emission  lines.  A  proportion  of  these sources show
          relatively  low [OIII]/H_beta line ratios, which are similar to
          those  of  Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies suggesting small mass
          black  holes which are rapidly growing. In the subsample of our
          survey  with both [OIII] and hard X-ray coverage, at least ~60%
          show  an  excess of [OIII] emission, by a factor of 5-10 times,
          relative   to   the  hard  X-ray  luminosity  compared  to  the
          correlation  between  these two properties seen in Seyferts and
          QSOs  locally.  From  our spectral diagnostics, we propose that
          the strong [OIII] emission in these galaxies arises from shocks
          in  dense  gaseous  regions  in  this  vigorously  star-forming
          population.

          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
          We  show  the  existence of a strong trend between neutron star
          surface  temperature  and the dipolar component of the magnetic
          field extending through four orders of field magnitude, a range
          that includes magnetars, X-ray pulsars, and many ordinary radio
          pulsars.  We show that this trend can be explained by the ohmic
          decay of currents in the crust over a time scale of $\sim 10^6$
          yr. We predict the minimum temperature that a neutron star with
          a given magnetic field can reach.

          scale strongly and smoothly with halo mass, but, at fixed mass,
          not  with  luminosity.  We  compare  these  findings  with  the
          semi-analytical galaxy formation model of Croton et al. (2006).
          The   discrepancies   we   find   can   be  explained  with  an
          oversimplified  implementation of strangulation, the neglect of
          tidal  stripping,  and  shortcomings  in the treatments of dust
          extinction and/or AGN feedback.

          Title: Dynamical Expansion of Ionization and Dissociation Front
          around a Massive Star : A Starburst Mechanism
          Authors:  Takashi  Hosokawa  (NAOJ), Shu-ichiro Inutsuka (Kyoto
          Univ.)
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL
          We  quantitatively  examine  the significance of star formation
          triggered in the swept-up shell around an expanding HII region.
          If  the  swept-up molecular gas is sufficiently massive, new OB
          stars massive enough to repeat the triggering process will form
          in the shell. We determine the lower limit (M_thr) for the mass
          of  the  star  that sweeps up the molecular gas, where at least
          one  new  star  with  mass  M_*  >  M_thr forms after the shell
          fragmentation.  To calculate the threshold stellar mass, M_thr,
          we examine how massive molecular shells can form around various
          central  stars,  by  performing  detailed  numerical  radiation
          hydrodynamics  calculations.  The  mass of the photodissociated
          gas  is generally larger than the mass of the photoionized gas.
          However,    the    swept-up    molecular   mass   exceeds   the
          photodissociated mass with a higher-mass star of M_* > 20 Msun.
          The  accumulated  molecular  mass  generally increases with the
          stellar  mass,  and  amounts to 10^{4-5} Msun for M_* > 20 Msun
          with an ambient density of n \sim 100/cc. The threshold stellar
          mass  is  M_thr \sim 18 Msun with the star-formation efficiency
          of  \epsilon  \sim  0.1  and  n  \sim  100/cc.  We  examine the
          generality  of  this  mode of run-away triggering for different
          sets  of  parameters,  and  found that M_thr \sim 15-20 Msun in
          various  situations.  If the ambient density is too high or the
          star-formation  efficiency  is  too  low, the triggering is not
          run-away, but a single event.

          We  studied  and compared the long term average hard X-ray (>20
          keV)  spectra  of  a  sample  of  twelve  bright low-mass X-ray
          binaries  hosting a neutron star (NS). Our sample comprises the
          six well studied Galactic Z sources and six Atoll sources, four
          of  which  are bright ("GX") bulge sources while two are weaker
          ones  in the 2-10 keV range (H 1750-440 and H 1608-55). For all
          the  sources  of  our sample, we analysed available public data
          and  extracted  average spectra from the IBIS/ISGRI detector on
          board  INTEGRAL. The two low-dim Atoll spectra are dominated by
          photons  upscattered  presumably  due  to dynamical and thermal
          Comptonization  in an optically thin, hot plasma. For the first
          time,  we extend the detection of H 1750-440 up to 150 keV. The
          Z and bright "GX" Atoll source spectra are very similar and are
          dominated  by  Comptonized  blackbody radiation of seed photons
          presumably  coming  from the accretion disc and NS surface. The
          seed  photons  radiation  is Comptonized in the optically thick
          cloud  with  plasma  temperature in the range of 2.5-3 keV. Six
          sources  show  a  hard  tail in their average spectrum: Cyg X-2
          (Z),  GX  340+0 (Z), GX 17+2 (Z), GX 5-1 (Z), Sco X-1(Z) and GX
          13+1 (Atoll). This is the first detection of a hard tail in the
          X-ray  spectrum  of  the  peculiar  GX 13+1 that we discover to
          behave  like  a  Z source not only in its variability and radio
          properties,  but  also  from  the spectral point of view. Using
          radio  data  from  the literature we find, in all Z sources and
          bright  "GX"  Atolls, a systematic positive correlation between
          the X-ray hard tail (40-100 keV) and the radio luminosity. This
          suggests  that  hard  tails and energetic electrons causing the
          radio  emission  may  have  the  same  origin,  most likely the
          Compton cloud located inside the NS magnetosphere.

          Authors: Pawel Lachowicz, Bozena Czerny, Marek A. Abramowicz
          Comments: 10 pages, 11 figures (9 in color), submitted to MNRAS
          Following  our  previous  work of Lachowicz & Czerny (2005), we
          explore  further  the  application  of  the  continuous wavelet
          transform  to  X-ray  astronomical  signals.  Using  the public
          archive  of  the XMM-Newton satellite, we analyze all available
          EPIC-pn  observations for nearby Seyfert 1 galaxies MCG-6-30-15
          and  NGC  4051.  We  confine  our  analysis  to  0.002-0.007 Hz
          frequency  band in which, on the way of theoretically motivated
          premises,  some quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are expected
          to  be  found.  We  find  that  indeed  wavelet power histogram
          analysis  reveals  such  QPOs  centered  at  two frequencies of
          ~2.5E-3  Hz  and  4-6E-3  Hz,  respectively. We show that these
          quasi-periodic  features  can  be disentangled from the Poisson
          noise  contamination  level  what is hardly to achieve with the
          standard  Fourier analysis. Interestingly, we find some of them
          to  be  in  2:1  or  3:2  ratio.  If  real,  our finding may be
          considered  as a link between QPOs observed in AGN and kHz QPOs
          seen in X-ray binary systems.

          Comments: accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  use a 100 ks long XMM-Newton observation of the Narrow-Line
          Seyfert  1  galaxy  Ark  564 and combine it with the month-long
          monitoring  of  the  same source produced by ASCA, to calculate
          the  phase  lags  and coherence between different energy bands,
          over  frequencies  ~  10^{-6} to 10^{-3} Hz. This is the widest
          frequency range for which these spectral-timing properties have
          been  calculated accurately for any AGN. The 0.7-2 and 2--0 keV
          ASCA   light   curves,  and  the  XMM-Newton  light  curves  in
          corresponding  energy  bands,  are highly coherent (~ 0.9) over
          most  of  the  frequency  range  studied.  We observe time lags
          between  the  energy bands, increasing both with time-scale and
          with  energy  separation  of  the  bands. The time lag spectrum
          shows  a  broad  peak  in  the 10^{-5} - 5x10^{-4} Hz frequency
          range,  where  the  time  lags follow a power law slope ~ -0.7.
          Above  ~  5  x  10^{-4}  Hz  the  lags drop below this relation
          significantly.  This change in slope resembles the shape of the
          lag  spectra  of  black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRB) in the very
          high or intermediate state. The lags increase linearly with the
          logarithm  of  the  separation of the energy bands, which poses
          one more similarity between this AGN and BHXRBs.

          The  nonextensivity  in a non-isothermal plasma system with the
          Coulombian  long-range interactions is studied in the framework
          of Tsallis statistics. We present for first time a mathematical
          expression  of  the  nonextensive  parameter  q  based  on  the
          mathematical  theory  about  the generalized Boltzmann equation
          and the q-H theorem and the Maxwellian q-velocity distribution.
          We  obtain  a  new  physical  explanation  for q concerning the
          nature  of non-isothermal configurations in plasma systems with
          Coulombian   long-range   interactions.  We  also  provide  one
          illustration  for Almeida theorem (Physica A 300(2001)424) from
          the  kinetic  analyses  of  plasma  systems,  which  means that
          Tsallis  statistics  might  be  a  suitable  statistics for the
          description  of  a  nonequilibrium  system  with  a temperature
          gradient in it.

          The  properties of the nonextensive parameter q and the Tsallis
          distribution   for  self-gravitating  systems  are  studied.  A
          mathematical   expression   of   q  is  deduced  based  on  the

          generalized Maxwellian q-velocity distribution in the framework
          of  Tsallis  statistics. We obtain a clear understanding of the

          temperature  gradient  and  the  gravitational potential of the
          self-gravitating  systems.  It  is  suggested  that the Tsallis

          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          To check the validity of the theory of nonextensive statistical
          mechanics,  we have investigated the nonextensive degree of the
          solar interior and have tried to find the experimental evidence
          by  helioseismological  measurements  that  q is different from
          unity.  We are able to derive a parameter for providing a lower
          limit  to  the  nonextensive  degree inside the sun that can be
          uniquely  determined  by  the  solar  sound  speeds measured by
          helioseismology.  After  calculating the parameter by using the
          solar sound speeds, we get the lower limit of(1-q)not less than
          0.1902  for  all  solar radii between 0.15R(sun) and 0.95R(sun)
          and   (1-q)approximately  equal  to  0.4  for  the  out  layers
          extending  from  0.75R(sun)to  0.95R(sun).Thus, the result that
          the  nonextensive  parameter  q is significantly different from
          unity  has  received the support by the experiment measurements
          for the solar sound speeds in the helioseismology.

          Authors: Du Jiulin
          Comments: 20 pages,40 references
          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          On  the  basis of q-kinetic theory based on Tsallis entropy, we
          propose  an  approach  to  derive  the  nonextensive  power law
          distributions  for  the many-body systems with self-gravitating
          long-range    interactions.    The   nonextensive   power   law
          distribution  is shown to represent the long-range interactions
          and  the  non-local  correlations  within  the self-gravitating
          system  with  inhomogeneous velocity dispersion when being at a
          nonequilibrium   stationary   state.   An   expression  of  the
          corresponding  nonextensive  parameter q is uniquely determined
          from  the  microscopic  dynamical  equation  and  the  physical
          interpretation  of q different from unity is clearly presented.
          We establish a relation between the nonextensive parameter q to
          deviate  from unity and the measurable quantities: the velocity
          dispersion   gradient   and  the  mass  density.  We  derive  a
          second-order  nonlinear  differential  equation  for the radial
          density  dependence  of  the system with inhomogeneous velocity
          dispersion  and correctly connect with the density profiles for
          dark  matter.  We also study the cases for the self-gravitating
          collisionless and gaseous dynamical system, respectively.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  have  carried  out  an  extensive radio study with the Very
          Large  Array  on  the  Seyfert  1.5  galaxy  Mrk 6 and imaged a
          spectacular  radio  structure in the source. The radio emission
          occurs on three different spatial scales, from ~7.5 kpc bubbles
          to  ~1.5  kpc  bubbles lying nearly orthogonal to them and a ~1
          kpc  radio  jet  lying  orthogonal  to the kpc-scale bubble. To
          explain the complex morphology, we first consider a scenario in
          which the radio structures are the result of superwinds ejected
          by a nuclear starburst. However, recent Spitzer observations of
          Mrk  6  provide an upper limit to the star formation rate (SFR)
          of  ~5.5  M_sun/yr,  an estimate much lower than the SFR of ~33
          M_sun/yr  derived  assuming  that  the  bubbles are a result of
          starburst  winds  energized  by  supernovae explosions. Thus, a
          starburst  alone  cannot  meet  the energy requirements for the
          creation of the bubbles in Mrk 6. We show that a single plasmon
          model   is  energetically  infeasible,  and  we  argue  that  a
          jet-driven  bubble  model while energetically feasible does not
          produce  the complex radio morphologies. Finally, we consider a
          model  in  which  the complex radio structure is a result of an
          episodically-powered    precessing   jet   that   changes   its
          orientation.  This  model  is  the  most  attractive  as it can
          naturally   explain   the  complex  radio  morphology,  and  is
          consistent  with  the  energetics,  the  spectral index and the
          polarization  structure.  Radio  emission in this scenario is a
          short-lived  phenomenon  in  the  lifetime  of a Seyfert galaxy
          which results due to an accretion event.

          Authors: R. Caimmi
          Comments: 46 pages, 4 figures
          With  regard  to large-scale astrophysical systems, the current
          paper  deals  with  (i)  formulation of tensor virial equations
          from the standpoint of analytical mechanics; (ii) investigation
          on  the  role  of  systematic  and  random  motions  for virial
          equilibrium  configurations;  (iii)  extent to which systematic
          and  random  motions  are equivalent in changing a fluid shape.
          The  tensor  virial  equations  are formulated using analytical
          mechanics,  and the self potential-energy tensor is shown to be
          symmetric.  The  role  of  systematic  and  random  motions  in
          collisionless,  ideal,  self-gravitating fluids, is analysed in
          detail  including  radial and tangential velocity dispersion on
          the   equatorial   plane.  R3  fluids  are  defined  as  ideal,
          self-gravitating  fluids in virial equilibrium, with systematic
          rotation  around  a  principal axis of inertia, and ihe related
          virial equations are formulated. A unified theory of systematic
          and  random  motions  is  developed  for R3 fluids, taking into
          consideration  imaginary  rotation. The effect of random motion
          excess  is  shown  to  be  equivalent  to an additional real or
          imaginary   rotation,   respectively,  inducing  flattening  or
          elongation. R3 fluids are found to admit adjoint configurations
          with    isotropic   random   velocity   distribution.   Further
          constraints  are  established  on the amount of random velocity
          anisotropy    along    the   principal   axes,   for   triaxial
          configurations.  A  necessary  condition  is formulated for the
          occurrence  of bifurcation points from axisymmetric to triaxial
          configurations  in  virial equilibrium, which is independent of
          the  anisotropy  parameters. In the special case of homeoidally
          striated  Jacobi  ellipsoid,  some previously known results are
          reproduced.

          Comments: Accepted to MNRAS
          We  present multi-epoch observations of the radio nebula around
          the  neutron star X-ray binary Circinus X-1 made at 1.4 and 2.5
          GHz  with the Australia Telescope Compact Array between October
          2000  and September 2004. The nebula can be seen as a result of
          the  interaction  between  the  jet  from  the  system  and the
          interstellar  medium  and  it  is  likely  that we are actually
          looking  toward  the  central  X-ray  binary system through the
          jet-powered  radio  lobe. The study of the nebula thus offers a
          unique  opportunity  to  estimate  for  the  first  time  using
          calorimetry  the  energetics  of  a  jet from an object clearly
          identified  as  a  neutron star. An extensive discussion on the
          energetics  of  the  complex  is presented: a first approach is
          based  on  the  minimum  energy  estimation, while a second one
          employs  a  self-similar  model  of the interaction between the
          jets and the surrounding medium. The results suggest an age for
          the nebula of \leq 10^5 years and a corresponding time-averaged
          jet  power  \geq  10^{35}  erg  s^{-1}. During periodic flaring
          episodes,  the  instantaneous  jet  power  may  reach values of
          similar magnitude to the X-ray luminosity.

          An  evolutionary  model of star formation in ULIRGs was created
          using  existing  star  formation  and  radiative transfer codes
          (STARBURST99,  RADMC  and  RADICAL)  as  building  blocks.  The
          results  of  the simulations are compared to data from two IRAS
          catalogs.  From  the  simulations  it  is  found  that the dust
          surrounding   the   starburst   region  is  made  up  from  two
          components.  There  is  a  low  optical  depth  (tau=0.1, which
          corresponds  to  0.1%  of  the  total  dust mass), hot (T~400K)
          non-grey component close to the starburst (scale size 10pc) and
          a  large  scale, colder grey component (100pc, 75K) with a much
          larger   column   (tau=10).  The  simulations  also  show  that
          starburst  galaxies  can  be powered by massive star formation.
          The  parameters  for  this star forming region are difficult to
          determine,  since the IR continuum luminosity is only sensitive
          to the total UV input. Therefore, there is a degeneracy between
          the  total  starburst  mass and the initial mass function (IMF)
          slope.  A less massive star formation with a shallower IMF will
          produce  the  same  amount  of  OB stars and therefore the same
          amount  of  irradiating  UV flux. Assuming the stars are formed
          according  to  a  Salpeter  IMF  (Psi(M)  ~  M^-2.35), the star
          formation  region  should produce 10^9 Msun of stars (either in
          one  instantaneous  burst, or in a continuous process) in order
          to produce enough IR radiation.

          Comments: 25 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Spatially  resolved  emission-line  spectroscopy  is a powerful
          tool  to  determine  the physical conditions in the narrow-line
          region (NLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We recently used
          optical long-slit spectroscopy to study the NLRs of a sample of
          six Seyfert-2 galaxies. We have shown that such an approach, in
          comparison  to  the  commonly  used  [OIII] narrow-band imaging
          alone,  allows  us to probe the size of the NLR in terms of AGN
          photoionisation.  Moreover,  several physical parameters of the
          NLR can be directly accessed. We here apply the same methods to
          study the NLR of six Seyfert-1 galaxies and compare our results
          to  those  of  Seyfert-2  galaxies.  We  employ  diagnostically
          valuable   emission-line   ratios  to  determine  the  physical
          properties  of  the  NLR,  including the core values and radial
          dependencies  of  density, ionisation parameter, and reddening.
          Tracking   the   radial   change  of  emission-line  ratios  in
          diagnostic diagrams allows us to measure the transition between
          AGN-like  and HII-like line excitation, and thus we are able to
          measure  the  size  of  the NLR. In the diagnostic diagrams, we
          find a transition between line ratios falling in the AGN regime
          and  those  typical  for HII regions in two Seyfert-1 galaxies,
          thus  determining  the  size  of  the NLR. The central electron
          temperature  and  ionisation parameter are in general higher in
          type-1  Seyferts  than  in  type  2s. In almost all cases, both
          electron density and ionisation parameter decrease with radius.
          In  general,  the decrease is faster in Seyfert-1 galaxies than
          in   type   2s.   In  several  objects,  the  gaseous  velocity
          distribution  is  characteristic  for  rotational  motion in an
          (inclined)  emission-line disk in the centre. We give estimates
          of the black hole masses. We discuss our findings in detail for
          each object.

          [ABRIDGED]  We present the discovery and follow-up observations
          of  142  pulsars  found  in  the  Parkes 20-cm multibeam pulsar
          survey  of  the Galactic plane. These new discoveries bring the
          total number of pulsars found by the survey to 742. In addition
          to tabulating spin and astrometric parameters, along with pulse
          width   and   flux  density  information,  we  present  orbital
          characteristics  for  13  binary pulsars which form part of the
          new  sample. Combining these results from another recent Parkes
          multibeam  survey  at high Galactic latitudes, we have a sample
          of   1008   normal   pulsars  which  we  use  to  carry  out  a
          determination of their Galactic distribution and birth rate. We
          infer a total Galactic population of 30000 +/- 1100 potentially
          detectable  pulsars  (i.e.  those  beaming  towards  us) having
          1.4-GHz  luminosities above 0.1 mJy kpc squared. Using a pulsar
          current  analysis,  we derive the birth rate of this population
          to  be 1.4 +/- 0.2 pulsars per century. An important conclusion
          from  our  work is that the inferred radial density function of
          pulsars  depends  strongly  on the assumed distribution of free
          electrons  in  the  Galaxy. As a result, any analyses using the
          most  recent  electron model of Cordes & Lazio predict a dearth
          of  pulsars  in  the  inner Galaxy. We show that this model can
          also  bias the inferred pulsar scale height with respect to the
          Galactic   plane.  Combining  our  results  with  other  Parkes
          multibeam surveys we find that the population is best described
          by an exponential distribution with a scale height of 330 pc.

          Comments: 19 pages, 17 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  analyse  a  z<0.1  galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky
          Survey   focusing   on  the  variation  of  the  galaxy  colour
          bimodality  with  stellar  mass and projected neighbour density
          Sigma,   and   on  measurements  of  the  galaxy  stellar  mass
          functions. The characteristic mass increases with environmental
          density  from  about  10^10.6 Msun to 10^10.9 Msun (Kroupa IMF,
          H_0=70)  for  Sigma  in the range 0.1--10 per Mpc^2. The galaxy
          population  naturally divides into a red and blue sequence with
          the    locus    of    the    sequences   in   colour-mass   and
          colour-concentration    index   not   varying   strongly   with
          environment.  The  fraction  of galaxies on the red sequence is
          determined  in  bins  of 0.2 in log Sigma and log mass (12 x 13
          bins). The red fraction f_r generally increases continuously in
          both  Sigma and mass such that there is a unified relation: f_r
          =  F(Sigma,mass).  Two  simple  functions  are  proposed  which
          provide  good  fits  to  the data. These data are compared with
          analogous  quantities  in  semi-analytical  models based on the
          Millennium  N-body  simulation:  the  Bower  et  al. (2006) and
          Croton et al. (2006) models that incorporate AGN feedback. Both
          models  predict  a  strong  dependence  of  the red fraction on
          stellar  mass  and environment that is qualitatively similar to
          the observations. However, a quantitative comparison shows that
          the  Bower  et  al. model is a significantly better match; this
          appears  to  be  due  to the different treatment of feedback in
          central galaxies.

          We present Chandra X-ray Observatory monitoring observations of
          the   recent  accretion  outburst  displayed  by  the  pre-main
          sequence  (pre-MS)  star V1647 Ori. The X-ray observations were
          obtained  over  a  period  beginning prior to outburst onset in
          late 2003 and continuing through its apparent cessation in late
          2005,  and  demonstrate  that  the  mean  flux of the spatially
          coincident  X-ray  source  closely  tracked  the  near-infrared
          luminosity  of  V1647  Ori  throughout  its  eruption.  We find
          negligible likelihood that the correspondence between X-ray and
          infrared  light  curves  over  this  period  was  the result of
          multiple  X-ray  flares  unrelated  to the accretion burst. The
          recent  Chandra  data  confirm that the X-ray spectrum of V1647
          Ori hardened during outburst, relative both to its pre-outburst
          state  and  to  the X-ray spectra of nearby pre-MS stars in the
          L1630 cloud. We conclude that the observed changes in the X-ray
          emission  from  V1647  Ori  over  the  course  of its 2003-2005
          eruption  were  generated  by  a sudden increase and subsequent
          decline  in  its  accretion  rate.  These results for V1647 Ori
          indicate  that  the  flux  of hard X-ray emission from erupting
          low-mass,  pre-MS stars, and the duration and intensity of such
          eruptions,  reflect  the  degree  to  which  star-disk magnetic
          fields  are  reorganized  before  and  during  major  accretion
          events.

          Title:  Cosmic  Evolution of Mass Accretion Rate and Metalicity
          in Active Galactic Nuclei
          Authors: Hagai Netzer, Benny Trakhtenbrot
          Comments: 10 pages 8 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We present line and continuum measurements for 9818 SDSS type-I
          active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with z le 0.75. The data are used
          to  study  the  four  dimensional  space  of  black  hole mass,
          normalized  accretion rate (Ledd), metalicity and redshift. The
          main  results  are:  1.  Ledd  is smaller for larger mass black
          holes  at  all  redshifts.  2. For a given black hole mass Ledd
          propto  z^gamma  or (1+z)^delta where the slope gamma increases
          with  black  hole  mass.  The mean slope is similar to the star
          formation  rate  slope  over the same redshift interval. 3. The
          FeII/Hb  line  ratio  is significantly correlated with Ledd. It
          also  shows  a weaker negative dependence on redshift. Combined
          with  the  known dependence of metalicity on accretion rate, we
          suggest  that the FeII/Hb line ratio is a metalicity indicator.
          4. Given the measured accretion rates, the growth times of most
          AGNs  exceed  the  age  of  the  universe.  This  suggests past
          episodes  of faster growth for all those sources. Combined with
          the  FeII/Hb  result, we conclude that the broad emission lines
          metalicity  goes  through  cycles  and  is  not  a monotonously
          decreasing  function of redshift. 5. FWHM(OIII) is a poor proxy
          of  sigma_*  especially  for high Ledd. 6. We define a group of
          narrow line type-I AGNs (NLAGN1s) by their luminosity (or mass)
          dependent  Hb  line width. Such objects have Ledd>0.25 and they
          comprise 8% of the type-I population. Other interesting results
          include  negative Baldwin relationships for EW(Hb) and EW(FeII)
          and  a  relative  increase  of the red part of the Hb line with
          luminosity.

          Title: Magnetic Reconnection in Astrophysical Systems
          Authors: Dmitri A. Uzdensky (Princeton University)
          Comments: Invited Talk at the Harry Petschek Memorial Symposium
          (Univ.  of  Maryland,  College Park, MD, March 21-23, 2006); 25
          pages, 6 figures
          The  main  subject  of my talk is the question: in what kind of
          astrophysical  systems  magnetic  reconnection  is  interesting
          and/or important? To address this question, I first put forward
          three general criteria for selecting the relevant astrophysical
          environments.    Namely,    reconnection   should   be:   fast;
          energetically  important;  and  observable. From this, I deduce
          that  the  gas  density  should  be low, so that the plasma is:
          collisionless;   force-free;  and  optically  thin.  Thus,  for
          example, the requirement that reconnection is fast implies that
          Petschek's  reconnection  mechanism must be operating, which is
          possible, apparently, only in the collisionless regime. Next, I
          argue  that  the force-free condition implies that the magnetic
          field  be  produced in, and anchored by, a nearby dense massive
          object, e.g., a star or a disk, strongly stratified by gravity.
          I  then  stress  the importance of field-line opening (e.g., by
          differential  rotation)  as  a  means  to  form  a reconnecting
          current  sheet.  Correspondingly,  I suggest the Y-point helmet
          streamer  as  a  generic  prototypical  magnetic  configuration
          relevant  to large-scale reconnection in astrophysics. Finally,
          I  discuss  several  specific  astrophysical  systems where the
          above criteria are met: stellar coronae,
          magnetically-interacting  star--disk  systems,  and  magnetized
          coronae  above  turbulent  accretion  disks. In the Appendix, I
          apply  the  ideas put forward in this talk to the solar coronal
          heating problem.

          The  binary X-ray pulsar A0535+262 was observed with the Suzaku
          X-ray  observatory,  on 2005 September 14 for a net exposure of
          22  ksec.  The  source  was  in  a  declining  phase of a minor
          outburst,  exhibiting 3--50 keV luminosity of about $3.7 \times
          10^{35}$  ergs  s$^{-1}$  at  an  assumed distance of 2 kpc. In
          spite  of  the  very low source intensity (about 30 mCrab at 20
          keV),  its  electron  cyclotron  resonance was detected clearly
          with  the Suzaku Hard X-ray Detector, in absorption at about 45
          keV.  The  resonance energy is found to be essentially the same
          as  those  measured  when  the  source  is almost two orders of
          magnitude  more  luminous.  These results are compared with the
          luminosity-dependent changes in the cyclotron resonance energy,
          observed from 4U 0115+63 and X 0331+53.

          Title:  The relation between the optical spectral slope and the
          luminosity for 17 Palomar-Green QSOs

          in MNRAS
          Using  7.5-year spectroscopic monitoring data of a sample of 17
          Palomar-Green  QSOs  (PG  QSOs)  (z=0.061-0.371), we obtain the
          optical  spectral  slope  for  each  object  at all epochs by a
          power-law  fit  to the spectra in continuum bands. All of these
          17  PG QSOs exhibit obvious spectral slope variability. Most of
          the 17 objects show anti-correlation between the spectral slope
          and  the rest-frame 5100$\AA$ continuum flux while five of them
          exist strong anti-correlation (correlation coefficient R larger
          than  0.5).  For  the  ensemble  of  these 17 PG QSOs, a strong
          anti-correlation  between  the  average  spectral slope and the
          average  rest-frame  5100$\AA$  luminosity  is  found  while no
          correlation  is  found  between  the  spectral  slope  and  the
          Eddington  ratio.  A  median  anti-correlation between spectral
          slope changes and continuum flux variations is also found which
          indicates  a  hardening  of  the spectrum during bright phases.
          Accretion  disk  (jet) instability models with other mechanisms
          associated   with   changes  in  the  accretion  processes  are
          promising.

          We  present XMM-Newton observations of three optically-selected
          z  > 0.6 clusters from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS),
          comprising  the  first results of a planned X-ray survey of the
          full  EDisCS  high-redshift  sample.  The  EDisCS clusters were
          identified  in  the  Las  Campanas  Distant  Cluster  Survey as
          surface  brightness  fluctuations  in the optical sky and their
          masses  and  galaxy populations are well described by extensive
          photometric  and  spectroscopic  observations. We detect two of
          the three clusters in the X-ray and place a firm upper limit on
          diffuse  emission  in  the  third cluster field. We are able to
          constrain  the X-ray luminosity and temperature of the detected
          clusters   and   estimate  their  masses.  We  find  the  X-ray
          properties of the detected EDisCS clusters are similar to those
          of  X-ray-selected  clusters  of  comparable mass and -- unlike
          other   high-redshift,   optically-selected   clusters  --  are
          consistent  with  the  T  -  sigma  and  L_x  - sigma relations
          determined  from  X-ray  selected clusters at low redshift. The
          X-ray  determined  mass estimates are generally consistent with
          those  derived  from  weak  lensing and spectroscopic analyses.
          These  preliminary  results  suggest  that  the novel method of
          optical  selection  used  to  construct the EDisCS catalog may,
          like   selection   by  X-ray  luminosity,  be  well-suited  for
          identification   of   relaxed,   high-redshift  clusters  whose
          intracluster medium is in place and stable by z ~ 0.8.

          model and precision estimates

          Comments:  30  pages,  3  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          Tempo2  is  a  new  software package for the analysis of pulsar
          pulse times of arrival. In this paper we describe in detail the
          timing  model  used  by  tempo2, and discuss limitations on the
          attainable  precision.  In  addition to the intrinsic slow-down
          behaviour  of  the pulsar, tempo2 accounts for the effects of a
          binary  orbital  motion,  the  secular  motion of the pulsar or
          binary  system,  interstellar,  Solar  system  and  ionospheric
          dispersion,   observatory  motion  (including  Earth  rotation,
          precession,   nutation,   polar  motion  and  orbital  motion),
          tropospheric propagation delay, and gravitational time dilation
          due  to  binary  companions and Solar system bodies. We believe
          the  timing model is accurate in its description of predictable
          systematic timing effects to better than one nanosecond, except
          in  the  case  of  relativistic  binary  systems  where further
          theoretical   development  is  needed.  The  largest  remaining
          sources  of potential error are measurement error, interstellar
          scattering,   Solar   system  ephemeris  errors,  atomic  clock
          instability and gravitational waves.

          We  report  the  first  detections  of the Class 0 protostellar
          source  IRAM  04191+1522 at wavelengths shortward of 60 microns
          with  the  Spitzer Space Telescope. We see extended emission in
          the  Spitzer  images  that  suggests the presence of an outflow
          cavity  in  the  circumstellar envelope. We combine the Spitzer
          observations  with  existing  data  to  form a complete dataset
          ranging  from  3.6  to  1300  microns  and  use  these  data to
          construct  radiative transfer models of the source. We conclude
          that  the internal luminosity of IRAM 04191+1522, defined to be
          the sum of the luminosity from the internal sources (a star and
          a  disk),  is L_int = 0.08 +/- 0.04 L_sun, placing it among the
          lowest  luminosity  protostars  known. Though it was discovered
          before   the  launch  of  the  Spitzer  Space  Telescope,  IRAM
          04191+1522  falls  within  a  new  class of Very Low Luminosity
          Objects  being  discovered  by  Spitzer.  Unlike  the two other
          well-studied objects in this class, which are associated either
          with  weak,  compact  outflows  or  no  outflows  at  all, IRAM
          04191+1522 has a well-defined molecular outflow with properties
          consistent  with those expected based on relations derived from
          higher  luminosity (L_int > 1 L_sun) protostars. We discuss the
          difficulties in understanding IRAM 04191+1522 in the context of
          the  standard  model  of star formation, and suggest a possible
          explanation for the very low luminosity of this source.

          I  present  an overview of past, present and future research on
          microquasars and jets, showing that microquasars, i.e. galactic
          jet  sources,  are  among the best laboratories for high energy
          phenomena   and  astroparticle  physics.  After  reminding  the
          analogy  with  quasars,  I focus on one of the best microquasar
          representatives,  probably  the archetype, namely GRS 1915+105,
          and present accretion and ejection phenomena, showing that only
          a  multi-wavelength  approach  allows a better understanding of
          phenomena occurring in these sources. Thereafter, I review jets
          at  different  scales:  compact jets, large-scale jets, and the
          interactions  between  ejection  and  the surrounding medium. I
          finish  this  review  by  showing  that  microquasars  are good
          candidates  to  be emitters of astroparticles: very high energy
          photons, cosmic rays and neutrinos.

          Comments: 20 pages
          We  report on a high-spatial-resolution survey for binary stars
          in  the periphery of the Orion Nebula Cluster, at 5 - 15 arcmin
          (0.65  -  2  pc) from the cluster center. We observed 228 stars
          with  adaptive  optics  systems, in order to find companions at
          separations of 0.13" - 1.12" (60 - 500 AU), and detected 13 new
          binaries.  Combined  with the results of Petr (1998), we have a
          sample of 275 objects, about half of which have masses from the
          literature  and  high  probabilities  to be cluster members. We
          used  an  improved  method to derive the completeness limits of
          the  observations, which takes into account the elongated point
          spread function of stars at relatively large distances from the
          adaptive  optics  guide  star.  The  multiplicity of stars with
          masses  >2  M_sun is found to be significantly larger than that
          of  low-mass  stars.  The  companion star frequency of low-mass
          stars  is  comparable  to  that of main-sequence M-dwarfs, less
          than  half that of solar-type main-sequence stars, and 3.5 to 5
          times  lower  than  in the Taurus-Auriga and Scorpius-Centaurus
          star-forming  regions. We find the binary frequency of low-mass
          stars  in  the  periphery of the cluster to be the same or only
          slightly  higher  than for stars in the cluster core (<3 arcmin
          from theta1C Ori). This is in contrast to the prediction of the
          theory  that  the low binary frequency in the cluster is caused
          by  the  disruption  of binaries due to dynamical interactions.
          There  are  two  ways  out  of this dilemma: Either the initial
          binary  frequency in the Orion Nebula Cluster was lower than in
          Taurus-Auriga,  or the Orion Nebula Cluster was originally much
          denser and dynamically more active.

          A  new  6-cm  survey of almost 0.6 square degrees to a limit of
          0.55-mJy/beam  (10-sigma) finds 37 isolated radio sources and 7
          radio  source pairs (not necessarily physical companions). IRAC
          counterparts  are  identified  for  at  least  92% of the radio
          sources  within  the area of deep IRAC coverage, which includes
          31  isolated  sources  and  6  pairs.  This  contrasts  with an
          identification  rate of <74% to R<23.95 in visible light. Eight
          of   the   IRAC   galaxies   have  power  law  spectral  energy
          distributions,  implying  that  the mid-infrared emission comes
          from  a  powerful  AGN.  The  remaining  26  IRAC galaxies show
          stellar emission in the mid-infrared, probably in most of these
          galaxies  because  the  stellar  emission  is  bright enough to
          outshine  an  underlying  AGN. The infrared colors suggest that
          the  majority  of  these  galaxies are bulge-dominated and have
          redshifts  between  approximately  0.5 and 1.0. Visible spectra
          from  the DEEP2 redshift survey, available for 11 galaxies, are
          consistent  with  this  suggestion. The IRAC galaxies fall into
          two  distinct  groups  in  a color-magnitude diagram, one group
          (the "stripe") includes all the AGN. The other group (the "blue
          clump")  has blue 3.6 to 8 micron colors and a small range of 8
          micron   magnitudes.   This  separation  should  be  useful  in
          classifying galaxies found in other radio surveys.

          Comments: ApJ, accepted for publication. 17 pages, 11 figures
          We  compute  the  type  Ia, Ib/c and II supernova (SN) rates as
          functions   of  the  cosmic  time  for  galaxies  of  different
          morphological  types.  We use four different chemical evolution
          models,  each  one  reproducing  the  features  of a particular
          morphological  type:  E/S0,  S0a/b,  Sbc/d and Irr galaxies. We
          essentially describe the Hubble sequence by means of decreasing
          efficiency  of  star formation and increasing infall timescale.
          These  models  are  used to study the evolution of the SN rates
          per  unit  luminosity  and per unit mass as functions of cosmic
          time  and as functions of the Hubble type. Our results indicate
          that:  (i)  the  observed  increase  of  the  SN  rate per unit
          luminosity  and  unit  mass  from early to late galaxy types is
          accounted  for by our models. Our explanation of this effect is
          related  to  the  fact  that  the  latest Hubble types have the
          highest  star  formation rate per unit mass; (ii) By adopting a
          Scalo  (1986)  initial  mass  function in spiral disks, we find
          that  massive  single  stars  ending  their lives as Wolf-Rayet
          objects  are  not  sufficient  to account for the observed type
          Ib/c  SN rate per unit mass. Less massive stars in close binary
          systems  can  give  instead  a  significant contribution to the
          local  Ib/c SN rates. On the other hand, with the assumption of
          a  Salpeter  (1955) IMF for all galaxy types, single massive WR
          stars  are  sufficient to account for the observed type Ib/c SN
          rate.  (iii) Our models allow us to reproduce the observed type
          Ia SN rate density up to redshift z~1. We predict an increasing
          type  Ia  SN  rate  density  with  redshift, reaching a peak at
          redshift  z  >=  3,  because  of  the  contribution  of massive
          spheroids.

          Title:  Probing  the Evolution of IR Properties of z~6 Quasars:

          We  present  Spitzer observations of thirteen z~6 quasars using
          the   Infrared   Array  Camera  (IRAC)  and  Multiband  Imaging
          Photometer  for  Spitzer  (MIPS).  All  the quasars except SDSS
          J000552.34-000655.8  (SDSS  J0005-0006) were detected with high
          S/N  in  the  four  IRAC channels and the MIPS 24um band, while
          SDSS J0005-0006 was marginally detected in the IRAC 8.0um band,
          and  not  detected  in the MIPS 24um band. We find that most of
          these   quasars  have  prominent  emission  from  hot  dust  as
          evidenced  by  the  observed 24um fluxes. Their spectral energy
          distributions  (SEDs)  are  similar  to  those  of low-redshift
          quasars  at  rest-frame  0.15-3.5 um, suggesting that accretion
          disks  and  hot-dust  structures for these sources already have
          reached  maturity.  However, SDSS J0005-0006 has an unusual SED
          that  lies  significantly  below  low-redshift SED templates at
          rest-frame  1 and 3.5 um, and thus shows a strong near-IR (NIR)
          deficit and no hot-dust emission. Type I quasars with extremely
          small  NIR-to-optical  flux ratios like SDSS J0005-0006 are not
          found  in  low-redshift  quasar  samples,  indicating that SDSS
          J0005-0006  has  different dust properties at high redshift. We
          combine   the  Spitzer  observations  with  X-ray,  UV/optical,
          mm/submm   and   radio  observations  to  determine  bolometric
          luminosities for all the quasars. We find that the four quasars
          with central black-hole mass measurements have Eddington ratios
          of order unity.

          Title:   The   globular  cluster  mass/low  mass  X-ray  binary
          correlation:implications  for  kick velocity distributions from
          supernovae
          Authors:  M.  Smits  (Amsterdam), T.J. Maccarone (Southampton &
          Amsterdam), A. Kundu, S.E. Zepf (Michigan State)
          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted to A&A
          Optical  and X-ray studies of six nearby galaxies show that the
          probability  a  globular  cluster  will  be  an X-ray source is
          consistent  with  being  linearly  proportional to its mass. We
          show  that this result is consistent with some recent estimates
          of  the  velocity kick distributions for isolated radio pulsars
          --  those which are the sum of two Maxwellians, with the slower
          distribution at about 100 km/sec -- so long as a large fraction
          of  the  retained  binaries  are  in  binary systems with other
          massive stars. We confirm that over a large sample of galaxies,
          metallicity  is  clearly  a  factor  in  determining  whether a
          globular  cluster will contain an X-ray binary, and we estimate
          the  transformations  between color and metallicity for a large
          number  of  optical  filter combinations. We also show that the
          core  interaction  rate is roughly linearly proportional to the
          stellar  mass  of a globular cluster for the Milky Way when one
          bins the clusters by mass.

          We   have  used  the  Very  Large  Telescope  (VLT)  to  obtain
          spectropolarimetry   of   the  radio-loud,  double-lobed  broad
          absorption  line  (BAL)  quasar  PKS 0040-005. We find that the
          optical continuum of PKS 0040-005 is intrinsically polarized at
          0.7%  with an electric vector position angle nearly parallel to
          that  of  the  large-scale radio axis. This result is naturally
          explained in terms of an equatorial scattering region seen at a
          small  inclination, building a strong case that the BAL outflow
          is  not  equatorial.  In  conjunction with other recent results
          concerning   radio-loud   BAL   quasars,   the  era  of  simply
          characterizing these sources as ``edge-on'' is over.

          Title: Eclipsing Binary Stars in Open Clusters
          Authors: John Southworth, J V Clausen
          Comments:  6  pages,  4  figures, proceedings of the conference
          Close  Binaries in the 21st Century (Syros, Greece, June 2005),
          to appear in Ap+SS
          The  study  of detached eclipsing binaries in open clusters can
          provide  stringent  tests  of  theoretical stellar evolutionary
          models,  which  must  simultaneously fit the masses, radii, and
          luminosities   of   the   eclipsing  stars  and  the  radiative
          properties of every other star in the cluster. We review recent
          progress  in such studies and discuss two unusually interesting
          objects  currently  under  analysis. GV Carinae is an A0m + A8m
          binary  in  the  Southern  open  cluster  NGC 3532; its eclipse
          depths   have  changed  by  0.1  mag  between  1990  and  2001,
          suggesting  that  its  orbit is being perturbed by a relatively
          close third body. DW Carinae is a high-mass unevolved B1V + B1V
          binary  in  the  very  young  open  cluster  Collinder 228, and
          displays  double-peaked  emission  in  the centre of the Halpha
          line  which  is  characteristic  of  Be  stars.  We conclude by
          pointing  out  that  the great promise of eclipsing binaries in
          open  clusters can only be satisfied when both the binaries and
          their  parent  clusters are well-observed, a situation which is
          less common than we would like.

          Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters
          The  goal of this study is to obtain accurate estimates for the
          individual  masses of the components of the tight binary system
          T  Tau S in order to settle the ongoing debate on the nature of
          T  Tau Sa, a so-called infrared companion. We take advantage of
          the  fact  that  T Tau S belongs to a triple system composed of
          two hierarchical orbits to simultaneously analyze the motion of
          T  Tau Sb in the rest frames of T Tau Sa and T Tau N. With this
          method,  it  is possible to pinpoint the location of the center
          of mass of T Tau S and, thereby, to determine individual masses
          for  T  Tau  Sa and T Tau Sb with no prior assumption about the
          mass/flux  ratio  of the system. This improvement over previous
          studies  of  the  system  results in much better constraints on
          orbital  parameters.  We  find individual masses of 2.73+/-0.31
          Msun  for  T  Tau  Sa  and of 0.61+/-0.17 Msun for T Tau Sb (in
          agreement  with  its  early-M  spectral  type),  including  the
          uncertainty  on the distance to the system. These are among the
          most  precise  estimates  of  the mass of any Pre-Main Sequence
          star,  a  remarkable  result  since this is the first system in
          which individual masses of T Tauri stars can be determined from
          astrometry  only. This model-independent analysis confirms that
          T  Tau Sa is an intermediate-mass star, presumably a very young
          Herbig Ae star, that may possess an almost edge-on disk.

          Title:  A Comparison of Ultraluminous X-ray Sources in NGC 1399
          and the Antennae Galaxies (NGC 4038/4039)
          Authors: Hua Feng, Philip Kaaret (Univ. of Iowa)
          Comments: 10 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          The  temporal  and  spectral  properties of ultraluminous X-ray
          sources  (ULXs,  L>2x10^39  ergs/s)  and  bright  X-ray sources
          (L>3x10^38  ergs/s)  are examined and compared in two extremely
          different host environments: the old elliptical galaxy NGC 1399
          and  the  young, starforming Antennae galaxies (NGC 4038/4039).
          ULXs  in  NGC  1399  show  little variability on either long or
          short time scales. Only 1 of 8 ULXs and 10 of 63 bright sources
          in  NGC 1399 are variable at a confidence level of 90%. On long
          timescales,  the  NGC  1399  sources  are  steadier  than  most
          Galactic   black  hole  X-ray  binaries,  but  similar  to  GRS
          1915+105.  The  outburst  duration  of  the NGC 1399 sources is
          about  20  yrs,  again,  similar  to  that of GRS 1915+105. The
          bright  X-ray  sources  in  NGC  1399  may  be black hole X-ray
          binaries  with  giant  star companions similar to GRS 1915+105.
          The  brightest  ULX  (PSX-1)  in  NGC 1399 is coincident with a
          globular  cluster,  shows  a  hard spectrum with a photon index
          around 1.5, and has a nearly constant luminosity around 5x10^39
          erg/s.  It  may  be an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in a
          hard  spectral  state. In contrast to NGC 1399, the ULXs in the
          Antennae  are  all  variable and a large fraction of the bright
          sources  (9  of  15)  are  also  variable.  The variability and
          luminosity  of ULXs in the Antennae suggest they are black hole
          high  mass  X-ray binaries accreting via Roche-lobe overflow. A
          flare  with  a  duration  of  about 5 ks is found from Antennae
          X-42.  The  most  luminous ULX, X-16, with a very hard spectrum
          (Gamma=1.0~1.3)  and  a  luminosity which varies by a factor of
          10, could be an IMBH candidate.

          Title: Collapsars in Three Dimensions
          Authors: Gabriel Rockefeller, Christopher L. Fryer, Hui Li
          Comments: 27 pages, 15 figures; submitted to ApJ
          We  present  the  results  of  3-dimensional simulations of the
          direct  collapse  to a black hole of a rotating, 60-solar-mass,
          zero metallicity, population III star. Because the structure of
          this  star (angular momentum, density and temperature profiles)
          is similar to many collapsar gamma-ray burst progenitors, these
          calculations  have  implications  beyond the fate of population
          III stars. These simulations provide a first 3-dimensional look
          at  a  realistic collapsar progenitor, and the results are very
          different  from any previous 2-dimensional calculations. If the
          angular  momentum  of  the progenitor is high, non-axisymmetric
          instabilities in the collapsing core cause spiral structures to
          form, and these structures shape later outflows. These outflows
          are  driven  by  the  imbalance  between  viscous  heating  and
          inefficient neutrino cooling and ultimately develop into a 1e52
          erg  explosion. Without magnetic fields, this collapse will not
          produce  relativistic  jets,  but  the  explosion  is  indeed a
          hypernova. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of
          such  calculations on the explosions, nucleosynthesis, neutrino
          flux  and  gravitational  wave  emission  from  the collapse of
          massive stars.

          Title: Measuring M dwarf Winds with DAZ White Dwarfs
          Authors: J.H. Debes
          Comments: 18 pages, 3 figures, accepted to ApJ
          Hydrogen  atmosphere  white  dwarfs with metal lines, so-called
          DAZs,  show  evidence  for  ongoing  accretion of material onto
          their  surfaces. Some DAZs are known to have unresolved M dwarf
          companions,  which  could  account  for  the observed accretion
          through a stellar wind. I combine observed Ca abundances of the
          DAZs  with  information  on  the  orbital separation of their M
          dwarf companions to infer the mass loss rate of the M dwarfs. I
          find  that  for  three  of  the  six  known  DAZs  with M dwarf
          companions,  a  stellar wind can plausibly explain the observed
          accretion on the white dwarfs assuming Bondi-Hoyle accretion of
          solar    abundance    stellar    winds    on   the   order   of
          10$^{-14}-10^{-16}\Msun$ yr$^{-1}$. The rest of the sample have
          companions  with  orbits $\gtorder$ 1~AU, and require companion
          mass loss rates of $> 10^{-11}\Msun$ yr$^{-1}$. I conclude that
          there  must  be  an  alternative  explanation  for accretion of
          material  onto  DAZs  with  widely  separated  companions.  The
          inferred  winds  for  two  of  the close binaries are orders of
          magnitude  smaller  than  typically  assumed  for  the  angular
          momentum  loss  of  red dwarf-white dwarf pairs due to magnetic
          braking   from   a   stellar  wind  and  may  seriously  affect
          predictions  for  the  formation  rate  of  CVs  with  low mass
          companions.

          We  present mid-infrared spectra of T Tauri stars in the Taurus
          star-forming   region   obtained   with  the  Spitzer  Infrared
          Spectrograph (IRS). For the first time, the 5-36 micron spectra
          of  a  large  sample  of  T  Tauri  stars belonging to the same
          star-forming  region  is  studied,  revealing  details  of  the
          mid-infrared  excess  due  to  dust  in circumstellar disks. We
          analyze  common  features and differences in the mid-IR spectra
          based  on  disk  structure,  dust  grain  properties,  and  the
          presence  of  companions.  Our  analysis  encompasses  spectral
          energy  distributions  from  the optical to the far-infrared, a
          morphological  sequence  based on the IRS spectra, and spectral
          indices in IRS wave bands representative of continuum emission.
          By  comparing  the observed spectra to a grid of accretion disk
          models, we infer some basic disk properties for our sample of T
          Tauri stars, and find additional evidence for dust settling.

          Title:   Efficiency  of  proton-driven  Weibel  instability  at
          thermalizing initially two-temperature astrophysical plasmas
          Authors: Chuang Ren, Eric G. Blackman, Wen-fai Fong
          Comments:  13 pages, including 3 figs., Submitted to Physics of
          Plasmas
          Whether    a    faster-than-Coulomb   collisionless   mechanism
          equilibrates  ion-electron  plasmas  with  ions  initially much
          hotter  than electrons is a fundamental plasma physics question
          and  important  for under standing low-luminosity astrophysical
          accretion  flows.  Here  we  study whether Weibel instabilities
          driven   by   proton  temperature  anisotropy  produce  such  a
          mechanism.
          From  theory  and  particle-in-cell  simulations,  we find that
          although  the Weibel instability amplifies magnetic fields much
          faster  than  the ion-electron collision rate, the ratio of the
          saturated  ma gnetic energy to the initial ion energy scales as
          the  fourth  power  of  the  electr on to ion mass ratio for an
          initially   unmagnetized  plasma.  The  energy  transferred  to
          electrons is of order the saturated magnetic energy, and so the
          instability  cannot  induce  a faster-than-Coulomb electron-ion
          equilibration. However, we suggest why the same instability for
          an  initially  modestly  magnetized  plasma  would provide more
          efficient equilibration.

          being   superAlfvenic   at   large   scales.   Magnetic  fields
          substantially  modify the turbulent cascade when the turbulence
          reaches  the scales at which the fluctuation velocity gets less
          than  the  Alfven  velocity.  At those scales it is possible to
          consider  three  cascades,  of fast, slow and Alfven modes with
          little energy exchange between them. As Alfvenic and slow modes
          are  anisotropic  they marginally scatter and accelerate cosmic
          rays,  while fast modes dominate the processes. However, in the
          presence  of  cosmic  rays the turbulence is modified as cosmic
          rays transfer the energy of compressible motions (i.e. slow and
          fast modes) from large scales to the scale of cosmic ray Larmor
          radius.  This  results  in  generation  of  a  new  small-scale
          Alfvenic  component  which  is  not  a part of the ordinary MHD
          cascade.  This  component  does  scatter  and accelerate cosmic
          rays.  In  addition,  magnetic reconnection in turbulent medium
          accelerates  cosmic  rays.  The  complexity of the intracluster
          turbulence  calls  for  observational  studies. A new technique
          Velocity  Coordinate  Spectrum  (VCS) is particularly promising
          for  studies  of velocity fluctuations with a new generation of
          X-ray observatories.

          We  present new Near-Infrared (J,K) magnitudes for 114 RR Lyrae
          stars  in  the  globular  cluster Omega Cen (NGC 5139) which we
          combine  with data from the literature to construct a sample of
          180  RR  Lyrae  stars  with J and K mean magnitudes on a common
          photometric  system.  This is presently the largest such sample
          in  any stellar system. We also present updated predictions for
          J,K-band  Period-Luminosity  relations for both fundamental and
          first-overtone  RR  Lyrae  stars, based on synthetic horizontal
          branch  models  with  metal  abundance ranging from Z=0.0001 to
          Z=0.004.  By adopting for the Omega Cen variables with measured
          metal  abundances an alpha-element enhancement of a factor of 3
          (about  0.5  dex)  with respect to iron we find a true distance
          modulus  of 13.70 (with a random error of 0.06 and a systematic
          error  of  0.06),  corresponding  to a distance d=5.5 Kpc (with
          both  random  and  systematic  errors  equal  to 0.03 Kpc). Our
          estimate  is  in excellent agreement with the distance inferred
          for  the  eclipsing  binary OGLEGC-17, but differ significantly
          from  the  recent  distance estimates based on cluster dynamics
          and on high amplitude Delta Scuti stars.

          Title: The Infrared Emission from the Narrow Line Region
          Authors: Brent Groves (1), Michael Dopita (2), Ralph Sutherland

          We  present models for the mid- and far- infrared emission from
          the  Narrow  Line Region (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
          Using  the  MAPPINGS  III code we explore the effect of typical
          NLR  parameters  on  the  spectral  characteristics  of  the IR
          emission.   These   include   useful  IR  emission  line  ratio
          diagnostic  diagrams for the determination of these parameters,
          as  well  as  Star  formation--AGN  mixing diagnostics. We also
          examine  emission  line  to  continuum correlations which would
          assist  in separating the IR emission arising from the NLR from
          that coming from the inner torus. We find for AGN like NGC 1068
          and  NGC  4151  that the NLR only contributes ~10% to the total
          IRAS  25  mum  flux,  and that other components such as a dusty
          torus are necessary to explain the total AGN IR emission.

          We  discuss spectroscopy and infrared photometry for a complete
          sample  of  ~  800 galaxies in close pairs objectively selected
          from  the  CfA2  redshift  survey. We use 2MASS to compare near
          infrared  color-color  diagrams  for our sample with the Nearby
          Field  Galaxy  Sample and with a set of IRAS flux-limited pairs
          from  Surace  et  al. We construct a basic statistical model to
          explore  the  physical  sources  of the substantial differences
          among  these  samples.  The  model  explains the spread of near
          infrared  colors and is consistent with a picture where central
          star  formation  is  triggered by the galaxy-galaxy interaction
          before  a  merger  occurs. For 160 galaxies we report new, deep
          JHK photometry within our spectroscopic aperture and we use the
          combined  spectroscopic  and  photometric  data  to explore the
          physical  conditions  in  the  central bursts. We find a set of
          objects  with  H-K  >=  0.45  and  with a large F(FIR)/F(H). We
          interpret  the  very  red H-K colors as evidence for 600-1000 K
          dust  within  compact  star-forming regions, perhaps similar to
          super-star   clusters  identified  in  individual  well-studied
          interacting  galaxies. The galaxies in our sample are candidate
          ``hidden'' bursts or, possibly, ``hidden'' AGN. Over the entire
          pair  sample, both spectroscopic and photometric data show that
          the  specific  star formation rate decreases with the projected
          separation of the pair. The data suggest that the near infrared
          color-color  diagram  is  also  a  function  of  the  projected
          separation;  all  of  the  objects  with  central near infrared
          colors  indicative  of  bursts  of  star formation lie at small
          projected separation.

          We  build,  as far as theory will permit, self consistent model
          HII  regions  around  central  clusters  of  aging stars. These
          produce  strong  emission line diagnostics applicable to either
          individual  HII  regions  in  galaxies,  or  to  the integrated
          emission line spectra of disk or starburst galaxies. The models
          assume  that  the expansion and internal pressure of individual
          HII  regions  is  driven  by the net input of mechanical energy
          from  the  central  cluster,  be  it through winds or supernova
          events.  This  eliminates  the  ionization  parameter as a free
          variable,  replacing  it  with a parameter which depends on the
          ratio  of  the  cluster mass to the pressure in the surrounding
          interstellar  medium. These models explain why HII regions with
          low  abundances  have  high excitation, and demonstrate that at
          least  part  of  the  warm  ionized  medium  is  the  result of
          overlapping faint, old, large, and low pressure HII regions. We
          present  line ratios (at both optical and IR wavelengths) which
          provide  reliable  abundance  diagnostics  for  both single HII
          regions  or for integrated galaxy spectra, and we find a number
          that  can be used to estimate the mean age of the cluster stars
          exciting individual HII regions.

          In the framework of the study of the X-ray and optical emission
          in supernova remnants we focus on an isolated X-ray knot in the
          northern  rim of the Vela SNR (Vela FilD), whose X-ray emission
          has   been  studied  and  discussed  in  Paper  I.  We  aim  at
          understanding  the  physical  origin  of  the X-ray and optical
          emission  in  FilD,  at understanding the role of the different
          physical  processes  at  work,  and  at obtaining a key for the
          interpretation  of  future  X-ray observations of SNRs. To this
          end  we  have  pursued  an accurate ``forward'' modeling of the
          interaction of the Vela SNR shock with an ISM cloud. We perform
          hydrodynamic   simulations   and   we   directly   compare  the
          observables  synthesized from the simulations with the data. We
          explore four different model setups, choosing the values of the
          physical parameters on the basis of our preliminary analysis of
          the  X-ray  data. We synthesize X-ray emission maps and spectra
          filtered through the XMM-Newton EPIC-MOS instrumental response.
          The  impact  of  a  shock  front  at  6  million  Kelvin  on an
          elliptical  cloud  30  times  denser  than  the  ambient medium
          describes  well  the  shock-cloud  interaction processes in the
          Vela FilD region in terms of spectral properties and morphology
          of  the  X-ray  and  optical  emission.  The  bulk of the X-ray
          emission  in  the  FilD  knot  originates in the cloud material
          heated  by  the  transmitted shock front, but significant X-ray
          emission  is  also  associated  to  the  cloud  material, which
          evaporates,   as  an  effect  of  thermal  conduction,  in  the
          intercloud  medium.  The  physical  origin  of the FilD optical
          emission  is  associated  to thermal instabilities. In the FilD
          knot the X-ray emission associated to the reflected shock front
          is negligible.

          Title:  Spectral  State  Transitions of the Ultraluminous X-ray
          Sources X-1 and X-2 in NGC 1313
          Authors: Hua Feng, Philip Kaaret (Univ. of Iowa)
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJL on May 26th
          X-ray  spectral  state transitions are a key signature of black
          hole  X-ray  binaries  and  follow  a  well-defined pattern. We
          examined 12 XMM-Newton observations of the nearby spiral galaxy
          NGC 1313, which harbors two compact ultraluminous X-ray sources
          (ULXs),  X-1  and  X-2,  in  order  to  determine  if the state
          transitions  in ULXs follow the same pattern. For both sources,
          the  spectra  were  adequately  fitted by an absorbed power-law
          with  the  addition  of a low temperature (kT=0.1~0.3 keV) disk
          blackbody  component  required  in 6 of the 12 observations. As
          the  X-ray  luminosity of X-1 increases to a maximum at 3x10^40
          ergs/s,  the  power-law  photon  index softens to 2.5-3.0. This
          behavior is similar to the canonical spectral state transitions
          in  Galactic  black  hole binaries, but the source never enters
          the  high/soft or thermal dominant state and instead enters the
          steep  power-law  state  at  high  luminosities.  X-2  has  the
          opposite  behavior  and appears to be in the hard state, with a
          photon  index  of  Gamma=1.7-2.0  at  high  luminosity, but can
          soften to Gamma=2.5 at the lower luminosities.

          Neutron Stars at High Accretion Rates
          Authors: Randall L. Cooper, Ramesh Narayan (Harvard/CfA)
          Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure, accepted by ApJL
          We  investigate  the  effect  of  the  hot  CNO  cycle breakout
          reaction 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne on the occurrence of type I X-ray
          bursts  on accreting neutron stars. For f_rp <~ 0.1, where f_rp
          is   a   dimensionless   factor   by   which  we  multiply  the
          15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne reaction rate of Caughlan & Fowler (1988),
          our  model predicts that bursts should occur only for accretion
          rates  below  a  critical  value of approximately 0.3 times the
          Eddington  limit.  This  agrees  with  observations. For larger
          values  of  f_rp,  including  the standard choice f_rp = 1, the
          model  switches  to  a new regime in which bursts occur all the
          way  up to roughly the Eddington limit. Since the latter regime
          disagrees   with   observations,   we  suggest  that  the  true
          15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne   reaction  rate  is  lower  than  usually
          assumed.

          Title: Stellar Encounters with Massive Star-Disk Systems
          Authors: Nickolas Moeckel, John Bally
          Comments: 11 pages, 10 figures, accepted to ApJ
          The  dense,  clustered  environment in which massive stars form
          can  lead  to  interactions with neighboring stars. It has been
          hypothesized  that collisions and mergers may contribute to the
          growth  of  the most massive stars. In this paper we extend the
          study of star-disk interactions to explore encounters between a
          massive  protostar and a less massive cluster sibling using the
          publicly  available  SPH code GADGET-2. Collisions do not occur
          in  the  parameter  space  studied,  but  the end state of many
          encounters  is an eccentric binary with a semi-major axis ~ 100
          AU.  Disk  material is sometimes captured by the impactor. Most
          encounters  result in disruption and destruction of the initial
          disk,  and  periodic  torquing of the remnant disk. We consider
          the  effect  of  the  changing  orientation  of  the disk on an
          accretion  driven  jet, and the evolution of the systems in the
          presence of on-going accretion from the parent core.

          Lyman-alpha line profile morphologies
          Authors:  Anne  Verhamme  (geneva obs), Daniel Schaerer (geneva

          Comments: 20 pages, 20 figures, accepted to A&A
          Using   a  Monte  Carlo  technique,  we  have  developed  a  3D
          lyman-alpha  radiation  transfer  code  allowing for prescribed
          arbitrary hydrogen density, ionisation, temperature structures,
          and  dust  distribution,  and  arbitrary velocity fields and UV
          photon sources.
          We  have  examined  the lyman-alpha line profiles predicted for
          several  simple geometrical configurations and their dependence
          on  the  main  input parameters. Overall, we find line profiles
          reaching  from  doubly  peaked  symmetric emission to symmetric
          Voigt  (absorption)  in  static  configurations with increasing
          dust content, and asymmetric red-(blue-) shifted emission lines
          with  a  blue  (red)  counterpart  ranging  from  absorption to
          emission (with increasing line/continuum strength) in expanding
          (infalling) media.
          The following results are of interest for the interpretation of
          lya  profiles  from  galaxies.  1/ Standard lya absorption line
          fitting   of   global  spectra  of  galaxies  may  lead  to  an
          underestimate  of  the  true hydrogen column density in certain
          geometrical  conditions.  2/ Normal (inverted) P-Cygni like lya
          profiles  can  be  obtained in expanding (infalling) media from
          objects  without  any  intrinsic  lya  emission,  as  a natural
          consequence of radiation transfer effects. 3/ The formation and
          the  detailed  shape  of  lya profiles resulting from expanding
          shells  has  been  thoroughly  revised:  for sufficiently large
          column densities, the position of the main lya emission peak is
          redshifted by twice the expansion velocity.This is in excellent
          agreement  with  the  observations  of  z~3  LBGs. This finding
          indicates   also  that  large  scale,  fairly  symmetric  shell
          structures  must  be  a  good  description  for the outflows in
          LBGs.(shortened abstract)

          investigate  the  birth of high-mass stars and the initial mass
          function.  Deep  JHKL  imaging and K-band spectroscopy from the
          VLT  of 201 stars toward the cluster is presented. The majority
          of  104 stars show the CO band-head in absorption. Half of them
          emit  X-rays  and/or  have  infrared excess, indicative of very
          young objects. Their intrinsic IR luminosity is compatible with
          intermediate   and  high-mass  pre-main  sequence  stars.  Nine
          additional  stars  have the CO feature in emission, while sixty
          sources are lacking any stellar spectral feature due to veiling
          by circumstellar dust. We suggest that CO absorption is - as in
          the  case  of low-mass stars - also a common feature during the
          early evolution of stars with higher masses. According to model
          calculations  the  observed CO absorption is most likely a sign
          of heavily accreting protostars with mass accretion rates above
          10^-5 solar masses/yr.

          Title:  X-ray  Spectral  Variations of U Gem from Quiescence to
          Outburst
          Authors: T. Guver, C. Uluyazi, M.T. Ozkan, E. Gogus
          Comments: accepted by MNRAS
          In  this  paper  we  report  the  discovery  of  a  high energy
          component  of the X-ray spectra of U Gem, which can be observed
          while the source is in outburst. We used Chandra and XMM-Newton
          observations  to  compare  the  quiescence  and  outburst X-ray
          spectra  of  the  source.  The  additional component may be the
          result  of  the  reflection of X-rays emitted from an optically
          thin  plasma close to the white dwarf, from the optically thick
          boundary   layer   during   the   outburst.   Another  possible
          explanation  is  that some magnetically channeled accretion may
          occur  onto  the  equatorial belt of the primary causing shocks
          similar  to  the  ones  in  the  intermediate  polars as it was
          suggested  by  \citep{w2002}.  We  have  also  found  a  timing
          structure   at  about  73  mHz  ($\sim$13.7  s.)  in  the  RXTE
          observation, resembling dwarf novae oscillations (DNOs).

          Title:  The  Spiral  Host  Galaxy  of  the  Double Radio Source

          Chandra grant GO4-5118X
          We  present  new  Hubble, Gemini-S, and Chandra observations of
          the  radio galaxy 0313-192, which hosts a 350-kpc double source
          and jets, even though previous data have suggested that it is a
          spiral  galaxy.  We  measure  the  bulge  scale and luminosity,
          radial  and  vertical  profiles of disk starlight, and consider
          the  distributions  of H II regions and absorbing dust. In each
          case,  the  HST  data  confirm its classification as an edge-on
          spiral  galaxy,  the  only such system known to produce such an
          extended  radio  source of this kind. The Gemini near-IR images
          and  Chandra  spectral  fit  reveal a strongly obscured central
          AGN,  seen  through  the entire ISM path length of the disk and
          showing  X-ray  evidence  of additional absorption from warm or
          dense material close to the central object. We consider several
          possible  mechanisms  for  producing such a rare combination of
          AGN  and  host  properties, some combination of which may be at
          work.  These  include an unusually luminous bulge (suggesting a
          black  hole  of mass 0.5-0.9 billion solar masses), orientation
          of  the  jets  near  the  pole  of  the gas-rich disk, and some
          evidence  of  a weak gravitational interaction which has warped
          the  disk  and  could  have  enhanced  fuelling  of the central
          engine.  An X-ray counterpart of the kiloparsec-scale radio jet
          emerges  to  the south; jet/counterjet limits in both radio and
          X-ray  allow  them to be symmetric if seen more than 15 degrees
          from  the  plane of the sky, still consistent with the jet axes
          being  within  ~30  degrees of the poles of the gas-rich galaxy
          disk.  A  linear  or  disklike  emission-line structure is seen
          around  thenucleus, inclined by ~20 degrees to the stellar disk
          but  nearly  perpendicular  to the jets; this may represent the
          aftermath  of  a galaxy encounter, where gas is photoionized by
          the nuclear continuum.

          Journal
          We  report  the discovery with the RXTE/PCA of twin kHz QPOs in
          Cir  X-1.  Eleven  cases  of simultaneous double QPOs occurred,
          with  significances  of  up  to  6.3 and 5.5 sigma and centroid
          frequencies ranging between approximately 56-225 and 230-500 Hz
          for the two QPO peaks, respectively, i.e., for the most part at
          frequencies   well  below  those  of  other  sources.  The  QPO
          properties clearly indicate that these double peaks are the kHz
          QPOs  known  from  low  magnetic  field  neutron stars, and not
          black-hole  high-frequency  QPOs,  confirming that Cir X-1 is a
          neutron  star.  The  kHz QPO peak separation varies over a wide
          range,  ~175-340  Hz, and increases with QPO frequency. This is
          contrary  to  what  is  seen  in  other sources but agrees with
          predictions  of  the  relativistic  precession model and Alfven
          wave  models;  beat-frequency  models  require  modification to
          accommodate  this. In other observations single kHz QPOs can be
          seen  down to frequencies as low as ~12 Hz, as well as a strong
          low-frequency  (LF)  QPO  between  1  and  30 Hz. The relations
          between  the  frequencies of the kHz QPOs and the LF QPO are in
          good  agreement  with  those  found  previously  in  Z sources,
          confirming  that Cir X-1 may be a peculiar Z source. We suggest
          that  the  low  frequencies of the kHz QPOs in Cir X-1 and to a
          lesser extent in (other) Z sources might be due to a relatively
          stronger  radial  inflow  to the neutron star than in other kHz
          QPO sources.

          D-string in the theory.

          Title:  Noncommutative  $D_3$-brane,  Black Holes and Attractor
          Mechanism
          Authors: Supriya Kar, Sumit Majumdar
          Comments: 17 pages
          We  revisit  the 4D generalized black hole geometries, obtained
          by  us  [1], with a renewed interest, to unfold some aspects of
          effective  gravity  in  a noncommutative D3-brane formalism. In
          particular,  we  argue for the existence of extra dimensions in
          the  gravity  decoupling  limit in the theory. We show that the
          theory  is  rather  described  by  an  ordinary geometry and is
          governed  by  an  effective  string  theory in 5D. The extremal
          black hole geometry $AdS_5$ obtained in effective string theory
          is  shown  to  be  in  precise  agreement with the gravity dual
          proposed   for   D3-brane   in   a   constant  magnetic  field.
          Kaluza-Klein   compactification  is  performed  to  obtain  the
          corresponding    charged   black   hole   geometries   in   4D.
          Interestingly,  they  are  shown to be governed by the extremal
          black  hole  geometries  known  in string theory. The attractor
          mechanism  is exploited in effective string theory underlying a
          noncommutative  D3-brane  and  the  macroscopic  entropy  of  a
          charged  black  hole  is computed. We show that the generalized
          black  hole  geometries in a noncommutative D3-brane theory are
          precisely  identical  to  the  extremal black holes known in 4D
          effective string theory.

          Comments: 39 pages, 6 tables, 8 figures, accepted to ApJ
          We  describe  a  method  for  accurately  determining  M  dwarf
          metallicities   with  spectral  synthesis  based  on  abundance
          analyses  of  visual binary stars. We obtained high resolution,
          high  signal-to-noise  spectra of each component of five visual
          binary pairs at McDonald Observatory. The spectral types of the
          components  range from F7 to K3 V for the primaries and M0.5 to
          M3.5   V   for   the   secondaries.   We  have  determined  the
          metallicities  of  the primaries differentially with respect to
          the  Sun  by  fitting  synthetic  spectra to Fe \textsc{i} line
          profiles in the observed spectra. In the course of our analysis
          of   the   M   dwarf   secondaries  we  have  made  significant
          improvements to the PHOENIX cool-star model atmospheres and the
          spectrum   analysis  code  MOOG.  Our  analysis  yields  a  RMS
          deviation  of 0.11 dex in metallicity values between the binary
          pairs.  We  estimate  the  uncertainties in the derived stellar
          parameters  for  the  M  dwarfs to be 48 K, 0.10 dex, 0.12 dex,
          0.15  km  s$^{-1}$,  and  0.20 km s$^{-1}$ for {T}$_{eff}$, log
          \textsl{g},  [M/H],  $\xi$,  and  $\eta$ respectively. Accurate
          stellar  evolutionary  models are needed to progress further in
          the  analysis  of  cool-star spectra; the new model atmospheres
          warrant recalculation of the evolutionary models.

          Title:  2MASS  J05162881+2607387:  A  New Low-Mass Double-Lined
          Eclipsing Binary
          Authors:  Amanda  J.  Bayless, Jerome A. Orosz (San Diego State
          University)
          Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures (Figure 1 has degraded quality),
          to appear in ApJ
          We   show  that  the  star  known  as  2MASS  J05162881+2607387
          (hereafter  J0516)  is  a  double-lined  eclipsing  binary with
          nearly   identical   low-mass   components.  The  spectroscopic
          elements  derived  from  18  spectra  obtained  with  the  High
          Resolution  Spectrograph  on  the Hobby-Eberly Telescope during
          the  Fall of 2005 are K_1=88.45 +/- 0.48 km/s and K_2=90.43 +/-
          0.60  km/s,  resulting in a mass ratio of$q=K_1/K_2 = 0.978 +/-
          0.018  and minimum masses of M_1 sin^{3}i=0.775 +/- 0.016 solar
          masses   and   M_2   sin^{3}i=0.759  +/-  0.012  solar  masses,
          respectively.  We  have  extensive  differential  photometry of
          J0516  obtained  over several nights between 2004 January-March
          (epoch  1)  and  2004  October-2005  January  plus 2006 January
          (epoch   2)   using  the  1m  telescope  at  the  Mount  Laguna
          Observatory.  The  source  was  roughly 0.1 mag brighter in all
          three bandpasses during epoch 1 when compared to epoch 2. Also,
          phased   light   curves   from   epoch   1   show  considerable
          out-of-eclipse  variability,  presumably due to bright spots on
          one  or  both  stars. In contrast, the phased light curves from
          epoch  2  show  little  out-of-eclipse  variability.  The light
          curves  from  epoch  2  and  the  radial  velocity  curves were
          analyzed  using our ELC code with updated model atmospheres for
          low-mass  stars.  We  find  the  following: M_1=0.787 +/- 0.012
          solar  masses,  R_1=0.788  +/- 0.015 solar radii, M_2=0.770 +/-
          0.009  solar  masses,  and R_2=0.817 +/- 0.010 solar radii. The
          stars  in  J0516  have radii that are significantly larger than
          model  predictions for their masses, similar to what is seen in
          a handful of other well-studied low-mass double-lined eclipsing
          binaries. We compiled all recent mass and radius determinations
          from  low-mass  binaries and determine an empirical mass-radius
          relation  of  the  form R = 0.0324 + 0.9343M + 0.0374M^2, where
          the quantities are in solar units.

          Envelopes:   Different  Kinematics  between  Submillimeter  and
          Millimeter Lines
          Authors:  Shigehisa  Takakuwa,  Takeshi  Kamazaki, Masao Saito,
          Nobuyuki Yamaguchi, Kotaro Kohno
          Comments: 20 pages, 11 figures
          With  the  ASTE  telescope,  we have made observations of three
          low-mass  protostellar envelopes around L483, B335, and L723 in
          the  submillimeter  CS  ($J$=7--6) and HCN ($J$=4--3) lines. We
          detected  both the CS and HCN lines toward all the targets, and
          the  typical  CS  intensity  ($\sim$ 1.0 K in T$_{B}$) is twice
          higher  than that of the HCN line. Mapping observations of L483
          in  these  lines have shown that the submillimeter emissions in
          the  low-mass  protostellar  envelope  are  resolved, exhibit a
          western  extension  from  the  central  protostar, and that the
          deconvolved  size  is  $\sim$  5500 AU $\times$ 3700 AU (P.A. =
          78$^{\circ}$)   in   the   HCN  emission.  The  extent  of  the
          submillimeter   emissions  in  L483  implies  the  presence  of
          higher-temperature  ($\gtrsim$  40  K) gas at 4000 AU away from
          the  central  protostar,  which  suggests  that we need to take
          2-dimensional   radiative  transfer  models  with  a  flattened
          disklike  envelope  and  bipolar cavity into account to explain
          the  temperature  structure  inside  the  low-mass protostellar
          envelope. The position-velocity diagrams of these submillimeter
          lines  in  L483  and  B335 exhibit different velocity gradients
          from  those  found  in the previous millimeter observations. In
          particular,  along the axis of the associated molecular outflow
          the  sense of the velocity gradient traced by the submillimeter
          lines is opposite to that of the millimeter observations or the
          associated molecular outflow, both in L483 and B335. We suggest
          that  expanding  gas  motions  at  the surface of the flattened
          disklike  envelope  around  the  protostar, which is irradiated
          from  the central star directly, are the origin of the observed
          submillimeter velocity structure.

          is  currently  mapping  the Northern Galactic plane reaching to
          r'=20  mag  with typically 1" resolution. Hundreds of Planetary
          Nebulae (PNe), both point-like and resolved, are expected to be
          discovered. We report on the discovery of the first new PN from
          this  survey:  it  is  an  unusual  object  located  at a large
          galactocentric  distance  and  has a very low oxygen abundance.
          The  nebula  shows  an  intricate morphology: there is an inner
          ring  surrounding  the central star, bright inner lobes with an
          enhanced  waist,  and very faint lobular extensions reaching up
          to more than 100". We classify it as a quadrupolar PN, a rather
          unusual  class  of  planetary  showing  two pairs of misaligned
          lobes.   From   long-slit   spectroscopy   we   derive  Te[NII]
          =12800+-1000K,  Ne  =  390+-40  cm-3,  and  chemical abundances
          typical  of  Peimbert's  Type  I nebulae (He/H =0.13, N/O =1.8)
          with  an  oxygen  abundance  of  12  +  log(O/H)=8.17+-0.15.  A
          kinematic distance of 7.0 kpc is derived, implying an unusually
          large  size  of  >4  pc  for  the nebula. The photometry of the
          central  star  indicates  the  presence  of  a  relatively cool
          companion.  This,  and  the  evidence for a dense circumstellar
          disk  and  quadrupolar  morphology, all of which are rare among
          PNe,  support the hypothesis that this morphology is related to
          binary interaction.

          Title:  The  Unusual  Cataclysmic  Binary Star RBS 0490 and the
          Space Density of Cataclysmics
          Authors: John R. Thorstensen, Sebastien Lepine, Michael Shara

          Society of the Pacific, in press
          RBS  (Rosat  Bright Source) 0490 is a cataclysmic variable star
          (CV)  with unusually strong emission lines. The strength of the
          emission   lines  led  to  a  suggestion  that  the  object  is
          intrinsically faint and correspondingly nearby (approx. 33 pc),
          which, if true, would strongly affect estimates of the CV space
          density.  Here  we  report  astrometry,  filter photometry, and
          time-series  spectroscopy  of this object. The astrometry gives
          an  absolute  parallax  pi(abs) = 4.5 +- 1.5 mas and a relative
          proper  motion of 102 mas/yr. A Bayesian procedure gives a very
          uncertain  distance estimate of d approx. 300 pc, and the small
          parallax alone implies d > 133 pc (at two standard deviations).
          The  mean V magnitude is 17.4, which implies M_V = 10.9 - 5 log
          (d/200  pc),  neglecting  extinction.  At  200  pc,  the  space
          velocity  would  be  over  90 km/s with respect to the LSR. The
          time-series   spectroscopy   shows   a  possible  emission-line
          radial-velocity  period  near  46  min. This would be unusually
          short  for  an  orbital  period and it may represent some other
          clock in the system.

          From  high-resolution VLT/UVES spectra (R~43,000), we determine
          abundances or upper limits for Li, C, N, O, and other important
          elements,  as  well  as 12C/13C isotopic ratio for three Carbon
          enhanced metal poor stars. All three stars have -3.30 <= [Fe/H]
          <=  -2.85  and moderate to high CNO abundances. CS 22958-042 is
          one  of  the most carbon-rich CEMP stars known ([C/Fe] = +3.2),
          while  CS 29528-041 (one of the few N-enhanced metal-poor stars
          known) is one of the most nitrogen rich ([N/Fe] = +3.0). Oxygen
          is  very  high  in  CS  31080-095  ([O/Fe]  =  +2.35) and in CS
          22958-042  ([O/Fe]  = +1.35). All three stars exhibit [Sr/Fe] <
          0; Ba is not detected in CS 22958-042 ([Ba/Fe] < -0.53), but it
          is moderately enhanced ([Ba/Fe] ~ 1) in the other two stars. CS
          22958-042 displays one of the largest sodium overabundances yet
          found  in CEMP stars ([Na/Fe] = +2.8). CS 22958-042 has 12C/13C
          =  9,  similar  to  most  other  CEMP  stars  without  enhanced
          neutron-capture  elements, while 12C/13C <= 40 in CS 31080-095.
          CS 31080-095 and CS 29528-041 have A(Li) ~ 1.7, below the Spite
          Plateau, while Li is not detected in CS 22958-042. CS 22958-042
          is  a  CEMP-no  star,  but  the other two stars are in no known
          class  of  CEMP  star and thus either constitute a new class or
          are  a  link  between  the  CEMP-no  and CEMP-s classes, adding
          complexity  to  the  abundance  patterns  for  CEMP  stars.  We
          interpret  the  abundance  patterns  in our stars to imply that
          current  models for the presumed AGB binary progenitors lack an
          extra-mixing  process, similar to those apparently operating in
          RGB stars.

          We  describe  a  high-precision,  deep  (to V ~ 19-21) absolute
          proper-motion  survey  that  samples  ~50 lines of sight in the
          Kapteyn  Selected  Areas  along declination zones -15, 0 and 15
          degrees. In many fields the astrometric baseline reaches nearly
          a  century.  We demonstrate that these data provide typical per
          star precisions between ~ 1 and 3 mas/yr to the above magnitude
          limits,  with  the  absolute  reference  frame  established  by
          numerous  extragalactic  sources in each survey field. Combined
          with  existing  and  ongoing  photometric  and  radial velocity
          surveys  in  these  fields, these astrometric data will enable,
          among  other  things,  accurate, detailed dynamical modeling of
          satellite interactions with our Galaxy. In this contribution we
          describe   the   astrometric   part  of  our  survey  and  show
          preliminary  results along the trailing tail of the Sagittarius
          dwarf galaxy, and in the Monoceros ring region.

          We  compare  a  new R = 120,000 spectrum of PG1634+706 (z_QSO =
          1.337,m_V = 14.9) obtained with the HDS instrument on Subaru to
          a  R = 45, 000 spectrum obtained previously with HIRES/Keck. In
          the  strong  MgII  system at z = 0.9902 and the multiple cloud,
          weak  MgII  system  at  z  = 1.0414, we find that at the higher
          resolution,  additional  components  are  resolved in a blended
          profile. We find that two single-cloud weak MgII absorbers were
          already  resolved  at  R  = 45,000, to have b = 2 - 4 km/s. The
          narrowest  line that we measure in the R = 120, 000 spectrum is
          a   component   of  the  Galactic  NaI  absorption,  with  b  =
          0.90+/-0.20  km/s.  We discuss expectations of similarly narrow
          lines  in  various applications, including studies of DLAs, the
          MgI  phases of strong MgII absorbers, and high velocity clouds.
          By  applying  Voigt  profile  fitting  to  synthetic  lines, we
          compare  the consistency with which line profile parameters can
          be  accurately  recovered  at  R  =  45,000 and R = 120,000. We
          estimate  the  improvement  gained from superhigh resolution in
          resolving  narrowly separated velocity components in absorption
          profiles.  We also explore the influence of isotope line shifts
          and   hyperfine  splitting  in  measurements  of  line  profile
          parameters,  and  the  spectral  resolution  needed to identify
          these  effects. Super high resolution spectra of quasars, which
          will be routinely possible with 20-meter class telescopes, will
          lead to greater sensitivity for absorption line surveys, and to
          determination  of  more  accurate  physical conditions for cold
          phases of gas in various environments.

          Title:  Satellite  Accretion Onto Massive Galaxies With Central
          Black Holes
          Authors: Michael Boylan-Kolchin, Chung-Pei Ma (UC Berkeley)
          Comments: 17 pages, 13 figures; submitted to MNRAS
          Minor  mergers  of  galaxies  are  expected  to  be common in a
          hierarchical  cosmology  such  as  $\Lambda$CDM  and  have  the
          potential  to  significantly affect galactic structure. In this
          paper  we  dissect  the  case-by-case  outcome  from  a  set of
          numerical  simulations  of a single satellite elliptical galaxy
          accreting  onto  a  massive  elliptical galaxy. We take care to
          explore  cosmologically  relevant orbital parameters and to set
          up  realistic  initial  galaxy  models  that  include all three
          relevant  dynamical  components:  dark  matter  halos,  stellar
          bulges, and central massive black holes. The effects of several
          different  parameters  are considered, including orbital energy
          and  angular  momentum,  satellite  density  and  inner density
          profile,  satellite-to-host mass ratio, and presence of a black
          hole at the center of the host. Black holes play a crucial role
          in  protecting  the  shallow  stellar  cores  of  the hosts, as
          satellites  merging  onto  a host with a central black hole are
          more  strongly  disrupted than those merging onto hosts without
          black  holes.  Orbital  parameters  play  an  important role in
          determining  the degree of disruption: satellites on less bound
          or  more  eccentric orbits are more easily destroyed than those
          on  more  bound  or  more  circular  orbits  as  a result of an
          increased number of pericentric passages and greater cumulative
          effects  of  gravitational  shocking  and  tidal  stripping. In
          addition, satellites with densities typical of faint elliptical
          galaxies   are   disrupted   relatively  easily,  while  denser
          satellites  can  survive  much better in the tidal field of the
          host.  Over  the range of parameters explored, we find that the
          accretion of a single satellite elliptical galaxy can result in
          a  broad  variety  of  changes,  in  both signs, in the surface
          brightness  profile  and  color  of  the  central  part  of  an
          elliptical galaxy.

          Instability,  diskoseismology,  and  the  high-frequency QPO of
          microquasars
          Authors: Michel Tagger, Peggy Varniere
          Comments: To be published in Ap.J
          We  present  a  possible  explanation  for  the  high-frequency
          Quasi-Periodic   Oscillations   of   microquasars   by  an  MHD
          instability  that  combines the physics developed, in different
          contexts,   for   the   Accretion-Ejection   Instability,   the
          Rossby-Wave  Instability,  and the normal modes of diskoseismic
          models  (which  rely  on  the  properties  of  the relativistic
          rotation curve in the vicinity of the Marginally Stable Orbit).
          This  instability  can appear as modes of azimuthal wavenumbers
          m=2,  3,...  that  have  very  similar pattern speeds \omega/m,
          while  the  m=1  mode, which would appear as the fundamental of
          this  discrete  spectrum,  is less unstable. This would readily
          explain the 2:3 (and sometimes higher) frequency ratio observed
          between  these  QPO.  These  instabilites form eigenmodes, i.e.
          standing  wave  patterns  at  a constant frequency in the disk;
          they  are  strongly  unstable, and thus do not need an external
          excitation  mechanism  to  reach  high amplitudes. Furthermore,
          they  have the property that a fraction of the accretion energy
          can be emitted toward the corona: this would explain that these
          QPO  are  seen  in  a spectral state where Comptonized emission
          from  the  corona  is  always  present. Their existence depends
          critically  on the existence of a magnetic structure, formed by
          poloidal flux advected in the accretion process, in the central
          region between the disk and the black hole.

          it  possible to study the correlation between optical and X-ray
          activity. The optical outburst of 0.1 mag was accompanied by an
          increase in X-ray flux in 2004 observations. Strong correlation
          between  the  optical  and  X-ray  light  curves  suggests that
          neutron  star directly accretes from the outflowing material of
          Be  star.  The  nearly  zero time lag between X-ray and optical
          light  curves  suggests  a  heating  of  the disk of Be star by
          X-rays.  No  optical brightening and X-ray enhancement was seen
          in  2005  observations.  There  is no indication of the orbital
          modulation in the optical light curve.

          Comments: 7 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We apply the stellar population synthesis code by Cid Fernandes
          et  al.  to  model the stellar contribution for a sample of 209
          type II AGNs at $0.3<z<0.83$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
          The  reliable  stellar  velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{*}$) are
          obtained   for   33  type  II  AGNs  with  significant  stellar
          absorption   features.  According  to  the  $L_{\rm  [O  III]}$
          criterion  of  $3\times  10^{8}  \Lsolar$,  20  of which can be
          classified  as  type II quasars. We use the formula of Greene &
          Ho   to  obtain  the  corrected  stellar  velocity  dispersions
          ($\sigma_{*}^c$).  We  also  calculate  the  supermassive black
          holes masses from $\sigma_{*}^c$ in these high-redshift type II
          AGNs.  The [O III] luminosity is correlated with the black hole
          mass  (although no correlation between the extinction-corrected
          [O III] luminosity and the black hole mass), and no correlation
          is found between the Eddington ratio and the [O III] luminosity
          or   the   corrected   [O   III]   luminosity.  Three  sets  of
          two-component   profile  are  used  to  fit  multiple  emission
          transitions   ([O   III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,   5007   and   [O
          II]$\lambda\lambda$3727,   3729)   in  these  33  stellar-light
          subtracted spectra. We also measure the gas velocity dispersion
          ($\sigma_{g}$)  from  these multiple transitions, and find that
          the  relation  between  $\sigma_{g}$ and $\sigma_{*}^c$ becomes
          much  weaker at higher redshifts than in smaller redshifts. The
          distribution  of  $<\sigma_{g}/\sigma_{*}^c>$  is $1.24\pm0.76$
          for  the  core  [O  III]  line and $1.20\pm0.96$ for the [O II]
          line,  which suggests that $\sigma_{g}$ of the core [O III] and
          [O  II]  lines can trace $\sigma_{*}^c$ within about 0.1 dex in
          the  logarithm  of $\sigma_{*}^c$. For the secondary driver, we
          find  that the deviation of $\sigma_{g}$ from $\sigma_{*}^c$ is
          correlated with the Eddington ratio.

          Comments: Accepted by the Astrophysical Journal
          We   present  high  angular  resolution  ($2\rlap.{''}8  \times
          1\rlap.{''}7$)  SiO  J=5$\to$4;  $v=0$ line observations of the
          OMC1S  region  in the Orion Nebula made using the Submillimeter
          Array  (SMA).  We  detect  for the first time a cluster of four
          compact bipolar and monopolar outflows that show high, moderate
          and  low  velocity gas and appear to be energized by millimeter
          and  infrared  sources  associated  with  this  region. The SiO
          molecular  outflows  are  compact ($<$ 3500 AU), and in most of
          the  cases,  they  are  located  very  close  to their exciting
          sources.  We  thus  propose  that  the  SiO thermal emission is
          tracing  the  youngest  and  most  highly  excited parts of the
          outflows which cannot be detected by other molecules. Moreover,
          since the ambient cloud is weak in the SiO line emission, these
          observations   can   reveal   flows  that  in  other  molecular
          transitions  will  be  confused with the ambient velocity cloud
          emission.  Analysis  of their positional-velocity diagrams show
          that  some  components  of  these  outflows  may  be  driven by
          wide-angle winds very close to the exciting object. Finally, we
          find  that  some  of  these SiO outflows seem to be the base of
          powerful  Herbig-Haro jets and large-scale molecular flows that
          emanate  from a few arcseconds around this zone. In particular,
          we  find  a strongly excited SiO bipolar outflow with a P.A. of
          $\sim$  100$^{\circ}$, that is likely energized by the luminous
          ($\sim$  3  $\times$ 10$^3$ L$_{\odot}$) infrared protostar "B"
          and could be the base of the remarkable object HH269.

          This paper reports the photospheric, magnetic and circumstellar
          gas  characteristics  of  the  magnetic  B8p star 36 Lyncis (HD
          79158).  Using  archival data and new polarised and unpolarised
          high-resolution  spectra,  we  redetermine  the  basic physical
          properties,  the  rotational  period  and  the  geometry of the
          magnetic  field,  and  the  photospheric  abundances of various
          elements.}{Based on magnetic and spectroscopic measurements, we
          infer  an improved rotational period of $3.83475\pm 0.00002$ d.
          We determine a current epoch of the longitudinal magnetic field
          positive extremum (HJD 2452246.033), and provide constraints on
          the  geometry  of  the  dipole magnetic field ($i\geq 56\degr$,
          $3210    {\rm   G}\leq   B_{\rm   d}\leq   3930$   G,   $\beta$
          unconstrained).  We  redetermine  the effective temperature and
          surface  gravity using the optical and UV energy distributions,
          optical   photometry   and   Balmer   line   profiles  ($T_{\rm
          eff}=13300\pm  300$  K,  $\log  g=3.7-4.2$),  and  based on the
          Hipparcos  parallax we redetermine the luminosity, mass, radius
          and  true  rotational  speed ($L=2.54\pm 0.16 L_\odot, M=4.0\pm
          0.2  M_\odot,  R=3.4\pm 0.7 R_\odot, v_{\rm eq}=45-61.5$ \kms).
          We  measure  photospheric  abundances  for  21  elements  using
          optical  and UV spectra, and constrain the presence of vertical
          stratification   of  these  elements.  We  perform  preliminary
          Doppler Imaging of the surface distribution of Fe, finding that
          Fe is distributed in a patchy belt near the rotational equator.
          Most  remarkably, we confirm strong variations of the H$\alpha$
          line core which we interpret as due to occultations of the star
          by magnetically-confined circumstellar gas.

          Title:  Resolved  Spectroscopy of M Dwarf/L Dwarf Binaries. II.
          2MASS J 17072343-0558249AB
          Authors: Michael W. McElwain, Adam J. Burgasser
          We  present  IRTF  SpeX  observations  of the M/L binary system
          2MASS  J17072343-0558249. SpeX imaging resolves the system into
          a  1"01+/-0.17  visual binary in which both components have red
          near  infrared  colors. Resolved low-resolution (R~150) 0.8-2.5
          micron  spectroscopy  reveals  strong H2O, CO and FeH bands and
          alkali  lines in the spectra of both components, characteristic
          of  late-type  M  and  L  dwarfs.  A  comparison to a sample of
          late-type  field  dwarf spectra indicates spectral types M9 and
          L3.   Despite   the   small   proper   motion   of  the  system
          (0"100+/-0"009  yr^{-1}),  imaging  observations  over  2.5  yr
          provide  strong  evidence  that the two components share common
          proper  motion.  Physical association is also likely due to the
          small  spatial  volume occupied by the two components (based on
          spectrophotometric   distances   estimates  of  15+/-1  pc)  as
          compared  to  the  relatively  low  spatial density of low mass
          field  stars.  The projected separation of the system is 15+/-3
          AU,  similar  to  other  late-type M and L binaries. Assuming a
          system  age  of 0.5-5 Gyr, we estimate the masses of the binary
          components  to  be  0.072-0.083  and 0.064-0.077 M_sun, with an
          orbital  period  of roughly 150-300 yr. While this is nominally
          too  long  a  baseline  for  astrometric mass measurements, the
          proximity  and  relatively wide angular separation of the 2MASS
          J1707-0558AB  pair  makes it an ideal system for studying the M
          dwarf/L dwarf transition at a fixed age and metallicity.

          non-rotating black hole computed by the GRH code
          Authors: Orhan Donmez
          Comments: 13 figures
          The  shocked wave created on the accretion disk after different
          physical  phenomena  (accretion  flows with pressure gradients,
          star-disk  interaction  etc.) may be responsible observed Quasi
          Periodic  Oscillations  (QPOs)  in $X-$ray binaries. We present
          the   set   of   characteristics  frequencies  associated  with
          accretion disk around the rotating and non-rotating black holes
          for one particle case. These persistent frequencies are results
          of  the  rotating  pattern in an accretion disk. We compare the
          frequency's from two different numerical results for fluid flow
          around  the non-rotating black hole with one particle case. The
          numerical     results     are    taken    from    our    papers
          Refs.\refcite{Donmez2}   and   \refcite{Donmez3}   using  fully
          general      relativistic      hydrodynamical     code     with
          non-selfgravitating  disk. While the first numerical result has
          a  relativistic  tori  around  the  black  hole, the second one
          includes  one-armed  spiral  shock wave produced from star-disk
          interaction.  Some  physical modes presented in the QPOs can be
          excited in numerical simulation of relativistic tori and spiral
          waves  on  the  accretion  disk. The results of these different
          dynamical structures on the accretion disk responsible for QPOs
          are discussed in detail.

          We present Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the "evolved
          starless  core"  L1521F which reveal the presence of a very low
          luminosity  object  (L < 0.07 Lsun). The object, L1521F-IRS, is
          directly  detected  at mid-infrared wavelengths (>5 micron) but
          only  in  scattered  light  at  shorter  infrared  wavelengths,
          showing  a  bipolar nebula oriented east-west which is probably
          tracing  an  outflow  cavity. The nebula strongly suggests that
          L1521F-IRS  is  embedded in the L1521F core. Thus L1521F-IRS is
          similar to the recently discovered L1014-IRS and the previously
          known  IRAM  04191  in its substellar luminosity and dense core
          environment.  However  these  objects  differ  significantly in
          their core density, core chemistry, and outflow properties, and
          some may be destined to be brown dwarfs rather than stars.

          Title: GRI: the gamma-ray imager mission
          Authors: Jrgen Kndlseder (on behalf of the GRI consortium)
          Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures
          Journal-ref: Proceedings of the SPIE, Volume 6266, p. 61 (2006)
          Observations  of  the  gamma-ray  sky  reveal the most powerful
          sources  and  the most violent events in the Universe. While at
          lower wavebands the observed emission is generally dominated by
          thermal processes, the gamma-ray sky provides us with a view on
          the  non-thermal  Universe.  Here  particles are accelerated to
          extreme  relativistic  energies  by  mechanisms which are still
          poorly  understood,  and nuclear reactions are synthesizing the
          basic constituents of our world. Cosmic accelerators and cosmic
          explosions  are  the major science themes that are addressed in
          the gamma-ray regime.
          With  the  INTEGRAL observatory, ESA has provided a unique tool
          to  the  astronomical  community revealing hundreds of sources,
          new  classes  of  objects,  extraordinary  views  of antimatter
          annihilation   in   our  Galaxy,  and  fingerprints  of  recent
          nucleosynthesis  processes.  While INTEGRAL provides the global
          overview  over  the soft gamma-ray sky, there is a growing need
          to  perform  deeper,  more  focused investigations of gamma-ray
          sources.  In soft X-rays a comparable step was taken going from
          the  Einstein  and  the  EXOSAT  satellites  to the Chandra and
          XMM/Newton  observatories.  Technological  advances in the past
          years   in   the   domain  of  gamma-ray  focusing  using  Laue
          diffraction  and multilayer-coated mirror techniques have paved
          the   way   towards   a   gamma-ray  mission,  providing  major
          improvements  compared  to  past missions regarding sensitivity
          and  angular  resolution.  Such  a future Gamma-Ray Imager will
          allow  to  study  particle acceleration processes and explosion
          physics  in  unprecedented detail, providing essential clues on
          the  innermost  nature  of  the most violent and most energetic
          processes in the Universe.

          publication in Astrophysical Journal
          We present rotation periods for the solar-type primary stars in
          13  close (a \~< 5 AU) single-lined spectroscopic binaries with
          known  orbital periods (P) and eccentricities (e). All binaries
          are members of the open clusters M35 (150Myr) and M34 (250Myr).
          The  binary  orbital parameters and the rotation periods of the
          primary stars were determined from time-series spectroscopy and
          time-series  photometry,  respectively.  Knowledge of the ages,
          orbital  periods, and eccentricities of these binaries combined
          with  the  rotation  periods  and masses of their primary stars
          makes  them  particularly  interesting systems for studying the
          rates  of tidal circularization and synchronization. Our sample
          of  13  binaries includes six with orbital periods shortward of
          13  days  (a  ~<  0.12  AU).  The stars in these binaries orbit
          sufficiently  close  that  their  spins and orbits have evolved
          toward   synchronization   and  circularization  due  to  tidal
          interactions.    We    investigate    the   degree   of   tidal
          synchronization   in  each  binary  by  comparing  the  angular
          rotation  velocity of the primary stars to the angular velocity
          expected  if the primary star was synchronized (e=0) or pseudo-
          synchronized  (e>0) with the orbital motion. Of the six closest
          binaries  two  with  circular  orbits are not synchronized, one
          being  subsynchronous  and  one being supersynchronous, and the
          primary  stars  in  two  binaries  with  eccentric  orbits  are
          rotating  more slowly than pseudosynchronism. The remaining two
          binaries   have   reached  the  equilibrium  state  of  both  a
          circularized orbit and synchronized rotation. As a set, the six
          binaries  present  a challenging case study for tidal evolution
          theory,  which  in  particular  does not predict subsynchronous
          rotation in such close systems.

          Title: A Study of Giant Pulses from PSR J1824-2452A
          Authors: H. S. Knight, M. Bailes, R. N. Manchester, S. M. Ord
          Comments: Accepted by ApJ
          We  have  searched  for  microsecond  bursts  of  emission from
          millisecond  pulsars  in  the  globular  cluster  M28 using the
          Parkes  radio telescope. We detected a total of 27 giant pulses
          from  the  known emitter PSR J1824-2452A. At wavelengths around
          20  cm  the  giant  pulses  are  scatter-broadened to widths of
          around  2  microseconds  and  follow  power-law statistics. The
          pulses  occur  in  two  narrow phase-windows which correlate in
          phase with X-ray emission and trail the peaks of the integrated
          radio  pulse-components. Notably, the integrated radio emission
          at  these phase windows has a steeper spectral index than other
          emission.   The   giant   pulses   exhibit  a  high  degree  of
          polarization,  with  many  being  100%  elliptically polarized.
          Their  position  angles  appear random. Although the integrated
          emission  of  PSR  J1824-2452A  is  relatively  stable  for the
          frequencies   and   bandwidths  observed,  the  intensities  of
          individual giant pulses vary considerably across our bands. Two
          pulses were detected at both 2700 and 3500 MHz. The narrower of
          the  two  pulses  is  20  ns wide at 3500 MHz. At 2700 MHz this
          pulse  has an inferred brightness temperature at maximum of 5 x
          10^37  K.  Our  observations  suggest  the  giant pulses of PSR
          J1824-2452A are generated in the same part of the magnetosphere
          as  X-ray emission through a different emission process to that
          of ordinary pulses.

          publication in the Astrophysical Journal
          The  disruption of binary stars by the tidal field of the black
          hole in the Galactic Center can produce the hypervelocity stars
          observed  in  the halo. We use numerical models to simulate the
          full  spectrum  of  observable velocities of stars ejected into
          the  halo by this binary disruption process. Our model includes
          a  range of parameters for binaries with 3-4 M_Solar primaries,
          consideration  of radial orbits of the ejected stars through an
          approximate mass distribution for the Galaxy, and the impact of
          stellar  lifetimes.  We  calculate  the  spectrum  of  ejection
          velocities and reproduce previous results for the mean ejection
          velocity  at  the  Galactic center. The model predicts that the
          full   population   of   ejected   stars   includes   both  the
          hypervelocity stars with velocities large enough to escape from
          the Galaxy and a comparable number of ejected, but bound, stars
          of  the  same  stellar type. The predicted median speeds of the
          population  of  ejected  stars as a function of distance in the
          halo  are  consistent  with current observations. Combining the
          model  with the data also shows that interesting constraints on
          the  properties  of  binaries in the Galactic Center and on the
          mass  distribution  in  the  Galaxy  can  be obtained even with
          modest samples of ejected stars.

          We  present new, sensitive, near-infrared images of the Class I
          protostar,  Elias  29,  in the Ophiuchus cloud core. To explore
          the  relationship  between the infall envelope and the outflow,
          narrowband  H2  1-0  S(1), Br-gamma, and narrowband K-continuum
          filters  were  used  to  image  the  source with the Wide-Field
          Infrared  Camera  on  the  Hale 5m telescope and with Persson's
          Auxiliary Nasmyth Infrared Camera on the Baade 6.5 m telescope.
          The source appears as a bipolar, scattered light nebula, with a
          wide opening angle in all filters, as is typical for late-stage
          protostars.  However, the pure H2 emission-line images point to
          the  presence  of a heretofore undetected precessing jet. It is
          argued  that high-velocity, narrow, precessing jets provide the
          mechanism  for creating the observed wide-angled outflow cavity
          in this source.

          We  report  on  the  first  census  of INTEGRAL/IBIS detections
          ($\gtrsim  4\sigma$  significance)  above  100 keV based on the
          Core  Program  and  public  Open  time observations up to April
          2005.  There are 49 sources detected in the 100-150 keV band of
          which 14 are also seen in the 150-300 keV range. The low energy
          sample  is  dominated  by  X-ray binary systems of both low and
          high  mass, but also includes 10 active galaxies. Of the binary
          systems  that  are  detected  above  150 keV, more than 50% are
          associated  with  black  hole  candidates,  often  reported  as
          microquasars.  The  present  survey  results  are  then used to
          construct  LogN-LogS  curves  for  galactic  and  extragalactic
          objects  in  the  100-150 keV band: above a 1 mCrab sensitivity
          limit we expect that around 200 galactic sources and almost 350
          active  galaxies  populate  the  sky  above  100 keV. While the
          contribution  of individual point sources to the total Galactic
          emission has been estimated to be around 70-80% between 100-300
          keV,  we  find  that  active  galaxies  detected  above 1 mCrab
          account  for  only about 3% of the cosmic hard X-ray background
          in the 100-150 keV band.

          We  review  recent  high-resolution  CO observations of distant
          QSOs  obtained  at  the  Very  Large  Array.  The  aim of these
          observations  is  to  resolve the molecular gas distribution in
          these  extreme  objects  both  spatially and in velocity space.
          They  provide  unique  information  regarding  the  small-scale
          distribution,  the  extent,  and the brightness temperatures of
          the  molecular  gas in these early systems. E.g., the structure
          and  dynamics  of  the  molecular gas may reveal whether or not
          mergers can be the cause of the ongoing starburst activity. The
          observations  also  allow for a first estimate of the dynamical
          gas mass. Currently, only the VLA is able to obtain resolutions
          in  CO  of  up  to  0.15"  which  is  needed to resolve typical
          galactic   structures   of   sizes   ~1  kpc.  We  present  new
          high-resolution  VLA imaging of high-z QSOs (BRI 1335-0417, APM
          08279+5255 and J1148+5251). These observations pave the road to
          future  ALMA observations where resolutions of order 0.1'' will
          be obtained routinely.

          Title: Cosmological evolution of compact AGN at 15 GHz
          Authors: Tigran Arshakian, Eduardo Ros, Anton Zensus
          Comments:  9  pages,  10  figures,  accepted for publication in
          Astronomy & Astrophysics
          We   study  the  uniformity  of  the  distribution  of  compact
          flat-spectrum  AGN  on  the  sky  and  the  evolution  of their
          relativistic  jets  with  cosmic  epoch.  A  complete sample of
          compact  extragalactic  radio  sources  at  15 GHz was recently
          compiled  to  conduct  the  MOJAVE  program.  The MOJAVE sample
          comprises   133   radio-loud  flat-spectrum  AGN  with  compact
          relativistic  outflows  detected  at  parsec scales. The source
          counts of compact AGN shows that the MOJAVE sample represents a
          flux-limited  complete  sample.  Analysis  of the population of
          flat-spectrum  quasars  of the sample reveals that the pc-scale
          jets  of  quasars  have  intrinsic  luminosities  in  the range
          between  ~10^24  W/Hz  and  ~10^27  W/Hz  and  Lorentz  factors
          distributed  between  3 and 30. We find that the apparent speed
          (or  Lorentz  factor) of jets evolves with redshift, increasing
          from z~0 to z~1 and then falling at higher redshifts (z~2.5) by
          a  factor  of  2.5.  The  evolution of apparent speeds does not
          affect  significantly  the  evolution  of the beamed luminosity
          function  of  quasars,  which is most likely to be dependent on
          the  evolution  of  radio  luminosity.  Furthermore, the beamed
          radio   luminosity   function   suggests   that  the  intrinsic
          luminosity  function of quasars has a double power-law form: it
          is  flat  at  low  luminosities and steep at high luminosities.
          There  is  a  positive  evolution  of  quasars at low redshifts
          (z<0.5)  and  strong  negative evolution at redshifts >1.7 with
          space  density  decline  up  to  z~2.5.  This  implies that the
          powerful  jets  were more populous at redshifts between 0.5 and
          1.7.   We  show  that  the  evolution  of  compact  quasars  is
          luminosity  dependent  and  it depends strongly on the speed of
          the  jet  suggesting that there are two distinct populations of
          quasars  with  slow and fast jets which evolve differently with
          redshift.

          We  study  the  LF  of  the high-z galaxy population with 3<z<4
          using  a  purely I-band magnitude-selected spectroscopic sample
          obtained in the framework of the VVDS. We determine the LF from
          the  VVDS,  taking care to add as few assumptions and as simple
          corrections  as  possible,  and  compare our results with those
          obtained   from   photometric  studies,  based  on  Lyman-break
          selections  or  photo-z measurements. We find that in the range
          3<z<4,  the  VVDS  LF  is parameterized by phi*=1.24+-0.50 10-3
          mag-1  Mpc-3  and  M*=-21.49+-0.19, assuming a slope alpha=-1.4
          consistent with most previous studies. While phi* is comparable
          to  previously  found  values,  M* is significantly brighter by
          about  0.5  mag at least. Using the conservative slope -1.4, we
          find  a  LD  at  1700A  rho(M<-18.5)=2.4  10 19 W Mpc-3 and rho
          Tot=3.1  10  19  W Mpc-3, comparable to that estimated in other
          studies.  The unexpectedly large number of very bright galaxies
          found  in  the  VVDS  indicates  that  the  color-selection and
          photo-z  techniques  that  are  generally  used to build high-z
          galaxy  samples  may  be  affected by a significant fraction of
          color-measurement  failures  or  by incomplete modelling of the
          mix  of stellar emission, AGN contribution, dust absorption and
          intergalactic  extinction  assumed to identify high-z galaxies,
          making  pure  magnitude selection better able to trace the full
          population.   Because   of   the  difficulty  to  identify  all
          low-luminosity galaxies in a spectroscopic survey, the LD could
          still  be  significantly  underestimated. We also find that the
          relative contribution of the most luminous galaxies compared to
          the  fainter  ones  is  at  least  twice  as  large in the VVDS
          compared  to  former  estimates.  Therefore,  the VVDS paints a
          quite  different  picture  of  the  role  of  the most actively
          star-forming galaxies in the history of star formation.

          Title:  The  Cool  ISM  in  Elliptical Galaxies. I. A Survey of
          Molecular Gas
          Authors: L. J. Sage, G. A. Welch, L. M. Young
          Comments:  Submitted  to  the  Astrophysical  Journal  22 pages
          including 3 figures
          We  present  preliminary  results  from a survey of CO emission
          from   members   of  a  volume-limited  sample  of  non-cluster
          elliptical   galaxies.   Our  intent  is  to  compare  the  gas
          properties  of  these  ellipticals  to  a sample of lenticulars
          selected  using  similar  criteria.  The  data,  although still
          sparse, suggest that the cool gas in ellipticals shows the same
          puzzling upper mass cutoff found in the lenticular galaxies. We
          find, however, significantly lower detection rates and possibly
          much  lower H2/HI mass ratios in the ellipticals. The detection
          rate is higher among the lower-mass galaxies, as has been found
          previously. This seems puzzling given that the deeper potential
          wells  of  the  larger  galaxies  ought  to  make gas retention
          easier, but perhaps that effect is overwhelmed by feedback from
          the  central  suppermassive black hole. As we have observed ~40
          percent   of   our  sample,  the  conclusions  are  necessarily
          tentative at this time.

          Title:  Gravitational  Dynamics of an Infinite Shuffled Lattice
          of Particles
          Authors: Thierry Baertschiger, Michael Joyce, Andrea Gabrielli,
          Francesco Sylos Labini
          Comments: 21 pages, 16 figures
          Subj-class: Statistical Mechanics
          We  study, using numerical simulations, the dynamical evolution
          of  self-gravitating point particles in static euclidean space,
          starting  from  a simple class of infinite ``shuffled lattice''
          initial    conditions.   These   are   obtained   by   applying
          independently to each particle on an infinite perfect lattice a
          small  random  displacement,  and  are characterized by a power
          spectrum  (structure  factor)  of density fluctuations which is
          quadratic  in  the  wave  number k, at small k. For a specified
          form   of   the   probability   distribution  function  of  the
          ``shuffling''  applied  to  each  particle,  and  zero  initial
          velocities, these initial configurations are characterized by a
          single  relevant  parameter:  the  variance  $\delta^2$  of the
          ``shuffling''  normalized  in  units  of  the  lattice  spacing
          $\ell$.  The  clustering,  which develops in time starting from
          scales  around  $\ell$,  is  qualitatively very similar to that
          seen  in  cosmological  simulations,  which begin from lattices
          with   applied  correlated  displacements  and  incorporate  an
          expanding   spatial   background.  From  very  soon  after  the
          formation of the first non-linear structures, a spatio-temporal
          scaling  relation describes well the evolution of the two-point
          correlations.   At   larger   times   the   dynamics  of  these
          correlations  converges  to  what  is  termed  ``self-similar''
          evolution  in  cosmology,  in  which the time dependence in the
          scaling   relation   is  specified  entirely  by  that  of  the
          linearized  fluid  theory. Comparing simulations with different
          $\delta$,  different  resolution,  but  identical  large  scale
          fluctuations, we are able to identify and study features of the
          dynamics  of  the system in the transient phase leading to this
          behavior.  In  this  phase,  the  discrete nature of the system
          explicitly plays an essential role.

          We  present  observations  of  the  unusually  bright  and long
          gamma-ray  burst GRB 050820A, one of the best-sampled broadband
          data sets in the Swift era. The gamma-ray light curve is marked
          by a soft precursor pulse some 200 s before the main event; the
          lack  of  any intervening emission suggests that it is due to a
          physical mechanism distinct from the GRB itself. The large time
          lag  between  the  precursor  and  the  main  emission  enabled
          simultaneous  observations in the gamma-ray, X-ray, and optical
          band-passes, something only achieved for a handful of events to
          date.  While the contemporaneous X-rays are the low-energy tail
          of the prompt emission, the optical does not directly track the
          gamma-ray  flux.  Instead,  the  early-time optical data appear
          mostly  consistent  with  the  forward  shock  synchrotron peak
          passing  through  the  optical,  and  are  therefore likely the
          beginning  of  the  afterglow.  On  hour  time scales after the
          burst, the X-ray and optical light curves are inconsistent with
          an  adiabatic  expansion  of  the  shock  into  the surrounding
          region,  but  rather  indicate that there is a period of energy
          injection. Observations at late times allow us to constrain the
          collimation  angle of the relativistic outflow to theta = 6.8 -
          9.3  degrees.  Our  estimates of both the kinetic energy of the
          afterglow  and  the  prompt  gamma-ray  energy release make GRB
          050820A  one of the most energetic events for which such values
          could be determined.

          Title: Requirements for Cosmological 21-cm Masers
          Authors: Mark Dijkstra, Abraham Loeb
          Comments: 13 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  explore  the  prospects  for  a population inversion in the
          hyperfine  levels of atomic hydrogen at high redshifts when the
          Universe was still predominanly neutral. The existence of 21-cm
          masers  during  the  epoch  of reionisation (EoR) could greatly
          boost  the  expected  EoR  signals.  We  show  that  the  color
          temperature  of Lya photons emitted by a bright source embedded
          in  a neutral collapsing gas cloud may be sufficiently negative
          to  establish  population inversion in the hyperfine transition
          via  the Wouthuysen-Field effect. In practice, however, a small
          flux  of  Lya  photons  produced  via  x-ray heating or through
          cascades   of   atoms   which   are   photo-excited  by  higher
          Lyman-series  photons, can counteract this effect. In order for
          maser conditions to prevail, the spectrum of the source must be
          strongly  suppressed  blueward  of  the  Ly-beta transition. We
          specify  conditions  in  a clumpy two-phase interstellar medium
          (ISM),  which could give rise to the required spectrum. We find
          that  the  most  likely  sites for 21-cm masers are cold infall
          regions  around  galaxies  undergoing massive star formation (>
          10^3 Msun/yr), obscured from view by a large column of gas with
          NH  >  10^22.5/cm^2 (reminiscent of known starburst galaxies at
          lower  redshifts).  Crucial  for the existence of masers is for
          the  dust  in  the  ISM  to  be  locked-up in cold dense clumps
          embedded in a hot tenous medium, through which a large fraction
          of the emitted Lya photons can escape the galaxies.

          binaries

          Comments:  10  pages,  7  figures,  Accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We  numerically  study the long-term evolution of the accretion
          disc around the neutron star in a coplanar Be/X-ray binary with
          a   short  period  and  a  moderate  eccentricity.  From  three
          dimensional  Smoothed  Particle  Hydrodynamics  simulations, we
          find  that the disc evolves through three distinct phases, each
          characterized  by  different  mass  accretion  patterns. In the
          first  "developing  phase",  the  disc  is  formed and develops
          towards  a  nearly  Keplerian  disc. It has a relatively large,
          double-peaked  mass-accretion  rate with the higher peak by the
          direct  accretion at periastron, which is followed by the lower
          peak  by  the  accretion induced by a one-armed spiral wave. In
          the  second  "transition  phase",  the  disc  is  approximately
          Keplerian   and   grows  with  time.  The  mass-accretion  rate
          increases  as  the  disc grows. In the second phase, there is a
          transition in the mass accretion rate from a double peaked to a
          single  peaked  pattern.  In  the final quasi-steady state, the
          mass-accretion   rate   is   on   average   balanced  with  the
          mass-transfer  rate  from  the  Be  disc and exhibits a regular
          orbital    modulation.   In   the   quasi-steady   state,   the
          mass-accretion  rate  has  a  single  peak  by the wave-induced
          accretion  as  in  a  later  stage of the transition phase. The
          orbital  modulation  of  X-ray  maxima could provide not only a
          circumstantial  evidence  for  the  persistent disc but also an
          observational diagnosis of the disc evolutionary state.

          The  discovery  of  luminous  quasars  at  redshift  $z \sim 6$
          indicates  the  presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of
          mass  $\sim  10^9  \Msun$  when  the Universe was less than one
          billion years old. This finding presents several challenges for
          theoretical  models,  because  whether such massive objects can
          form  so early in the $\Lambda$-cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM)
          cosmology,  the  leading theory for cosmic structure formation,
          is an open question. Furthermore, whether the formation process
          requires  exotic  physics  such  as  super-Eddington  accretion
          remains  undecided.  Here,  we  present  the  first multi-scale
          simulations  that, together with a self-regulated model for the
          SMBH  growth,  produce a luminous quasar at $z \sim 6.5$ in the
          $\Lambda$CDM  paradigm.  We  follow  the  hierarchical assembly
          history of the most massive halo in a $\sim 3 \Gpc^{3}$ volume,
          and find that this halo of $\sim 8\times 10^{12} \Msun$ forming
          at  $z  \sim  6.5$  after  several  major  mergers  is  able to
          reproduce  a  number of observed properties of SDSS J1148+5251,
          the  most distant quasar detected at $z =6.42$ \citep{Fan2003}.
          Moreover,  the  SMBHs  grow  through  gas  accretion  below the
          Eddington  limit  in a self-regulated manner owing to feedback.
          We  find  that  the  progenitors  experience  significant  star
          formation  (up  to  $10^4  \Msun \yr^{-1}$) preceding the major
          quasar  phase  such  that  the  stellar mass of the quasar host
          reaches  $10^{12}  \Msun$  at  $z  \sim  6.5$,  consistent with

          Title:  Structured  Red Giant Winds with Magnetized Hot Bubbles
          and the Corona/Cool Wind Dividing Line
          Authors: Takeru K. Suzuki (Tokyo)
          Comments:  20  pages,  21 figures embedded (emulate ApJ style),
          submitted to ApJ
          (Abridged)    By    performing    magnetohydrodynamical   (MHD)
          simulations,  we  investigate  mass  loss  of intermediate- and
          low-mass  stars  from main sequence to red giant branch phases.
          Alfven   waves,   which   are   excited   by  the  photospheric
          perturbations  due to the surface convections, travel outwardly
          and  dissipate  by  nonlinear  processes to accelerate and heat
          stellar  winds.  We  dynamically  treat these processes in open
          magnetic  field  regions  from  the  photospheres to 25 stellar
          radii.  When  the  star  evolves  to  slightly  blueward of the
          dividing  line  (Linsky  &  Haisch), the steady hot corona with
          temperature, T ~ 10^6 K, suddenly disappears. Instead, many hot
          (~  10^6  K) and warm (>~ 10^5 K) bubbles are formed in cool (T
          <~   2  x  10^4  K)  chromospheric  winds  because  of  thermal
          instability;  the  RGB  star  wind  is  not a steady stream but
          structured  outflow.  The  densities  of  the bubbles which are
          supported  by  the  magnetic pressure can be kept low to reduce
          the  radiative  cooling  so that the bubbles survive long time.
          Even  in  the  stars  redward of the dividing line, hot bubbles
          intermittently  exist,  and  they  can  be  sources of UV/X-ray
          emissions  from hybrid stars. \dot{M} of RGB stars largely vary
          in  time  because  of  many  bubbles  and  blobs;  for  example
          $\dot{M}$  of a simulated 3 Msun star with surface gravity, log
          g=1.4,  varies  from  10^{-10}  to 5 x 10^{-7} (Msun/yr). Along
          with  the  stellar  evolution,  the  wind velocity also rapidly
          decreases  to  <~ several 10 km/s, considerably slower than the
          escape  velocity  at  the  stellar  surface. This is because an
          ``effective  surface'' is formed at several stellar radii below
          which  the  time-averaged  atmosphere  is  almost  static.  The
          acceleration  of  the  wind  starts from there, hence, the wind
          speed  is  regulated  by  the  slower  escape  velocity at that
          location.

          Title:  An  evolutionary  disc  model of the edge-on galaxy NGC
          5907
          Authors: A. Just, C. Moellenhoff, A. Borch
          Comments: 17 pages, 21 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          We  present a physical model taht explains in a natural way the
          two   observational   facts  falling  somewhat  apart:  1)  the
          exponential  vertical  disc structure in the optical and NIR of
          the  non-obscured  part of the stellar disc and 2) the enhanced
          FIR/submm  luminosity  by  about  a  factor  of  four  near the
          obscured  mid-plane,  which  requires  additional dust and also
          stellar  light  to  heat  the dust component. We use multi-band
          photometry  in  U, B, V, R, and I- band combined with radiative
          transfer  through  a  dust  component to fit simultaneously the
          vertical  surface-brightness  and  colour index profiles in all
          bands   adopting   a  reasonable  star  formation  history  and
          dynamical heating function. The final disc model reproduces the
          surface-brightness  profiles  in  all  bands  with a moderately
          declining  star  formation  rate  and a slowly starting heating
          function  for  young  stars.  The total dust mass is 57 million
          solar  masses  as  required  from  the  FIR/submm measurements.
          Without  a  recent star burst we find in the midplane an excess
          of  5.2-, 4.0-, and 3.0-times more stellar light in the U-, B-,
          and    V-band,    respectively.   The   corresponding   stellar
          mass-to-light  ratios  are  0.91  in  V- and 1.0 in R-band. The
          central  face-on optical depth in V-band is 0.81 and the radial
          scale length of the dust is 40% larger than that of the stellar
          disc.  Evolutionary  disc  models  are  a  powerful  method  to
          understand the vertical structure of edge-on galaxies. Insights
          to  the  star  formation history and the dynamical evolution of
          stellar   discs  can  be  gained.  FIR/submm  observations  are
          necessary to restrict the parameter space for the models.

          The measurement of the cosmic microwave background has strongly
          constrained  the  cosmological parameters of the Universe. When
          the  measured  density of baryons (ordinary matter) is combined
          with   standard  Big  Bang  nucleosynthesis  calculations,  the
          amounts  of hydrogen, helium and lithium produced shortly after
          the Big Bang can be predicted with unprecedented precision. The
          predicted  primordial  lithium  abundance is a factor of two to
          three  higher than the value measured in the atmospheres of old
          stars.  With  estimated  errors of 10 to 25%, this cosmological
          lithium  discrepancy  seriously challenges our understanding of
          stellar  physics,  Big  Bang  nucleosynthesis  or both. Certain
          modifications  to nucleosynthesis have been proposed, but found
          experimentally  not  to  be  viable. Diffusion theory, however,
          predicts  atmospheric  abundances  of  stars to vary with time,
          which offers a possible explanation of the discrepancy. Here we
          report  spectroscopic  observations  of  stars in the metalpoor
          globular  cluster  NGC  6397  that reveal trends of atmospheric
          abundance  with  evolutionary stage for various elements. These
          element-specific  trends  are  reproduced  by stellar-evolution
          models  with  diffusion  and turbulent mixing. We thus conclude
          that   diffusion  is  predominantly  responsible  for  the  low
          apparent  stellar  lithium  abundance in the atmospheres of old
          stars by transporting the lithium deep into the star.

          Title:  The  Cosmological  History of Accretion onto Dark Halos
          and Supermassive Black Holes
          Authors: L. Miller, W. J. Percival, S. M. Croom, A. Babic
          Comments:  14  pages. Accepted for publication in Astronomy and
          Astrophysics
          Aims:  We investigate the cosmological growth of dark halos and
          follow  the  consequences  of  coeval  growth for the accretion
          history  of  associated  supermassive black holes. Methods: The
          Press-Schechter  approximation  is  used  to obtain an analytic
          expression  for  the  mean rate of growth of dark matter halos.
          Dark  halo accretion rates are compared with numerical work and
          the consequences for understanding AGN evolution are described.
          Results:  The  mean  accretion  rate  onto dark matter halos is
          shown  to have a simple analytic form that agrees with previous
          numerical  work  and  that  may easily be calculated for a wide
          range  of  halo mass, redshift and cosmological parameters. The
          result  offers a significant improvement over published fitting
          formulae deduced from merger trees. We then consider the growth
          of  associated  supermassive black holes, and make a basic test
          of  the  simple  hypothesis of `Pure Coeval Evolution' (PCE) in
          which,  on  average, black hole growth tracks dark halo growth.
          We  demonstrate  that both the absolute value of the integrated
          AGN   bolometric   luminosity   density  and  its  cosmological
          evolution  derived  from hard X-ray surveys are well-reproduced
          by  PCE. Excellent agreement is found at z >~ 0.5, although the
          observed  luminosity  density drops by a factor 2 compared with
          PCE  by  z=0:  black  hole growth appears to decouple from halo
          growth  at  low  redshifts,  and  this  may  be  related to the
          phenomenon  of  `cosmic  downsizing'.  Overall,  AGN  evolution
          appears  either  to be caused by or to be closely linked to the
          slow-down  in  the  growth of cosmic structure. We also discuss
          the  mean  Eddington ratio averaged over all galaxies, which is
          predicted  to  show  strong  evolution  to  higher  values with
          redshift.

          Astronomy and Astrophysics
          We   present  two-dimensional  spectroscopy  of  the  extremely
          metal-deficient  blue  compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy SBS 0335-052E
          aiming  to  studyphysical  conditions,  element  abundances and
          kinematical  properties  of  the  ionised  gas  in this galaxy.
          Observations  were  obtained  in  the spectral range 3620-9400A
          with  the  imaging spectrograph GIRAFFE installed on the UT2 of
          the  Very  Large  Telescope  (VLT).  These observations are the
          first  ones  carried  out so far with GIRAFFE in the ARGUS mode
          which  allows  to  obtain simultaneously 308 spectra covering a
          11.4"x7.3"  region.  We produced images of SBS 0335-052E in the
          continuum   and  in  emission  lines  of  different  stages  of
          excitation.  We  find that while the maximum of emission in the
          majority  of  lines,  including  the  strong lines Hbeta 4861A,
          Halpha  6563A,  [OIII]  4363,5007A, [OII] 3726,3729A, coincides
          with  the  youngest  south-eastern  star  clusters 1 and 2, the
          emission  of  HeII  4686A  line  is  offset to the more evolved
          north-west  clusters  4,5.  This  suggests  that  hard ionising
          radiation  responsible  for  the  HeII  4686A  emission  is not
          related  to  the  most  massive  youngest  stars, but rather is
          connected  with  fast  radiative  shocks.  This  conclusion  is
          supported by the kinematical properties of the ionised gas from
          the  different emission lines as the velocity dispersion in the
          HeII  4686A  line  is systematically higher, by ~50%-100%, than
          that  in  other  lines.  The  variations  of  the emission line
          profiles  suggest the presence of an ionised gas outflow in the
          direction perpendicular to the galaxy disk. (abridged)

          Title: Studying Millisecond Pulsars in X-rays
          Authors: Vyacheslav E. Zavlin (NASA/MSFC)
          Comments:   To   appear  in  Astrophysics  and  Space  Science,

          the  Surface",  eds. D. Page, R. Turolla and S. Zane; 10 pages,

          Millisecond  pulsars represent an evolutionarily distinct group
          among  rotation-powered  pulsars.  Outside  the radio band, the
          soft  X-ray  range  ($\sim  0.1$--10  keV) is most suitable for
          studying  radiative  mechanisms  operating in these fascinating
          objects.  X-ray  observations  revealed  diverse  properties of
          emission  from  millisecond  pulsars. For the most of them, the
          bulk  of  radiation  is of a thermal origin, emitted from small
          spots  (polar  caps)  on  the  neutron  star  surface heated by
          relativistic  particles  produced in pulsar acceleration zones.
          On  the  other  hand,  a  few  other very fast rotating pulsars
          exhibit   almost   pure  nonthermal  emission  generated,  most
          probably,  in pulsar magnetospheres. There are also examples of
          nonthermal  emission  detected  from  X-ray  nebulae powered by
          millisecond  pulsars,  as  well as from pulsar winds shocked in
          binary  systems  with  millisecond pulsars as companions. These
          and   other   most   important   results  obtained  from  X-ray
          observations of millisecond pulsars are reviewed in this paper,
          as  well  as results from the search for millisecond pulsations
          in
          X-ray flux of the radio-quite neutron star RX J1856.5-3754.

          Observations of H$_{2}$CO lines and continuum at 1.3 mm towards
          Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M) cores were carried out with the SMA. We
          imaged  H$_{2}$CO  line  absorption against the continuum cores
          and the surrounding line emission clumps. The results show that
          the  majority  of the dense gas is falling into the major cores
          where  massive stars have been formed. The filaments and clumps
          of  the continuum and gas are detected outside of Sgr B2(N) and
          Sgr  B2(M) cores. Both the spectra and moment analysis show the
          presence of outflows from Sgr B2(M) cores. The H$_{2}$CO gas in
          the red-shifted outflow of Sgr B2(M) appears to be excited by a
          non-LTE  process  which  might  be related to the shocks in the
          outflow.

          eclipsing  binary.  Under  various  assumptions, we are able to
          derive a mass of ~ 50 Msun for each component.

          HH30  is  a  well-known  Pre-Main-Sequence  star in Taurus. HST
          observations  have  revealed  a  flared, edge-on disk driving a
          highly-collimated  optical jet, making this object a case study
          for  the  disk-jet-outflow  paradigm.  We obtained high angular
          resolution (about 1") observations of the dust continuum at 2.7
          and  1.3 mm, and of the 12CO(2-1), 13CO(2-1) & (1-0), C18O(1-0)
          emissions around HH30. A standard disk model is used to fit the
          13CO(2-1) uv-plane visibilities and derive the disk properties,
          and the stellar mass. It results that HH30 is a low mass TTauri
          of spectral type around M1 and age 1 to 4 Myrs, surrounded by a
          medium  size Keplerian disk, of mass around 4e-3 Msun and outer
          radius  420  AU.  The  disk  rotation  vector points toward the
          North-Eastern  jet.  Using  a  distance  of 140 pc, we deduce a
          stellar   mass  of  0.45  Msun.  A  highly  asymmetric  outflow
          originates  from  the  inner  parts of the disk. It presents to
          first  order a conical morphology with a 30 degree half opening
          angle  and  a constant (12 km/s) radial velocity field. Outflow
          rotation  was searched for but not found. These observations do
          not  enable  to  assign  the origin of the molecular outflow to
          entrainment by the optical jet or to a disk wind. In the latter
          case,  the upper limit of the outflow rotation velocity implies
          an origin in the inner 15 AU of the disk.

          of  type B. We then carried out a spectroscopic survey of other
          stars  in  the  vicinity,  revealing two more B-type stars, all
          within 45" of V838 Mon. We have determined the distance to this
          sparse,  young  cluster,  based  on spectral classification and
          photometric  main-sequence  fitting  of  the three B stars. The
          distance  is  found  to be 6.2+-1.2 kpc, in excellent agreement
          with  the  geometric  distance  to V838 Mon of 5.9 kpc obtained
          from  Hubble  Space  Telescope polarimetry of the light echoes.
          The cluster's age is less than 25 Myr.
          The  absolute luminosity of V838 Mon during its outburst, based
          on  our  distance  measurement, was very similar to that of M31
          RV,  an  object  in  the  bulge  of  M31  that  was also a cool
          supergiant  throughout  its eruption in 1988. However, there is
          no young population at the site of M31 RV.
          It  does  not  appear  possible to form a nova-like cataclysmic
          binary system within the young age of the V838 Mon cluster, and
          the lack of a young population surrounding M31 RV suggests that
          the  outburst  mechanism does not require a massive progenitor.
          These  considerations  appear  to  leave  stellar-collision  or
          merger  scenarios  as  one of the remaining viable explanations
          for the outbursts of V838 Mon and M31 RV.

          Title:  Hubble  Space  Telescope Observations of the Light Echo
          around V838 Monocerotis

          The  outburst  of  V838  Monocerotis  in  early  2002,  and the
          subsequent appearance of its light echoes, occurred just before
          the  installation  of  the Advanced Camera for Surveys into the
          Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This fortunate sequence of events
          has  allowed us to obtain spectacular HST images of the echoes,
          yielding  not  only  pictures of extraordinary beauty, but also
          providing  unique scientific information. Our team has used the
          HST  images  to  provide  a direct geometrical distance to V838
          Mon,  based on polarimetric imaging, and limits on the distance
          based   on   the  apparent  angular  expansion  rates.  Several
          morphological  features seen in the HST images strongly suggest
          that  the  illuminated  dust  was  ejected  from  the star in a
          previous outburst, similar to the current one. In particular, a
          "double-helix"   feature  points  exactly  back  to  the  star.
          Moreover,  three-dimensional  mapping of the outer edges of the
          dust  suggests  an  overall ellipsoidal shape, centered on V838
          Mon  itself.  And  the appearance of the light echo in the most
          recent  Hubble  images  is  remarkably  similar  to  that  of a
          well-known planetary nebula, M27. Future work on the HST images
          will  include  an  analysis  of interstellar-dust physics, in a
          situation  where  the  scattering  angle  and  illumination are
          unambiguously    known,    and   visualization   of   a   fully
          three-dimensional map of the dust distribution.

          Title:  A Survey of 56 Mid-latitude EGRET Error Boxes for Radio
          Pulsars

          We  have  conducted  a  radio  pulsar survey of 56 unidentified
          gamma-ray  sources  from  the  3rd  EGRET  catalog which are at
          intermediate  Galactic  latitudes (5 deg. < |b| < 73 deg.). For
          each  source,  four  interleaved  35-minute pointings were made
          with  the  13-beam,  1400-MHz  multibeam receiver on the Parkes
          64-m  radio  telescope.  This covered the 95% error box of each
          source  at  a  limiting  sensitivity of about 0.2 mJy to pulsed
          radio  emission for periods P > 10 ms and dispersion measures <
          50  pc cm-3. Roughly half of the unidentified gamma-ray sources
          at  |b|  >  5  deg.  with  no  proposed active galactic nucleus
          counterpart  were  covered  in  this  survey.  We detected nine
          isolated  pulsars  and four recycled binary pulsars, with three
          from  each  class  being  new. Timing observations suggest that
          only  one  of  the  pulsars has a spin-down luminosity which is
          even  marginally consistent with the inferred luminosity of its
          coincident  EGRET  source.  Our results suggest that population
          models,   which   include   the  Gould  belt  as  a  component,
          overestimate   the   number   of  isolated  pulsars  among  the
          mid-latitude Galactic gamma-ray sources and that it is unlikely
          that  Gould belt pulsars make up the majority of these sources.
          However,  the possibility of steep pulsar radio spectra and the
          confusion  of  terrestrial  radio interference with long-period
          pulsars  (P > 200 ms) having very low dispersion measures (< 10
          pc  cm-3, expected for sources at a distance of less than about
          1 kpc) prevent us from strongly ruling out this hypothesis. Our
          results  also  do  not  support the hypothesis that millisecond
          pulsars  make  up  the  majority  of  these sources. Non-pulsar
          source  classes  should  therefore  be  further investigated as
          possible  counterparts  to  the  unidentified  EGRET sources at
          intermediate Galactic latitudes.

          Title:  The X-ray binary 2S0114+650=LSI+65 010:A slow pulsar or
          tidally-induced pulsations?

          Comments: 12 pages, 14 figures
          The  X-ray  source  2S0114+650=LSI+65  010  is  a binary system
          containing  a  B-type primary and a low mass companion believed
          to   be   a   neutron  star.  The  system  has  three  reported
          periodicities: the orbital period, P{orb}~11.6 d, X-ray flaring
          with  P{flare}~2.7  hr,  and a "superorbital" X-ray periodicity
          P{super}~30.7  d.  The  objective of this paper is to show that
          the  puzzling  periodicities  in the system may be explained in
          the  context  of  scenarios  in  which tidal interactions drive
          oscillations   in  the  B-supergiant  star.  We  calculate  the
          solution  of  the  equations  of  motion for one layer of small
          surface  elements distributed along the equator of the star, as
          they  respond  to  the forces due to gas pressure, centrifugal,
          coriolis,  viscous forces, and the gravitational forces of both
          stars.  This  calculation  provides variability timescales that
          can  be  compared  with  the  observations. In addition, we use
          observational  data  obtained at the Observatorio Astron\'omico
          Nacional  en  San Pedro M\'artir (OAN/SPM) between 1993-2004 to
          determine  which  of  the  periodicities  may be present in the
          optical  region. We suggest that the tidal oscillations lead to
          a  structured stellar wind which, when fed to the neutron star,
          produces  the  X-ray  modulations.  The  connection between the
          stellar  oscillations  and  the modulation of the mass ejection
          may  lie  in  the  shear  energy  dissipation  generated by the
          tangential  motions that are produced by the tidal interaction,
          particularly  in  the tidal bulge region. The tidal oscillation
          scenario  weakens the case for 2S0114+650 containing a magnetar
          descendent.

          4522: A Local Analog to K+A Galaxies?
          Authors: Hugh H. Crowl, Jeffrey D.P. Kenney (Yale U.)

          Letters
          We  present  observations  of the stripped Virgo Cluster spiral
          NGC  4522,  a  clear,  nearby  example  of  a  galaxy currently
          undergoing  ISM-ICM  stripping.  Utilizing  SparsePak  integral
          field  spectroscopy  on  the  WIYN  3.5m telescope and GALEX UV
          photometry,  we  present  an  analysis of the outer disk (r > 3
          kpc)  stellar  population  of  this  galaxy,  beyond the HI and
          Halpha  truncation  radius.  We find that the star formation in
          the gas-stripped outer disk ceased very recently, ~100 Myr ago,
          in agreement with previous claims that this galaxy is currently
          being  stripped. At the time of this stripping, data and models
          suggest  that  the  galaxy  experienced a modest starburst. The
          stripping  is occurring in a region of the cluster well outside
          the  cluster  core,  likely because this galaxy is experiencing
          extreme  conditions  from  a  dynamic  ICM  due  to  an ongoing
          sub-cluster  merger.  The  outer  disk  has a spectrum of a K+A
          galaxy,   traditionally   observed   in  high-redshift  cluster
          galaxies.  In the case of NGC 4522, a K+A spectrum is formed by
          simple   stripping   of   the   interstellar  gas  by  the  hot
          intracluster medium. These data show K+A spectra can be created
          by  cluster  processes  and  that these processes likely extend
          beyond the cluster core.

          Astrometric   measurements   for   25  red  dwarf  systems  are
          presented,   including   the   first  definitive  trigonometric
          parallaxes  for 20 systems within 10 pc of the Sun, the horizon
          of  the  RECONS  sample.  The three nearest systems that had no
          previous  trigonometric  parallaxes  (other  than perhaps rough
          preliminary  efforts)  are  SO 0253+1652 (3.84 +/- 0.04 pc, the
          23rd  nearest  system),  SCR  1845-6357  AB  (3.85 +/- 0.02 pc,
          24th),  and  LHS 1723 (5.32 +/- 0.04 pc, 56th). In total, seven
          of the systems reported here rank among the nearest 100 stellar
          systems.  Supporting photometric and spectroscopic observations
          have been made to provide full characterization of the systems,
          including  complete  VRIJHK  photometry  and  spectral types. A
          study  of  the  variability  of  27 targets reveals six obvious
          variable  stars,  including  GJ  1207,  for which we observed a
          flare  event  in  the  V band that caused it to brighten by 1.7
          mag.
          Improved  parallaxes  for  GJ 54 AB and GJ 1061, both important
          members  of  the  10  pc  sample, are also reported. Definitive
          parallaxes for GJ 1001 A, GJ 633, and GJ 2130 ABC, all of which
          have  been  reported to be within 10 pc, indicate that they are
          beyond  10  pc.  From the analysis of systems with (previously)
          high trigonometric parallax errors, we conclude that parallaxes
          with errors in excess of 10 mas are insufficiently reliable for
          inclusion  in  the  RECONS  sample. The cumulative total of new
          additions  to  the 10 pc sample since 2000 is now 34 systems --
          28  by  the  RECONS  team  and  six by other groups. This total
          represents  a  net  increase  of  16%  in the number of stellar
          systems reliably known to be nearer than 10 pc.

          Title:  Correlation  between  Flux  and  Spectral  Index during
          Flares in Sagittarius A*
          Authors: Jonathan M. Bittner, Siming Liu, Christopher L. Fryer,
          Vahe Petrosian
          Comments: 26 pages, 11 figures
          Flares  in  Sagittarius A* are produced by hot plasmas within a
          few  Schwarzschild  radii of the supermassive black hole at the
          Galactic  center. The recent detection of a correlation between
          the  spectral index and flux during a near infrared (NIR) flare
          provides  a  means  to  conduct  detailed investigations of the
          plasma  heating and radiation processes. We study the evolution
          of  the electron distribution function under the influence of a
          turbulent  magnetic  field  in  a hot collisionless plasma. The
          magnetic  field,  presumably generated through instabilities in
          the  accretion  flow,  can  both  heat  the plasma via resonant
          wave-particle  coupling  and  cool the electrons via radiation.
          The  electron  distribution  can  generally  be approximated as
          relativistic   Maxwellian.   To   account   for   the  observed
          correlation,  we  find  that  the  magnetic  field  needs to be
          anti-correlated  with  the  electron  ''temperature''.  NIR and
          X-ray  light  curves  are  produced for a cooling and a heating
          phase.  The  model  predicts simultaneous flare activity in the
          NIR  and  X-ray bands, which can be compared with observations.
          These  results  can  be applied to MHD simulations to study the
          radiative  characteristics of collisionless plasmas, especially
          accretion flows in low-luminosity AGNs.

          Comments:  54  pages  with  18 postscript figures. Submitted to

          Two-dimensional  magnetohydrodynamic  simulations are performed
          using  the  ZEUS-2D  code  to  investigate  the  dynamics  of a
          collapsar that generates a GRB jet, taking account of realistic
          equation  of  state,  neutrino  cooling  and heating processes,
          magnetic fields, and gravitational force from the central black
          hole  and  self  gravity.  It  is  found  that neutrino heating
          processes  are  not so efficient to launch a jet in this study.
          It is also found that a jet is launched mainly by B_\phi fields
          that are amplified by the winding-up effect. However, since the
          ratio  of  total energy relative to the rest mass energy in the
          jet  is  not  so  high as several hundred, we conclude that the
          jets  seen  in  this  study  are  not be a GRB jet. This result
          suggests  that  general  relativistic  effects,  which  are not
          included  in  this  study,  will be important to generate a GRB
          jet.  Also,  the  accretion disk with magnetic fields may still
          play  an  important  role  to  launch  a  GRB  jet,  although a
          simulation  for  much  longer  physical time (\sim 10-100 s) is
          required  to confirm this effect. It is shown that considerable
          amount of 56Ni is synthesized in the accretion disk. Thus there
          will  be  a  possibility  for  the  accretion  disk  to  supply
          sufficient amount of 56Ni required to explain the luminosity of
          a  hypernova. Also, it is shown that neutron-rich matter due to
          electron captures with high entropy per baryon is ejected along
          the  polar  axis.  Moreover,  it  is  found  that  the electron
          fraction becomes larger than 0.5 around the polar axis near the
          black hole by \nu_e capture at the region. Thus there will be a
          possibility  that  r-process  and  r/p-process  nucleosynthesis
          occur  at these regions. Finally, much neutrons will be ejected
          from  the  jet,  which  suggests  that signals from the neutron
          decays  may  be  observed  as  the delayed bump of afterglow or
          gamma-rays.

          We  present a grid of radiation transfer models of axisymmetric
          young  stellar objects (YSOs), covering a wide range of stellar
          masses  (from  0.1Msun to 50Msun) and evolutionary stages (from
          the  early  envelope infall stage to the late disk-only stage).
          The  grid  consists  of 20,000 YSO models, with spectral energy
          distributions  (SEDs)  and polarization spectra computed at ten
          viewing  angles for each model, resulting in a total of 200,000
          SEDs. [...]. These models are publicly available on a dedicated
          WWW server: this http URL . In this paper we summarize the main
          features  of  our  models,  as  well as the range of parameters
          explored.  [...].  We  examine  the  dependence of the spectral
          indices  of  the model SEDs on envelope accretion rate and disk
          mass.  In addition, we show variations of spectral indices with
          stellar  temperature, disk inner radius, and disk flaring power
          for  a subset of disk-only models. We also examine how changing
          the wavelength range of data used to calculate spectral indices
          affects  their  values. We show sample color-color plots of the
          entire  grid as well as simulated clusters at various distances
          with  typical  {\it  Spitzer Space Telescope} sensitivities. We
          find  that  young  embedded  sources  generally  occupy a large
          region  of  color-color  space  due  to inclination and stellar
          temperature  effects.  Disk  sources occupy a smaller region of
          color-color  space,  but  overlap substantially with the region
          occupied  by  embedded  sources,  especially  in  the near- and
          mid-IR.  We  identify  regions  in  color-color space where our
          models indicate that only sources at a given evolutionary stage
          should lie. [...].

          Neutral  fluorine  (F  I)  lines  are identified in the optical
          spectra  of  cool EHe stars. These are the first identification
          of  F  I  lines  in  a  star's  spectrum, and provide the first
          measurement  of  fluorine  abundances in EHe stars. The results
          show   that   fluorine   is  overabundant  in  EHe  stars.  The
          overabundance  of  fluorine provides evidence for the synthesis
          of  fluorine  in these stars, that is discussed in the light of
          asymptotic  giant  branch  (AGB) evolution, and the expectation
          from accretion of an He white dwarf by a C-O white dwarf.

          Title:  Hyperfine  structure  radio  lines  in  spectra  of hot
          interstellar and warm-hot intergalactic gas
          Authors: R. A. Sunyaev (MPA, Iki), D. Docenko (MPA)
          Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Astronomy Letters
          Hyperfine structure lines of highly-charged ions may open a new
          window  in  observations of hot rarefied astrophysical plasmas.
          In  this  paper  we discuss spectral lines of isotopes and ions
          abundant   at  temperatures  10^5-10^7  K,  characteristic  for
          warm-hot   intergalactic   medium,   hot  interstellar  medium,
          starburst   galaxies   and   young  and  middle-aged  supernova
          remnants.  Observations  of  these  lines might complement soft
          X-ray observations with micro-calorimeters, but, in contrast to
          soft X-rays, they are not obscured by the Galactic interstellar
          medium  and  allow  to study observed target bulk and turbulent
          motions with much higher spectroscopic and angular resolution.
          We  estimate  feasibility  of  hyperfine structure emission and
          absorption  line  observations from these astrophysical sources
          and   gamma-ray   burst  afterglows  using  simple  theoretical
          estimates   of   spectral  line  absorption  cross-section  and
          emissivity  accounting  for  major  processes  populating upper
          hyperfine sublevel. Using modern and near-future instruments it
          appears  possible  both  to observe absorption line of 14-N VII
          (rest  wavelength  5.652  mm)  from  the warm-hot intergalactic
          medium  and  galactic  halos  at  redshifts  above  z=0.15  and
          emission lines of several less abundant isotopes from young and
          middle-aged supernova remnants.

          The  recent  development  of numerical schemes for Relativistic
          MHD  (RMHD)  allows  us  to  model the acceleration and outflow
          properties  of  winds  from compact sources. Theoretical models
          suggest  that  acceleration  and  collimation  of  the flow are
          extremely  inefficient  when  the  speed  is  close  to $c$, in
          contrast  with  many  observations.  Numerical  results  for an
          axisymmetric rotator, both in the case of monopolar and dipolar
          magnetic field will be presented, suggesting that in ideal RMHD
          acceleration   is  indeed  inefficient.  I  will  also  mention
          numerical   challenges   and   stability  problems  of  present
          simulations. Finally I will discuss the interaction of a pulsar
          wind  with  the  surrounding  SNR. I will present emission maps
          based  on  numerical  simulations of the flow inside the nebula
          and  how  they  can  be used in comparison with observations to
          derive  informations  about  the properties of pulsar winds far
          away from the source.

          We present a sample of 1035 thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts
          from  observations  of  45 accreting neutron stars by the Rossi
          X-ray  Timing  Explorer  (RXTE), spanning more than nine years.
          This  sample  contains for the first time confirmed examples of
          burst   ignition  in  each  of  the  three  regimes  identified
          theoretically:  H-ignition  of  mixed H/He fuel, He-ignition in
          pure He, and He-ignition in mixed H/He fuel. We combined bursts
          from multiple sources to investigate the variation of the burst
          rate,  energetics,  and  time  scale as a function of accretion
          rate. We found a peak burst rate of 0.2-0.3/hr for a normalised
          peak flux of gamma approx. 0.02-0.06, corresponding to a source
          luminosity of (0.3-2)e37 ergs/cm^2/s.
          For    35   sources   with   bursts   exhibiting   photospheric
          radius-expansion,   we  estimated  the  likely  distance  range
          arising  from  the  possible  range  of the Eddington limit. We
          found  that in general the peak flux of radius-expansion bursts
          from  individual  sources  is  not  constant,  varying  with  a
          fractional  standard  deviation  of  14%  in  the mean. We also
          examined  the  bursts  with  very  short  (<~30 min) recurrence
          times.  We  found evidence for two distinct populations of such
          bursts,  one of faint bursts following a much stronger burst by
          6-18   min,   and  another  with  comparable  intensity  bursts
          separated  by  7  min  or  more.  We describe the properties of
          bursts observed from 5 new bursters discovered by RXTE, as well
          as  two  new  transient  outbursts of previously known sources.
          Finally,  we  searched  for  burst  oscillations  at  the known
          oscillation   frequencies   in  14  sources.  We  describe  the
          distribution  of  the  oscillation  amplitudes  as  well as the
          stages of each burst in which the oscillations are detected.

          IV. Direct Integration of Strong Interactions
          Authors:  John  M.  Fregeau,  Frederic  A.  Rasio (Northwestern

          Comments: Submitted to ApJ. 16 pages, 18 figures, in emulateapj
          We   study   the   dynamical  evolution  of  globular  clusters
          containing  populations of primordial binaries, using our newly
          updated  Monte  Carlo cluster evolution code with the inclusion
          of  direct  integration  of  binary scattering interactions. We
          describe the modifications we have made to the code, as well as
          improvements  we  have  made to the core Monte Carlo method. We
          present several test calculations to verify the validity of the
          new code, and perform many comparisons with previous analytical
          and numerical work in the literature. We simulate the evolution
          of a large grid of models, with a wide range of initial cluster
          profiles,  and  with  binary fractions ranging from 0 to 1, and
          compare  with  observations  of  Galactic globular clusters. We
          find  that  our  code  yields  excellent  agreement with direct
          N-body  simulations  of  clusters with primordial binaries, but
          yields  some  results  that  differ  significantly  from  other
          approximate  methods. Our results for the structural parameters
          of  clusters  during  the  binary-burning phase are outside the
          range of parameters for observed clusters, implying that either
          clusters   are   born  significantly  more  or  less  centrally
          concentrated than has been previously considered, or that there
          are  additional  physical  processes beyond two-body relaxation
          and    binary   interactions   that   affect   the   structural
          characteristics of clusters.

          Three  binaries are now established sources of emission at very
          high  energies  (>1e11 eV). They are composed of a massive star
          and   a  compact  object.  The  emission  can  be  due  to  the
          interaction  of  the  relativistic  wind from a young ms pulsar
          with the stellar wind of the companion, by which rotation-power
          ends  up  as  non-thermal  flux. Variations at VHE energies are
          explained  as  due  to gamma-gamma absorption and/or changes in
          shock  location along the orbit. Resolved radio emission is due
          to cooling particles trailing the pulsar.

          Spectral  properties  of  super-Eddington  accretion  flows are
          investigated  by means of a parallel line-of-sight calculation.
          The  subjacent  model,  taken  from  two-dimensional  radiation
          hydrodynamic simulations by Ohsuga et al. (2005), consists of a
          disc  accretion  region  and  an  extended atmosphere with high
          velocity  outflows. The non-gray radiative transfer equation is
          solved,  including  relativistic  effects,  by applying the FLD
          approximation.
          The   calculated   spectrum   is   composed   of   a   thermal,
          blackbody-like emission from the disc which depends sensitively
          on  the  inclination  angle,  and  of  high  energy  X-ray  and
          gamma-ray  emission  from  the atmosphere. We find mild beaming
          effects  in the thermal radiation for small inclination angles.
          If  we  compare  the  face-on  case  with the edge-on case, the
          average  photon energy is larger by a factor of ~1.7 due mainly
          to  Doppler boosting, while the photon number density is larger
          by   a   factor  of  ~3.7  due  mainly  to  anisotropic  matter
          distribution  around  the  central  black  hole.  This gives an
          explanation  for  the observed X-ray temperatures of ULXs which
          are   too   high   to   be   explained   in  the  framework  of
          intermediate-mass black holes.
          While  the  main features of the thermal spectral component are
          consistent  with  more  detailed calculations of slim accretion
          discs,  the atmosphere induces major changes in the high-energy
          part,  which  cannot be reproduced by existing models. In order
          to  interpret  observational  data  properly, simple approaches
          like the Eddington-Barbier approximation cannot be applied.

          Title: The Enrichment History of Baryons in the Universe
          Authors: Romeel Dav, Benjamin D. Oppenheimer (Arizona)
          Comments: 9 pages, submitted to MNRAS
          We  present  predictions for the cosmic metal budget in various
          phases   of   baryons   from   redshift  z=6-0,  taken  from  a
          cosmological    hydrodynamic   simulation   that   includes   a
          well-constrained  model for enriched galactic outflows. We find
          that  substantial amounts of metals are found in every baryonic
          phase  at all epochs, with diffuse intergalactic gas dominating
          the  metal  budget  at  early  epochs  and  stars  and halo gas
          dominating  at  recent  epochs. We provide a full accounting of
          metals  in  the context of the missing metals problem at z~2.5,
          showing  that  ~40%  of  the  metals  are  in galaxies, and the
          remainder is divided between diffuse IGM gas and shocked gas in
          halos  and  filamentary  structures. Comparisons with available
          observations  of  metallicity and metal mass fraction evolution
          show  broad agreement. We predict stars have a mean metallicity
          of  one-tenth  solar  already at z=6, which increases slowly to
          one-half  solar  today,  while  stars  just  forming today have
          typically  solar  metallicity.  Our  HI column density-weighted
          mean   metallicity   (comparable   to  Damped  Ly-alpha  system
          metallicities)  slowly  increases  from  one-tenth to one-third
          solar  from  z=6-1, then falls to one-quarter solar at z=0. The
          global mean metallicity of the universe tracks ~50% higher than
          that  of  the  diffuse  phase  down to z~1, and by z=0 it has a
          value  around  one-tenth  solar.  Metals  move  towards  higher
          densities  and  temperatures with time, peaking around the mean
          cosmic  density  at  z=2  and  an overdensity of 100 at z=0. We
          study  how  carbon  and oxygen ions trace the path of metals in
          phase  space,  and  show  that OIII-OVII lines provide the most
          practical  option  for constraining intergalactic medium metals
          at z<2.

          Identifying  binaries  among runaway O- and B-type stars offers
          valuable  insight into the evolution of open clusters and close
          binary  stars. Here we present a spectroscopic investigation of
          12  known  or  suspected  binaries  among  field and runaway OB
          stars.  We  find  new  orbital  solutions for five single-lined
          spectroscopic  binaries (HD 1976, HD 14633, HD 15137, HD 37737,
          and HD 52533), and we classify two stars thought to be binaries
          (HD  30614  and  HD  188001)  as  single stars. In addition, we
          reinvestigate   their  runaway  status  using  our  new  radial
          velocity  data  with  the  UCAC2  proper motion catalogs. Seven
          stars  in  our  study  appear  to  have been ejected from their
          birthplaces,   and   at  least  three  of  these  runaways  are
          spectroscopic  binaries  and  are  of great interest for future
          study.

          Title: Spin-orbit interactions in black-hole binaries
          Authors: M. Campanelli, C. O. Lousto, Y. Zlochower
          Comments: 9 pages, revtex4
          We  perform  numerical  simulations  of  black-hole binaries to
          study  the exchange of spin and orbital angular momentum during
          the  last, highly nonlinear, stages of the coalescence process.
          To  calculate  the transfer of angular momentum from orbital to
          spin,  we  start with a configuration of initially non-spinning
          holes  in  a  quasicircular orbit. We find that each individual
          black  hole horizon acquires a non-vanishing spin and that this
          spin  is two orders of magnitude smaller than what is needed to
          tidally  lock the binary into a corotation state. We also study
          the  converse  transfer  from spin into orbital motion. In this
          case,  we  start the simulations with parallel, highly-spinning
          non-boosted  black holes. As the collision proceeds, the system
          acquires  a  non-head-on  orbital  motion,  due  to  spin-orbit
          coupling,  that  leads to the radiation of angular momentum. We
          are  able to accurately measure the energy and angular momentum
          losses and model their dependence on the initial spins.

          Correlation  between  Spectral Hardness and Apparent Luminosity
          in Gamma-ray Bursts
          Authors:  C. Thompson (CITA), P. Meszaros (PSU), M.J. Rees (IOA
          Cambridge)
          Comments: 29 pages, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal
          We  present an interpretation of the phenomenological relations
          between the spectral peak, isotropic luminosity and duration of
          long  gamma  ray  bursts  that have been discovered by Amati et
          al.,  Ghirlanda  et  al., Firmani et al., and Liang & Zhang. In
          our  proposed model, a jet undergoes internal dissipation which
          prevents  its bulk Lorentz factor from exceeding 1/theta (theta
          being  the jet opening angle) until it escapes from the core of
          its  progenitor star, at a radius of order 1e10 cm; dissipation
          may  continue at larger radii. The dissipated radiation will be
          partially   thermalized,  and  we  identify  its  thermal  peak
          (Doppler  boosted  by  the  outflow)  with  E_pk. The radiation
          comes,   in  effect,  from  within  the  jet  photosphere.  The
          non-thermal,  high  energy part of the GRB emission arises from
          Comptonization  of this radiation by relativistic electrons and
          positrons  outside  the  effective  photosphere. This model can
          account  naturally  not only for the surprisingly small scatter
          in   the   various  claimed  correlations,  but  also  for  the
          normalization,  as  well  as  the  slopes.  It then has further
          implications  for  the  jet  energy,  the  limiting jet Lorentz
          factor, and the relation of the energy, opening angle and burst
          duration  to  the  mass  and  radius  of  the  stellar  stellar
          progenitor.  The  observed  relation  between  pulse  width and
          photon  frequency can be reproduced by inverse-Compton emission
          at  ~  1e14  cm  from  the  engine,  but  there are significant
          constraints  on  the  energy  distribution  and isotropy of the
          radiating particles.

          the  150  and 220-GHz telescopes have 256 horns each. The horns
          are  arranged in a hexagonal array and feed a polarimeter which
          uses finline-coupled TES bolometers as detectors. To detect the
          two  polarizations the 97-GHz telescope has 320 detectors while
          the  150  and  220-GHz  telescopes  have 512 detectors each. To
          achieve  the  target NEPs (1.5, 2.5, and 4.5x10^-17 W/rtHz) the
          detectors  are  cooled  to  100  mK  for  the  97  and  150-GHz
          polarimeters  and  230  mK  for  the  220-GHz polarimeter. Each
          detector  is  fabricated  as  a  single  chip  to ensure a 100%
          operational  focal plane. The detectors are contained in linear
          modules  made  of copper which form split-block waveguides. The
          detector   modules   contain   16  or  20  detectors  each  for
          compatibility  with  the  hexagonal  arrays  of  horns  in  the
          telescopes'  focal  planes.  Each  detector  module  contains a
          time-division  SQUID  multiplexer  to  read  out the detectors.
          Further amplification of the multiplexed signals is provided by
          SQUID  series  arrays. The first prototype detectors for CLOVER
          operate  with  a  bath  temperature  of  230 mK and are used to
          validate  the  detector  design  as  well  as  the  polarimeter
          technology.  We  describe  the  design of the CLOVER detectors,
          detector   blocks,   and   readout,   and  present  preliminary
          measurements of the prototype detectors performance.

          Title: Optical and Infrared Emission from the AXPs and SGRs
          Authors: Unal Ertan, Sirin Caliskan
          Comments: 12 pages, accepted for publication in ApJ Letters
          We  show  that  the irradiated accretion disk model can account
          for  all the optical and infrared observations of the anomalous
          X-ray  pulsars  in  the  persistent  state.  Model  fits do not
          constrain the outer disk radii, while placing an upper limit to
          the  inner  disk  radii, and thus to the strength of the dipole
          component  of the stellar magnetic field. While magnetar fields
          (B_*  > 10^{14} G) in higher multipoles are compatible with the
          irradiated  disk  model, magnetic dipole components of magnetar
          strength are not consistent with optical data.

          Title:  Measuring  coalescing  massive  binary black holes with
          gravitational waves: The impact of spin-induced precession
          Authors: Ryan N. Lang, Scott A. Hughes
          Comments: 22 pages, 10 figures
          The  coalescence of massive black holes generates gravitational
          waves  (GWs)  that  will be measurable by space-based detectors
          such  as LISA to large redshifts. The spins of a binary's black
          holes  have  an important impact on its waveform. Specifically,
          geodetic   and  gravitomagnetic  effects  cause  the  spins  to
          precess;  this  precession  then modulates the waveform, adding
          periodic  structure  which encodes useful information about the
          binary's  members.  Following  pioneering  work  by Vecchio, we
          examine  the  impact  upon  GW  measurements of including these
          precession-induced  modulations  in the waveform model. We find
          that  the  additional periodicity due to spin precession breaks
          degeneracies  among  certain  parameters, greatly improving the
          accuracy  with  which they may be measured. In particular, mass
          measurements  are  improved  tremendously,  by  one  to several
          orders  of  magnitude. Localization of the source on the sky is
          also  improved,  though not as much -- low redshift systems can
          be localized to an ellipse which is roughly $10- {a few} \times
          10$  arcminutes  in  the  long direction and a factor of 2 -- 5
          smaller   in   the   short  direction.  Though  not  a  drastic
          improvement relative to analyses which neglect spin precession,
          even   modest   gains   in  source  localization  will  greatly
          facilitate  searches  for  electromagnetic  counterparts  to GW
          events.  Determination  of  distance  to the source is likewise
          improved:  We  find  that relative error in measured luminosity
          distance  is  commonly  $\sim 0.1-0.4%$ at $z \sim 1$. Finally,
          with the inclusion of precession, we find that the magnitude of
          the  spins  themselves  can  typically  be  determined  for low
          redshift   systems  with  an  accuracy  of  about  $0.1-10  %$,
          depending  on the spin value, allowing accurate surveys of mass
          and spin evolution over cosmic time.

          Despite  the  common  picture  of an early-type dwarf (dE) as a
          quiescent  galaxy  with  no  star  formation and little gas, we
          identify  23 dEs that have blue central colors caused by recent
          or  ongoing  star  formation in our sample of 476 Virgo cluster
          dEs.  In  addition,  14  objects that were mostly classified as
          (candidate)  BCDs  have  similar  properties. Among the certain
          cluster  members, the dEs with blue centers reach a fraction of
          more  than  15%  of  the  dE  population  at  brighter  (B<=16)
          magnitudes.  A  spectral analysis of the centers of 16 galaxies
          reveals   in  all  cases  an  underlying  old  population  that
          dominates  the  mass,  with M(old)>=90% for all but one object.
          Therefore  the  majority  of  these  galaxies  will appear like
          ordinary  dEs  within  ~one  Gigayear  or  less  after the last
          episode  of  star  formation. Their overall gas content is less
          than  that of dwarf irregular galaxies, but higher than that of
          ordinary  dEs. Their flattening distribution suggests the shape
          of  a  thick  disk, similar to what has been found for dEs with
          disk  features  in  Paper  I  of  this  series. Their projected
          spatial  distribution  shows  no  central clustering, and their
          distribution  with  projected  local  density  follows  that of
          irregular galaxies, indicative of an unrelaxed population. This
          is  corroborated by their velocity distribution, which displays
          two  side  peaks  characteristic  of  recent infall. We discuss
          possible  formation mechanisms (ram-pressure stripping, tidally
          induced  star  formation,  harassment)  that  might  be able to
          explain  both  the disk shape and the central star formation of
          the dEs with blue centers.

          Title:  Spontaneous  axisymmetry  breaking of Saturn's external
          magnetic field
          Authors: Peter Goldreich, Alison J. Farmer
          Comments: 24 pages, 2 figures, submitted to JGRA
          Saturn's  magnetic field is remarkably axisymmetric. Its dipole
          axis  is  inclined  by  less  than  0.2 deg with respect to its
          rotation axis. Rotationally driven convection of magnetospheric
          plasma  breaks  the axisymmetry of its external magnetic field.
          Field  aligned  currents  transfer  angular  momentum  from the
          planet  to  a  tongue of outflowing plasma. This transfer slows
          the  rate of rotation of the ionosphere relative to that of the
          underlying  atmosphere.  The  currents  are  the source for the
          non-axisymmetric  components  of the field. The common rotation
          rates  of  these components and Saturn's kilometric radio (SKR)
          bursts  is  that of the plasma near the orbit of Enceladus, and
          by  extension the rotation rate in the ionosphere to which this
          plasma  is  coupled.  That  rate  tells  us  nothing  about the
          rotation  rate  of  Saturn's  deep  interior. Of that we remain
          ignorant.  Magnetic  perturbations  with  magnitudes similar to
          those  observed  by Cassini are produced for Mdot ~ 10^4 g/s, a
          value similar to estimates for the rate of production of plasma
          from Saturn's E-ring. Enhancement of the SKR occurs in a narrow
          range of longitudes where the tip of the outgoing plasma stream
          connects  to  the  auroral  ionosphere via field lines that are
          bowed outwards by currents that supply the plasma's centripetal
          acceleration. (abridged)

          Telescope  Imaging Spectrograph ultraviolet spectroscopy of the
          QSO/galaxy pair SBS 1122+594/IC 691. The QSO sight line lies at
          a  position  angle  of  27  degrees  from the minor axis of the
          nearby  dwarf  starburst  galaxy IC 691 (cz_gal = 1204+-3 km/s,
          L_B  ~  0.09  L*, current star formation rate = 0.08-0.24 solar
          masses  per  year) and 33 kpc (6.6 arcmin) from its nucleus. We
          find  that  IC  691 has an H I mass of M_HI = (3.6+-0.1) x 10^8
          solar masses and a dynamical mass of M_dyn = (3.1+-0.5) x 10^10
          solar   masses.  The  UV  spectrum  of  SBS  1122+594  shows  a
          metal-line  (Ly-alpha  + C IV) absorber near the redshift of IC
          691  at  cz_abs  =  1110+-30  km/s.  Since  IC  691  is a dwarf
          starburst  and the SBS 1122+594 sight line lies in the expected
          location for an outflowing wind, we propose that the best model
          for producing this metal-line absorber is a starburst wind from
          IC  691.  We  place  consistent  metallicity  limits  on IC 691
          ([Z/Zsun]  ~  -0.7)  and  the  metal-line  absorber ([Z/Zsun] <
          -0.3).  We  also  find that the galaxy's escape velocity at the
          absorber  location  is  v_esc  =  80+-10 km/s and derive a wind
          velocity  of  v_w  =  160+-50 km/s. Thus, the evidence suggests
          that  IC  691  produces  an unbound starburst wind that escapes
          from its gravitational potential to transport metals and energy
          to the surrounding intergalactic medium.

          Title:   Optical   Intensity  Interferometry  with  Atmospheric
          Cherenkov Telescope Arrays
          Authors: S. Le Bohec, J. Holder
          Comments: Accepted for publicaion in ApJ
          In the 1970s, the Narrabri intensity interferometer was used to
          measure   32   stellar   diameters;   some   as  small  as  0.4
          milli-arc-seconds (mas). The interferometer consisted of a pair
          of  6.5m  telescopes  with  relatively crude optics, similar to
          those  currently  in  use  as  Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
          (ACT).  We  explore  the  possibility  of implementing a modern
          intensity  interferometer on an ACT array. Developments in fast
          digital  signal  processing  technology  now make such a system
          relatively easy to implement, and provide improved sensitivity.
          Allowing  measurements  at short wavelength (<400nm), with long
          baselines  (>  100m), which are still challenging for Michelson
          interferometers,  present  ACT  arrays  could  be used to probe
          angular  structures as small as ~0.2mas, and smaller with large
          array  projects  already  being  discussed.  This would provide
          measurements    of    stellar    diameters,   binary   systems,
          circumstellar   environments  and,  possibly,  stellar  surface
          features. ACT arrays could be used as intensity interferometers
          during  bright  moon  periods,  providing  valuable  scientific
          output  for  little  expense  and  no  impact  on the gamma-ray
          observing schedule.

          We  present  ground-based infrared K- (2-2.5 micron) and L-band
          (2.8-4.1  micron)  spectroscopy,  as  well  as  interferometric
          observations  at 3mm, for the individual merging components (A,
          B,  and  C)  of  the  luminous  infrared  galaxy  Arp  299.  We
          investigate  the  presence  and location of the putative buried
          active  galactic  nucleus  (AGN)  inferred  from previous X-ray
          observations  at E > 10 keV. Our sub-arcsec-resolution infrared
          spectra  clearly reveal that the putative buried AGN resides in
          the  nucleus  B1  (a  subcomponent  of  B), based on a very low
          equivalent  width of 3.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
          emission,  a weak 2.3 micron CO absorption feature, and a large
          time  variation  of  the  K-  and  L-band  continuum fluxes. In
          component  C, we find strong 3.1 micron ice absorption at L and
          weak  2.3  micron  CO  absorption at K, as expected in a buried
          AGN; however, a centrally concentrated young super star cluster
          is  an  alternative  possibility because of the modest infrared
          luminosity and non-galaxy-nucleus nature of this component. The
          infrared  K-  and  L-band  spectra  of  the  infrared brightest
          nucleus,  A, are typical of a normal starburst with no explicit
          AGN signatures. Our interferometric observations simultaneously
          obtain  HCN  (J=1-0)  and  HCO+  (J=1-0)  emission lines with 4
          arcsec    resolution,   and   we   find   the   HCN   to   HCO+
          brightness-temperature  ratios  to  be as low as those found in
          starburst  nuclei  in  all  the major merging components of Arp
          299. The low ratio even in the AGN-hosting nucleus B may be due
          to the presence of a large amount of high-density molecular gas
          whose  chemistry  is  dominated by coexisting starbursts and/or
          shocks, rather than by the central strong X-ray-emitting AGN.

          Title: Neutron star binaries and long duration gamma-ray bursts
          Authors: Andrew J. Levan, Melvyn B. Davies, Andrew R. King
          Comments: 7 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Cosmological long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are thought
          to  originate from the core collapse to black holes of stripped
          massive   stars.   Those   with   sufficient  rotation  form  a
          centrifugally-supported torus whose collapse powers the GRB. We
          investigate  the role of tidal locking within a tight binary as
          a  source  of  the necessary angular momentum. We find that the
          binary  orbit  must  be  no  wider than a few solar radii for a
          torus  to  form upon core collapse. Comparing this criterion to
          the  observed  population  of  binaries  containing two compact
          objects  suggests  that rotation may have been important in the
          formation  of  up  to  50%  of  the  observed systems. As these
          systems  created  a  neutron  star  and  not  a black hole they
          presumably  did  not  produce  highly luminous GRBs. We suggest
          instead  that  they  make  the subset of GRBs in the relatively
          local universe which have much lower luminosity.

          Encounters

          Letters
          The   formation   of   brown   dwarfs  via  encounters  between
          proto-stars  has  been confirmed with high-resolution numerical
          simulations   with   a  restricted  treatment  of  the  thermal
          conditions.  The  new  results indicate that young brown dwarfs
          (BDs)  formed  this  way  are  disk-like  and  often  reside in
          multiple systems. The newly-formed proto-BDs disks are up to 18
          AU   in  size  and  spin  rapidly  making  small-scale  bipolar
          outflows, fragmentation and the possible formation of planetary
          companions  likely  as have recently been observed for BDs. The
          object masses range from 2 to 73 Jupiter masses, distributed in
          a  manner consistent with the observed sub-stellar initial mass
          function.   The   simulations  usually  form  multiple  BDs  on
          eccentric   orbits   about   a   star.   One  such  system  was
          hierarchical,  a  BD  binary  in orbit around a star, which may
          explain  recently  observed  hierarchical systems. One third of
          the   BDs   were   unbound  after  a  few  thousand  years  and
          interactions  among  orbiting  BDs may eject more or add to the
          number  of  binaries.  Improvements  over  prior  work  include
          resolution  down  to  a Jupiter mass, self-consistent models of
          the  vertical  structure  of  the  initial  disks  and  careful
          attention to avoid artificial fragmentation.

          magnetohydrodynamic  (MHD) simulations. We present the detailed
          analysis  of  the  MHD  waves,  the  cylindrical  radial  force
          balance,  and  the  collimation  of  magnetic  tower  jets.  As
          magnetic  energy is injected into a small central volume over a
          finite  amount  of  time,  the  magnetic fields expand down the
          background  density  gradient,  forming a collimated jet and an
          expanded  ``lobe''  due  to the gradually decreasing background
          density  and  pressure. Both the jet and lobes are magnetically
          dominated.  In  addition, the injection and expansion produce a
          hydrodynamic  shock  wave that is moving ahead of and enclosing
          the  magnetic  tower  jet.  This shock can eventually break the
          hydrostatic  equilibrium  in  the  ambient  medium  and cause a
          global  gravitational  contraction. This contraction produces a
          strong  compression at the head of the magnetic tower front and
          helps to collimate radially to produce a slender-shaped jet. At
          the outer edge of the jet, the magnetic pressure is balanced by
          the background (modified) gas pressure, without any significant
          contribution from the hoop stress. On the other hand, along the
          central  axis  of the jet, hoop stress is the dominant force in
          shaping  the  central  collimation of the poloidal current. The
          system,   which  possesses  a  highly  wound  helical  magnetic
          configuration,  never  quite  reaches  a force-free equilibrium
          state  though the evolution becomes much slower at late stages.
          The    simulations   were   performed   without   any   initial
          perturbations  so  the  overall  structures  of  the jet remain
          mostly axisymmetric.

          Title:  Diamonds  and  PAHs in the Circumstellar Environment of

          We  report  long-slit  spectroscopic observations of the Herbig
          Ae/Be  star  Elias 1 in the 3.2-3.6 mum region covering the C-H
          stretch  emission  features of hydrogen-terminated diamonds and
          PAHs.  The  data  were  recorded  at UKIRT using UIST and yield
          information  on  the profiles and intensities of the bands as a
          function  of  offset  along the N-S and E-W axes centred on the
          close  binary.  The  diamond  and  nearby IR continuum emission
          arises  from  a symmetrical inner core region (< 0.34 arcsec or
          48 AU). The 3.3 mum PAH emission is extended along the E-W axis
          up  to  ~  100 AU each side of the star. This result supports a
          suggestion  of  Haas,  Leinert  &  Richichi  (1997)  of  an E-W
          oriented bipolar nebula in Elias 1.

          We  present here simultaneous INTEGRAL/RXTE observations of Sco
          X-1,  and  in  particular a study of the hard X-ray emission of
          the source and its correlation with the position in the Z-track
          of  the  X-ray color-color diagram. We find that the hard X-ray
          (above  about  30  keV)  emission  of Sco X-1 is dominated by a
          power-law  component with a photon index of ~3. The flux in the
          power-law component slightly decreases when the source moves in
          the  color-color  diagram  in  the sense of increasing inferred
          mass  accretion  rate  from the horizontal branch to the normal
          branch/flaring  branch  vertex.  It  becomes  not significantly
          detectable  in the flaring branch, where its flux has decreased
          by  about  an  order  of magnitude. These results present close
          analogies to the behavior of GX 17+2, one of so-called Sco-like
          Z  sources.  Finally, the hard power law in the spectrum of Sco
          X-1  does  not  show any evidence of a high energy cutoff up to
          100 - 200 keV, strongly suggesting a non-thermal origin of this
          component.

          We  present  the  detection and modeling of more than 70 far-IR
          pure rotational lines of water vapor, including the 18O and 17O
          isotopologues,  towards  Orion  KL. Observations were performed
          with  the  Long  Wavelength  Spectrometer  Fabry-Perot (LWS/FP;
          R~6800-9700)  on  board  the  Infrared  Space Observatory (ISO)
          between  ~43  and  ~197 um. The water line profiles evolve from
          P-Cygni  type  profiles  (even  for  the  H2O18  lines) to pure
          emission at wavelengths above ~100 um. We find that most of the
          water  emission/absorption  arises from an extended flow of gas
          expanding  at 25+-5 kms^-1. Non-local radiative transfer models
          show  that  much  of  the  water  excitation  and  line profile
          formation is driven by the dust continuum emission. The derived
          beam  averaged  water  abundance is 2-3x10^-5. The inferred gas
          temperature  Tk=80-100  K  suggests  that: (i) water could have
          been  formed  in  the  "plateau"  by  gas phase neutral-neutral
          reactions  with  activation  barriers if the gas was previously
          heated  (e.g. by shocks) to >500 K and/or (ii) H2O formation in
          the  outflow  is  dominated  by  in-situ  evaporation  of grain
          water-ice  mantles and/or (iii) H2O was formed in the innermost
          and  warmer  regions  (e.g.  the  hot core) and was swept up in
          ~1000 yr, the dynamical timescale of the outflow.

          Title:  Very  Massive  Close Binaries and the Puzzling Temporal
          Evolution of 14N in the Solar Neighbourhood
          Authors: D. Vanbeveren, E. De Donder
          Comments: 15 pages, 9 figures, accepted for New Astronomy
          Low metallicity very massive stars with an initial mass between
          140  Mo  and  260  Mo  can be subdivided into two groups: those
          between  140  Mo  and  200  Mo which produce a relatively small
          amount  of  Fe, and those with a mass between 200 Mo and 260 Mo
          where  the  Fe-yield  ejected during the supernova explosion is
          enormous. We first demonstrate that the inclusion of the second
          group   into  a  chemical  evolutionary  model  for  the  Solar
          Neighbourhood  predicts an early temporal evolution of Fe which
          is at variance with observations whereas it can not be excluded
          that the first group could have been present. We then show that
          a  low  metallicity binary with very massive components (with a
          mass corresponding to the first group) can be an efficient site
          of  primary  14N  production  through the explosion of a binary
          component  that  has  been  polluted  by  the  pair instability
          supernova  ejecta  of  its  companion.  When we implement these
          massive  binary  14N  yields  in a chemical evolution model, we
          conclude  that  very  massive  close  binaries may be important
          sites  of  14N  enrichment  during  the  early evolution of the
          Galaxy.

          [Abridged]   Over   the   past  two  decades  observations  and
          theoretical simulations have established a global frame-work of
          galaxy  formation and evolution in the young Universe. Galaxies
          formed as baryonic gas cooled at the centres of collapsing dark
          matter  halos.  Mergers  of halos led to the build up of galaxy
          mass.  A  major  step  forward  in  understanding  these issues
          requires  well  resolved  physical  information  on  individual
          galaxies  at  high  redshift.  Here  we report adaptive optics,
          spectroscopic  observations  of  a representative luminous star
          forming galaxy when the Universe was only twenty percent of its
          age.  The superior angular resolution of these data reveals the
          physical  and dynamical properties of a high redshift galaxy in
          unprecedented  detail.  A large and massive rotating proto-disk
          is  channelling  gas  towards  a  growing central stellar bulge
          hosting an accreting massive black hole.

          cluster
          Authors:  Alexis Brandeker, Ray Jayawardhana, Parandis Khavari,

          Comments: Accepted by ApJ. 13 pages, 10 figures
          We  have carried out a sensitive high-resolution imaging survey
          of stars in the young (6-8 Myr), nearby (97 pc) compact cluster
          around  eta Chamaeleontis to search for stellar and sub-stellar
          companions.  Given  its  youth  and  proximity, any sub-stellar
          companions  are expected to be luminous, especially in the near
          infrared, and thus easier to detect next to their parent stars.
          Here,   we   present  VLT/NACO  adaptive  optics  imaging  with
          companion  detection limits for 17 eta Cha cluster members, and
          follow-up  VLT/ISAAC  near-infrared  spectroscopy for companion
          candidates.  The widest binary detected is ~0.2", corresponding
          to  the  projected  separation  20 AU, despite our survey being
          sensitive  down  to  sub-stellar  companions  outside 0.3", and
          planetary  mass  objects  outside  0.5".  This implies that the
          stellar  companion probability outside 0.3" and the brown dwarf
          companion  probability outside 0.5" are less than 0.16 with 95%
          confidence.  We compare the wide binary frequency of eta Cha to
          that  of the similarly aged TW Hydrae association, and estimate
          the  statistical likelihood that the wide binary probability is
          equal  in  both  groups  to  be < 2e-4. Even though the eta Cha
          cluster  is relatively dense, stellar encounters in its present
          configuration  cannot  account for the relative deficit of wide
          binaries.  We  thus conclude that the difference in wide binary
          probability  in  these  two groups provides strong evidence for
          multiplicity  properties being dependent on environment. In two
          appendices  we  derive  the  projected  separation  probability
          distribution   for   binaries,   used   to  constrain  physical
          separations  from observed projected separations, and summarize
          statistical tools useful for multiplicity studies.

          We  report  the discovery of an eclipsing X-ray binary in M101,
          the first such system to be discovered outside the Local Group.
          Based  on  a  sequence of 25 Chandra observations that sample a
          wide  range of orbital phases, we find a period of 32.688 $\pm$
          0.002  hours,  which  we  interpret  as  an orbital period. The
          folded  light  curve exhibits an eclipse lasting about 8 hours,
          suggesting  a compact orbit in an nearly edge-on configuration.
          The  X-ray  binary has an average luminosity of $L_X(0.3-8 {\rm
          keV})  \approx  1.3\times10^{38}$ erg/sec, with only one out of
          the  25  observations  significantly  lower  in  flux  than the
          average  light curve.The presence of the eclipse and the $\sim$
          1.4-day  orbital  period suggests that this source is an analog
          of  the  well studied eclipsing X-ray binary pulsars Her X-1 or
          LMC X-4. Combining the Chandra data and the HST ACS/WFC images,
          we  have  identified  several  possible  optical  counterparts,
          including  an  O5-O3  star  with  V  =  25.0. Follow-up optical
          monitoring  observations  should  be able to identify the donor
          and further constrain the orbital properties.

          Title: Evolution of Giant Planets in Eccentric Disks
          Authors: Gennaro D'Angelo, Stephen H. Lubow, Matthew R. Bate
          Comments:  20  pages  16  figures,  3  tables. To appear in The
          Astrophysical Journal vol.652 (December 1, 2006 issue)
          We  investigate  the  interaction  between a giant planet and a
          viscous   circumstellar   disk  by  means  of  high-resolution,
          two-dimensional  hydrodynamical simulations. We consider planet
          masses that range from 1 to 3 Jupiter masses (Mjup) and initial
          orbital eccentricities that range from 0 to 0.4. We find that a
          planet  can cause eccentricity growth in a disk region adjacent
          to  the planet's orbit, even if the planet's orbit is circular.
          Disk-planet  interactions  lead to growth in a planet's orbital
          eccentricity.  The  orbital  eccentricities of a 2 Mjup and a 3
          Mjup  planet  increase from 0 to 0.11 within about 3000 orbits.
          Over  a  similar  time  period, the orbital eccentricity of a 1
          Mjup planet grows from 0 to 0.02. For a case of a 1 Mjup planet
          with  an initial eccentricity of 0.01, the orbital eccentricity
          grows  to  0.09  over 4000 orbits. Radial migration is directed
          inwards,  but  slows  considerably  as a planet's orbit becomes
          eccentric.   If   a   planet's   orbital  eccentricity  becomes
          sufficiently  large,  e > ~0.2, migration can reverse and so be
          directed  outwards. The accretion rate towards a planet depends
          on  both  the  disk  and the planet orbital eccentricity and is
          pulsed  over  the  orbital  period.  Planet  mass  growth rates
          increase  with  planet orbital eccentricity. For e~0.2 the mass
          growth  rate  of  a planet increases by approximately 30% above
          the  value  for e=0. For e > ~0.1, most of the accretion within
          the  planet's  Roche  lobe  occurs  when the planet is near the
          apocenter.  Similar accretion modulation occurs for flow at the
          inner disk boundary which represents accretion toward the star.

          New   NTT/SOFI  imaging  and  spectroscopy  of  the  Wolf-Rayet
          population  in  Westerlund 1 are presented. Narrow-band near-IR
          imaging  together  with follow up spectroscopy reveals four new
          WR stars, of which three were independently identified recently
          by  Groh  et  al.,  bringing the confirmed WR content to 24 (23
          excluding  source  S)  [..]  A  quantitative  near-IR  spectral
          classification  scheme for WR stars is presented and applied to
          members  of  Westerlund  1. Late subtypes are dominant, with no
          subtypes  earlier  than  WN5 or WC8 for the nitrogen and carbon
          sequences,  respectively.  A  qualitative  inspection of the WN
          stars  suggests  that most (75%) are highly H-deficient. The WR
          binary  fraction  is high (>62%), on the basis of dust emission
          from  WC stars, in addition to a significant WN binary fraction
          from hard X-ray detections according to Clark et al. We exploit
          the  large  WN  population  of  Westerlund  1  to  reassess its
          distance  (~5.0kpc) and extinction (A_Ks ~ 0.96 mag), such that
          it  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the Galactic bar, [..]. The
          observed  ratio  of  WR  stars  to  red and yellow hypergiants,
          N(WR)/N(RSG+YHG)~3,   favours  an  age  of  4.5-5.0  Myr,  with
          individual  WR stars descended from progenitors of initial mass
          ~  40-55  Msun.  Qualitative  estimates  of  current masses for
          non-dusty, H-free WR stars are presented, revealing 10-18 Msun,
          such that ~75% of the initial stellar mass has been removed via
          stellar  winds or close binary evolution. We present a revision
          to  the  cluster  turn-off mass for other Milky Way clusters in
          which  WR  stars  are  known, based upon the latest temperature
          calibration  for  OB  stars.  Finally,  comparisons between the
          observed WR population and subtype distribution in Westerlund 1
          and  instantaneous  burst  evolutionary  synthesis  models  are
          presented.

          does  not  have  a  high-velocity large-scale molecular outflow
          evidenced  by our deep search for CO wing emission. These facts
          indicate  that  GF9-2 core is early enough after star formation
          so that it still retains some information of initial conditions
          for collapse. Our 350 um dust continuum emission image revealed
          the  presence  of  a  protostellar  envelope in the center of a
          molecular  core. The mass of the envelope is ~0.6 Msun from the
          350 um flux density, while LTE mass of the core is ~3 Msun from
          moleuclar line observations. Combining visibility data from the
          OVRO mm-array and the 45m telescope, we found that the core has
          a radial density profile of $\rho(r)\propto r^{-2}$ for 0.003 <
          r/pc  < 0.08 region. Molecular line data analysis revealed that
          the  velocity  width of the core gas increases inward,while the
          outermost region maintains a velocity dispersion of a few times
          of the ambient sound speed. The broadened velocity width can be
          interpreted as infall. Thus, the collapse in GF9-2 is likely to
          be described by an extension of the Larson-Penston solution for
          the  period  after  formation of a central star. We derived the
          current  mass  accretion  rate  of ~3E-05 Msun/year from infall
          velocity  of ~ 0.3 km/s at r~ 7000 AU. All results suggest that
          GF9-2  core  has  been  undergoing gravitational collapse for ~
          5000  years  since  the  formation of central protostar(s), and
          that  the  unstable  state  initiated the collapse ~2E+05 years
          (the free-fall time) ago.

          Title:  The  small  dispersion  of  the  mid  IR  -- hard X-ray
          correlation in AGN
          Authors: Hannes Horst, Alain Smette, Poshak Gandhi, Wolfgang J.

          Astronomy & Astrophysics
          Context:  We  investigate  mid-infrared and X-ray properties of
          the  dusty  torus  in unification scenarios for active galactic
          nuclei.
          Aims:  We  use  the  relation  between  mid  IR  and hard X-ray
          luminosities to constrain AGN unification scenarios.
          Methods:  With VISIR at the VLT, we have obtained the currently
          highest   angular   resolution  (0".35  FWHM)  narrow-band  mid
          infrared  images  of  the  nuclei of 8 nearby Seyfert galaxies.
          Combining   these   observations   with  X-ray  data  from  the
          literature  we  study  the correlation between their mid IR and
          hard X-ray luminosities.
          Results:  We  find  that the rest frame 12.3 mircon (L_MIR) and
          2-10   keV  (L_X)  luminosities  are  correlated  at  a  highly
          significant  level.  The  best fit power-law to our data is log
          L_MIR  \propto  (1.60 \pm 0.22) log L_X, showing a much smaller
          dispersion than earlier studies.
          Conclusions:  The  similarity  in  the og L_MIR / log L_X ratio
          between  Sy1s  and  Sy2s even using high angular resolution MIR
          data  implies  that  the similarity is intrinsic to AGN and not
          caused  by  contamination  from  extra-nuclear  emission.  This
          supports  clumpy  torus models. The exponent of the correlation
          constrains the inner geometry of the torus.

          Title: What is a planet?
          Authors: Steven Soter
          Comments:  22  pages,  3  tables,  4  figures  submitted to The
          Astronomical Journal
          A  planet  is an end product of disk accretion around a primary
          star  or  substar.  I quantify this definition by the degree to
          which  a body dominates the other masses that share its orbital
          zone.  Both theoretical and observational measures of dynamical
          dominance  reveal  a gap of five orders of magnitude separating
          the  eight  planets of our solar system from the populations of
          asteroids  and  comets.  This  simple definition dispenses with
          upper  and  lower  mass  limits  for  a planet. It reflects the
          tendency  of  disk  evolution  in  a mature system to produce a
          small   number   of   relatively   large  bodies  (planets)  in
          non-intersecting  or  resonant orbits, which prevent collisions
          between them.

          Title:  Gamma-Ray Burst Spectral Correlations: Photospheric and
          Injection Effects
          Authors: Felix Ryde, Claes-Ingvar Bjornsson, Yuki Kaneko, Peter
          Meszaros, Robert Preece, Milan Battelino
          Comments: ApJ, accepted
          We  present  a  physical framework that can account for most of
          the  observed spectral properties of the prompt gamma-ray burst
          emission.  This  includes the variety of spectral shapes, shape
          evolutions, and spectral correlations between flux and spectral
          peak,  within  bursts  described by Borgonovo & Ryde, and among
          bursts  described by Amati/Ghirlanda. In our proposed model the
          spectral  peak  is  given  by  the photospheric emission from a
          relativistic  outflow  for  which  the  horizon  length is much
          smaller  than  the  radial  width. The observed duration of the
          thermal  flash will be given by the radial light-crossing time.
          This  then gives that the typical emission site is at ~10e11 cm
          from  the  center, with a Lorentz factor of ~300. This emission
          is   accompanied   by  non-thermal  emission  from  dissipation
          locations  outside  the  photosphere.  The relative strength of
          these two components depend on injection effects at the central
          engine  leading  to varying relative location of the saturation
          and  photospheric  radii. The total emission can then reproduce
          the  observed  variety.  The spectral correlations are found by
          assuming   that   the   amount  of  energy  dissipated  depends
          non-linearly  on  the  averaged  particle  density.  Beside the
          spectral  correlations this also gives a description of how the
          relative   strength   of  the  thermal  component  varies  with
          temperature within a burst.

          As  part  of  the  DART  project we have used the ESO/2.2m Wide
          Field   Imager  in  conjunction  with  the  VLT/FLAMES  GIRAFFE
          spectrograph  to  study the detailed properties of the resolved
          stellar population of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy out to
          and  beyond  its  tidal  radius.  We  re-derived the structural
          parameters  of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal using our wide field
          imaging  covering  the  galaxy  out  to  its  tidal radius, and
          analysed  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  Fornax  stars of
          different   ages  as  selected  from  Colour-Magnitude  Diagram
          analysis.    We   have   obtained   accurate   velocities   and
          metallicities  from  spectra  in  the  CaII  triplet wavelength
          region  for  562  Red  Giant Branch stars which have velocities
          consistent  with membership in Fornax dwarf spheroidal. We have
          found  evidence  for  the  presence  of at least three distinct
          stellar  components:  a  young  population  (few  100  Myr old)
          concentrated  in  the  centre  of the galaxy, visible as a Main
          Sequence  in  the Colour-Magnitude Diagram; an intermediate age
          population   (2-8  Gyr  old);  and  an  ancient  population  (>
          10Gyr),which are distinguishable from each other kinematically,
          from   the   metallicity   distribution   and  in  the  spatial
          distribution  of  stars  found in the Colour-Magnitude Diagram.
          From our spectroscopic analysis we find that the ``metal rich''
          stars ([Fe/H]> -1.3) show a less extended and more concentrated
          spatial  distribution, and display a colder kinematics than the
          ``metal  poor'' stars ([Fe/H<-1.3). There is tentative evidence
          that  the  ancient  stellar  population in the centre of Fornax
          does  not  exhibit equilibrium kinematics. This could be a sign
          of a relatively recent accretion of external material.

          Title:  A  weakly  nonlinear  analysis of the magnetorotational
          instability in a model channel flow
          Authors: O.M. Umurhan, K. Menou, O. Regev
          Comments: Submitted to Physical Review Letters
          The  magnetorotational  instability (MRI) is generally accepted
          as  the  physical cause of turbulence and enhanced transport of
          angular  momentum in accretion disks, which are one of the most
          basic  and  ubiquitous  astrophysical  structures.  We show, by
          means  of  a  perturbative  weakly nonlinear analysis, that the
          axisymmetric   MRI  of  a  viscous,  resistive,  incompressible
          rotating  shear  flow  in a thin channel gives rise to a Landau
          equation  for  the  disturbance  amplitude.  For small magnetic
          Prandtl  number  (${\cal P}_{\rm m}$), the saturation amplitude
          is $\propto \sqrt{{\cal P}_{\rm m}}$ and the resulting momentum
          transport  scales  as  ${\cal  R}^{-1}$,  where $\cal R$ is the
          hydrodynamic  Reynolds number. Simplifying assumptions, such as
          linear  shear  base  flow,  mathematically  expedient  boundary
          conditions  and  continuous  spectrum  of  the  vertical linear
          modes,  are  used  to  facilitate this analysis. The asymptotic
          results are shown to comply with numerical calculations using a
          spectral  code.  They  suggest  that  the  transport due to the
          nonlinearly  developed  MRI  may be very small, in experimental
          setups with ${\cal P}_{\rm m} \ll 1$.

          Title:  Deficit of wide binaries in the eta Chamaeleontis young
          cluster
          Authors:  Alexis Brandeker, Ray Jayawardhana, Parandis Khavari,
          Karl E. Haisch Jr, Diego Mardones
          Comments: Accepted by ApJ. 13 pages, 10 figures
          We  have carried out a sensitive high-resolution imaging survey
          of stars in the young (6-8 Myr), nearby (97 pc) compact cluster
          around  eta Chamaeleontis to search for stellar and sub-stellar
          companions.  Given  its  youth  and  proximity, any sub-stellar
          companions  are expected to be luminous, especially in the near
          infrared, and thus easier to detect next to their parent stars.
          Here,   we   present  VLT/NACO  adaptive  optics  imaging  with
          companion  detection limits for 17 eta Cha cluster members, and
          follow-up  VLT/ISAAC  near-infrared  spectroscopy for companion
          candidates.  The widest binary detected is ~0.2", corresponding
          to  the  projected  separation  20 AU, despite our survey being
          sensitive  down  to  sub-stellar  companions  outside 0.3", and
          planetary  mass  objects  outside  0.5".  This implies that the
          stellar  companion probability outside 0.3" and the brown dwarf
          companion  probability outside 0.5" are less than 0.16 with 95%
          confidence.  We compare the wide binary frequency of eta Cha to
          that  of the similarly aged TW Hydrae association, and estimate
          the  statistical likelihood that the wide binary probability is
          equal  in  both  groups  to  be < 2e-4. Even though the eta Cha
          cluster  is relatively dense, stellar encounters in its present
          configuration  cannot  account for the relative deficit of wide
          binaries.  We  thus conclude that the difference in wide binary
          probability  in  these  two groups provides strong evidence for
          multiplicity  properties being dependent on environment. In two
          appendices  we  derive  the  projected  separation  probability
          distribution   for   binaries,   used   to  constrain  physical
          separations  from observed projected separations, and summarize
          statistical tools useful for multiplicity studies.

          Title: Discovery of an eclipsing X-ray binary with a 32.69 hour
          period in M101: an analog of Her X-1 or LMC X-4?

          Comments: 24 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, ApJ in press
          We  report  the discovery of an eclipsing X-ray binary in M101,
          the first such system to be discovered outside the Local Group.
          Based  on  a  sequence of 25 Chandra observations that sample a
          wide  range of orbital phases, we find a period of 32.688 $\pm$
          0.002  hours,  which  we  interpret  as  an orbital period. The
          folded  light  curve exhibits an eclipse lasting about 8 hours,
          suggesting  a compact orbit in an nearly edge-on configuration.
          The  X-ray  binary has an average luminosity of $L_X(0.3-8 {\rm
          keV})  \approx  1.3\times10^{38}$ erg/sec, with only one out of
          the  25  observations  significantly  lower  in  flux  than the
          average  light curve.The presence of the eclipse and the $\sim$
          1.4-day  orbital  period suggests that this source is an analog
          of  the  well studied eclipsing X-ray binary pulsars Her X-1 or
          LMC X-4. Combining the Chandra data and the HST ACS/WFC images,
          we  have  identified  several  possible  optical  counterparts,
          including  an  O5-O3  star  with  V  =  25.0. Follow-up optical
          monitoring  observations  should  be able to identify the donor
          and further constrain the orbital properties.

          Title: Evolution of Giant Planets in Eccentric Disks
          Authors: Gennaro D'Angelo, Stephen H. Lubow, Matthew R. Bate
          Comments:  20  pages  16  figures,  3  tables. To appear in The
          Astrophysical Journal vol.652 (December 1, 2006 issue)
          We  investigate  the  interaction  between a giant planet and a
          viscous   circumstellar   disk  by  means  of  high-resolution,
          two-dimensional  hydrodynamical simulations. We consider planet
          masses that range from 1 to 3 Jupiter masses (Mjup) and initial
          orbital eccentricities that range from 0 to 0.4. We find that a
          planet  can cause eccentricity growth in a disk region adjacent
          to  the planet's orbit, even if the planet's orbit is circular.
          Disk-planet  interactions  lead to growth in a planet's orbital
          eccentricity.  The  orbital  eccentricities of a 2 Mjup and a 3
          Mjup  planet  increase from 0 to 0.11 within about 3000 orbits.
          Over  a  similar  time  period, the orbital eccentricity of a 1
          Mjup planet grows from 0 to 0.02. For a case of a 1 Mjup planet
          with  an initial eccentricity of 0.01, the orbital eccentricity
          grows  to  0.09  over 4000 orbits. Radial migration is directed
          inwards,  but  slows  considerably  as a planet's orbit becomes
          eccentric.   If   a   planet's   orbital  eccentricity  becomes
          sufficiently  large,  e > ~0.2, migration can reverse and so be
          directed  outwards. The accretion rate towards a planet depends
          on  both  the  disk  and the planet orbital eccentricity and is
          pulsed  over  the  orbital  period.  Planet  mass  growth rates
          increase  with  planet orbital eccentricity. For e~0.2 the mass
          growth  rate  of  a planet increases by approximately 30% above
          the  value  for e=0. For e > ~0.1, most of the accretion within
          the  planet's  Roche  lobe  occurs  when the planet is near the
          apocenter.  Similar accretion modulation occurs for flow at the
          inner disk boundary which represents accretion toward the star.

          New   NTT/SOFI  imaging  and  spectroscopy  of  the  Wolf-Rayet
          population  in  Westerlund 1 are presented. Narrow-band near-IR
          imaging  together  with follow up spectroscopy reveals four new
          WR stars, of which three were independently identified recently
          by  Groh  et  al.,  bringing the confirmed WR content to 24 (23
          excluding  source  S)  [..]  A  quantitative  near-IR  spectral
          classification  scheme for WR stars is presented and applied to
          members  of  Westerlund  1. Late subtypes are dominant, with no
          subtypes  earlier  than  WN5 or WC8 for the nitrogen and carbon
          sequences,  respectively.  A  qualitative  inspection of the WN
          stars  suggests  that most (75%) are highly H-deficient. The WR
          binary  fraction  is high (>62%), on the basis of dust emission
          from  WC stars, in addition to a significant WN binary fraction
          from hard X-ray detections according to Clark et al. We exploit
          the  large  WN  population  of  Westerlund  1  to  reassess its
          distance  (~5.0kpc) and extinction (A_Ks ~ 0.96 mag), such that
          it  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the Galactic bar, [..]. The
          observed  ratio  of  WR  stars  to  red and yellow hypergiants,
          N(WR)/N(RSG+YHG)~3,   favours  an  age  of  4.5-5.0  Myr,  with
          individual  WR stars descended from progenitors of initial mass
          ~  40-55  Msun.  Qualitative  estimates  of  current masses for
          non-dusty, H-free WR stars are presented, revealing 10-18 Msun,
          such that ~75% of the initial stellar mass has been removed via
          stellar  winds or close binary evolution. We present a revision
          to  the  cluster  turn-off mass for other Milky Way clusters in
          which  WR  stars  are  known, based upon the latest temperature
          calibration  for  OB  stars.  Finally,  comparisons between the
          observed WR population and subtype distribution in Westerlund 1
          and  instantaneous  burst  evolutionary  synthesis  models  are
          presented.

          We  present  a  study  of  the natal core harboring the class 0
          protostar  GF9-2  in  the  filamentary dark cloud GF 9 (d = 200
          pc).  GF9-2  stands unique in the sense that it shows H2O maser
          emission,  a  clear signpost of protostar formation, whereas it
          does  not  have  a  high-velocity large-scale molecular outflow
          evidenced  by our deep search for CO wing emission. These facts
          indicate  that  GF9-2 core is early enough after star formation
          so that it still retains some information of initial conditions
          for collapse. Our 350 um dust continuum emission image revealed
          the  presence  of  a  protostellar  envelope in the center of a
          molecular  core. The mass of the envelope is ~0.6 Msun from the
          350 um flux density, while LTE mass of the core is ~3 Msun from
          moleuclar line observations. Combining visibility data from the
          OVRO mm-array and the 45m telescope, we found that the core has
          a radial density profile of $\rho(r)\propto r^{-2}$ for 0.003 <
          r/pc  < 0.08 region. Molecular line data analysis revealed that
          the  velocity  width of the core gas increases inward,while the
          outermost region maintains a velocity dispersion of a few times
          of the ambient sound speed. The broadened velocity width can be
          interpreted as infall. Thus, the collapse in GF9-2 is likely to
          be described by an extension of the Larson-Penston solution for
          the  period  after  formation of a central star. We derived the
          current  mass  accretion  rate  of ~3E-05 Msun/year from infall
          velocity  of ~ 0.3 km/s at r~ 7000 AU. All results suggest that
          GF9-2  core  has  been  undergoing gravitational collapse for ~
          5000  years  since  the  formation of central protostar(s), and
          that  the  unstable  state  initiated the collapse ~2E+05 years
          (the free-fall time) ago.

          Title:  The  small  dispersion  of  the  mid  IR  -- hard X-ray
          correlation in AGN

          Astronomy & Astrophysics
          Context:  We  investigate  mid-infrared and X-ray properties of
          the  dusty  torus  in unification scenarios for active galactic
          nuclei.
          Aims:  We  use  the  relation  between  mid  IR  and hard X-ray
          luminosities to constrain AGN unification scenarios.
          Methods:  With VISIR at the VLT, we have obtained the currently
          highest   angular   resolution  (0".35  FWHM)  narrow-band  mid
          infrared  images  of  the  nuclei of 8 nearby Seyfert galaxies.
          Combining   these   observations   with  X-ray  data  from  the
          literature  we  study  the correlation between their mid IR and
          hard X-ray luminosities.
          Results:  We  find  that the rest frame 12.3 mircon (L_MIR) and
          2-10   keV  (L_X)  luminosities  are  correlated  at  a  highly
          significant  level.  The  best fit power-law to our data is log
          L_MIR  \propto  (1.60 \pm 0.22) log L_X, showing a much smaller
          dispersion than earlier studies.
          Conclusions:  The  similarity  in  the og L_MIR / log L_X ratio
          between  Sy1s  and  Sy2s even using high angular resolution MIR
          data  implies  that  the similarity is intrinsic to AGN and not
          caused  by  contamination  from  extra-nuclear  emission.  This
          supports  clumpy  torus models. The exponent of the correlation
          constrains the inner geometry of the torus.

          Title: What is a planet?
          Authors: Steven Soter
          Comments:  22  pages,  3  tables,  4  figures  submitted to The
          Astronomical Journal
          A  planet  is an end product of disk accretion around a primary
          star  or  substar.  I quantify this definition by the degree to
          which  a body dominates the other masses that share its orbital
          zone.  Both theoretical and observational measures of dynamical
          dominance  reveal  a gap of five orders of magnitude separating
          the  eight  planets of our solar system from the populations of
          asteroids  and  comets.  This  simple definition dispenses with
          upper  and  lower  mass  limits  for  a planet. It reflects the
          tendency  of  disk  evolution  in  a mature system to produce a
          small   number   of   relatively   large  bodies  (planets)  in
          non-intersecting  or  resonant orbits, which prevent collisions
          between them.

          Title:  Gamma-Ray Burst Spectral Correlations: Photospheric and
          Injection Effects
          Authors: Felix Ryde, Claes-Ingvar Bjornsson, Yuki Kaneko, Peter
          Meszaros, Robert Preece, Milan Battelino
          Comments: ApJ, accepted
          We  present  a  physical framework that can account for most of
          the  observed spectral properties of the prompt gamma-ray burst
          emission.  This  includes the variety of spectral shapes, shape
          evolutions, and spectral correlations between flux and spectral
          peak,  within  bursts  described by Borgonovo & Ryde, and among
          bursts  described by Amati/Ghirlanda. In our proposed model the
          spectral  peak  is  given  by  the photospheric emission from a
          relativistic  outflow  for  which  the  horizon  length is much
          smaller  than  the  radial  width. The observed duration of the
          thermal  flash will be given by the radial light-crossing time.
          This  then gives that the typical emission site is at ~10e11 cm
          from  the  center, with a Lorentz factor of ~300. This emission
          is   accompanied   by  non-thermal  emission  from  dissipation
          locations  outside  the  photosphere.  The relative strength of
          these two components depend on injection effects at the central
          engine  leading  to varying relative location of the saturation
          and  photospheric  radii. The total emission can then reproduce
          the  observed  variety.  The spectral correlations are found by
          assuming   that   the   amount  of  energy  dissipated  depends
          non-linearly  on  the  averaged  particle  density.  Beside the
          spectral  correlations this also gives a description of how the
          relative   strength   of  the  thermal  component  varies  with
          temperature within a burst.

          As  part  of  the  DART  project we have used the ESO/2.2m Wide
          Field   Imager  in  conjunction  with  the  VLT/FLAMES  GIRAFFE
          spectrograph  to  study the detailed properties of the resolved
          stellar population of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy out to
          and  beyond  its  tidal  radius.  We  re-derived the structural
          parameters  of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal using our wide field
          imaging  covering  the  galaxy  out  to  its  tidal radius, and
          analysed  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  Fornax  stars of
          different   ages  as  selected  from  Colour-Magnitude  Diagram
          analysis.    We   have   obtained   accurate   velocities   and
          metallicities  from  spectra  in  the  CaII  triplet wavelength
          region  for  562  Red  Giant Branch stars which have velocities
          consistent  with membership in Fornax dwarf spheroidal. We have
          found  evidence  for  the  presence  of at least three distinct
          stellar  components:  a  young  population  (few  100  Myr old)
          concentrated  in  the  centre  of the galaxy, visible as a Main
          Sequence  in  the Colour-Magnitude Diagram; an intermediate age
          population   (2-8  Gyr  old);  and  an  ancient  population  (>
          10Gyr),which are distinguishable from each other kinematically,
          from   the   metallicity   distribution   and  in  the  spatial
          distribution  of  stars  found in the Colour-Magnitude Diagram.
          From our spectroscopic analysis we find that the ``metal rich''
          stars ([Fe/H]> -1.3) show a less extended and more concentrated
          spatial  distribution, and display a colder kinematics than the
          ``metal  poor'' stars ([Fe/H<-1.3). There is tentative evidence
          that  the  ancient  stellar  population in the centre of Fornax
          does  not  exhibit equilibrium kinematics. This could be a sign
          of a relatively recent accretion of external material.

          Title:  A  weakly  nonlinear  analysis of the magnetorotational
          instability in a model channel flow
          Authors: O.M. Umurhan, K. Menou, O. Regev
          Comments: Submitted to Physical Review Letters
          The  magnetorotational  instability (MRI) is generally accepted
          as  the  physical cause of turbulence and enhanced transport of
          angular  momentum in accretion disks, which are one of the most
          basic  and  ubiquitous  astrophysical  structures.  We show, by
          means  of  a  perturbative  weakly nonlinear analysis, that the
          axisymmetric   MRI  of  a  viscous,  resistive,  incompressible
          rotating  shear  flow  in a thin channel gives rise to a Landau
          equation  for  the  disturbance  amplitude.  For small magnetic
          Prandtl  number  (${\cal P}_{\rm m}$), the saturation amplitude
          is $\propto \sqrt{{\cal P}_{\rm m}}$ and the resulting momentum
          transport  scales  as  ${\cal  R}^{-1}$,  where $\cal R$ is the
          hydrodynamic  Reynolds number. Simplifying assumptions, such as
          linear  shear  base  flow,  mathematically  expedient  boundary
          conditions  and  continuous  spectrum  of  the  vertical linear
          modes,  are  used  to  facilitate this analysis. The asymptotic
          results are shown to comply with numerical calculations using a
          spectral  code.  They  suggest  that  the  transport due to the
          nonlinearly  developed  MRI  may be very small, in experimental
          setups with ${\cal P}_{\rm m} \ll 1$.

          Title: Iron in Hot DA White Dwarfs
          Authors:  Stephane  Vennes, Pierre Chayer, Jean Dupuis, Thierry
          Lanz
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  present  a  study  of  the  iron  abundance  pattern in hot
          hydrogen-rich  (DA) white dwarfs. The study is based on new and
          archival  far  ultraviolet  spectroscopy  of  a sample of white
          dwarfs  in  the  temperature range 30,000 K < T_eff < 64,000 K.
          The  spectra  obtained  with  the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic
          Explorer  along  with  spectra  obtained  with the Hubble Space
          Telescope    Imaging   Spectrograph   and   the   International
          Ultraviolet  Explorer  sample  FeIII  to  FeVI absorption lines
          enabling  a detailed iron abundance analysis over a wider range
          of   effective   temperatures  than  previously  afforded.  The
          measurements  reveal  abundance  variations  in  excess  of two
          orders   of  magnitude  between  the  highest  and  the  lowest
          temperatures  probed,  but  also  show  considerable variations
          (over  one  order  of  magnitude)  between objects with similar
          temperatures  and  surface gravities. Such variations in cooler
          objects  may  be imputed to accretion from unseen companions or
          so-called  circumstellar debris although the effect of residual
          mass-loss  and  selective  radiation  pressure  in  the hottest
          objects in the sample remain dominant.

          distribution of nearby AGN: INTEGRAL all-sky survey

          Astrophysics
          Using the INTEGRAL all-sky hard X-ray survey, we study the hard
          X-ray  luminosity function and absorption distribution of local
          (z<0.1) AGN, and discuss the implications for AGN evolution and
          the  CXB.  Our  entire  all-sky  sample consists of 123 AGN, of
          which  91  are  confidently  detected (>5 sigma) on the average
          IBIS/ISGRI   map   and  32  are  detected  only  during  single
          observations.  Among  the  former  there  are 66 non-blazar AGN
          located  at  |b|>5 deg, which we use for the calculation of the
          AGN  luminosity  function and X-ray absorption distribution. In
          broad  agreement  with  previous  studies,  we  find  that  the
          fraction  of  obscured (logNH>22) objects is much higher (~70%)
          among  the low-luminosity AGN (Lx<10^43.6 erg/s) than among the
          high-luminosity  ones (Lx>10^43.6 erg/s), ~25%, where Lx is the
          luminosity in the 17-60 keV band. We also find that locally the
          fraction of Compton-thick AGN is less than 20%. The constructed
          hard   X-ray  luminosity  function  has  a  canonical  smoothly
          connected two power-law shape in the range 40<logLx<45.5 with a
          characteristic  luminosity of logL*=43.40+/-0.28. The estimated
          local   luminosity   density   due  to  AGN  with  logLx>40  is
          (1.4+/-0.3)  10^39  erg/s/Mpc^3  (17-60  keV). We show that the
          spectral shape and amplitude of the CXB can be explained in the
          simple  scenario in which at all redshifts for a given Lx/L*(z)
          the  NH  distribution  of  AGN  is  similar to that measured by
          INTEGRAL at z<0.1 while the AGN luminosity function experiences
          pure luminosity evolution as suggested by deep X-ray surveys.

          Astrophysics  and  Space  Research,  Massachusetts Institute of

          Astrophysical Main Journal
          Massive stars rarely show intrinsic X-ray variability. The only
          O-stars  credited to be intrinsically variable are theta1 Ori C
          due  to  effects  from  magnetic  confinement  of its wind, and
          theta2  Ori  A  suspected  of  similar  activity. Early Chandra
          observations  have  shown  that the most massive star system in
          the   Orion  Trapezium  Cluster,  theta2  Ori  A,  shows  rapid
          variability  on time scales of hours. We determine X-ray fluxes
          and  find  that the star shows very strong variability over the
          last  5  years.  We  observed  a second large X-ray outburst in
          November  2004  with  the  high resolution transmission grating
          spectrometer   on-board   Chandra.   In  the  low  state  X-ray
          emissivities  indicate  temperatures  well  above 25 MK. In the
          high  state  we  find  an extended emissivity distribution with
          high  emissivities  in  the range from 3 MK to over 100 MK. The
          outburst  event  in  stellar  terms is one of the most powerful
          ever  observed  and  the  most  energetic one in the ONC with a
          lower   total   energy   limit  of  1.5x10^37  ergs.  The  line
          diagnostics  show  that  under  the  assumption  that  the line
          emitting  regions in the low states are as close as within 1 --
          2 stellar radii from the O-star's photosphere, whereas the hard
          states  suggest  a  distance  of  3 -- 5 stellar radii. The two
          outbursts  are  very  close  to  the  periastron passage of the
          stars.  We  argue  that  the high X-ray states are possibly the
          result of reconnection events from magnetic interactions of the
          primary  and  secondary  stars  of  the  spectroscopic  binary.
          Effects from wind collisions seem unlikely for this system. The
          low  state  emissivity  and R-ratios strengthen the predicament
          that  the X-ray emission is enhanced by magnetic confinement of
          the  primary wind. We also detect Fe fluorescence indicative of
          the  existence  of  substantial  amounts  of  neutral Fe in the
          vicinity of the X-ray emission.

          structure  of  radio  jets, but the accretion disk close to the

          The  five  enigmatic  Cocoon  stars  after which the Quintuplet
          cluster  was  christened  have  puzzled astronomers since their
          discovery.   Their   extraordinary  cool,  featureless  thermal
          spectra  have  been  attributed  to  various stellar types from
          young  to  highly  evolved,  while  their absolute luminosities
          places    them    among    the    supergiants.    We    present
          diffraction-limited  images  from  the  Keck  1 telescope which
          resolves  this  debate  with  the  discovery of rotating spiral
          plumes   characteristic  of  colliding-wind  binary  "pinwheel"
          nebulae.   Such   elegant   spiral   structures,  found  around
          high-luminosity Wolf-Rayet stars, have recently been implicated
          in  the  behavior  of  supernovae  lightcurves in the radio and

          We  construct  a  sample of extremely red objects (EROs) within

          Release  with  optical  data  from  the  Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep

          with  R-K>5.3  and  K<=20.3,  which is a higher surface density
          than  found  by  previous  studies.  This  is partly due to our
          ability  to  use  a small aperture in which to measure colours,
          but  is  also  the  result  of a genuine overdensity of objects
          compared   to   other  fields.  We  separate  our  sample  into
          passively-evolving  and dusty star-forming galaxies using their
          RJK colours and investigate their radio properties using a deep
          radio  map.  The  dusty  population  has  a  higher fraction of
          individually-detected  radio  sources  and  a higher mean radio
          flux  density  among  the  undetected  objects, but the passive
          population  has  a  higher  fraction  of  bright radio sources,
          suggesting  that  AGNs are more prevalent among the passive ERO
          population.

          Title:  The  Turn-On  of  Mass  Transfer  in  AM  CVn Binaries:
          Implications for RX J0806+1527 and RX J1914+2456
          Authors:   Christopher  J.  Deloye  (Northwestern  University),

          We  report  on  evolutionary  calculations of the onset of mass
          transfer  in AM CVn binaries, treating the donor's evolution in
          detail.  We show that during the early contact phase, while the
          mass  transfer  rate, $\Mdot$, is increasing, gravity wave (GW)
          emission  continues  to  drive  the  binary  to shorter orbital
          period,  $\Porb$. We argue that the phase where $\Mdot > 0$ and
          $\nudot  >  0$  ($\nu  =  1/\Porb$) can last between $10^3$ and
          $10^6$  yrs,  significantly  longer  than previously estimated.
          These  results  are  applied to RX J0806+1527 ($\Porb = 321$ s)
          and  RX  J914+2456 ($\Porb=569$ s), both of which have measured
          $\nudot  >  0$.  \emph{Thus,  a  $\nudot  >  0$ does not select
          between  the  unipolar  inductor  and  accretion  driven models
          proposed  as  the  source  of X-rays in these systems}. For the
          accretion  model,  we  predict  for  RX  J0806 that $\ddot{\nu}
          \approx  \ee{1.0-1.5}{-28}$  Hz  s$^{-2}$ and argue that timing
          observations  can probe $\ddot{\nu}$ at this level with a total
          $\approx  20$  yr  baseline.  We also place constraints on each
          system's initial parameters given current observational data.

          Title: Threat Mitigation: The Asteroid Tugboat
          Authors:  Russell Schweickart (B612 Foundation), Clark Chapman,
          Dan  Durda, (Southwest Research Institute), Piet Hut (Institute
          for Advanced Studies)
          Comments:  Submitted  to  NASA  Workshop on Near-Earth Objects,
          Vail, Colorado, June 2006
          Subj-class: Space Physics
          The  Asteroid  Tugboat  (AT)  is  a  fully  controlled asteroid
          deflection concept using a robotic spacecraft powered by a high
          efficiency,  electric  propulsion  system (ion or plasma) which
          docks  with  and attaches to the asteroid, conducts preliminary
          operations,  and  then  thrusts  continuously  parallel  to the
          asteroid  velocity  vector until the desired velocity change is
          achieved.  Based  on early warning, provided by ground tracking
          and  orbit  prediction,  it  would be deployed a decade or more
          prior  to  a  potential  impact.  On  completion of the initial
          rendezvous  with the near-Earth object (NEO) the AT would first
          reduce  the  uncertainty in the orbit of the asteroid via Earth
          tracking  of  its radio transponder while it is station keeping
          with the asteroid. If on analysis of tracking data a deflection
          is  required  the  AT  would  execute  a  reconnaissance  phase
          collecting   and  processing  information  about  the  physical
          characteristics   of   the   asteroid   to  support  subsequent
          operations.  The  AT  would  then  dock at the appropriate pole
          (i.e.  on  the  spin axis), attach to the asteroid surface, and
          initiate  a NEO reorientation maneuver. Following completion of
          the  NEO  reorientation  the  AT  would initiate the deflection
          phase  by  thrusting  continuously  parallel  to  the  asteroid
          velocity  vector  until the resultant target orbit is achieved.
          The  orbit of the asteroid is continuously monitored throughout
          the deflection process and the end state is known in real time.
          If  one  assumes  a  nuclear-electric  propulsion  (NEP) system
          similar  to  that  formerly  under  development in the recently
          canceled  Prometheus  Program,  the  AT  would  be  capable  of
          deflecting  threatening  NEOs  up  to 800 meters in diameter or
          more.

          We study 87 Extremely Red Objects (EROs), selected both to have
          color  redder  than  R-[3.6]  =  4.0,  and  to  have  confirmed
          spectroscopic redshifts. Together, these two constraints result
          in  this  sample  populating  a fairly narrow redshift range at
          0.76  <  z < 1.42. The key new ingredient included here is deep
          Spitzer  Space  Telescope  InfraRed  Array  Camera (IRAC) data.
          Based  on [3.6]-[8.0] color, we demonstrate that it is possible
          to classify EROs into early-type, dusty starburst, or power-law
          (AGN)  types.  We  present ultraviolet to mid-infrared spectral
          energy  distributions  (SEDs)  and  Advanced Camera for Surveys

          We  have  carried  out a detailed study of symbiotic stars with
          white  dwarf accretors by means of a population synthesis code.
          We  estimate  the  total  number  of symbiotic stars with white
          dwarf  accretors in the Galaxy as 1,200 - 15,000. This range is
          compatible  with  observational estimates. Two crucial physical
          parameters  that  define  the birthrate and number of symbiotic
          stars  are  the  efficiency of accretion by white dwarfs (which
          greatly  depends  on  the separation of components after common
          envelope  stage  and stellar wind velocity) and the mass of the
          hydrogen  layer  which  the white dwarf can accumulate prior to
          the hydrogen ignition. The theoretical estimate of the Galactic
          occurrence  rate  of  symbiotic  novae ranges from about 1.3 to
          about  13.5 per year out of which weak symbiotic novae comprise
          about  0.5 to 6.0 per year, depending on the model assumptions.
          We  simulate  the distributions of symbiotic stars over orbital
          periods,   masses   of  components,  mass-loss  rates  of  cool
          components,   mass-accretion   rates   of  hot  components  and
          luminosity   of  components.  Agreement  with  observations  is
          reasonable.

          New  millimeter-wave  CO  and  HCN  observations  of  the  host
          galaxies of infrared-excess Palomar Green quasi-stellar objects
          (PG  QSOs)  previously  detected  in  CO  are  presented. These
          observations  are  designed to assess the validity of using the
          infrared   luminosity  to  estimate  star  formation  rates  of
          luminous  AGN  by  determining  the  relative  significance  of
          dust-heating by young, massive stars and active galactic nuclei
          (AGN)  in  QSO  hosts  and  IRAS  galaxies  with warm, AGN-like
          infrared  colors.  The  HCN  data show the PG QSO host IZw1 and
          most  of  the  warm  IRAS  galaxies  to have high L_IR / L'_HCN
          (>1600)  relative  to the cool IRAS galaxy population for which
          the median L_IR / L'_HCN ~ 890(+440,-470). If the assumption is
          made  that  the  infrared  emission  from cool IRAS galaxies is
          reprocessed light from embedded star-forming regions, then high
          values  of  L_IR / L'_HCN are likely the result of dust heating
          by  the  AGN.  Further, if the median ratio of L'_HCN / L'_CO ~
          0.06  observed  for Seyfert galaxies and IZw1 is applied to the
          PG  QSOs  not  detected  in HCN, then the derived L_IR / L'_HCN
          correspond  to a stellar contribution to the production of L_IR
          of  ~  7-39%,  and  star  formation  rates  ~ 2-37 M_sun/yr are
          derived  for  the QSO hosts. Alternatively, if the far-infrared
          is  adopted  as  the  star  formation  component  of  the total
          infrared  in  cool  galaxies,  the stellar contributions in QSO
          hosts  to their L_FIR are up to 35% higher than the percentages
          derived for L_IR. This raises the possibility that the L_FIR in
          several  of  the  PG  QSO  hosts,  including IZw1, could be due
          entirely to dust heated by young, massive stars. Finally, there
          is  no  evidence  that  the  global  HCN  emission  is enhanced
          relative to CO in galaxies hosting luminous AGN.

          We  report  the  detection  of  rest--frame 6.2 and 7.7 \micron
          emission features arising from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
          (PAH) in the Spitzer/IRS spectrum of an infrared-luminous Lyman
          break  galaxy at z=3.01. This is currently the highest redshift
          galaxy  where  these  PAH emission features have been detected.
          The total infrared luminosity inferred from the MIPS 24 \micron
          and  radio  flux density is 2$\times10^{13}$ L$_{\odot}$, which
          qualifies  this  object  as a so--called hyperluminous infrared
          galaxy  (HyLIRG).  However,  unlike  local  HyLIRGs  which  are
          generally  associated with QSO/AGNs and have weak or absent PAH
          emission  features,  this  HyLIRG  has  very strong 6.2 and 7.7
          \micron  PAH  emission.  We  argue  that intense star formation
          dominates  the  infrared  emission  of this source, although we
          cannot rule out the presence of a deeply obscured AGN. This LBG
          appears to be a distorted system in the HST ACS F606W and F814W
          images,  possibly  indicating  that  a  significant  merger  or
          interaction is driving the large IR luminosity.

          Comments: 10 pages, 8 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          We  show  that the combination of a weak magnetic propeller and
          accretion  disc  resonances  can  effectively halt accretion in
          short period cataclysmic variables for large fractions of their
          lifetimes. This may help to explain the discrepancy between the
          observed   and   predicted   orbital  period  distributions  of
          cataclysmic  variables  at  short  periods.  Orbital resonances
          cause  the  disc to become eccentric, allowing material to fall
          back  onto the donor star or out of the system. A weak magnetic
          field  on a rapidly spinning primary star propels disc material
          outwards, allowing it to access these resonances. Numerical and
          analytic  calculations  show  that this state can be long lived
          (~10^11 yr). This is because the magnetic propeller is required
          only  to  maintain  access  to  the resonances, and not to push
          matter  out of the Roche lobe, so that the spin down time-scale
          is much longer than for a classical propeller model.

          Title: Astrophysics of extreme mass ratio inspiral sources
          Authors: Clovis Hopman (Leiden Observatory)
          Comments:  Invited  contribution  to the 6th International LISA
          Symposium
          Compact  remnants  on  orbits  with  peri-apses  close  to  the
          Schwarzschild radius of a massive black hole (MBH) lose orbital
          energy  by  emitting  gravitational  waves (GWs) and spiral in.
          Scattering  with other stars allows successful inspiral of such
          extreme  mass  ratio inspiral sources (EMRIs) only within small
          distances,  a < few \times 0.01 pc from the MBH. The event rate
          of  EMRIs  is  therefore  dominated by the stellar dynamics and
          content in the inner few \times 0.01 pc. I discuss the relevant
          dynamical aspects and resulting estimated event rates of EMRIs.
          Subjects considered include the loss-cone treatment of inspiral
          sources; mass segregation; resonant relaxation; and alternative
          routes  to  EMRI  formation  such  as tidal binary disruptions,
          stellar  formation  in  disks and tidal capture of massive main
          sequence stars. The EMRI event rate is estimated to be of order
          few  \times  10^2/Gyr  per  MBH, giving excellent prospects for
          observation by LISA.

          We   present   a  high-resolution  (R~16,000)  spectrum  and  a
          narrow-band image centered on the [NeII]12.8 micron line of the
          central  kpc  region of the starburst/Seyfert2 galaxy NGC 7582.
          The  galaxy has a rotating circum-nuclear starburst disk, shown
          at  great  detail  at  a  diffraction-limited resolution of 0.4
          arcsec.  The  high  spatial  resolution  allows us to probe the
          dynamics  of  the  [NeII]  gas  in  the nuclear regions, and to
          estimate  the  mass  of  the  central  black hole. We construct
          models  of  gas  disks  rotating  in the combined gravitational
          potential  from the stellar bulge and a central black hole, and
          derive  a black hole mass of 5.5 x 10^7 solar masses with a 95%
          confidence interval of [3.6,8.1] x 10^7 solar masses. The black
          hole   mass   combined   with   stellar   velocity   dispersion
          measurements  from  the  literature  shows  that  the galaxy is
          consistent  with  the local M-sigma relation. This is the first
          time  that  a  black hole mass in a galaxy except our own Milky
          Way  system  has  been  estimated  from  gas  dynamics  in  the
          mid-infrared.  We  show  that  spatially  resolved mid-infrared
          spectroscopy  may be competitive with similar techniques in the
          optical  and  near-infrared,  and may prove to be important for
          estimating  black  hole  masses in galaxies with strong nuclear
          dust  obscuration.  The  high  spectral resolution allows us to
          determine  the  heliocentric systemic velocity of the galaxy to
          between  1614  and  1634  km/s.  The mid-infrared image reveals
          several  dense  knots  of  dust-embedded  star formation in the
          circum-nuclear disk, and we briefly discuss its morphology.

          We  revisit  a  method to obtain upper limits on the jet matter
          content  combining  synchrotron self-absorption constraints and
          the  large scale bubble energy. We use both X-ray observations,
          which  give  limits  on  the  jet  power  from the energies and
          timescales  of bubbles found in clusters of galaxies, and radio
          observations,  which  give  limits on the magnetic field in the
          jets.  Combining  the  two  imposes constraints on the particle
          number  density,  and hence the jet content. Out of a sample of
          clusters  which  have  clear  radio bubbles, there are only two
          which  have  sufficient  resolution in the radio images to give
          significant constraints, under the assumption that the jets are
          fairly  steady.  The  results for M87 and Perseus indicate that
          the  radio  emitting  region  of  the  jet is electron-positron
          dominated,  assuming  that  the  minimum of the electron energy

          Title:     The     Effects    of    Thermal    Conduction    on
          Radiatively-Inefficient Accretion Flows
          Authors: Bryan M. Johnson, Eliot Quataert
          Comments:  16  pages, 8 figures, submitted to The Astrophysical
          Journal
          We  quantify  the effects of electron thermal conduction on the
          properties  of  hot  accretion  flows,  under the assumption of
          spherical  symmetry.  Electron heat conduction is important for
          low  accretion  rate systems where the electron cooling time is
          longer  than  the conduction time of the plasma, such as Sgr A*
          in  the  Galactic  Center.  For  accretion  flows  with density
          profiles  similar  to  the Bondi solution (n[r] ~ r^{-3/2}), we
          show  that  heat conduction leads to super-virial temperatures,
          implying that conduction significantly modifies the dynamics of
          the  accretion  flow.  We  then self-consistently solve for the
          dynamics  of  spherical  accretion in the presence of saturated
          conduction  and  electron  heating.  We find that the accretion
          rate  onto  the central object can be reduced by ~1-3 orders of
          magnitude  relative  to  the  canonical  Bondi  rate.  Electron
          conduction  may  thus  be an important ingredient in explaining
          the low radiative efficiencies and low accretion rates inferred
          from   observations  of  low-luminosity  galactic  nuclei.  The
          solutions  presented  in  this  paper  may  also  describe  the
          nonlinear  saturation  of the magnetothermal instability in hot
          accretion flows.

          Title:  A  three  stage model for the inner engine of Gamma Ray
          Burst: Prompt emission and early afterglow
          Authors: Jan Staff, Rachid Ouyed, Manjari Bagchi
          Comments: submitted to ApJ
          We  propose  a  new model within the ``Quark-nova'' scenario to
          interpret  the  recent observations of early afterglows of long
          Gamma-Ray  Bursts  (GRB)  with  the  Swift satellite. This is a
          three-stage   model  within  the  context  of  a  core-collapse
          supernova.  Stage  1  is  an  accreting  (proto-)  neutron star
          leading  to  a possible delay between the core collapse and the
          GRB.  Stage 2 is an accreting quark-star, generating the prompt
          GRB.  Stage 3, which occurs only if the quark-star collapses to
          form a black-hole, consists of an accreting black-hole. The jet
          launched  in  this  accretion process interacts with the ejecta
          from  stage 2, and can generate the flaring activity frequently
          seen  in  X-ray afterglows. This model can account for both the
          energies  and  the timescales of GRBs, in addition to the newly
          discovered early X-ray afterglow features.

          Title:   On   the   age   of  the  TW  Hydrae  Association  and
          2M1207334-393254
          Authors: David Barrado y Navascues
          Comments: Astronomy & Astrophysics, accepted
          We  have  estimated the age of the young moving group TW Hydrae
          Association,  a  cohort  of  a few dozen stars and brown dwarfs
          located  near the Sun which share the same kinematic properties
          and,  presumably,  the  same origin and age. The chronology has
          been  determined by analyzing different properties (magnitudes,
          colors,  activity,  lithium)  of its members and comparing them
          with several well-known star forming regions and open clusters,
          as   well   as   theoretical  models.  In  addition,  by  using
          medium-resolution  optical  spectra  of  two  M8 members of the
          association (2M1139 and 2M1207 -an accreting brown dwarf with a
          planetary  mass  companion), we have derived spectral types and
          measured  H(alpha)  and lithium equivalent widths. We have also
          estimated  their  effective temperature and gravity, which were
          used  to  produce  an  independent age estimation for these two
          brown  dwarfs.  We  have  also  collected  spectra of 2M1315, a
          candidate  member  with  a  L5  spectral  type and measured its
          H(alpha)   equivalent   width.   Our   age   estimate  for  the
          association,  10  Myr  (in  the  range  3-20  Myr), agrees with
          previous values cited in the literature. In the case of the two
          brown  dwarfs,  we  have derived an age of 15 Myr (in the range
          5-30  Myr),  which  also  agree with our estimate for the whole
          group.  We  compared our results with recent articles published
          on  the  same  subject  using other techniques, and discuss the
          limits of the age-dating techniques.

          Title:  The  distribution  of absorption in AGN detected in the
          XMM-Newton observations of the CDFS
          Authors: T. Dwelly, M. J. Page
          Comments: 24 pages, 18 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          We  have  used very deep XMM-Newton observations of the Chandra
          Deep  Field-South  to  examine  the  spectral properties of the
          faint  active  galactic  nucleus  (AGN)  population. Crucially,
          redshift  measurements  are  available for 84% (259/309) of the
          XMM-Newton  sample.  We  have  calculated  the  absorption  and
          intrinsic  luminosities  of the sample using an extensive Monte
          Carlo  technique  incorporating the specifics of the XMM-Newton
          observations.   Twenty-three   sources   are   found   to  have
          substantial absorption and intrinsic X-ray luminosities greater
          than  10^44  erg/s, putting them in the "type-2" QSO regime. We
          compare  the  redshift, luminosity and absorption distributions
          of  our  sample to the predictions of a range of AGN population
          models.  In contrast to recent findings from ultra-deep Chandra
          surveys,  we  find  that  there  is  little  evidence  that the
          absorption  distribution  is  dependent  on  either redshift or
          intrinsic  X-ray  luminosity.  The pattern of absorption in our
          sample  is  best  reproduced by models in which ~75% of the AGN
          population   is   heavily  absorbed  at  all  luminosities  and
          redshifts.

          S. Zane
          Unique  among  neutron stars, 1E 1207.4-5209 is an X-ray pulsar
          with  a spin period of 424 ms that contains at least two strong
          absorption  features  in its energy spectrum. This neutron star
          has  been  identified  as  a  member of the radio-quiet compact
          central  objects  in supernova remnants. It has been found that
          1E  1207.4-5209  is  not spinning down monotonically suggesting
          that  this  neutron  star  undergoes strong, frequent glitches,
          contains a fall-back disk, or possess a binary companion. Here,
          we  report on a sequence of seven XMM-Newton observations of 1E
          1207.4-5209 performed during a 40 day window in June/July 2005.
          Due  to unanticipated variance in the phase measurements beyond
          the  statistical  uncertainties, we could not identify a unique
          phase-coherent  timing solution. The three most probable timing
          solutions  give  frequency  time derivatives of +0.9, -2.6, and
          +1.6   X   10^(-12)   Hz/s   (listed  in  descending  order  of
          significance).  We conclude that the local frequency derivative
          during  our  XMM-Newton  observing  campaign  differs  from the
          long-term  spin-down  rate  by more than an order of magnitude,
          effectively ruling out glitch models for 1E 1207.4-5209. If the
          long-term spin frequency variations are caused by timing noise,
          the  strength  of  the  timing  noise in 1E 1207.4-5209 is much
          stronger than in other pulsars with similar period derivatives.
          Therefore,  it  is highly unlikely that the spin variations are
          caused by the same physical process that causes timing noise in
          other  isolated  pulsars.  The  most plausible scenario for the
          observed  spin  irregularities  is  the  presence  of  a binary
          companion  to 1E 1207.4-5209. We identified a family of orbital
          solutions  that  are consistent with our phase-connected timing
          solution,  archival  frequency measurements, and constraints on
          the   companions   mass   imposed   by   deep  IR  and  optical
          observations.

          Title: Effect of turbulent diffusion on iron abundance profiles
          Authors: P. Rebusco, E. Churazov, H. Boehringer, W. Forman
          Comments:  12  pages,  4  figures,  accepted for publication on
          MNRAS
          We  compare  the  observed peaked iron abundance profiles for a
          small  sample  of groups and clusters with the predictions of a
          simple  model  involving  the metal ejection from the brightest
          galaxy and the subsequent diffusion of metals by stochastic gas
          motions.  Extending  the  analysis  of Rebusco et al. (2005) we
          found  that  for  5 out of 8 objects in the sample an effective
          diffusion  coefficient  of  the  order  of  $10^{29}$  cm$^{2}$
          s$^{-1}$  is  needed.  For AWM4, Centaurus and AWM7 the results
          are  different  suggesting  substantial  intermittence  in  the
          process  of  metal  spreading  across  the cluster. There is no
          obvious  dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the mass of
          the system.
          We also estimated the characteristic velocities and the spatial
          scales  of the gas motions needed to balance the cooling losses
          by the dissipation of the same gas motions. A comparison of the
          derived  spatial scales and the sizes of observed radio bubbles
          inflated  in the ICM by a central active galactic nucleus (AGN)
          suggests  that  the  AGN/ICM interaction makes an important (if
          not  a dominant) contribution to the gas motions in the cluster
          cores.

          Based  on  a high resolution cosmological n-body simulation, we
          track the hierarchical growth of black holes in galaxy clusters
          from  z=20  to  z=0.  We  present  a  census  of black holes as
          function  of  redshift  and  will determine their mass assembly
          history under a variety of assumptions regarding the importance
          of gas accretion in black hole growth, from early supercritical
          Eddington   accretion   to   gas-poor   hierarchical  assembly.
          Following  a  galaxy  merger, black holes are expected to form,
          inspiral   and   merge  after  strongly  radiating  energy  via
          gravitational  waves.  For  each binary black hole inspiral and
          merger, we determine the expected gravitational wave signal for
          the  Laser  Interferometer  Space Antenna (LISA), and calculate
          the  LISA  event  rate as a function of time. We will calculate
          the  black  hole  mass  assembly history for several black hole
          growth  scenerios, so that we can explore tests to characterize
          each  model  observationally.  In particular, we will study how
          well  LISA  observations  will  be  able to distinguish between
          these very different assembly scenarios.

          Title:  The Centaurus Group and the Outer Halo of NGC 5128: Are
          they Dynamically Connected?
          Authors: Kristin A. Woodley
          Comments:   14   pages,  3  tables,  7  figures,  Accepted  for
          publication in AJ
          NGC  5128, a giant elliptical galaxy only $\sim 4$ Mpc away, is
          the  dominant  member  of  a  galaxy  group of over 80 probable
          members. The Centaurus group provides an excellent sample for a
          kinematic  comparison  between  the  halo  of  NGC 5128 and its
          surrounding  satellite  galaxies.  A new study, presented here,
          shows  no  kinematic difference in rotation amplitude, rotation
          axis,  and  velocity  dispersion  between the halo of NGC 5128,
          determined  from  over  $\sim340$ of its globular clusters, and
          those  of the Centaurus group as a whole. These results suggest
          NGC  5128  could  be behaving in part as the inner component to
          the  galaxy group, and could have begun as a large initial seed
          galaxy,  gradually  built  up  by  minor  mergers and satellite
          accretions, consistent with simple cold dark matter models. The
          mass  and  mass-to-light  ratios  in  the B-band, corrected for
          projection  effects,  are  determined to be $(1.3\pm0.5) \times
          10^{12}$ M$_{\sun}$ and $52\pm22$ M$_{\sun}$/L$_{\sun}$ for NGC
          5128 out to a galactocentric radius of 45 kpc, and $(9.2\pm3.0)
          \times 10^{12}$ M$_{\sun}$ and $153\pm50$ M$_{\sun}$/L$_{\sun}$
          for the Centaurus group, consistent with previous studies.

          We  present an analysis of the observed broad iron line feature
          and   putative  warm  absorber  in  the  long  2001  XMM-Newton
          observation  of  the  Seyfert-1.2  galaxy  MCG-6-30-15. The new
          "kerrdisk"  model we have designed for simulating line emission
          from accretion disk systems allows black hole spin to be a free
          parameter  in  the fit, enabling the user to formally constrain
          the  angular  momentum  of  a  black hole, among other physical
          parameters of the system. In an important extension of previous
          work,   we  derive  constraints  on  the  black  hole  spin  in
          MCG-6-30-15  using a self-consistent model for X-ray reflection
          from  the  surface  of  the accretion disk while simultaneously
          accounting  for absorption by dusty photoionized material along
          the  line  of  sight  (the warm absorber). Even including these
          complications,  the  XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn  data  require  extreme
          relativistic  broadening  of  the  X-ray  reflection  spectrum;
          assuming  no  emission  from  within  the  radius  of  marginal
          stability,  we  derive a formal constraint on the dimensionless
          black  hole  spin parameter of a > 0.987 at 90% confidence. The
          principal  unmodeled  effect  that can significantly reduce the
          inferred  black  hole spin is powerful emission from within the
          radius  of marginal stability. Although significant theoretical
          developments  are  required to fully understand this region, we
          argue that the need for a rapidly spinning black hole is robust
          to  physically  plausible  levels  of  emission from within the
          radius  of  marginal  stability.  In particular, we show that a
          non-rotating black hole is strongly ruled out.

          We observed the narrow-line quasar SDSS J094857.3+002225, which
          has   the  highest  known  radio  loudness  for  a  narrow-line
          Seyfert~1  galaxy  (NLS1),  at 1.7--15.4 GHz with the Very Long
          Baseline  Array  (VLBA).  This  is the first very-long-baseline
          interferometry  (VLBI)  investigation for a radio-loud NLS1. We
          independently  found very high brightness temperatures from (1)
          its  compactness  in  a VLBA image and (2) flux variation among
          the VLBA observation, our other observations with the VLBA, and
          the  Very  Large  Array  (VLA).  A  Doppler  factor larger than
          2.7--5.5  was required to meet an intrinsic limit of brightness
          temperature  in  the  rest  frame.  This is evidence for highly
          relativistic  nonthermal  jets  in an NLS1. We suggest that the
          Doppler   factor   is   one  of  the  most  crucial  parameters
          determining  the radio loudness of NLS1s. The accretion disk of
          SDSS  J094857.3+002225  is  probably  in  the  very high state,
          rather than the high/soft state, by analogy with X-ray binaries
          with  strong  radio outbursts and superluminal jets such as GRS
          1915+105.

          The     gravitational     collapse     of    a    non-rotating,
          black-hole-forming     massive     star     is    studied    by
          neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamical simulations for two different
          sets  of  realistic  equation of state of dense matter. We show
          that  the  event will produce as many neutrinos as the ordinary
          supernova, but with distinctive characteristics in luminosities
          and  spectra  that  will be an unmistakable indication of black
          hole  formation.  More  importantly,  the  neutrino signals are
          quite  sensitive to the difference of equation of state and can
          be  used as a useful probe into the properties of dense matter.
          The  event  will be unique in that they will be shining only by
          neutrinos  (and,  possibly,  gravitational  waves)  but  not by
          photons,  and  hence  they  should  be  an  important target of
          neutrino astronomy.

          Title: Winds and Infalling Gas in Lyman Break Galaxies
          Authors:   A.   Ferrara  (SISSA),  M.  Ricotti  (University  of
          Maryland)
          Comments: Accepted by MNRAS
          A  model  for  gas  outflows  is  proposed which simultaneously
          explains  the  correlations between the (i) equivalent width of
          low  ionization  and Ly-alpha lines, (ii) outflow velocity, and
          (iii)  star  formation  rate  observed  in Lyman Break Galaxies
          (LBGs).  Our  interpretation implies that LBGs host short-lived
          (30  +/-  5  Myr)  starburst  episodes  observed  at  different
          evolutionary phases. Initially, the starburst powers a hot wind
          bound  by  a denser cold shell, which after about 5 Myr becomes
          dynamically  unstable  and  fragments;  afterwards the fragment
          evolution  is  approximately  ballistic  while  the  hot bubble
          continues  to  expand.  As  the  fragments  are gravitationally
          decelerated, their screening ability of the starlight decreases
          as   the   UV  starburst  luminosity  progressively  dims.  LBG
          observations sample all these evolutionary phases. Finally, the
          fragments fall back onto the galaxy after approximately 60 Myr.
          This  phase  cannot  be  easily  probed  as  it occurs when the
          starburst  UV  luminosity  has  already largely faded; however,
          galaxies dimmer in the UV than LBGs should show infalling gas.

          Detailed  high-resolution observations of the innermost regions
          of  nearby  galaxies have revealed the presence of supermassive
          black  holes1.  These  black holes may interact with their host
          galaxies  by  means  of  'feedback'  in  the form of energy and
          material  jets; this feedback affects the evolution of the host
          and gives rise to observed relations between the black hole and
          the  host.  Here  we  report  observations  of  the ultraviolet
          emissions   of   massive  early-type  galaxies.  We  derive  an
          empirical  relation  for  a  critical  black-hole  mass  (as  a
          function  of velocity dispersion) above which the outflows from
          these  black  holes  suppress  star formation in their hosts by
          heating  and  expelling  all  available  cold gas. Supermassive
          black  holes are negligible in mass compared to their hosts but
          nevertheless seem to play a critical role in the star formation
          history of galaxies.

          We  present an analysis of the accreting X-ray pulsar system 4U
          1907+09 based on INTEGRAL data. The main focus of this analysis
          is  a  study of the timing behavior of this source. In addition
          we  also  show  an  analysis of the 5-90 keV spectrum. The data
          were  extracted  using  the official INTEGRAL software OSA 5.1.
          Timing  analysis  was  performed using epoch folding and pulsar
          pulse phasing. We have measured 12 individual pulse periods for
          the  years  2003  to 2005. We confirm earlier RXTE results that
          during  2003  the  spin down became slower and show furthermore
          that  after this phase 4U 1907+09 started to spin up with dP/dt
          =  -0.158  s/yr  in  2004.  The  similarity of the pulse period
          histories  of 4U 1907+09 and 4U 1626-26 suggests that accretion
          onto  an oblique rotator, as recently proposed by Perna et al.,
          is a possible explanation for this change.

          Title: The M-sigma Relation for Nucleated Galaxies
          Authors: Dean E. McLaughlin, Andrew R. King, Sergei Nayakshin
          Comments: ApJ Letters, in press
          Momentum  feedback  from  super-Eddington  accretion  offers  a
          simple  explanation for the observed M-sigma and M-M_{spheroid}
          relations  between  supermassive  black  holes  (SMBH)  and the
          spheroids of their host galaxies. Recently Ferrarese et al. and
          Wehner & Harris observed analogous relations between the masses
          of  central star clusters and their hosts. We show that stellar
          winds  and  supernovae  from  such  nuclear  clusters (NC) give
          similar  feedback  explanations  for  this  case  also,  and we
          discuss  the  connection  to the Faber-Jackson relation for the
          spheroids themselves.

          We  have obtained the spectrum of a middle-aged PSR B0656+14 in
          the  4300-9000  AA  range  with  the ESO/VLT/FORS2. Preliminary
          results  show  that  at  4600-7000  AA  the  spectrum is almost
          featureless  and  flat  with a spectral index $\alpha_nu ~ -0.2
          that   undergoes  a  change  to  a  positive  value  at  longer
          wavelengths.  Combining  with  available  multiwavelength  data
          suggests  two  wide,  red  and  blue,  flux  depressions  whose
          frequency  ratio  is about 2 and which could be the 1st and 2nd
          harmonics  of  electron/positron cyclotron absorption formed at
          magnetic fields ~10^8G in upper magnetosphere of the pulsar.

          physical conditions of the active nucleus
          Authors: X. Mazzalay, A. Rodriguez-Ardila
          Comments: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics.
          14 pages, 5 figures
          Near-infrared  and  optical  spectroscopy  of  the  nuclear and
          extended  emission  region  of  the  Seyfert2 galaxy Mrk1210 is
          presented.  This  galaxy  is  outstanding  because  it displays
          signatures   of  recent  circumnuclear  star  formation  and  a
          high-level  of  X-ray  activity,  in  addition to the classical
          spectral  characteristics  typical  of  an AGN. The NIR nuclear
          spectrum,   which  covers  the  interval  0.8-2.4  microns,  is
          dominated  by  HI  and HeI recombination lines as well a [SII],
          [SIII]  and  [Fe II] forbidden lines. Coronal lines of [SVIII],
          [SIX], [SiVI], [SiX], and [CaVIII] in addition to molecular H_2
          lines are also detected. An estimate of the contribution of the
          stellar  population  to  the  continuum is made by means of the
          ^{12}CO(6-3) 1.618 microns overtone bandhead. It was found that
          83%  of  the H-band continuum is of stellar origin. It improves
          previous  estimates,  which  claimed  that  at least 50% of the
          observed  continuum  was attributed to the AGN. The analysis of
          the emission line profiles, both allowed and forbidden, shows a
          narrower  line  on  top  of a broad blue-shifted component. The
          latter seems to be associated to a nuclear outflow. This result
          does  not  required  the presence of a hidden BLR claimed to be
          present  in  previous NIR observations of this object. Internal
          extinction, calculated by means of several indicators including
          [FeII]  flux ratios not previously used before in AGNs, reveals
          a  dusty  AGN,  while  the  extended  regions are little or not
          affected  by  dust.  Density  and  temperature  for the NLR are
          calculated  using  optical and NIR lines diagnostic ratios. The
          results   show  temperatures  from  10000K  up  to  40000K  and
          densities  between  10^3-10^5  cm^{-3}. The larger temperatures
          points out that shocks must contribute to the line emission.

          Title:    The   Mass-Metallicity   Relation   in   Cosmological
          Hydrodynamic Simulations
          Authors:   Romeel   Dave,   Kristian   Finlator,  Benjamin  D.
          Oppenheimer (Arizona)
          Comments: 8 pages, to appear in proc. "Chemodynamics 2006: From
          First Stars to Local Galaxies"
          We  use  cosmological  hydrodynamic  simulations  with enriched
          galactic   outflows  to  compare  predictions  for  the  galaxy
          mass-metallicity  (M*-Z)  relation  versus  observations at z~2
          from  Erb  et  al.  (2006).  With  no  outflows,  galaxies  are
          over-enriched,  indicating  that outflows are required not only
          to suppress star formation and enrich the IGM but also to lower
          galaxy  metal  content. The observed M*-Z slope is matched both
          in our model without winds as well as our favored outflow model
          where  the  outflow velocity scales as the escape velocity, but
          is  too  steep  in  a  model  with  constant outflow speeds. If
          outflows  are  too  widespread  at  early times, the IGM out of
          which  smaller galaxies form can become pre-polluted, resulting
          in   a  low-mass  flattening  of  the  M*-Z  relation  that  is
          inconsistent  with  data.  Remarkably, the same momentum-driven
          wind model that provides the best agreement with IGM enrichment
          data also yields the best agreement with the z~2 M*-Z relation,
          showing  the  proper  outflow scaling and strength to match the
          observed  slope and amplitude. In this model, the M*-Z relation
          evolves   slowly   from   z=6-2;   an   (admittedly  uncertain)
          extrapolation  to  z=0 broadly matches local M*-Z observations.
          Overall,  the  M*-Z  relation  provides critical constraints on
          galactic  outflow processes during the heydey of star formation
          in the Universe.

          Authors: Duncan K Galloway (University of Melbourne)
          Comments:   5   pages,  2  figures,  to  be  published  in  the
          Proceedings  of  the  7th  Pacific  Rim  Conference  on Stellar
          Astrophysics,  held  1-5  Nov  2005,  Sejong University, Seoul,
          Korea (ASP Conference Series). Uses asp2004.sty and psfig.sty
          Millisecond X-ray pulsars consist of a rapidly-spinning neutron
          star  accreting  from a low-mass stellar companion, and are the
          long-sought   evolutionary  progenitors  of  millisecond  radio
          pulsars,   as   well   as   promising   candidate  sources  for
          gravitational  radiation.  The  population of these sources has
          grown  significantly  over  the  last  three  years,  with  the
          discovery  of  six  new  examples  to bring the total sample to
          seven.  Three sources are ultracompact binaries with H-depleted
          donors  and  orbital periods of approx. 40 min, like the 185 Hz
          pulsar  XTE  J0929-314. Three more have orbital periods of 2 hr
          or  longer,  similar  to  IGR  J00291+5934,  first  detected in
          outburst by INTEGRAL in December 2004. The neutron star in this
          2.46 hr binary has the most rapid spin of the accreting pulsars
          at   599   Hz.   The   most  recently-discovered  pulsar,  HETE
          J1900.1-2455  (377  Hz),  has an intermediate orbital period of
          83.3  min,  and has been active for more than 1 yr, much longer
          than  the  typical transient outburst. Pulsations were detected
          only  in  the first few months of the outburst; this source has
          since  resembled a faint, persistent non-pulsing low-mass X-ray
          binary,   typical   of   the   broader  low-mass  X-ray  binary
          population.

          young stars
          Authors: P. Manoj, H. C. Bhatt, G. Maheswar, S. Muneer
          Comments: 39 pages, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We present optical spectra of 45 intermediate mass Herbig Ae/Be
          stars.   Together   with   the  multi-epoch  spectroscopic  and
          photometric data compiled for a large sample of these stars and
          ages  estimated for individual stars by using pre-main sequence
          evolutionary  tracks, we have studied the evolution of emission
          line  activity  in  them. We find that, on average, the H_alpha
          emission line strength decreases with increasing stellar age in
          HAeBe  stars,  indicating that the accretion activity gradually
          declines  during the PMS phase. This would hint at a relatively
          long-lived  (a  few  Myr)  process  being  responsible  for the
          cessation of accretion in Herbig Ae/Be stars. We also find that
          the  accretion activity in these stars drops substantially by ~
          3  Myr.  This  is  comparable  to  the  timescale in which most
          intermediate  mass stars are thought to lose their inner disks,
          suggesting  that  inner  disks  in  intermediate mass stars are
          dissipated  rapidly  after  the  accretion  activity has fallen
          below  a  certain  level.  We,  further find a relatively tight
          correlation   between   strength   of  the  emission  line  and
          near-infrared  excess  due  to  inner  disks  in  HAeBe  stars,
          indicating  that  the disks around Herbig Ae/Be stars cannot be
          entirely  passive.  We  suggest  that  this  correlation can be
          understood  within  the  frame  work of the puffed-up inner rim
          disk  models  if the radiation from the accretion shock is also
          responsible for the disk heating.

          Title: Stellar archaeology: the evolving spectrum of FG Sge
          Authors: C.S. Jeffery, D. Schoenberner
          Comments: 18 pages, 13 figures, A&A in press
          Over  an interval of 120 years, the extraordinary object FG Sge
          has  been  transformed  from  a  hot  post-AGB  star  to a very
          luminous  cool  supergiant.  Theoretically,  this evolution has
          been  associated  with  the reignition of a helium-shell during
          the  post-AGB  stage.  A  series  of  studies  of  the chemical
          composition   of  the  photosphere  have  suggested  that  this
          evolution  has  been  associated  with  a  dramatic increase of
          approximately  3  dex  in  the abundances of s-process elements
          between  about  1960  and  1995. The problem with this apparent
          change  is  that  it  occurred  at  a  time  when  the  surface
          convection  zone,  which  is  governed  by the star's effective
          temperature,  could  not  have developed sufficiently to dredge
          processed material from the stellar interior to the surface. We
          have  reviewed  the  chemical  evolution  of FG Sge by means of
          modelling   the   time-varying   spectrum   under  a  range  of
          assumptions.   By   comparing   these   models  with  published
          observational  data,  a self-consistent picture has emerged. In
          particular  we  find  that  surface  hydrogen has been depleted
          during  the  interval  in  question. In contrast, the s-process
          abundances  have  generally  maintained a steady enhancement of
          around  1  -  2  dex,  although  some  modest  changes may have
          occurred  since  1950.  This  implies  that FG Sge has not just
          completed  dredging  up  freshly-produced  s-process  isotopes.
          However,  there  remains  a  contradiction between the observed
          hydrogen-depletion, the age of the associated planetary nebula,
          and current evolutionary models for a pre-white dwarf suffering
          a late thermal pulse.

          Comments: 19 pages, 8 figures, submitted to A&A
          We   investigate   the   energy-momentum   deposition   due  to
          neutrino-antineutrino   annihilation   in   the   vicinity   of
          axisymmetric,   accreting  black  holes  (BHs)  by  numerically
          ray-tracing   neutrino   trajectories  in  a  Kerr  space-time.
          Hyperaccreting stellar-mass BHs are widely considered as energy
          sources  that  can  drive  ultrarelativistic  outflows with the
          potential  to  produce gamma-ray bursts. In contrast to earlier
          works,  we provide an extensive and detailed parameter study of
          the  influence  of  general  relativistic  (GR)  effects and of
          different  neutrinosphere  geometries.  These include idealized
          thin   disks,   tori,   and  spheres,  or  are  constructed  as
          non-selfgravitating equilibrium matter distributions for varied
          BH  rotation.  Considering  isothermal neutrinospheres with the
          same  temperature and surface area, we confirm previous results
          that  compared  to  Newtonian calculations, GR effects increase
          the  annihilation rate measured by an observer at infinity by a
          factor of 2 when the neutrinosphere is a disk. However, in case
          of a torus and a sphere the influence of GR effects is globally
          only  ~25%,  although  locally  it can be significantly larger.
          Independent of whether GR effects are included, disks yield the
          highest energy deposition rates, followed by tori and, with the
          lowest  rates,  spheres.  For  disks  and  tori, increasing the
          angular  momentum  of  the  BH  from 0 to 1 enhances the energy
          deposition  rate measured by an observer at infinity by roughly
          a  factor  of  2  due  to  the  shrinking  inner  radius of the
          neutrinosphere. (abridged)

          Comments: Protostars and Planets V, in press
          We  review  the  current  state  of  observational  work on the
          formation  of  brown  dwarfs,  focusing  on  their initial mass
          function,   velocity   and   spatial  distributions  at  birth,
          multiplicity, accretion, and circumstellar disks. The available
          measurements  of these various properties are consistent with a
          common  formation  mechanism  for  brown  dwarfs  and stars. In
          particular,  the  existence  of  widely  separated binary brown
          dwarfs  and a probable isolated proto-brown dwarf indicate that
          some  substellar objects are able to form in the same manner as
          stars   through  unperturbed  cloud  fragmentation.  Additional
          mechanisms  such  as  ejection  and photoevaporation may play a
          role  in  the  birth  of  some  brown  dwarfs,  but there is no
          observational evidence to date to suggest that they are the key
          elements that make it possible for substellar bodies to form.

          We  study  hard  states of the black-hole binary XTE J1550--564
          during  its  2000 outburst. In order to explain those states at
          their  highest  luminosities,  $L\sim  10%$  of  the  Eddington
          luminosity,  $L_{\rm  E}$,  we propose a specific hot accretion
          flow model. We point out that $L$ is substantially more than an
          advection-dominated  accretion  flow  (ADAF) can produce, $\sim
          0.4\alpha^2 L_{\rm E}$, which is only $\sim (3$--$4)%L_{\rm E}$
          even  for  $\alpha$  as  high  as  0.3.  On  the other hand, we
          successfully  explain the hard states with $L\simeq (4$--$10)%$
          using   the  luminous  hot  accretion  flow  (LHAF)  model.  As
          $10%L_{\rm  E}$  is also roughly the highest luminosity an LHAF
          can  produce,  such  an  agreement  between  the  predicted and
          observed highest luminosities provides by itself strong support
          for   this   model.  Then,  we  study  multi-waveband  spectral
          variability  during  the  2000  outburst.  In  addition  to the
          primary  maxima  in  the optical light curves, secondary maxima
          were  detected after the transition from the very high state to
          the  hard  state.  We  show  that the secondary maxima are well
          modeled  by  synchrotron  emission from a jet formed during the
          state   transition.   We   argue   that   the  absence  of  the
          corresponding secondary peak in the X-ray light curve indicates
          that  the  X-ray  jet  emission,  regardless  of  its radiative
          process, synchrotron or its Comptonization, is not important in
          the  hard  state  compared  to  the emission from the accretion
          flow.

          Title:  A  look  at  disk-jet connections in stellar-mass black
          holes
          Authors: J. M. Miller (University of Michigan)
          Comments:  9  pages,  to  appear  in AIP Conference Proceedings
          "Relativistic Jets: The Common Physics of AGN, Microquasars and
          Gamma-Ray Bursts", ed. Philip A. Hughes and Joel N. Bregman
          Connections between accretion disks and jets in accreting black
          holes are anticipated theoretically. In recent years, potential
          evidence  for  such connections has been emerging, most vividly
          in  the  convenient regime of stellar-mass black holes. In this
          contribution,   various   lines   of   evidence   for  disk-jet
          connections  are  briefly  examined,  from the standpoint of an
          observer  focused  on the role of the disk. While many lines of
          investigation   may  be  promising  in  the  future,  obtaining
          multi-wavelength  lightcurves  and  correlating jet flux in the
          radio  band  with physical parameters and phenomena tied to the
          accretion disk in X-rays may be the most direct.

          We imaged five objects considered by Allers et al. (2006) to be
          of  low-mass  and associated with the young star-forming clouds
          in  Ophiuchus.  We resolved their #11 (2MASS J16222521-2405139)
          and #16 (2MASS J16233609-2402209) into binaries. The #16 binary
          is  an  unusually  wide  (212  AU), very low-mass (VLM), binary
          composed  of  a  ~100  Mjup  primary (16A) and a ~73 MJup (16B)
          secondary.  The  #11  object  is  even more unusual. The binary
          nature  of  11  was  independently discovered by Jayawardhana &
          Ivanov  (2006b)  who  call  it  Oph  162225-240515. The Oph #11
          projected  separation,  243  AU, is the largest known for a VLM
          binary  and  an  order  of  magnitude larger than that of older
          field  VLM  binaries.  We  have  obtained  the  first spatially
          resolved  near-infrared  (J & K) spectra and Mid-IR photometry.
          We  estimate  for  11A  and  11B  gravities (log(g)>3.75), ages
          (5+/-2     Myr),    luminosities    (log(L)=-2.77+/-0.10    and
          -2.96+/-0.10), and temperatures (Teff=2375+/-175 and 2175+/-175
          K).  We find self-consistent DUSTY evolutionary model (Chabrier
          et  al.  2000)  masses  of 17.5+/-2.5 MJup and 15.5+/-2.5 MJup,
          respectively.   Our  masses  are  higher  than  the  previously
          reported  13-15  MJup  and  7-8  MJup  masses  for  11A and 11B
          (Jayawardhana  &  Ivanov  2006b).  Hence, we find the system is
          unlikely  a  ``planetary  mass  binary'',  but it is the second
          lowest   mass   binary   known.  Moreover,  due  to  its  large
          separation,  Oph 11 appears to have a binding energy lower than
          any  other known binary. The formation (and survival) of such a
          weakly  bound  system  with  Vesc~0.5  km/s  may pose a serious
          challenge  to  brown dwarf/star formation theories. Oph #11 and
          Oph  #16  belong  to a new population of wide (>200 AU), young,
          roughly  equal  mass, VLM stellar and brown dwarf binaries that
          may become unbound over time.

          Title: Spin of Stellar-Mass Black Holes Estimated by a Model of
          Quasi-Periodic Oscillations
          Authors: Shoji Kato, Jun Fukue
          Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures, PASJ 58 (in press)
          We  have  proposed  in  previous papers that the high-frequency
          pair  QPOs observed in black-hole binaries with frequency ratio
          3:2   are  inertial-acoustic  oscillations  (nearly  horizontal
          oscillations  with no node in the vertical direction) or g-mode
          oscillations,   which   are   resonantly   excited   on  warped
          relativistic  disks.  The  resonance  occurs through horizontal
          motions.  In  this model the dimensionless spin parameter $a_*$
          of  the  central sources can be estimated when their masses are
          known  from other observations. This estimate is done for three
          sources (GRO J1665-40, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1915+105). For all of
          them we have $a_*\leq 0.45$.

          This   paper   presents  new  five  passbands  (UBVRI)  optical
          wide-field  imaging data accumulated as part of the DEEP Public
          Survey  (DPS) carried out as a public survey by the ESO Imaging
          Survey  (EIS)  project.  Out of the 3 square degrees originally
          proposed,  the  survey  covers 2.75 square degrees, in at least
          one  band  (normally  R),  and  1.00  square  degrees  in  five
          passbands.  The median seeing, as measured in the final stacked
          images,  is  0.97",  ranging  from  0.75"  to  2.0". The median
          limiting  magnitudes (AB system, 2" aperture, 5 sigma detection
          limit)  are  U_(AB)=25.65, B_(AB)=25.54, V_(AB)=25.18, R_(AB) =
          24.8  and  I_(AB)=24.12  mag, consistent with those proposed in
          the   original   survey   design.   The   paper  describes  the
          observations  and  data  reduction using the EIS Data Reduction
          System  and  its associated EIS/MVM library. The quality of the
          individual  images were inspected, bad images discarded and the
          remaining  used to produce final image stacks in each passband,
          from which sources have been extracted. Finally, the scientific
          quality  of  these  final  images  and  associated catalogs was
          assessed  qualitatively by visual inspection and quantitatively
          by  comparison  of statistical measures derived from these data
          with  those  of other authors as well as model predictions, and
          from  direct  comparison  with  the  results  obtained from the
          reduction  of  the same dataset using an independent (hands-on)
          software  system. Finally to illustrate one application of this
          survey, the results of a preliminary effort to identify sub-mJy
          radio  sources  are reported. To the limiting magnitude reached
          in the R and I passbands the success rate ranges from 66 to 81%
          (depending on the fields). These data are publicly available at
          CDS.

          We  have  redefined  group  membership  of  six southern galaxy
          groups in the local universe (mean cz < 2000 km/s) based on new
          redshift    measurements    from    our    recently    acquired
          Anglo-Australian  Telescope  2dF  spectra.  For  each group, we
          investigate  member galaxy kinematics, substructure, luminosity
          functions  and  luminosity-weighted  dynamics. Our calculations
          confirm  that  the  group sizes, virial masses and luminosities
          cover  the  range  expected  for galaxy groups, except that the
          luminosity  of  NGC  4038  is  boosted by the central starburst
          merger  pair.  We  find  that  a  combination  of  kinematical,
          substructural and dynamical techniques can reliably distinguish
          loose,  unvirialised  groups  from compact, dynamically relaxed
          groups.  Applying  these  techniques,  we find that Dorado, NGC
          4038  and  NGC 4697 are unvirialised, whereas NGC 681, NGC 1400
          and NGC 5084 are dynamically relaxed.

          Turolla and S. Zane
          The  excellent  spatial  resolution  of the Chandra observatory
          offers  the unprecedented possibility to measure proper motions
          at  X-ray  wavelength  with  relatively  high accuracy using as
          reference  the  background  of extragalactic or remote galactic
          X-ray   sources.  We  took  advantage  of  this  capability  to
          constrain   the   proper  motion  of  RX  J0806.4-4123  and  RX
          J0420.0-5022, two X-ray bright and radio quiet isolated neutron
          stars  (INSs)  discovered  by  ROSAT  and  lacking  an  optical
          counterpart.   In   this  paper,  we  present  results  from  a
          preliminary  analysis from which we derive 2 sigma upper limits
          of  76  mas/yr  and  138  mas/yr  on  the  proper motions of RX
          J0806.4-4123  and  RX  J0420.0-5022  respectively. We use these
          values  together  with  those of other ROSAT discovered INSs to
          constrain  the origin, distance and evolutionary status of this
          particular  group  of  objects.  We  find  that  the tangential
          velocities  of  radio  quiet  ROSAT  neutron stars are probably
          consistent  with  those of 'normal' pulsars. Their distribution
          on  the  sky  and,  for  those  having  accurate  proper motion
          vectors,  their  possible  birth  places,  all point to a local
          population,  probably  created  in  the  part of the Gould Belt
          nearest to the earth.

          Title: The Metallicity of Galaxy Disks: Infall versus Outflow
          Authors: J. J. Dalcanton
          Comments:  22  pages,  including  10  figures;  Accepted to the
          Astrophysical Journal
          Both  gas  accretion  (infall)  and  winds  (outflow)  change a
          galaxy's  metallicity  and gas fraction, lowering the effective
          yield.  Low effective yields in galaxies with rotation speeds <
          120 km/s have been widely interpreted as the onset of SN-driven
          winds  below a characteristic galaxy mass, but gas accretion is
          also a viable explanation. However, calculations presented here
          prove:  (1) that metal-enriched outflows are the only mechanism
          that can significantly reduce the effective yield, but only for
          gas-rich  systems;  (2)  that it is nearly impossible to reduce
          the  effective  yield  of a gas-poor system, no matter how much
          gas  is  lost  or  accreted;  and  (3) that any subsequent star
          formation  drives  the  effective  yield back to the closed-box
          value.  Thus,  only  gas-rich  systems  with low star formation
          rates  (such  as dwarf irregulars) can produce and maintain low
          effective  yields,  while  massive  gas-poor galaxies can never
          show  low effective yields, even after experiencing substantial
          infall  and/or outflow. The drop in effective yield seen in low
          mass  galaxies  is therefore less likely to be due to the onset
          of  SN-driven  winds  than  to  the galaxies' surface densities
          falling  entirely  below the Kennicutt SF threshold. Additional
          calculations  confirm  that  the fraction of baryonic mass lost
          through  winds  varies  only  weakly with galaxy mass, shows no
          sharp  upturn at any mass scale, and does not require that >15%
          of  baryons have been lost by galaxies of any mass. SN feedback
          is  therefore  unlikely  to  be  effective  for  removing large
          amounts  of  gas  from low mass disk galaxies. In addition, the
          dependence  between  metal-loss and galaxy mass is sufficiently
          weak  that  massive  galaxies  dominate metal enrichment of the
          IGM.  The calculations in this paper provide limiting cases for
          any  arbitrary  chemical  evolution  history,  as  proven in an
          Appendix.

          International LISA Symposium
          We   consider  a  model  in  which  massive  stars  form  in  a
          self-gravitating  accretion  disk  around  an  active  galactic
          nucleus.  These  stars  may evolve and collapse to form compact
          objects  on  a time scale shorter than the accretion time, thus
          producing an important family of sources for LISA. Assuming the
          compact  object  formation/inspiral rate is proportional to the
          steady-state   gas   accretion   rate,   we  use  the  observed
          extra-galactic  X-ray  luminosity function to estimate expected
          event  rates  and  signal strengths. We find that these sources
          will  produce  a continuous low-frequency background detectable
          by  LISA  if  more  than >~ 1% of the accreted matter is in the
          form of compact objects. For compact objects with m >~ 10 Msun,
          the  last  stages  of  the inspiral events should be resolvable
          above a few mHz, at a rate of ~10-100 per year.

          2003-2005.  This  source  as  been  observed  in  both the soft
          (banana) and hard (island) spectral states. A high energy tail,
          above 50 keV, in the hard state has been observed for the first
          time.  This places the source in the category of X-ray bursters
          showing high-energy emission. The tail can be modeled as a soft
          power  law  component, with the photon index of ~2.4, on top of
          thermal Comptonization emission from a plasma with the electron
          temperature   of  kT_e~6  keV  and  optical  depth  of  \tau~4.
          Alternatively,  but  at  a  lower  goodness  of  the  fit,  the
          hard-state broad band spectrum can be accounted for by emission
          from   a   hybrid,   thermal-nonthermal,  plasma.  During  this
          monitoring the source spent most of the time in the soft state,
          usual  for this source, and the >~4 keV spectra are represented
          by thermal Comptonization with kT_e~3 keV and \tau~6-7.

          Title:  Gravitational Recoil from Binary Black Hole Mergers:the
          Close-Limit Approximation
          Authors:  Carlos F. Sopuerta, Nicolas Yunes, Pablo Laguna (Penn
          State)
          Comments: RevTeX, 27 pages, 11 figures
          [abridged] The coalescence of a binary black hole system is one
          of  the  main  sources  of gravitational waves that present and
          future  detectors will study. Apart from the energy and angular
          momentum  that  these  waves  carry,  for unequal-mass binaries
          there  is  also  a  net  flux of linear momentum that implies a
          recoil  velocity  of  the  resulting  final  black  hole in the
          opposite  direction.  We  present  a  computation of the recoil
          velocity  based  on the close-limit approximation scheme, which
          gives  excellent  results for head-on and grazing collisions of
          black  holes  when  compared  to  full  numerical  relativistic
          calculations.  We obtain a maximum recoil velocity of ~ 57 km/s
          for a symmetric mass ratio eta = M_1 M_2/(M_1+M_2)^2 ~ 0.19 and
          an  initial  proper separation of 4 M, where M is the total ADM
          mass of the system. This separation is the maximum at which the
          close-limit  approximation  is  expected  to  provide  accurate
          results. If we supplement this estimate with PN calculations up
          to the innermost stable circular orbit, we obtain a lower bound
          for the recoil velocity, with a maximum around 80 km/s. This is
          a  lower bound because it neglects the initial merger phase. We
          can  however obtain a rough estimate by using PN methods or the
          close-limit  approximation.  Since  both  methods  are known to
          overestimate  the amount of radiation, we obtain in this way an
          upper  bound for the recoil with maxima in the range of 214-240
          km/s.  We also provide non-linear fits to these estimated upper
          and  lower bounds. These estimates are subject to uncertainties
          related to issues such as the choice of initial data and higher
          effects  in perturbation theory. Nonetheless, our estimates are
          consistent  with previous results in the literature and suggest
          a narrower range of possible recoil velocities.

          Title:  A  Hard-to-Soft  State  Transition  during A Luminosity
          Decline of Aquila X-1
          Authors: Wenfei Yu, Joshua Dolence
          Comments:   12   pages  including  3  figures,  AASTEX  format,
          submitted to ApJ
          Contrary  to  the  idea  that  the  X-ray  spectral  states  of
          accreting  black  holes and neutron stars are determined by the
          mass  accretion  rate  and  that a transition from the low/hard
          (LH)  state  to  the high/soft (HS) state is associated with an
          increase of luminosity, we have discovered a hard-to-soft state
          transition  during  a  luminosity  decay of Aquila X$-$1 in the
          observations  made  with  the  {\it Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
          (RXTE)}.  The  2--60 keV energy flux corresponding to the state
          transition  is $9.3\times{10}^{-10} {\rm ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}}$,
          an  order  of  magnitude lower than the maximum observed in the
          past.  The  2--60  keV  peak  flux of the following HS state is
          $1.5\times{10}^{-9}  {\rm  ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}}$. This confirms
          the  correlation  between  the  luminosity  of the hard-to-soft
          state  transition  and  the peak luminosity of the following HS
          state   previously   found.   The  relation  derived  from  the
          observations  of  four  outbursts  is  consistent with a linear
          relation over a luminosity range of an order of magnitude. This
          implies   that   the   luminosity  of  the  hard-to-soft  state
          transition is not determined solely by the mass accretion rate,
          but  appears  determined  by  the peak luminosities of the soft
          X-ray  outbursts.  The  time  lag  of  the peak of the HS state
          relative to the occurrence of the hard-to-soft state transition
          varied  from  about  5 days to 11 days, showing a weak trend of
          increasing  time  lag with increasing peak luminosity of the HS
          state.  These results provide additional evidence that the mass
          in the accretion disk probably determines the luminosity of the
          hard-to-soft state transition.

          young  stellar objects Interplay between stellar magnetospheric
          winds and disc-driven jets
          Authors: Z. Meliani; F. Casse; C. Sauty
          Comments: 16 pages, Accepted in A&A 04/08/2006
          We    present   the   first-ever   simulations   of   non-ideal
          magnetohydrodynamical   (MHD)   stellar   magnetospheric  winds
          coupled  with  disc-driven jets where the resistive and viscous
          accretion disc is self-consistently described. These innovative
          MHD  simulations  are  devoted  to  the  study of the interplay
          between  a  stellar wind (having different ejection mass rates)
          and  an  MHD  disc-driven  jet  embedding the stellar wind. The
          transmagnetosonic,  collimated  MHD  outflows  are investigated
          numerically  using  the  VAC  code.  We  first  investigate the
          various   angular   momentum   transports   occurring   in  the
          magneto-viscous   accretion   disc.   We   then   analyze   the
          modifications  induced  by  the  interaction  between  the  two
          components of the outflow.}{Our simulations show that the inner
          outflow  is  accelerated  from  the central object's hot corona
          thanks  to  both the thermal pressure and the Lorentz force. In
          our  framework,  the  thermal  acceleration is sustained by the
          heating  produced  by the dissipated magnetic energy due to the
          turbulence. Conversely, the outflow launched from the resistive
          accretion disc is mainly accelerated by the magneto-centrifugal
          force.}{The  simulations  show that the MHD disc-driven outflow
          extracts  angular  momentum  more  efficiently  than do viscous
          effects  in  near-equipartition,  thin-magnetized  discs  where
          turbulence  is fully developed. We also show that, when a dense
          inner  stellar wind occurs, the resulting disc-driven jet has a
          different structure, namely a magnetic structure where poloidal
          magnetic  field lines are more inclined because of the pressure
          caused  by the stellar wind. This modification leads to both an
          enhanced mass-ejection rate in the disc-driven jet and a larger
          radial   extension   that  is  in  better  agreement  with  the
          observations, besides being more consistent.

          Comments: 34 pages, 11 figures, ApJ accepted (Dec 2006)
          Spectra have been obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS)
          on  the  Spitzer  Space Telescope for 20 sources in the Lockman
          Hole  field  of the SWIRE survey. The sample is divided between
          sources  with indicators of an obscured AGN, based primarily on
          X-ray  detections  of optically-faint sources, and sources with
          indicators  of  a starburst, based on optical and near-infrared
          spectral  energy  distributions  (SEDs) which show a luminosity
          peak  from  stellar  photospheric  emission.  Ten of the 11 AGN
          sources  have IRS spectra which show silicate absorption or are
          power  laws;  only  one AGN source shows PAH emission features.
          All   9   of   the   sources  showing  starburst  SEDs  in  the
          near-infrared  show  PAH  emission features in the IRS spectra.
          Redshifts  are  determined  from  the  IRS  spectra  for  all 9
          starbursts (1.0 < z < 1.9) and 8 of the 11 AGN (0.6 < z < 2.5).
          Classification  as  AGN  because  of  an  X-ray  detection, the
          classification as AGN or starburst derived from the photometric
          SED,  and the IRS spectroscopic classification as AGN (silicate
          absorption)  or  starburst (PAH emission) are all consistent in
          18  of 20 sources. The surface density for starbursts which are
          most  luminous  in  the  mid-infrared is less than that for the
          most  luminous  AGN within the redshift interval 1.7 < z < 1.9.
          This  result  implies  that  mid-infrared source counts at high
          redshift are dominated by AGN for f(24micron) > 1.0 mJy.

          Title: The concentration-sigma relation in galaxy groups
          Authors: Andreas Faltenbacher, William G. Mathews
          Comments: 12 pages, 11 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Based  on  results  from cold dark matter N-body simulations we
          develop a dynamical model for the evolution of subhaloes within
          host  haloes of galaxy groups. Only subhaloes more massive than
          5  times  10^8  M_{sol}  at  the time of accretion are examined
          because  they  are  massive  enough  to  possibly host luminous
          galaxies.  As  they  orbit  within a growing host potential the
          subhaloes   are   subject  to  tidal  stripping  and  dynamical
          friction. We consider groups of equal mass (M_{vir} = 3.9 times
          10^{13}   M_{sol})   at   redshift   z=0   but  with  different
          concentrations  associated  with  different formation times. We
          investigate  the  variation  of  subhaloe (or satellite galaxy)
          velocity  dispersion  with  host concentration and/or formation
          time.  In  agreement  with  the  Jeans  equation  the  velocity
          dispersion  of subhaloes increases with the host concentration.
          Between   concentrations  ~5  and  ~20  the  subhaloe  velocity
          dispersions  increase by ~25 per cent. By applying a simplified
          tidal  disruption  criterion,  i.e.  rejection of all subhaloes
          with  a tidal truncation radius below 3 kpc at z=0, the central
          velocity   dispersion   of   'surviving'   subhaloes  increases
          substantially  for  all  concentrations.  The  enhanced central
          velocity  dispersion  among  surviving subhaloes is caused by a
          lack  of  slow  tangential  motions. Additionally, we present a
          fitting  formula for the velocity anisotropy parameter \beta(r)
          which  does  not  depend  on concentration if the group-centric
          distances  are  scaled by r_s, the characteristic radius of the
          NFW-profile.

          Palous, Cambridge Univ Press
          New  observations  in  favour  of a significant role of secular
          evolution  are  reviewed:  central  star  formation  boosted in
          pseudo-bulge barred galaxies, relations between bulge and disk,
          evidence  for  rejuvenated  bulges.  Numerical simulations have
          shown  that  secular evolution can occur through a cycle of bar
          formation and destruction, in which the gas plays a major role.
          Since bars are weakened or destroyed in gaseous disks, the high
          frequency  of  bars  observed  today requires external cold gas
          accretion, to replenish the disk and allow a new bar formation.
          The rate of gas accretion from external filaments is compatible
          with what is observed in cosmological simulations.

          Comments:  6  pages,  3  figures,  Proceedings  of "Mapping the
          Galaxy and Nearby Galaxies", Eds. K. Wada & F. Combes, Springer
          Dynamical evolution of spiral galaxies is strongly dependent on
          non-axisymmetric   patterns  that  develop  from  gravitational
          instabilities, either spontaneously or externally triggered.
          Some  evolutionary  sequences  are  described  through  which a
          galaxy  could  possibly  concentrate mass and build bulges, how
          external  gas accretion from cosmic filaments could be funneled
          to  the  galaxy  disks, and intermittently driven to the galaxy
          center,  to form nuclear starbursts and fuel an active nucleus.
          The  frequency  of  both  bars  and lopsidedness can be used to
          constrain the gas accretion rate.

          Letters
          We  present  a period-luminosity-amplitude analysis of 5899 red
          giant  and  binary  stars  in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using
          publicly  available observations of the MACHO project. For each
          star,  we  determined new periods, which were double-checked in
          order    to    exclude   aliases   and   false   periods.   The
          period-luminosity   relations   confirm   the  existence  of  a
          short-period, small-amplitude P-L sequence at periods shortward
          of  Seq.  A.  We point out that the widely accepted sequence of
          eclipsing binaries between Seqs. C and D, known as Seq. E, does
          not  exist.  The  correct  position  for Seq. E is at periods a
          factor  of  two  greater,  and  the  few  stars genuinely lying
          between  Seq.  C  and  D  are  under-luminous  Mira  variables,
          presumably  enshrouded  in  dust. The true Seq. E overlaps with
          the  sequence  of Long Secondary Periods (Seq. D) and their P-L
          relation  is  well  described  by a simple model assuming Roche
          geometry.  The  amplitudes  of  LSPs  have  properties that are
          different   from   both  the  pulsations  and  the  ellipsoidal
          variations,  but  they  are more similar to the former than the
          latter,  arguing  for  pulsation  rather  than  binarity as the
          origin of the LSP phenomenon.

          (NJU)
          Comments: 18 pages,5 figures, accepted by ApJ
          We  have  investigated the relation between the orbital periods
          ($\pb$)  and the spin periods ($\ps$) of wind-fed X-ray pulsars
          in  high-mass  X-ray  binaries  (HMXBs),  based  on  population
          synthesis  calculations  of the spin evolution of neutron stars
          during  the  pre-HMXB  stage.  We show that most of the neutron
          stars either have steady accretion or still reside in the radio
          pulsar  phase  when the donor star starts evolving off the main
          sequence.  In  the  former  case  the  values  of  $\ps$ can be
          decelerated  to  be  $\sim  10^2-10^3$ s depending on $\pb$. We
          briefly   discuss   the   possible   origin  of  the  $\ps-\pb$
          correlation  in  Be/X-ray  binaries, and the existence of HMXBs
          with  main  sequence  donors.  We  have  also  investigated the
          evolution  of  the  inclination  angle between the magnetic and
          spin  axes  of  neutron  stars  in a massive binary, suggesting
          secular  alignment  of  the magnetic and spin axes during their
          evolution.

          Comments: 4 pages, REVTeX
          It  is  shown  that the oscillations of brightness in classical
          Cepheids and other 'pulsating' variable stars are caused rather
          by the passing of radial solitary waves through the photosphere
          of  a star, than by pulsations of a star. Radial solitary waves
          also  determine  the  oscillations  of brightness in some other
          types  of  periodic  variable  stars ordinary not considered as
          pulsating stars.

          Title:  Local stability of self-gravitating fluid disks made of
          two components in relative motion
          Authors: Giuseppe Bertin, Antonio Cava
          Comments:  9  pages,  5  figures,  Astronomy & Astrophysics, in
          press
          Context.  We  consider  a simple self-gravitating disk, made of
          two  fluid  components  characterized  by  different  effective
          thermal  speeds  and  interacting with one another only through
          gravity;  two-component  models  of  this  type have often been
          considered  in  order  to  estimate  the  impact  of  the  cold
          interstellar   medium   on   gravitational   instabilities   in
          star-dominated galaxy disks.
          Aims.  This  simple  model  allows  us  to  produce  a  unified
          description  of  instabilities  in non-viscous self-gravitating
          disks,  some  originating  from Jeans collapse, and others from
          the  relative motion between the two components. In particular,
          the  model  suggests  that the small streaming velocity between
          the  two  components  associated  with the so-called asymmetric
          drift   may   be   the   origin  of  instability  for  suitable
          non-axisymmetric perturbations.
          Methods.  The result is obtained by examining the properties of
          a  local,  linear dispersion relation for tightly wound density
          waves    in    such   two-component   model.   The   parameters
          characterizing the equilibrium model and the related dispersion
          relation allow us to recover as natural limits the cases, known
          in  the literature, in which the relative drift between the two
          components is ignored.
          Results.  Dynamically,  the instability is similar to (although
          gentler  than)  that  known  to  affect counter-rotating disks.
          However,   in   contrast   to   the   instability   induced  by
          counter-rotation,  which  is  a relatively rare phenomenon, the
          mechanism discussed in this paper is likely to be rather common
          in nature.
          Conclusions.  We  briefly  indicate  some  consequences  of the
          instability  on  the  evolution  of  galaxy  disks and possible
          applications  to  other astrophysical systems, in particular to

          Title:  Accretion  states and radio loudness in Active Galactic
          Nuclei: analogies with X-ray binaries
          Authors:   Elmar   Koerding   (Southampton),  Sebastian  Jester
          (Southampton), Rob Fender (Southampton)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Hardness-intensity  diagrams  (HIDs)  have been used with great
          success  to  study the accretion states and their connection to
          radio  jets  in X-ray binaries (XRBs). The analogy between XRBs
          and active galactic nuclei (AGN) suggests that similar diagrams
          may help to understand and identify accretion states in AGN and
          their    connection    to    radio   loudness.   We   construct
          ``disc-fraction    luminosity    diagrams''    (DFLDs)   as   a
          generalization  of  HIDs,  which plot the intensity against the
          fraction  of  the  disc  contribution  in  the overall spectral
          energy distribution (SED). Using a sample of 4963 Sloan Digital
          Sky   Survey   (SDSS)  quasars  with  ROSAT  matches,  we  show
          empirically  that  an  AGN  is  more  likely  to  have  a  high
          radio:optical flux ratio when it has a high total luminosity or
          a  large  non-thermal contribution to the SED. We find that one
          has to consider at least two-dimensional diagrams to understand
          the  radio  loudness  of  AGN.  To  extend  our  DFLD  to lower
          luminosities  we  also  include a sample of low-luminosity AGN.
          Using  a  simulated population of XRBs we show that stellar and
          supermassive  BHs populate similar regions in the DFLD and show
          similar  radio/jet  properties.  This supports the idea the AGN
          and  XRBs  have  the  same  accretion states and associated jet
          properties.

          Title: Sensitive VLBI Studies of the OH Megamaser Emission from
          IRAS 17208-0014
          Authors:  E. Momjian (NAIC), J. D. Romney (NRAO), C. L. Carilli

          Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures. ApJ Accepted
          We present phase-referenced VLBI results on the radio continuum
          and  the  OH  18  cm megamaser emission from the Ultra-Luminous
          Infrared   Galaxy,  IRAS  17208--0014.  The  observations  were
          carried out at 1599 MHz using the Very Long Baseline Array, the
          phased   VLA,   and  the  Green  Bank  Telescope.  The  highest
          resolution radio continuum results show several compact sources
          with  brightness temperatures on the order of $10^{6}$ K. These
          sources  are  more  likely  to  be clustered supernova remnants
          and/or   luminous  radio  supernovae.  However,  the  agreement
          between  the  number  of  observed and expected compact sources
          above  the  5 $\sigma$ level supports the possibility that each
          one  of  the  compact  sources could be dominated by a recently
          detonated  luminous  radio  supernova.  The  continuum  results
          suggest  that  there is no radio-loud AGN in the nuclear region
          of  this  galaxy.  The  OH  18  cm  megamaser  emission in IRAS
          17208--0014  is detected at various angular resolutions. It has
          an  extent  of  $170 \times 110$ pc, and is mostly localized in
          two  regions  separated by 61 pc. The structure and dynamics of
          the  maser  emission  seem  to  be  consistent  with  a clumpy,
          rotating,  ring-like  geometry,  with  the  two  dominant maser
          regions   marking   the   tangential  points  of  the  proposed
          rotating-ring  distribution.  Assuming Keplerian motion for the
          rotating  maser  ring, the enclosed dynamical mass and the mass
          density  within  a radius of 30.5 pc, are about {$3 \times 10^7
          ({\rm  sin}^{-2}i)  M{_\odot}$},  and  $281  ({\rm sin}^{-2} i)
          M{_\odot} {\rm pc}^{-3}$, respectively.

          Title:  The structure of dark matter halos: self-similar models
          versus N-body simulations
          Authors: Leonid Chuzhoy
          Comments: 3 pages, 3 figures
          We derive the density profile of cold dark matter halos using a
          self-similar accretion model. We show that if the clumpiness of
          the  infalling  matter  is  taken  into account, then the inner
          density  slope, d(log{rho})/d(log{r}), is close to -1. Compared
          with  the  density  profiles  predicted  by different numerical
          simulations,  we  find that outside ~0.1% of the virial radius,
          our  solutions  agree best with the fitting formula proposed by
          Navarro  et al. (2004), d(ln{rho})/d(ln{r})=-2(r/R)^0.17, where
          R  is a characteristic radius, inside which the density profile
          becomes shallower than isothermal.

          The  Palomar  High-precision  Astrometric  Search for Exoplanet
          Systems  (PHASES) has monitored 37 sub-arcsecond binary systems
          to  determine  whether  their Keplerian orbits are perturbed by
          faint  astrometric companions to either star. Software has been
          developed  to  evaluate  the regions in a companion mass-period
          phase  space  in  which the PHASES observations can exclude the
          possibility  of face-on orbit perturbations. We present results
          for  8  systems for which astrometric companions with masses as
          small as those of giant planets can be excluded.

          Title: Growth of structure seeded by primordial black holes
          Authors:  Katherine  J.  Mack,  Jeremiah  P.  Ostriker, Massimo
          Ricotti
          Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures. Submitted to ApJ
          We  discuss the possibilities for primordial black holes (PBHs)
          to  grow  via  the  accretion of dark matter. In agreement with
          previous   works,   we   find   that   accretion   during   the
          radiation-dominated  era  does  not  lead to a significant mass
          increase.  However,  during matter-domination, PBHs may grow by
          up  to  two orders of magnitude in mass through the acquisition
          of  large dark matter halos. We discuss the possibility of PBHs
          being  an  important component in dark matter halos of galaxies
          as  well as their potential to explain the ultra-luminous x-ray
          sources  (ULXs) observed in nearby galactic disks. We point out
          that  although  PBHs are ruled out as the dominant component of
          dark  matter,  there  is  still a great deal of parameter space
          open  to  them  playing  a role in the modern-day universe. For
          example, a primordial halo population of PBHs each at $10^{2.5}
          M_\odot$  making  up  0.1% of the dark matter grow to $10^{4.5}
          M_\odot$  via  the accumulation of dark matter halos to account
          for  $\sim  10%$  of  the  dark matter mass by a redshift of $z
          \approx  30$.  These  intermediate  mass  black  holes may then
          ``light  up''  when  passing through molecular clouds, becoming
          visible  as ULXs at the present day, or they may form the seeds
          for supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.

          We  describe  observations  of  9.7  um silicate features in 97
          AGNs,  exhibiting  a  wide  range  of  AGN  types  and of X-ray
          extinction toward the central nuclei. We find that the strength
          of  the  silicate feature correlates with the HI column density
          estimated from fitting the X-ray data, such that low HI columns
          correspond  to  silicate emission while high columns correspond
          to  silicate  absorption.  The behavior is generally consistent
          with  unification  models  where  the  large  diversity  in AGN
          properties  is caused by viewing-angle-dependent obscuration of
          the  nucleus.  Radio-loud  AGNs  and radio-quiet quasars follow
          roughly  the correlation between HI columns and the strength of
          the silicate feature defined by Seyfert galaxies. The agreement
          among  AGN types suggests a high-level unification with similar
          characteristics for the structure of the obscuring material. We
          demonstrate    the    implications   for   unification   models
          qualitatively  with a conceptual disk model. The model includes
          an  inner  accretion  disk  (< 0.1 pc in radius), a middle disk
          (0.1-10  pc  in radius) with a dense diffuse component and with
          embedded  denser clouds, and an outer clumpy disk (10-300 pc in
          radius).

          We  report  H2O masers associated with the massive-star forming
          region G192.16-3.84 observed with the new Japan VLBI network at
          three  epochs  spanned  for two months, which have revealed the
          three-dimensional kinematical structure of the whole \h2o maser
          region  in  G192.16-3.84,  containing two young stellar objects
          separated  by  ~1200 AU. The maser spatio-kinematical structure
          has  well  persisted  since previous observations, in which the
          masers  are  expected to be associated with a highly-collimated
          bipolar  jet and an infalling-rotating disk in the northern and
          southern  clusters  of  H2O  maser  features,  respectively. We
          estimated a jet expansion speed of ~100 km/s and re-estimated a
          dynamical  age  of  the  whole  jet to be 5.6x10^4 yrs. We have
          investigated  the  spatial  distribution  of Doppler velocities
          during  the  previous  and  present  observations  and relative
          proper  motions  of H2O maser features in the southern cluster,
          and a relative bulk motion between the two maser clusters. They
          are  well  explained  by  a model of an infalling-rotating disk
          with  a  radius  of ~1000 AU and a central stellar mass of 5-10
          M_sun, rather than by a model of a bipolar jet perpendicular to
          the  observed  CO  outflow.  Based  on  the  derived  H2O maser
          spatio-kinematical   parameters,   we   discuss  the  formation
          mechanism  of the massive young stellar objects and the outflow
          development in G192.16-3.84.

          Title: A ULX associated with a cloud collision in M99
          Authors:  Roberto  Soria  (CfA  &  MSSL),  Diane Sonya Wong (UC
          Berkeley)
          Comments: 10 pages, accepted by MNRAS
          The  Sc  galaxy  M99  in  the  Virgo  cluster has been strongly
          affected  by  tidal  interactions  and recent close encounters,
          responsible  for  an  asymmetric spiral pattern and a high star
          formation  rate. Our XMM-Newton study shows that the inner disk
          is dominated by hot plasma at kT ~ 0.30 keV, with a total X-ray
          luminosity  ~  10^{41}  erg/s  in  the 0.3--12 keV band. At the
          outskirts  of  the  galaxy,  away  from  the  main star-forming
          regions,  there  is an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) with an
          X-ray  luminosity  ~ 2 x 10^{40} erg/s and a hard spectrum well
          fitted  by a power law of photon index Gamma ~ 1.7. This source
          is close to the location where a massive HI cloud appears to be
          falling  onto  the  M99 disk at a relative speed > 100 km/s. We
          suggest  that  there may be a direct physical link between fast
          cloud collisions and the formation of bright ULXs, which may be
          powered  by  accreting  black  holes  with  masses  ~ 100 Msun.
          External collisions may trigger large-scale dynamical collapses
          of  protoclusters, leading to the formation of very massive (>~
          200  Msun)  stellar  progenitors;  we argue that such stars may
          later   collapse  into  massive  black  holes  if  their  metal
          abundance is sufficiently low.

          The  X-ray  spectra  of the magnetar candidates are customarily
          fitted  with  an  empirical,  two  component model: an absorbed
          blackbody and a power-law. However, the physical interpretation
          of  these  two  spectral components is rarely discussed. It has
          been recently proposed that the presence of a hot plasma in the
          magnetosphere of highly magnetized neutron stars might distort,
          through  efficient  resonant  cyclotron scattering, the thermal
          emission  from  the  neutron  star  surface,  resulting  in the
          production of non-thermal spectra. Here we discuss the Resonant
          Cyclotron   Scattering  (RCS)  model,  and  present  its  XSPEC
          implementation,   as   well   as  preliminary  results  of  its
          application  to  Anomalous  X-ray  Pulsars  and  Soft Gamma-ray

          SAX J2103.5+4545 had been continously monitored for $\sim $ 900
          days  by  Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) since its outburst
          at  July  2002.  Using these observations and previous archival
          RXTE  observations  of  SAX J2103.5+4545, we refined the binary
          orbital  parameters  and  find  the  new  orbital  period as P=
          (12.66536   $\pm   $  0.00088)  days  and  the  eccentricty  as
          0.4055$\pm$  0.0032.  With  these  new  orbital  parameters, we
          constructed  the pulse frequency and pulse frequency derivative
          histories  of  the pulsar and confirmed the correlation between
          X-ray  flux and pulse frequency derivative presented by Baykal,
          Stark  and  Swank  (2002). We constructed the power spectra for
          the  fluctuations of pulse frequency derivatives and found that
          the  power  law  index of the noise spectra 2.13 $\pm$ 0.6. The
          power  law  index  is  consistent  with  random  walk  in pulse
          frequency  derivative  and is the steepest power law index seen
          among the HMXRBs.
          X-ray  spectra analysis confirmed the inverse correlation trend
          between  power  law index and X-ray flux found by Baykal, Stark
          and Swank (2002).

          Astrophysics
          This  paper  develops a method for obtaining the star formation
          histories  of  a  mixed, resolved population through the use of
          color-magnitude  diagrams  (CMDs).  The method provides insight
          into  the local star formation rate, analyzing the observations
          of  the Hipparcos satellite through a comparison with synthetic
          CMDs  computed  for different histories with an updated stellar
          evolution  library.  Parallax and photometric uncertainties are
          included   explicitly   and   corrected   using   the  Bayesian
          Richardson-Lucy  algorithm.  We first describe our verification
          studies  using  artificial  data  sets.  From  this sensitivity
          study,  the  critical  factors  determining  the  success  of a
          recovery  for  a  known  star  formation  rate  are  a  partial
          knowledge  of  the  IMF  and  the age-metallicity relation, and
          sample  contamination  by  clusters  and moving groups (special
          populations  whose  histories  are  different  than that of the
          whole   sample).   Unresolved   binaries   are  less  important
          impediments.  We  highlight how these limit the method. For the
          real field sample, complete to Mv < 3.5, we find that the solar
          neighborhood star formation rate has a characteristic timescale
          for  variation of about 6 Gyr, with a maximum activity close to
          3   Gyr  ago.  The  similarity  of  this  finding  with  column
          integrated  star  formation rates may indicate a global origin,
          possibly  a  collision with a satellite galaxy. We also discuss
          applications  of  this technique to general photometric surveys
          of  other  complex  systems  (e.g.  Local Group dwarf galaxies)
          where the distances are well known.

          Aims:  In this work the luminosity function of QSOs is measured
          in  the  redshift  range  3.5<z<5.2  for the absolute magnitude
          interval -21<M_{145}<-28. The determination of the faint end of
          the  luminosity  function at these redshifts provides important
          constraints  on models of joint evolution of galaxies and AGNs.
          Methods: We have defined suitable criteria to select faint QSOs
          in the GOODS fields, checking in detail their effectiveness and
          completeness.  Spectroscopic  follow-up  of  the  resulting QSO
          candidates  has been carried out. The confirmed sample of faint
          QSOs  is compared with a brighter one derived from the SDSS. We
          have used a Monte-Carlo technique to estimate the properties of
          the luminosity function, checking various parameterizations for
          its  shape and evolution. Results: Models based on Pure Density
          Evolution  show  better  agreement with observation than models
          based  on  Pure Luminosity Evolution. However a different break
          magnitude  with  respect  to  z~2.1  is  required at 3.5<z<5.2.
          Models  with a steeper faint end score a higher probability. We
          do  not find any evidence for a flattening of the bright end at
          redshift   z>3.5.  Conclusions:  The  estimated  space  density
          evolution  of  QSOs  indicates  a  suppression of the formation
          and/or  feeding of Supermassive Black Holes at these redshifts.
          The  QSO  contribution  to the UV background is insufficient to
          ionize the IGM at 3.5<z<5.2.

          Title: A Search for Nitrogen-Enhanced Metal-Poor Stars
          Authors: Jennifer A. Johnson (DAO/HIA/NRC), Falk Herwig (LANL),
          Timothy C. Beers (MSU/JINA), Norbert Christlieb (Hamburg)
          Comments: 14 pages, 7 figures, to be published in ApJ
          Theoretical   models   of   very  metal-poor  intermediate-mass
          Asymptotic   Giant   Branch   (AGB)   stars   predict  a  large
          overabundance   of   primary  nitrogen.  The  very  metal-poor,
          carbon-enhanced,  s-process-rich stars, which are thought to be
          the  polluted  companions  of  now-extinct  AGB  stars, provide
          direct tests of the predictions of these models. Recent studies
          of  the carbon and nitrogen abundances in metal-poor stars have
          focused  on  the most carbon-rich stars, leading to a potential
          selection  bias  against  stars  that have been polluted by AGB
          stars  that  produced large amounts of nitrogen, and hence have
          small  [C/N]  ratios.  We  call  these  stars Nitrogen-Enhanced
          Metal-Poor  (NEMP)  stars,  and  define them as having [N/Fe] >
          +0.5  and  [C/N]  < -0.5. In this paper, we report on the [C/N]
          abundances  of  a  sample  of 21 carbon-enhanced stars, all but
          three  of  which have [C/Fe] < +2.0. If NEMP stars were made as
          easily  as  Carbon-Enhanced  Metal-Poor  (CEMP)  stars, then we
          expected  to find between two and seven NEMP stars. Instead, we
          found   no   NEMP   stars   in   our  sample.  Therefore,  this
          observational  bias  is  not  an  important  contributor to the
          apparent  dearth  of  N-rich stars. Our [C/N] values are in the
          same  range  as  values  reported  previously in the literature
          (-0.5  to  +2.0),  and  all  stars are in disagreement with the
          predicted  [C/N]  ratios  for  both  low-mass and high-mass AGB
          stars.  We suggest that the decrease in [C/N] from the low-mass
          AGB  models  is due to enhanced extra-mixing, while the lack of
          NEMP stars may be caused by unfavorable mass ratios in binaries
          or the difficulty of mass transfer in binary systems with large
          mass ratios.

          Journal
          We  present  Very Large Array observations at 1.3 cm of several
          water maser detections obtained by previous single-dish studies
          of  Bok globules in the Clemens & Barvainis (1988; CB) catalog.
          We  report  water  maser emission in CB 3 (CB3-mm), CB 54 (IRAS
          07020-1618),  CB  101  (IRAS  17503-0833),  and  CB  232  (IRAS
          21352+4307),  and non-detection towards CB 65 (IRAS 16277-2332)
          and  CB  205  (IRAS  19433+2743).  These are the first reported
          interferometric observations of water masers in Bok globules of
          the  CB  catalog.  We  also present single-dish observations of
          millimeter  and  centimeter spectral lines towards CB 101 (IRAS
          17503-0833) and CB 65 (IRAS 16277-2332). All the maser emission
          seems  to  be  associated  with  star  forming  regions hosting
          bipolar  molecular  outflows, except IRAS 17503-0833 in CB 101,
          which  we  suggest to be a possible Mira evolved star, and IRAS
          16277-2332  in  CB  65,  of  unknown  nature.  We have used the
          precise  position  of  the maser emission to derive information
          about  the  powering  source  of  the  masers. By analyzing the
          spatio-kinematical distribution of the water masers, we confirm
          the  millimeter  source  CB  3-mm  as  the most likely powering
          source of the CB 3 masers. We propose the near-IR source CB 232
          YC1-I  as  the  best  candidate  for pumping the maser emission
          observed in CB 232, while in CB 54, we suggest that the pumping
          source  of  the  masers  could be located at the position of an
          elongated feature observed in near-infrared maps.

          We  present a review of some of the current major challenges in
          stellar  cluster  research,  including young clusters, globular
          clusters,  and  galactic  nuclei.  Topics  considered  include:
          primordial  mass  segregation and runaway mergers, expulsion of
          gas  from  clusters,  the production of stellar exotica seen in
          some    clusters    (eg    blue    stragglers    and    extreme
          horizontal--branch  stars), binary populations within clusters,
          the  black--hole  population within stellar clusters, the final
          parsec  problem,  stellar dynamics around a massive black hole,
          and stellar collisions. The Modest Questions posed here are the
          outcome  of  discussions  which  took  place  at  the Modest-6A
          workshop held in Lund, Sweden, in December, 2005. Modest-6A was

          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  argue  on  the  basis of astrometric and spectroscopic data
          that  the  ultramassive white dwarf GD50 is associated with the
          star  formation event that created the Pleiades and is possibly
          a  former  member of this cluster. Its cooling age (~60Myrs) is
          consistent  with it having evolved essentially as a single star
          from  a  progenitor  with  a mass M>6Msun so we find no need to
          invoke  a  white  dwarf-white  dwarf  binary merger scenario to
          account  for its existence. This result may represent the first
          direct  observational  evidence  that single star evolution can
          produce  white  dwarfs  with  M>1.1Msun,  as  predicted by some
          stellar  evolutionary  theories. On the basis of its tangential
          velocity   we  also  provisionally  identify  the  ultramassive
          (M~1.2Msun)  white  dwarf  PG0136+251  as  being related to the
          Pleiades. These findings may help to alleviate the difficulties
          in  reconciling  the observed number of hot nearby ultramassive
          white  dwarfs  with  the  smaller  number  predicted  by binary
          evolution  models  under  the  assumption  that  they  are  the
          products of white dwarf mergers.

          Astrophysics
          This   paper  describes  a  systematic  search  for  high-order
          multiplicity   among   wide   visual  Pre-Main  Sequence  (PMS)
          binaries. We conducted an Adaptive Optics survey of a sample of
          58  PMS  wide binaries from various star-forming regions, which
          include 52 T Tauri systems with mostly K- and M-type primaries,
          with the NIR instrument NACO at the VLT. Of these 52 systems, 7
          are found to be triple (2 new) and 7 quadruple (1 new). The new
          close  companions  are  most  likely  physically bound based on
          their  probability  of chance projection and, for some of them,
          on  their  position on a color-color diagram. The corresponding
          degree  of  multiplicity among wide binaries (number of triples
          and  quadruples  divided  by the number of systems) is 26.9 +/-
          7.2% in the projected separation range 0.07-12 arcsec, with the
          largest  contribution  from  the  Taurus-Auriga  cloud. We also
          found  that  this  degree  of  multiplicity  is twice in Taurus
          compared  to Ophiuchus and Chamaeleon for which the same number
          of  sources are present in our sample. Considering a restricted
          sample composed of systems at distance 140-190pc, the degree of
          multiplicity is 26.8 +/- 8.1%, in the separation range 10/14 AU
          -  1700/2300  AU  (30  binaries,  5 triples, 6 quadruples). The
          observed   frequency   agrees   with   results   from  previous
          multiplicity  surveys  within  the  uncertainties,  although  a
          significant  overabundance  of  quadruple  systems  compared to
          triple   systems   is   apparent.   Tentatively  including  the
          spectroscopic  pairs in our restricted sample and comparing the
          multiplicity   fractions   to  those  measured  for  solar-type
          main-sequence  stars  in  the  solar  neighborhood leads to the
          conclusion  that  both the ratio of triples to binaries and the
          ratio  of  quadruples  to  triples  seems to be in excess among
          young stars. [...]

          Title:  Proto-Neutron  Star  Winds  with  Magnetic  Fields  and
          Rotation
          Authors: Brian D. Metzger, Todd A. Thompson, Eliot Quataert
          Comments: 21 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  solve  the  1D  neutrino-heated  non-relativistic  MHD wind
          problem  for  conditions  that range from slowly rotating (spin
          period  P > 10 ms) protoneutron stars (PNSs) with surface field
          strengths   typical   of  radio  pulsars  (B  <  10^13  G),  to
          "proto-magnetars"  with B ~ 10^14-10^15 G in their hypothesized
          rapidly  rotating  initial  states  (P  ~  1  ms).  We  use the
          simulations  of  Bucciantini  et al. (2006) to map our monopole
          results  onto  a  more physical dipole geometry and to estimate
          the spindown of PNSs when their winds are relativistic. We then
          quantify  the  effects  of  rotation and magnetic fields on the
          mass  loss,  energy  loss, and r-process nucleosynthesis in PNS
          winds.  We  describe  the  evolution  of  PNS winds through the
          Kelvin-Helmholtz  cooling  epoch,  emphasizing  the  transition
          between   (1)  thermal  neutrino-driven,  (2)  non-relativistic
          magnetically-dominated,        and       (3)       relativistic
          magnetically-dominated  outflows.  We find that proto-magnetars
          with  P  ~  1  ms and B > 10^15 G drive relativistic winds with
          luminosities,  energies,  and  Lorentz  factors  (magnetization
          sigma  ~ 1-1000) consistent with those required to produce long
          duration gamma-ray bursts and hyper-energetic supernovae (SNe).
          A   significant  fraction  of  the  rotational  energy  may  be
          extracted  in only a few seconds, sufficiently rapidly to alter
          the  asymptotic  energy of the SN remnant, its morphology, and,
          potentially,  its  nucleosynthetic  yield. Winds from PNSs with
          more   modest   rotation   periods   (2   -  10  ms)  and  with
          magnetar-strength  fields produce conditions significantly more
          favorable  for  the  r-process  than winds from slowly rotating
          PNSs.  Lastly,  we  show that energy and momentum deposition by
          convectively-excited  waves  further increase the likelihood of
          successful r-process in PNS winds.

          Comments:  10  pages  (preprint format), 1 figure. Submitted to
          ApJ Letters
          We present maps and spectra of rotational CO line emission from
          a  cosmological  self-consistent  N-body/hydrodynamical TreeSPH
          simulation  of  a  z~3 merger system with properties similar to
          Lyman   Break   Galaxies   at  those  redshifts.  The  CO  line
          intensities  and widths predicted by our simulation are in good
          agreement  with  those  of  MS1512-cB58 -- the only Lyman break
          system  detected  in  CO to date. We find that while supernovae
          explosions  from  the  on-going  star formation carve out large
          cavities  in  the  molecular  ISM,  they  do not generate large
          enough  gas  outflows  to  make a substantial imprint on the CO
          line profile. This implies that for most proto-galaxies at high
          redshift  --  except possibly the most extreme cases -- stellar
          feedback  effects  do  not  jeopardize  CO  as a dynamical mass
          tracer.  Finally,  using  our  model  we  have simulated a mock
          observation  with ALMA, from which we confirm that ALMA will be
          able  to  detect CO in LBG-type galaxies at high-z on a routine
          basis, and distinguish between edge-on and face-on disk systems
          based on the shape of the CO line profile alone. In such cases,
          we  find  that  dynamical  masses  can be inferred to within 20
          per-cent  accuracy,  although  this  will  improve  for angular
          resolutions  better than 0.1", which we find is the upper limit
          at  which  LBGs  at  z~3 are robustly resolved in CO. This will
          signify  an  important  step  forward  in  our understanding of
          galaxy  formation  and  evolution,  since  LBGs  are the likely
          progenitors of the bulk population of galaxies seen today.

          Title:  Environmental  Dependence  of  Cold  Dark  Matter  Halo
          Formation
          Authors: H.Y. Wang, H.J. Mo, Y.P. Jing
          Comments: 18 pages, 21 figures, submitted to MNRas
          We  use  a high-resolution $N$-body simulation to study how the
          formation  of cold dark matter (CDM) halos is affected by their
          environments,  and  how  such environmental effects produce the
          age-dependence  of  halo clustering observed in recent $N$-body
          simulations.  We  estimate, for each halo selected at $z=0$, an
          `initial'  mass  $M_{\rm i}$ defined to be the mass enclosed by
          the largest sphere which contains the initial barycenter of the
          halo  particles  and  within  which  the mean linear density is
          equal  to  the critical value for spherical collapse. For halos
          of a given final mass, $M_{\rm h}$, the ratio $M_{\rm i}/M_{\rm
          h}$  has  large scatter, and the scatter is larger for halos of
          lower  final  masses.  Halos  that form earlier on average have
          larger $M_{\rm i}/M_{\rm h}$, and so correspond to higher peaks
          in the initial density field than their final masses imply. Old
          halos are more strongly clustered than younger ones of the same
          mass   because   their   initial   masses   are   larger.   The
          age-dependence of clustering for low-mass halos is entirely due
          to the difference in the initial/final mass ratio. Low-mass old
          halos  are  almost  always  located  in  the  vicinity  of  big
          structures, and their old ages are largely due to the fact that
          their  mass  accretions  are suppressed by the hot environments
          produced  by  the  tidal  fields  of  the larger structure. The
          age-dependence  of  clustering is weaker for more massive halos
          because  the  heating  by  large-scale  tidal  fields  is  less
          important.

          Comments: in press on ApJ
          MACHO-96-BLG-5  is  a  microlensing  event observed towards the
          bulge  of  the Galaxy with exceptionally long duration of $\sim
          970$  days.  The microlensing parallax fit parameters were used
          to  estimate the lens mass $M=6^{+10}_{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and its
          distance  $d$ which results to be in the range 0.5 kpc - 2 kpc.
          The  upper  limit  on the absolute brightness for main-sequence
          stars  of  the same mass is less than 1 $L_{\odot}$ so that the
          lens  is  a  good  black hole candidate. If it is so, the black
          hole  would  accrete by interstellar medium thereby emitting in
          the  $X$-ray  band.  Here,  the  analysis  of an {\it XMM} deep
          observation  towards  MACHO-96-BLG-5 lens position is reported.
          Only  an upper limit (at 99.8% confidence level) to the $X$-ray
          flux   from   the  lens  position  of  $9.10\times  10^{-15}$--
          $1.45\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the energy band
          $0.2-10$  keV  has  been  obtained  from  that deep observation
          allowing   to  constrain  the  putative  black  hole  accretion
          parameters.

          Neutrino-neutrino  interactions  can lead to collective flavour
          conversion  effects in supernovae and in the early universe. We
          demonstrate  that  the  case of "bipolar" oscillations, where a
          dense  gas  of  neutrinos  and  antineutrinos  in equal numbers
          completely  converts  from  one  flavour to another even if the
          mixing  angle  is small, is equivalent to a pendulum in flavour
          space.  Bipolar  flavour conversion corresponds to the swinging
          of  the  pendulum, which begins in an unstable upright position
          (the  initial  flavour),  and  passes  through  momentarily the
          vertically  downward position (the other flavour) in the course
          of  its  motion.  The  time  scale  to  complete  one  cycle of
          oscillation depends logarithmically on the vacuum mixing angle.
          Likewise,  the  presence  of  an  ordinary  medium can be shown
          analytically  to  contribute  to  a logarithmic increase in the
          bipolar  conversion period. We further find that a more complex
          (and  realistic)  system  of  unequal  numbers of neutrinos and
          antineutrinos  is  analogous  to  a  spinning  top subject to a
          torque.  This  analogy  easily  explains that such a system can
          oscillate  in  both  the  bipolar  or  the  synchronised  mode,
          depending   on  the  neutrino  density  and  the  size  of  the
          neutrino-antineutrino  asymmetry.  Our  simple model applies to
          isotropic  and  "single-angle"  systems,  as well as systems in
          which  the  matrix  of  neutrino-neutrino  couplings  possesses
          certain symmetries that prevent kinematical decoherence between
          the  individual neutrino modes. In more general cases, however,
          and  especially  in  the  case  of  neutrinos  emitted  from  a
          supernova  core, these symmetries are not necessarily manifest.
          As  a  result,  quick decoherence in flavour space, rather than
          collective  bipolar  oscillations,  for  both  the  normal  and
          inverted  mass hierarchies may in fact be the generic behaviour
          of dense neutrino gases.

          The  XMM-Newton  Extended  Survey  of the TMC (XEST) is a large
          program   designed  to  systematically  investigate  the  X-ray
          properties  of  young stellar/substellar objects in the TMC. In
          particular,  the  area  surveyed by 15 XMM-Newton pointings (of
          which  three  are archival observations), supplemented with one
          archival  Chandra observation, allows us to study 17 BDs with M
          spectral  types.  Half  of  this  sample  (9  out of 17 BDs) is
          detected; 7 BDs are detected here for the first time in X-rays.
          We  observed  a  flare from one BD. We confirm several previous
          findings on BD X-ray activity: a log-log relation between X-ray
          and  bolometric  luminosity for stars (with L*<10 Lsun) and BDs
          detected  in  X-rays;  a shallow log-log relation between X-ray
          fractional  luminosity  and  mass;  a  log-log relation between
          X-ray   fractional  luminosity  and  effective  temperature;  a
          log-log  relation  between  X-ray  surface  flux  and effective
          temperature. We find no significant log-log correlation between
          the  X-ray  fractional luminosity and EW(Halpha). Accreting and
          nonaccreting  BDs  have  a similar X-ray fractional luminosity.
          The  median  X-ray fractional luminosity of nonaccreting BDs is
          about  4 times lower than the mean saturation value for rapidly
          rotating  low-mass  field  stars. Our TMC BDs have higher X-ray
          fractional  luminosity  than BDs in the Chandra Orion Ultradeep
          Project. The X-ray fractional luminosity declines from low-mass
          stars  to  M-type  BDs,  and  as  a  sample,  the  BDs are less
          efficient  X-ray emitters than low-mass stars. We thus conclude
          that  while  the  BD  atmospheres observed here are mostly warm
          enough  to  sustain  coronal activity, a trend is seen that may
          indicate  its  gradual  decline due to the drop in photospheric
          ionization degree (abridged).

          Title:  Assessing  The  Starburst Contribution to the Gamma-Ray

          If  cosmic  ray  protons  interact with gas at roughly the mean
          density  of the interstellar medium in starburst galaxies, then
          pion  decay in starbursts is likely to contribute significantly
          to the diffuse extra-galactic background in both gamma-rays and
          high energy neutrinos. We describe the assumptions that lead to
          this   conclusion   and  clarify  the  difference  between  our
          estimates  and  those  of Stecker (2006). Detection of a single
          starburst  by  GLAST would confirm the significant contribution
          of  starburst  galaxies  to  the  extra-galactic  neutrino  and
          gamma-ray backgrounds.

          Title: The Cosmic Battery Revisited
          Authors:  Ioannis  Contopoulos  Demosthenes Kazanas Dimitris M.
          Christodoulou
          We  reinvestigate  the  generation and accumulation of magnetic
          flux   in   optically   thin   accretion  flows  around  active
          gravitating  objects.  The  source of the magnetic field is the
          azimuthal     electric     current    associated    with    the
          Poynting-Robertson  drag  on  the  electrons  of  the accreting
          plasma.  This current generates magnetic field loops which open
          up  because  of  the differential rotation of the flow. We show
          through  simple  numerical  simulations that what regulates the
          generation and accumulation of magnetic flux near the center is
          the value of the plasma conductivity. Although the conductivity
          is  usually considered to be effectively infinite for the fully
          ionized  plasmas  expected  near  the  inner  edge of accretion
          disks, the turbulence of those plasmas may actually render them
          much   less   conducting  due  to  the  presence  of  anomalous
          resistivity.  We  have  discovered  that  if the resistivity is
          sufficiently  high  throughout  the  turbulent disk while it is
          suppressed   interior   to   its  inner  edge,  an  interesting
          steady-state  process  is  established:  accretion  carries and
          accumulates magnetic flux of one polarity inside the inner edge
          of  the disk, whereas magnetic diffusion releases magnetic flux
          of  the opposite polarity to large distances. In this scenario,
          magnetic flux of one polarity grows and accumulates at a steady
          rate in the region inside the inner edge and up to the point of
          equipartition  when  it becomes dynamically important. We argue
          that    this   inward   growth   and   outward   expulsion   of
          oppositely-directed magnetic fields that we propose may account
          for  the  ~30  min  cyclic variability observed in the galactic
          microquasar GRS1915+105.

          Aims.  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  characterise the star
          formation  activity  in  the  poorly  studied  embedded cluster
          Serpens/G3-G6, located ~ 45' (3 pc) to the south of the Serpens
          Cloud  Core, and to determine the luminosity and mass functions
          of its population of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs).
          Methods.  Multi-wavelength broadband photometry was obtained to
          sample  the  near  and  mid-IR spectral energy distributions to
          separate   YSOs   from   field   stars  and  classify  the  YSO
          evolutionary  stage.  ISOCAM  mapping  in  the  two filters LW2
          (5-8.5 um) and LW3 (12-18 um) of a 19' x 16' field was combined
          with JHKs data from 2MASS, Ks data from Arnica/NOT, and L' data
          from  SIRCA/NOT. Continuum emission at 1.3 mm (IRAM) and 3.6 cm
          (VLA)   was  mapped  to  study  the  cloud  structure  and  the
          coldest/youngest  sources. Deep narrow band imaging at the 2.12
          um  S(1)  line of H2 from NOTCam/NOT was obtained to search for
          signs of bipolar outflows.
          Results. We have strong evidence for a stellar population of 31
          Class  II  sources, 5 flat-spectrum sources, 5 Class I sources,
          and  two  Class 0 sources. Our method does not sample the Class
          III  sources.  The  cloud  is composed of two main dense clumps
          aligned  along  a  ridge  over  ~  0.5  pc plus a starless core
          coinciding with absorption features seen in the ISOCAM maps. We
          find  two  S-shaped bipolar collimated flows embedded in the NE
          clump,  and  propose  the  two  driving sources to be a Class 0
          candidate  (MMS3) and a double Class I (MMS2). For the Class II
          population we find a best age of ~ 2 Myr and compatibility with
          recent  Initial Mass Functions (IMFs) by comparing the observed
          Class  II  luminosity  function (LF), which is complete to 0.08
          L_sun,  to  various  model  LFs  with  different star formation
          scenarios and input IMFs.

          Title:  Proto-Neutron  Star  Winds  with  Magnetic  Fields  and
          Rotation
          Authors: Brian D. Metzger, Todd A. Thompson, Eliot Quataert
          Comments: 21 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  solve  the  1D  neutrino-heated  non-relativistic  MHD wind
          problem  for  conditions  that range from slowly rotating (spin
          period  P > 10 ms) protoneutron stars (PNSs) with surface field
          strengths   typical   of  radio  pulsars  (B  <  10^13  G),  to
          "proto-magnetars"  with B ~ 10^14-10^15 G in their hypothesized
          rapidly  rotating  initial  states  (P  ~  1  ms).  We  use the
          simulations  of  Bucciantini  et al. (2006) to map our monopole
          results  onto  a  more physical dipole geometry and to estimate
          the spindown of PNSs when their winds are relativistic. We then
          quantify  the  effects  of  rotation and magnetic fields on the
          mass  loss,  energy  loss, and r-process nucleosynthesis in PNS
          winds.  We  describe  the  evolution  of  PNS winds through the
          Kelvin-Helmholtz  cooling  epoch,  emphasizing  the  transition
          between   (1)  thermal  neutrino-driven,  (2)  non-relativistic
          magnetically-dominated,        and       (3)       relativistic
          magnetically-dominated  outflows.  We find that proto-magnetars
          with  P  ~  1  ms and B > 10^15 G drive relativistic winds with
          luminosities,  energies,  and  Lorentz  factors  (magnetization
          sigma  ~ 1-1000) consistent with those required to produce long
          duration gamma-ray bursts and hyper-energetic supernovae (SNe).
          A   significant  fraction  of  the  rotational  energy  may  be
          extracted  in only a few seconds, sufficiently rapidly to alter
          the  asymptotic  energy of the SN remnant, its morphology, and,
          potentially,  its  nucleosynthetic  yield. Winds from PNSs with
          more   modest   rotation   periods   (2   -  10  ms)  and  with
          magnetar-strength  fields produce conditions significantly more
          favorable  for  the  r-process  than winds from slowly rotating
          PNSs.  Lastly,  we  show that energy and momentum deposition by
          convectively-excited  waves  further increase the likelihood of
          successful r-process in PNS winds.

          ApJ Letters
          We present maps and spectra of rotational CO line emission from
          a  cosmological  self-consistent  N-body/hydrodynamical TreeSPH
          simulation  of  a  z~3 merger system with properties similar to
          Lyman   Break   Galaxies   at  those  redshifts.  The  CO  line
          intensities  and widths predicted by our simulation are in good
          agreement  with  those  of  MS1512-cB58 -- the only Lyman break
          system  detected  in  CO to date. We find that while supernovae
          explosions  from  the  on-going  star formation carve out large
          cavities  in  the  molecular  ISM,  they  do not generate large
          enough  gas  outflows  to  make a substantial imprint on the CO
          line profile. This implies that for most proto-galaxies at high
          redshift  --  except possibly the most extreme cases -- stellar
          feedback  effects  do  not  jeopardize  CO  as a dynamical mass
          tracer.  Finally,  using  our  model  we  have simulated a mock
          observation  with ALMA, from which we confirm that ALMA will be
          able  to  detect CO in LBG-type galaxies at high-z on a routine
          basis, and distinguish between edge-on and face-on disk systems
          based on the shape of the CO line profile alone. In such cases,
          we  find  that  dynamical  masses  can be inferred to within 20
          per-cent  accuracy,  although  this  will  improve  for angular
          resolutions  better than 0.1", which we find is the upper limit
          at  which  LBGs  at  z~3 are robustly resolved in CO. This will
          signify  an  important  step  forward  in  our understanding of
          galaxy  formation  and  evolution,  since  LBGs  are the likely
          progenitors of the bulk population of galaxies seen today.

          Title:  Environmental  Dependence  of  Cold  Dark  Matter  Halo
          Formation
          Authors: H.Y. Wang, H.J. Mo, Y.P. Jing
          Comments: 18 pages, 21 figures, submitted to MNRas
          We  use  a high-resolution $N$-body simulation to study how the
          formation  of cold dark matter (CDM) halos is affected by their
          environments,  and  how  such environmental effects produce the
          age-dependence  of  halo clustering observed in recent $N$-body
          simulations.  We  estimate, for each halo selected at $z=0$, an
          `initial'  mass  $M_{\rm i}$ defined to be the mass enclosed by
          the largest sphere which contains the initial barycenter of the
          halo  particles  and  within  which  the mean linear density is
          equal  to  the critical value for spherical collapse. For halos
          of a given final mass, $M_{\rm h}$, the ratio $M_{\rm i}/M_{\rm
          h}$  has  large scatter, and the scatter is larger for halos of
          lower  final  masses.  Halos  that form earlier on average have
          larger $M_{\rm i}/M_{\rm h}$, and so correspond to higher peaks
          in the initial density field than their final masses imply. Old
          halos are more strongly clustered than younger ones of the same
          mass   because   their   initial   masses   are   larger.   The
          age-dependence of clustering for low-mass halos is entirely due
          to the difference in the initial/final mass ratio. Low-mass old
          halos  are  almost  always  located  in  the  vicinity  of  big
          structures, and their old ages are largely due to the fact that
          their  mass  accretions  are suppressed by the hot environments
          produced  by  the  tidal  fields  of  the larger structure. The
          age-dependence  of  clustering is weaker for more massive halos
          because  the  heating  by  large-scale  tidal  fields  is  less
          important.

          Title:  XMM  search  for  $X$-ray  emission from the black hole
          candidate MACHO-96-BLG-5

          Comments: in press on ApJ
          MACHO-96-BLG-5  is  a  microlensing  event observed towards the
          bulge  of  the Galaxy with exceptionally long duration of $\sim
          970$  days.  The microlensing parallax fit parameters were used
          to  estimate the lens mass $M=6^{+10}_{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and its
          distance  $d$ which results to be in the range 0.5 kpc - 2 kpc.
          The  upper  limit  on the absolute brightness for main-sequence
          stars  of  the same mass is less than 1 $L_{\odot}$ so that the
          lens  is  a  good  black hole candidate. If it is so, the black
          hole  would  accrete by interstellar medium thereby emitting in
          the  $X$-ray  band.  Here,  the  analysis  of an {\it XMM} deep
          observation  towards  MACHO-96-BLG-5 lens position is reported.
          Only  an upper limit (at 99.8% confidence level) to the $X$-ray
          flux   from   the  lens  position  of  $9.10\times  10^{-15}$--
          $1.45\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the energy band
          $0.2-10$  keV  has  been  obtained  from  that deep observation

          Title:   Self-induced   conversion  in  dense  neutrino  gases:
          Pendulum in flavour space
          Authors:  S.Hannestad (Univ. Aarhus), G.G.Raffelt (MPI Physics,
          Munich), G.Sigl (APC, Paris), Y.Y.Y.Wong (MPI Physics, Munich)

          Neutrino-neutrino  interactions  can lead to collective flavour
          conversion  effects in supernovae and in the early universe. We
          demonstrate  that  the  case of "bipolar" oscillations, where a
          dense  gas  of  neutrinos  and  antineutrinos  in equal numbers
          completely  converts  from  one  flavour to another even if the
          mixing  angle  is small, is equivalent to a pendulum in flavour
          space.  Bipolar  flavour conversion corresponds to the swinging
          of  the  pendulum, which begins in an unstable upright position
          (the  initial  flavour),  and  passes  through  momentarily the
          vertically  downward position (the other flavour) in the course
          of  its  motion.  The  time  scale  to  complete  one  cycle of
          oscillation depends logarithmically on the vacuum mixing angle.
          Likewise,  the  presence  of  an  ordinary  medium can be shown
          analytically  to  contribute  to  a logarithmic increase in the
          bipolar  conversion period. We further find that a more complex
          (and  realistic)  system  of  unequal  numbers of neutrinos and
          antineutrinos  is  analogous  to  a  spinning  top subject to a
          torque.  This  analogy  easily  explains that such a system can
          oscillate  in  both  the  bipolar  or  the  synchronised  mode,
          depending   on  the  neutrino  density  and  the  size  of  the
          neutrino-antineutrino  asymmetry.  Our  simple model applies to
          isotropic  and  "single-angle"  systems,  as well as systems in
          which  the  matrix  of  neutrino-neutrino  couplings  possesses
          certain symmetries that prevent kinematical decoherence between
          the  individual neutrino modes. In more general cases, however,
          and  especially  in  the  case  of  neutrinos  emitted  from  a
          supernova  core, these symmetries are not necessarily manifest.
          As  a  result,  quick decoherence in flavour space, rather than
          collective  bipolar  oscillations,  for  both  the  normal  and
          inverted  mass hierarchies may in fact be the generic behaviour
          of dense neutrino gases.

          The  XMM-Newton  Extended  Survey  of the TMC (XEST) is a large
          program   designed  to  systematically  investigate  the  X-ray
          properties  of  young stellar/substellar objects in the TMC. In
          particular,  the  area  surveyed by 15 XMM-Newton pointings (of
          which  three  are archival observations), supplemented with one
          archival  Chandra observation, allows us to study 17 BDs with M
          spectral  types.  Half  of  this  sample  (9  out of 17 BDs) is
          detected; 7 BDs are detected here for the first time in X-rays.
          We  observed  a  flare from one BD. We confirm several previous
          findings on BD X-ray activity: a log-log relation between X-ray
          and  bolometric  luminosity for stars (with L*<10 Lsun) and BDs
          detected  in  X-rays;  a shallow log-log relation between X-ray
          fractional  luminosity  and  mass;  a  log-log relation between
          X-ray   fractional  luminosity  and  effective  temperature;  a
          log-log  relation  between  X-ray  surface  flux  and effective
          temperature. We find no significant log-log correlation between
          the  X-ray  fractional luminosity and EW(Halpha). Accreting and
          nonaccreting  BDs  have  a similar X-ray fractional luminosity.
          The  median  X-ray fractional luminosity of nonaccreting BDs is
          about  4 times lower than the mean saturation value for rapidly
          rotating  low-mass  field  stars. Our TMC BDs have higher X-ray
          fractional  luminosity  than BDs in the Chandra Orion Ultradeep
          Project. The X-ray fractional luminosity declines from low-mass
          stars  to  M-type  BDs,  and  as  a  sample,  the  BDs are less
          efficient  X-ray emitters than low-mass stars. We thus conclude
          that  while  the  BD  atmospheres observed here are mostly warm
          enough  to  sustain  coronal activity, a trend is seen that may
          indicate  its  gradual  decline due to the drop in photospheric
          ionization degree (abridged).

          Title:  Assessing  The  Starburst Contribution to the Gamma-Ray

          If  cosmic  ray  protons  interact with gas at roughly the mean
          density  of the interstellar medium in starburst galaxies, then
          pion  decay in starbursts is likely to contribute significantly
          to the diffuse extra-galactic background in both gamma-rays and
          high energy neutrinos. We describe the assumptions that lead to
          this   conclusion   and  clarify  the  difference  between  our
          estimates  and  those  of Stecker (2006). Detection of a single
          starburst  by  GLAST would confirm the significant contribution
          of  starburst  galaxies  to  the  extra-galactic  neutrino  and
          gamma-ray backgrounds.

          Title: The Cosmic Battery Revisited
          Authors:  Ioannis  Contopoulos  Demosthenes Kazanas Dimitris M.
          Christodoulou
          We  reinvestigate  the  generation and accumulation of magnetic
          flux   in   optically   thin   accretion  flows  around  active
          gravitating  objects.  The  source of the magnetic field is the
          azimuthal     electric     current    associated    with    the
          Poynting-Robertson  drag  on  the  electrons  of  the accreting
          plasma.  This current generates magnetic field loops which open
          up  because  of  the differential rotation of the flow. We show
          through  simple  numerical  simulations that what regulates the
          generation and accumulation of magnetic flux near the center is
          the value of the plasma conductivity. Although the conductivity
          is  usually considered to be effectively infinite for the fully
          ionized  plasmas  expected  near  the  inner  edge of accretion
          disks, the turbulence of those plasmas may actually render them
          much   less   conducting  due  to  the  presence  of  anomalous
          resistivity.  We  have  discovered  that  if the resistivity is
          sufficiently  high  throughout  the  turbulent disk while it is
          suppressed   interior   to   its  inner  edge,  an  interesting
          steady-state  process  is  established:  accretion  carries and
          accumulates magnetic flux of one polarity inside the inner edge
          of  the disk, whereas magnetic diffusion releases magnetic flux
          of  the opposite polarity to large distances. In this scenario,
          magnetic flux of one polarity grows and accumulates at a steady
          rate in the region inside the inner edge and up to the point of
          equipartition  when  it becomes dynamically important. We argue
          that    this   inward   growth   and   outward   expulsion   of
          oppositely-directed magnetic fields that we propose may account
          for  the  ~30  min  cyclic variability observed in the galactic
          microquasar GRS1915+105.

          Aims.  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  characterise the star
          formation  activity  in  the  poorly  studied  embedded cluster
          Serpens/G3-G6, located ~ 45' (3 pc) to the south of the Serpens
          Cloud  Core, and to determine the luminosity and mass functions
          of its population of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs).
          Methods.  Multi-wavelength broadband photometry was obtained to
          sample  the  near  and  mid-IR spectral energy distributions to
          separate   YSOs   from   field   stars  and  classify  the  YSO
          evolutionary  stage.  ISOCAM  mapping  in  the  two filters LW2
          (5-8.5 um) and LW3 (12-18 um) of a 19' x 16' field was combined
          with JHKs data from 2MASS, Ks data from Arnica/NOT, and L' data
          from  SIRCA/NOT. Continuum emission at 1.3 mm (IRAM) and 3.6 cm
          (VLA)   was  mapped  to  study  the  cloud  structure  and  the
          coldest/youngest  sources. Deep narrow band imaging at the 2.12
          um  S(1)  line of H2 from NOTCam/NOT was obtained to search for
          signs of bipolar outflows.
          Results. We have strong evidence for a stellar population of 31
          Class  II  sources, 5 flat-spectrum sources, 5 Class I sources,
          and  two  Class 0 sources. Our method does not sample the Class
          III  sources.  The  cloud  is composed of two main dense clumps
          aligned  along  a  ridge  over  ~  0.5  pc plus a starless core
          coinciding with absorption features seen in the ISOCAM maps. We
          find  two  S-shaped bipolar collimated flows embedded in the NE
          clump,  and  propose  the  two  driving sources to be a Class 0
          candidate  (MMS3) and a double Class I (MMS2). For the Class II
          population we find a best age of ~ 2 Myr and compatibility with
          recent  Initial Mass Functions (IMFs) by comparing the observed
          Class  II  luminosity  function (LF), which is complete to 0.08
          L_sun,  to  various  model  LFs  with  different star formation
          scenarios and input IMFs.

          Rotation
          Authors: Brian D. Metzger, Todd A. Thompson, Eliot Quataert
          Comments: 21 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  solve  the  1D  neutrino-heated  non-relativistic  MHD wind
          problem  for  conditions  that range from slowly rotating (spin
          period  P > 10 ms) protoneutron stars (PNSs) with surface field
          strengths   typical   of  radio  pulsars  (B  <  10^13  G),  to
          "proto-magnetars"  with B ~ 10^14-10^15 G in their hypothesized
          rapidly  rotating  initial  states  (P  ~  1  ms).  We  use the
          simulations  of  Bucciantini  et al. (2006) to map our monopole
          results  onto  a  more physical dipole geometry and to estimate
          the spindown of PNSs when their winds are relativistic. We then
          quantify  the  effects  of  rotation and magnetic fields on the
          mass  loss,  energy  loss, and r-process nucleosynthesis in PNS
          winds.  We  describe  the  evolution  of  PNS winds through the
          Kelvin-Helmholtz  cooling  epoch,  emphasizing  the  transition
          between   (1)  thermal  neutrino-driven,  (2)  non-relativistic
          magnetically-dominated,        and       (3)       relativistic
          magnetically-dominated  outflows.  We find that proto-magnetars
          with  P  ~  1  ms and B > 10^15 G drive relativistic winds with
          luminosities,  energies,  and  Lorentz  factors  (magnetization
          sigma  ~ 1-1000) consistent with those required to produce long
          duration gamma-ray bursts and hyper-energetic supernovae (SNe).
          A   significant  fraction  of  the  rotational  energy  may  be
          extracted  in only a few seconds, sufficiently rapidly to alter
          the  asymptotic  energy of the SN remnant, its morphology, and,
          potentially,  its  nucleosynthetic  yield. Winds from PNSs with
          more   modest   rotation   periods   (2   -  10  ms)  and  with
          magnetar-strength  fields produce conditions significantly more
          favorable  for  the  r-process  than winds from slowly rotating
          PNSs.  Lastly,  we  show that energy and momentum deposition by
          convectively-excited  waves  further increase the likelihood of
          successful r-process in PNS winds.

          ApJ Letters
          We present maps and spectra of rotational CO line emission from
          a  cosmological  self-consistent  N-body/hydrodynamical TreeSPH
          simulation  of  a  z~3 merger system with properties similar to
          Lyman   Break   Galaxies   at  those  redshifts.  The  CO  line
          intensities  and widths predicted by our simulation are in good
          agreement  with  those  of  MS1512-cB58 -- the only Lyman break
          system  detected  in  CO to date. We find that while supernovae
          explosions  from  the  on-going  star formation carve out large
          cavities  in  the  molecular  ISM,  they  do not generate large
          enough  gas  outflows  to  make a substantial imprint on the CO
          line profile. This implies that for most proto-galaxies at high
          redshift  --  except possibly the most extreme cases -- stellar
          feedback  effects  do  not  jeopardize  CO  as a dynamical mass
          tracer.  Finally,  using  our  model  we  have simulated a mock
          observation  with ALMA, from which we confirm that ALMA will be
          able  to  detect CO in LBG-type galaxies at high-z on a routine
          basis, and distinguish between edge-on and face-on disk systems
          based on the shape of the CO line profile alone. In such cases,
          we  find  that  dynamical  masses  can be inferred to within 20
          per-cent  accuracy,  although  this  will  improve  for angular
          resolutions  better than 0.1", which we find is the upper limit
          at  which  LBGs  at  z~3 are robustly resolved in CO. This will
          signify  an  important  step  forward  in  our understanding of
          galaxy  formation  and  evolution,  since  LBGs  are the likely
          progenitors of the bulk population of galaxies seen today.

          Title:  Environmental  Dependence  of  Cold  Dark  Matter  Halo
          Formation
          Authors: H.Y. Wang, H.J. Mo, Y.P. Jing
          Comments: 18 pages, 21 figures, submitted to MNRas
          We  use  a high-resolution $N$-body simulation to study how the
          formation  of cold dark matter (CDM) halos is affected by their
          environments,  and  how  such environmental effects produce the
          age-dependence  of  halo clustering observed in recent $N$-body
          simulations.  We  estimate, for each halo selected at $z=0$, an
          `initial'  mass  $M_{\rm i}$ defined to be the mass enclosed by
          the largest sphere which contains the initial barycenter of the
          halo  particles  and  within  which  the mean linear density is
          equal  to  the critical value for spherical collapse. For halos
          of a given final mass, $M_{\rm h}$, the ratio $M_{\rm i}/M_{\rm
          h}$  has  large scatter, and the scatter is larger for halos of
          lower  final  masses.  Halos  that form earlier on average have
          larger $M_{\rm i}/M_{\rm h}$, and so correspond to higher peaks
          in the initial density field than their final masses imply. Old
          halos are more strongly clustered than younger ones of the same
          mass   because   their   initial   masses   are   larger.   The
          age-dependence of clustering for low-mass halos is entirely due
          to the difference in the initial/final mass ratio. Low-mass old
          halos  are  almost  always  located  in  the  vicinity  of  big
          structures, and their old ages are largely due to the fact that
          their  mass  accretions  are suppressed by the hot environments
          produced  by  the  tidal  fields  of  the larger structure. The
          age-dependence  of  clustering is weaker for more massive halos
          because  the  heating  by  large-scale  tidal  fields  is  less
          important.

          Comments: in press on ApJ
          MACHO-96-BLG-5  is  a  microlensing  event observed towards the
          bulge  of  the Galaxy with exceptionally long duration of $\sim
          970$  days.  The microlensing parallax fit parameters were used
          to  estimate the lens mass $M=6^{+10}_{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and its
          distance  $d$ which results to be in the range 0.5 kpc - 2 kpc.
          The  upper  limit  on the absolute brightness for main-sequence
          stars  of  the same mass is less than 1 $L_{\odot}$ so that the
          lens  is  a  good  black hole candidate. If it is so, the black
          hole  would  accrete by interstellar medium thereby emitting in
          the  $X$-ray  band.  Here,  the  analysis  of an {\it XMM} deep
          observation  towards  MACHO-96-BLG-5 lens position is reported.
          Only  an upper limit (at 99.8% confidence level) to the $X$-ray

          Title:   Self-induced   conversion  in  dense  neutrino  gases:
          Pendulum in flavour space
          Authors:  S.Hannestad (Univ. Aarhus), G.G.Raffelt (MPI Physics,
          Munich), G.Sigl (APC, Paris), Y.Y.Y.Wong (MPI Physics, Munich)
          Comments: 20 pages, 8 figures, revtex format
          Neutrino-neutrino  interactions  can lead to collective flavour
          conversion  effects in supernovae and in the early universe. We
          demonstrate  that  the  case of "bipolar" oscillations, where a
          dense  gas  of  neutrinos  and  antineutrinos  in equal numbers
          completely  converts  from  one  flavour to another even if the
          mixing  angle  is small, is equivalent to a pendulum in flavour
          space.  Bipolar  flavour conversion corresponds to the swinging
          of  the  pendulum, which begins in an unstable upright position
          (the  initial  flavour),  and  passes  through  momentarily the
          vertically  downward position (the other flavour) in the course
          of  its  motion.  The  time  scale  to  complete  one  cycle of
          oscillation depends logarithmically on the vacuum mixing angle.
          Likewise,  the  presence  of  an  ordinary  medium can be shown
          analytically  to  contribute  to  a logarithmic increase in the
          bipolar  conversion period. We further find that a more complex
          (and  realistic)  system  of  unequal  numbers of neutrinos and
          antineutrinos  is  analogous  to  a  spinning  top subject to a
          torque.  This  analogy  easily  explains that such a system can
          oscillate  in  both  the  bipolar  or  the  synchronised  mode,
          depending   on  the  neutrino  density  and  the  size  of  the
          neutrino-antineutrino  asymmetry.  Our  simple model applies to
          isotropic  and  "single-angle"  systems,  as well as systems in
          which  the  matrix  of  neutrino-neutrino  couplings  possesses
          certain symmetries that prevent kinematical decoherence between
          the  individual neutrino modes. In more general cases, however,
          and  especially  in  the  case  of  neutrinos  emitted  from  a
          supernova  core, these symmetries are not necessarily manifest.
          As  a  result,  quick decoherence in flavour space, rather than
          collective  bipolar  oscillations,  for  both  the  normal  and
          inverted  mass hierarchies may in fact be the generic behaviour
          of dense neutrino gases.

          The  XMM-Newton  Extended  Survey  of the TMC (XEST) is a large
          program   designed  to  systematically  investigate  the  X-ray
          properties  of  young stellar/substellar objects in the TMC. In
          particular,  the  area  surveyed by 15 XMM-Newton pointings (of
          which  three  are archival observations), supplemented with one
          archival  Chandra observation, allows us to study 17 BDs with M
          spectral  types.  Half  of  this  sample  (9  out of 17 BDs) is
          detected; 7 BDs are detected here for the first time in X-rays.
          We  observed  a  flare from one BD. We confirm several previous
          findings on BD X-ray activity: a log-log relation between X-ray
          and  bolometric  luminosity for stars (with L*<10 Lsun) and BDs
          detected  in  X-rays;  a shallow log-log relation between X-ray
          fractional  luminosity  and  mass;  a  log-log relation between
          X-ray   fractional  luminosity  and  effective  temperature;  a
          log-log  relation  between  X-ray  surface  flux  and effective
          temperature. We find no significant log-log correlation between
          the  X-ray  fractional luminosity and EW(Halpha). Accreting and
          nonaccreting  BDs  have  a similar X-ray fractional luminosity.
          The  median  X-ray fractional luminosity of nonaccreting BDs is
          about  4 times lower than the mean saturation value for rapidly
          rotating  low-mass  field  stars. Our TMC BDs have higher X-ray
          fractional  luminosity  than BDs in the Chandra Orion Ultradeep
          Project. The X-ray fractional luminosity declines from low-mass
          stars  to  M-type  BDs,  and  as  a  sample,  the  BDs are less
          efficient  X-ray emitters than low-mass stars. We thus conclude
          that  while  the  BD  atmospheres observed here are mostly warm
          enough  to  sustain  coronal activity, a trend is seen that may
          indicate  its  gradual  decline due to the drop in photospheric
          ionization degree (abridged).

          If  cosmic  ray  protons  interact with gas at roughly the mean
          density  of the interstellar medium in starburst galaxies, then
          pion  decay in starbursts is likely to contribute significantly
          to the diffuse extra-galactic background in both gamma-rays and
          high energy neutrinos. We describe the assumptions that lead to
          this   conclusion   and  clarify  the  difference  between  our
          estimates  and  those  of Stecker (2006). Detection of a single
          starburst  by  GLAST would confirm the significant contribution
          of  starburst  galaxies  to  the  extra-galactic  neutrino  and
          gamma-ray backgrounds.

          Title: The Cosmic Battery Revisited
          Authors:  Ioannis  Contopoulos  Demosthenes Kazanas Dimitris M.
          Christodoulou
          We  reinvestigate  the  generation and accumulation of magnetic
          flux   in   optically   thin   accretion  flows  around  active
          gravitating  objects.  The  source of the magnetic field is the
          azimuthal     electric     current    associated    with    the
          Poynting-Robertson  drag  on  the  electrons  of  the accreting
          plasma.  This current generates magnetic field loops which open
          up  because  of  the differential rotation of the flow. We show
          through  simple  numerical  simulations that what regulates the
          generation and accumulation of magnetic flux near the center is
          the value of the plasma conductivity. Although the conductivity
          is  usually considered to be effectively infinite for the fully
          ionized  plasmas  expected  near  the  inner  edge of accretion
          disks, the turbulence of those plasmas may actually render them
          much   less   conducting  due  to  the  presence  of  anomalous
          resistivity.  We  have  discovered  that  if the resistivity is
          sufficiently  high  throughout  the  turbulent disk while it is
          suppressed   interior   to   its  inner  edge,  an  interesting
          steady-state  process  is  established:  accretion  carries and
          accumulates magnetic flux of one polarity inside the inner edge
          of  the disk, whereas magnetic diffusion releases magnetic flux
          of  the opposite polarity to large distances. In this scenario,
          magnetic flux of one polarity grows and accumulates at a steady
          rate in the region inside the inner edge and up to the point of
          equipartition  when  it becomes dynamically important. We argue
          that    this   inward   growth   and   outward   expulsion   of
          oppositely-directed magnetic fields that we propose may account
          for  the  ~30  min  cyclic variability observed in the galactic
          microquasar GRS1915+105.

          Aims.  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  characterise the star
          formation  activity  in  the  poorly  studied  embedded cluster
          Serpens/G3-G6, located ~ 45' (3 pc) to the south of the Serpens
          Cloud  Core, and to determine the luminosity and mass functions
          of its population of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs).
          Methods.  Multi-wavelength broadband photometry was obtained to
          sample  the  near  and  mid-IR spectral energy distributions to
          separate   YSOs   from   field   stars  and  classify  the  YSO
          evolutionary  stage.  ISOCAM  mapping  in  the  two filters LW2
          (5-8.5 um) and LW3 (12-18 um) of a 19' x 16' field was combined
          with JHKs data from 2MASS, Ks data from Arnica/NOT, and L' data
          from  SIRCA/NOT. Continuum emission at 1.3 mm (IRAM) and 3.6 cm
          (VLA)   was  mapped  to  study  the  cloud  structure  and  the
          coldest/youngest  sources. Deep narrow band imaging at the 2.12
          um  S(1)  line of H2 from NOTCam/NOT was obtained to search for
          signs of bipolar outflows.
          Results. We have strong evidence for a stellar population of 31
          Class  II  sources, 5 flat-spectrum sources, 5 Class I sources,
          and  two  Class 0 sources. Our method does not sample the Class
          III  sources.  The  cloud  is composed of two main dense clumps
          aligned  along  a  ridge  over  ~  0.5  pc plus a starless core
          coinciding with absorption features seen in the ISOCAM maps. We
          find  two  S-shaped bipolar collimated flows embedded in the NE
          clump,  and  propose  the  two  driving sources to be a Class 0
          candidate  (MMS3) and a double Class I (MMS2). For the Class II
          population we find a best age of ~ 2 Myr and compatibility with
          recent  Initial Mass Functions (IMFs) by comparing the observed
          Class  II  luminosity  function (LF), which is complete to 0.08
          L_sun,  to  various  model  LFs  with  different star formation
          scenarios and input IMFs.

          Comments: 23 pages, 6 figures, accepted for ApJ
          Existing  determinations  show  that  n(C)/n(Fe) is more than a
          factor  of  10  below  solar  in the atmospheres of three white
          dwarfs that appear to be externally-polluted. These results are
          not  easily  explained  if the stars have accreted interstellar
          matter, and we re-interpret these measurements as evidence that
          these   stars   have   accreted   asteroids  of  a  chrondritic
          composition.

          with Stellar-Mass Black Holes in the Galactic Centre
          Authors: Ryan M. O'Leary, Abraham Loeb (Harvard University)
          Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          Stars  within  0.1  pc of the supermassive black hole Sgr A* at
          the  Galactic  centre  are  expected  to encounter a cluster of
          stellar-mass  black  holes  (BHs)  that have segregated to that
          region. Some of these stars will scatter off an orbiting BH and
          be  kicked  out  of  the  Galactic centre with velocities up to
          \~2000  km/s.  We  calculate  the  resulting  ejection  rate of
          hypervelocity  stars  (HVSs) by this process under a variety of
          assumptions,  and  find  it  to  be  comparable  to  the  tidal
          disruption  rate  of binary stars by Sgr A*, first discussed by
          Hills  (1998).  Under  some  conditions,  this novel process is
          sufficient  to  account for all the B-type HVSs observed in the
          halo,  and  to  dominate  the  production rate of all HVSs with
          lifetimes  much  less  than  the  relaxation  time-scale  at  a
          distance  ~2  pc from Sgr A* (>~2 Gyr). Since HVSs are produced
          by  at  least two unavoidable processes, the statistics of HVSs
          could  reveal  bimodal velocity and mass distributions, and can
          constrain  the  distribution  of BHs and stars in the innermost
          0.1 pc around Sgr A*.

          Title:  Magnetar-Driven Magnetic Tower as a Model for Gamma-Ray
          Bursts and Asymmetric Supernovae
          Authors:  Dmitri  A.  Uzdensky (Princeton University and CMSO),
          Andrew I. MacFadyen (IAS)
          Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures; submitted to ApJ
          We  consider a newly-born millisecond magnetar, focusing on its
          interaction  with  the  dense  stellar  plasma  in  which it is
          initially  embedded.  We  argue that the confining pressure and
          inertia  of  the  surrounding  plasma  acts  to  collimate  the
          magnetar's  Poynting-flux-dominated outflow into tightly beamed
          jets  and  increases  its  magnetic luminosity. We propose this
          process  as  an  essential ingredient in the magnetar model for
          gamma-ray  burst  and  asymmetric supernova central engines. We
          introduce  the  ``pulsar-in-a-cavity''  as  an  important model
          problem  representing a magnetized rotating neutron star inside
          a  collapsing  star.  We  describe its essential properties and
          derive simple estimates for the evolution of the magnetic field
          and  the  resulting spin-down power. We find that the infalling
          stellar  mantle  confines the magnetosphere, enabling a gradual
          build-up  of  the  toroidal  magnetic  field  due to continuous
          twisting.  The  growing  magnetic  pressure  eventually becomes
          dominant,  resulting  in  a  magnetically-driven explosion. The
          initial  phase of the explosion is quasi-isotropic, potentially
          exposing a sufficient amount of material to $^{56}$Ni-producing
          temperatures  to  result  in  a  bright  supernova. However, if
          significant   expansion   of  the  star  occurs  prior  to  the
          explosion,  then  very  little  $^{56}$Ni  is  produced  and no
          supernova is expected. In either case, hoop stress subsequently
          collimates  the  magnetically-dominated outflow, leading to the
          formation  of  a  magnetic  tower. After the star explodes, the
          decrease  in  bounding  pressure causes the magnetic outflow to
          become  less  beamed.  However,  episodes  of late fallback can
          reform  the  beamed  outflow, which may be responsible for late
          X-ray flares.

          Notices
          Published  maps  of  red  giant stars in the halo region of M31
          exhibit  a giant stellar stream to the south of this galaxy, as
          well as a giant "shelf" to the northeast of M31's center. Using
          these maps, we find that there is a fainter shelf of comparable
          size  on  the  western  side  as  well. By choosing appropriate
          structural  and  orbital  parameters  for  an  accreting  dwarf
          satellite  within the accurate M31 potential model of Geehan et
          al.  (2006),  we  produce a very similar structure in an N-body
          simulation.  In  this  scenario,  the  tidal stream produced at
          pericenter  of  the  satellite's  orbit  matches  the  observed
          southern  stream,  while the forward continuation of this tidal
          stream  makes  up  two  orbital  loops, broadened into fan-like
          structures  by  successive  pericentric  passages;  these loops
          correspond  to  the NE and W shelves. The tidal debris from the
          satellite  also  reproduces  a  previously-observed "stream" of
          counterrotating  PNe  and  a  related  stream seen in red giant
          stars. The debris pattern in our simulation resembles the shell
          systems  detected  around many elliptical galaxies, though this
          is  the  first  identification  of  a  shell system in a spiral
          galaxy  and  the  first  in  any  galaxy  close enough to allow
          measurements  of  stellar velocities and relative distances. We
          discuss  the  physics of these partial shells, highlighting the
          role   played   by   spatial   and  velocity  caustics  in  the
          observations.  We  show  that  kinematic  surveys  of the tidal
          debris  will  provide  a  sensitive  measurement  of M31's halo
          potential,  while  quantifying the surface density of debris in
          the  shelves will let us reconstruct the original mass and time
          of disruption of the progenitor satellite.

          our  survey  is sensitive to the binaries with separation < 0.1
          au.  We  found  that 4 out of 17 objects (or 24^{+16}_{-13} per
          cent  by  fraction)  show a significant RV change in 4-33d time
          scale,  and  are considered as binary/multiple `candidates.' We
          found  no  double-lined  spectroscopic  binaries in our sample,
          based   on  the  shape  of  cross-correlation  curves.  The  RV
          dispersion of the objects in UScoOB is found to be very similar
          to  that  of  the  BD and VLM stars in Chamaeleon I (Cha I). We
          also  found  the distribution of the mean rotational velocities
          (v  sin  i) of the UScoOB objects is similar to that of the Cha
          I,  but  the  dispersion of v sin i is much larger than that of
          the Cha I objects.

          Recent  observations  of the binary system LS5039 with the High
          Energy  Stereoscopic  System  (H.E.S.S.) revealed that its Very
          High  Energy  (VHE)  gamma-ray emission is modulated at the 3.9
          days  orbital period of the system. The bulk of the emission is
          largely  confined  to  half  of  the  orbit, peaking around the
          inferior  conjunction  epoch  of  the  compact object. The flux
          modulation   provides   the   first   indication  of  gamma-ray
          absorption  by  pair  production  on the intense stellar photon
          field. This implies that the production region size must be not
          significantly greater than the gamma-gamma photosphere size (~1
          AU), thus excluding the large scale collimated outflows or jets
          (extending  out  to  ~1000  AU). A hardening of the spectrum is
          also observed at the same epoch between 0.2 and a few TeV which
          is unexpected under a pure absorption scenario and could rather
          arise  from variation with phase in the maximum electron energy
          and/or  the  dominant  VHE gamma-ray production mechanism. This
          first-time  observation  of modulated gamma-ray emission allows
          precise tests of the acceleration and emission models in binary
          systems.

          Title: Unstable modes of non-axisymmetric gaseous discs
          Authors: Naser M. Asghari, Mir Abbas Jalali
          Comments:  12  pages,  6  figures,  Accepted for publication in
          Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
          We present a perturbation theory for studying the instabilities
          of  non-axisymmetric  gaseous  discs.  We perturb the dynamical
          equations  of  self-gravitating  fluids  in  the  vicinity of a
          non-axisymmetric equilibrium, and expand the perturbed physical
          quantities  in  terms  of  a  complete  basis  set  and a small
          non-axisymmetry  parameter  $\epsilon$. We then derive a linear
          eigenvalue  problem  in  matrix form, and determine the pattern
          speed,  growth rate and mode shapes of the first three unstable
          modes.  In non-axisymmetric discs the amplitude and phase angle
          of  travelling  waves  are functions of both the radius $R$ and
          the  azimuthal  angle $\phi$. This is due to the interaction of
          different   wave   components  in  the  response  spectrum.  We
          demonstrate  that wave interaction in unstable discs with small
          initial  asymmetries, can develop dense clumps during the phase
          of  exponential  growth. Local clumps, which occur on the major
          spiral  arms,  can  constitute  seeds  of  gas giant planets in
          accretion discs.

          We report the discovery of companions to 5 nearby late M dwarfs
          (>M5),  LHS1901,  LHS4009,  LHS6167, LP869-26 and WT460, and we
          confirm   that   the  recently  discovered  mid-T  brown  dwarf
          companion  to  SCR1845-6357  is  physically bound to that star.
          These discoveries result from our adaptive optics survey of all
          M  dwarfs  within 12 pc. The new companions have spectral types
          M5 to L1, and orbital separations between 1 and 10 AU. They add
          significantly  to  the  number of late M dwarfs binaries in the
          immediate   solar   neighbourhood,   and   will   improve   the
          multiplicity  statistics of late M dwarfs. The expected periods
          range  from  3  to  130  years.  Several  pairs  thus have good
          potential  for  accurate  mass  determination  in  this  poorly
          sampled mass range.

          We  review in these notes the status of the construction of the
          Pierre Auger Observatory and present the first Physics results,
          based on the data collected during the first year and a half of
          operation.  These  results  are  preliminary,  once the work to
          understand the systematics of the detectors are still underway.
          We  discuss  the  cosmic ray spectrum above 3 EeV, based on the
          measurement   done   using   the   Surface   Detector  and  the
          Fluorescence  Detector, both, components of the observatory. We
          discuss,  as  well, the search for anisotropy near the Galactic
          Center  and  the  limit  on  the photon fraction at the highest
          energies.

          Title:  The evolution of binary star clusters and the nature of
          NGC2136/NGC2137
          Authors: Simon Portegies Zwart (UVA), Stephanie Rusli (Leiden)
          Comments: submitted to MNRAS
          We study the evolution of bound pairs of star clusters by means
          of direct N-body simulations. Our simulations include mass loss
          by  stellar  evolution.  The initial conditions are selected to
          mimic the observed binary star cluster NGC 2136 and NGC 2137 in
          the Large Magellanic Cloud. Based on the rather old ages ($\sim
          100$  Myr),  masses,  sizes  of  the  two  clusters  and  their
          projected  separation,  we  conclude that the cluster pair must
          have  been  born  with  an  initial  separation  of  15--20 pc.
          Clusters  with  a  smaller  initial separation tend to merge in
          $\aplt  60$  Myr  due to loss of angular momentum from escaping
          stars. Clusters with a larger initial separation tend to become
          even  more  widely separated due to mass loss from the evolving
          stellar  populations.  The  early orbital evolution of a binary
          cluster  is  governed  by  mass  loss from the evolving stellar
          population and by loss of angular momentum from escaping stars.
          Mass  loss  by  stellar  winds and supernovae explosions in the
          first  $\sim  30$ Myr causes the binary to expand and the orbit
          to become eccentric. The initially less massive cluster expands
          more  quickly  than  the  binary  separation  increases, and is
          therefore  bound  to initiate mass transfer to the more massive
          cluster.  This process is quite contrary to stellar binaries in
          which  the  more  massive star tends to initiate mass transfer.
          Since  mass  transfer  proceeds on a thermal timescale from the
          less  massive  to  the more massive cluster, this semi-detached
          phase  is  quite  stable,  even in an eccentric orbit until the
          orbital  separation  reaches  the  gyration  radius  of the two
          clusters, at which point both clusters merge to one.

          We  examine the correlation between globular cluster (GC) color
          and  magnitude  using  HST/ACS  imaging  for  a  sample  of  79
          early-type  galaxies  (-21.7<M_B<-15.2  mag)  with accurate SBF
          distances  from  the  ACS  Virgo  Cluster Survey. Using the KMM
          mixture  modeling  algorithm,  we  find  a  highly  significant
          correlation,  d(g-z)/dz  =  -0.037  +- 0.004, between color and
          magnitude  for the subpopulation of blue GCs in the co-added GC
          color-magnitude  diagram  of the three brightest Virgo galaxies
          (M49,  M87 and M60): brighter GCs are redder than their fainter
          counterparts. For the single GC systems of M87 and M60, we find
          similar correlations; M49 does not appear to show a significant
          trend. There is no correlation between (g-z) and M_z for GCs of
          the  red  subpopulation. The correlation d(g-z)/dg for the blue
          subpopulation  is much weaker than d(g-z)/dz. Using Monte Carlo
          simulations,  we  attribute  this  to  the  fact  that the blue
          subpopulation  in  M_g  extends to higher luminosities than the
          red  subpopulation,  which biases the KMM fits. The correlation
          between color and M_z thus is a real effect. This conclusion is
          supported  by biweight fits to the same color distributions. We
          identify  two environmental dependencies of the color-magnitude
          relation:   (1)   the  slope  decreases  in  significance  with
          decreasing galaxy luminosity; and (2) the slope is stronger for
          GCs  at  smaller  galactocentric  distances. We examine several
          mechanisms that might give rise to the observed color-magnitude
          relation:  (1)  presence of contaminators; (2) accretion of GCs
          from  low-mass galaxies; (3) stochastic effects; (4) capture of
          field  stars  by individual GCs; and (5) GC self-enrichment. We
          conclude  that  self-enrichment  and  field-star  capture, or a
          combination  of these processes, offer the most promising means
          of explaining our observations.

          Title:  RASS-SDSS  Galaxy Cluster Survey. VI. The dependence of
          the cluster SFR on the cluster global properties
          Authors: P. Popesso, A. Biviano, M. Romaniello, H. Bhringer
          Comments: 14 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication on A&A
          Using  a  subsample  of  79  nearby clusters from the RASS-SDSS
          galaxy  cluster catalogue of Popesso et al. (2005a), we perform
          a  regression  analysis  between  the  cluster  integrated star
          formation  rate  (Sigma_SFR)  the  cluster  total  stellar mass
          (M_star),  the  fractions of star forming (f_SF) and blue (f_b)
          galaxies  and  other  cluster  global  properties,  namely  its
          richness  (N_gal,  i.e.  the  total  number  of cluster members
          within   the   cluster   virial  radius),  velocity  dispersion
          (sigma_v), virial mass (M_200), and X-ray luminosity (L_X). All
          cluster  global quantities are corrected for projection effects
          before  the  analysis. Galaxy SFRs and stellar masses are taken
          from the catalog of Brinchmann et al. (2004), which is based on
          SDSS  spectra.  We only consider galaxies with M_r <= -20.25 in
          our analysis, and exclude AGNs. We find that both Sigma_SFR and
          M_star are correlated with all the cluster global quantities. A
          partial correlation analysis show that all the correlations are
          induced  by  the  fundamental  one between Sigma_SFR and N_gal,
          hence  there  is no evidence that the cluster properties affect
          the  mean  SFR  or  M_star  per  galaxy.  The relations between
          Sigma_SFR and M_star, on one side, and both N_gal and M_200, on
          the  other  side,  are  linear,  i.e.  we  see no evidence that
          different  clusters  have different SFR or different M_star per
          galaxy  and per unit mass. The fraction f_SF does not depend on
          any  cluster property considered, while f_b does depend on L_X.
          We  note  that  a  significant fraction of star-forming cluster
          galaxies are red (~25% of the whole cluster galaxy population).
          We  conclude  that  the global cluster properties are unable to
          affect  the SF properties of cluster galaxies, but the presence
          of  the  X-ray  luminous  intra-cluster medium can affect their
          colors, perhaps through the ram-pressure stripping mechanism.

          MNRAS
          HII  regions  surrounding  supermassive black holes (BHs) in an
          otherwise  still  neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) are likely
          to  be  the  most  easily  detectable  sources  by  future 21cm
          experiments  like  LOFAR. We have made predictions for the size
          distribution   of  such  HII  regions  for  several  physically
          motivated  models  for  BH growth at high redshift and compared
          this  to  the  expected LOFAR sensitivity to these sources. The
          number  of  potentially  detectable  HII  regions does not only
          depend  on the ionisation state of the intergalactic medium and
          the  decoupling of the spin temperature of the neutral hydrogen
          from  the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature, but is
          also  strongly  sensitive  to the rate of growth of BHs at high
          redshift.  If  the supermassive BHs at redshift 6 were built up
          via  continuous  Eddington-limited accretion from low mass seed
          BHs  at  high  redshift,  then  LOFAR is not expected to detect
          isolated  QSO  HII regions at redshifts much larger than 6, and
          only  if  the  IGM  is  still  significantly  neutral.  If  the
          high-redshift growth of BHs starts with massive seed BHs and is
          driven by short-lived accretion events following the merging of
          BH   hosting   galaxies  then  the  detection  of  HII  regions
          surrounding  supermassive  BHs may extend to redshifts as large
          as 8-9 but is still very sensitive to the redshift to which the
          IGM   remains   significantly   neutral.  The  most  optimistic
          predictions  are  for a model where the supermassive BHs at z>6
          have grown slowly. HII regions around supermassive BHs may then
          be detected to significantly larger redshifts.

          The   winds  of  stars  with  very  specific  temperatures  and
          luminosities are ideal for determining the magnitude and nature
          of  mass  loss  in OB stars. I identify these stars and analyze
          their  wind lines. The results are discussed within the context
          of  recent findings which appear to indicate that the mass-loss
          rates  of  OB  stars  may as much as an order of magnitude less
          than commonly accepted values.

          Title:  String-inspired  cosmology:  Late  time transition from
          scaling  matter  era  to  dark  energy  universe  caused  by  a
          Gauss-Bonnet coupling
          Authors: Shinji Tsujikawa, M. Sami
          Comments: 17 pages, 3 figures
          The  Gauss-Bonnet  (GB) curvature invariant coupled to a scalar
          field   $\phi$   can   lead   to   an   exit   from  a  scaling
          matter-dominated  epoch  to  a late-time accelerated expansion,
          which is attractive to alleviate the coincident problem of dark
          energy.   We   derive   the  condition  for  the  existence  of
          cosmological  scaling  solutions  in  the  presence  of  the GB
          coupling for a general scalar-field Lagrangian density $p(\phi,
          X)$, where $X=-(1/2)(\nabla \phi)^2$ is a kinematic term of the
          scalar  field.  The  GB coupling and the Lagrangian density are
          restricted to be in the form $f(\phi) \propto e^{\lambda \phi}$
          and  $p=Xg  (Xe^{\lambda \phi})$, respectively, where $\lambda$
          is  a constant and $g$ is an arbitrary function. We also derive
          fixed  points  for such a scaling Lagrangian with a GB coupling
          $f(\phi) \propto e^{\mu \phi}$ and clarify the conditions under
          which  the  scaling  matter  era  is  followed  by  a de-Sitter
          solution  which  can appear in the presence of the GB coupling.
          Among  scaling  models  proposed  in the current literature, we
          find  that the models which allow such a cosmological evolution
          are  an ordinary scalar field with an exponential potential and
          a  tachyon field with an inverse square potential, although the
          latter requires a coupling between dark energy and dark matter.
