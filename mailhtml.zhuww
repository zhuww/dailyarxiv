We present a weak-lensing analysis of the merging {\em Frontier Fields} (FF)<br>
cluster Abell~2744 using new Subaru/Suprime-Cam imaging. The wide-field lensing<br>
mass distribution reveals this cluster is comprised of four distinct<br>
substructures. Simultaneously modeling the two-dimensional reduced shear field<br>
using a combination of a Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) model for the main core<br>
and truncated NFW models for the subhalos, we determine their masses and<br>
locations. The total mass of the system is constrained as $M_\mathrm{200c} =<br>
(2.06\pm0.42)\times10^{15}\,M_\odot$. The most massive clump is the southern<br>
component with $M_\mathrm{200c} = (7.7\pm3.4)\times10^{14}\,M_\odot$, followed<br>
by the western substructure ($M_\mathrm{200c} =<br>
(4.5\pm2.0)\times10^{14}\,M_\odot$) and two smaller substructures to the<br>
northeast ($M_\mathrm{200c} = (2.8\pm1.6)\times10^{14}\,M_\odot$) and northwest<br>
($M_\mathrm{200c} = (1.9\pm1.2)\times10^{14}\,M_\odot$). The presence of the<br>
four substructures supports the picture of multiple mergers. Using a composite<br>
of hydrodynamical binary simulations we explain this complicated system without<br>
the need for a "slingshot" effect to produce the northwest X-ray interloper, as<br>
previously proposed. The locations of the substructures appear to be offset<br>
from both the gas ($87^{+34}_{-28}$ arcsec, 90\% CL) and the galaxies<br>
($72^{+34}_{-53}$ arcsec, 90\% CL) in the case of the northwestern and western<br>
subhalos. To confirm or refute these findings, high resolution space-based<br>
observations extending beyond the current FF limited coverage to the west and<br>
northwestern area are essential.<br>

In quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries (qLMXBs) containing neutron stars, the<br>
origin of the thermal X-ray component may be either release of heat from the<br>
core of the neutron star, or continuing low-level accretion. In general, heat<br>
from the core should be stable on timescales $<10^4$ years, while continuing<br>
accretion may produce variations on a range of timescales. While some quiescent<br>
neutron stars (e.g. Cen X-4, Aql X-1) have shown variations in their thermal<br>
components on a range of timescales, several others, particularly those in<br>
globular clusters with no detectable nonthermal hard X-rays (fit with a<br>
powerlaw), have shown no measurable variations. Here, we constrain the spectral<br>
variations of 12 low mass X-ray binaries in 3 globular clusters over $\sim10$<br>
years. We find no evidence of variations in 10 cases, with limits on<br>
temperature variations below 11% for the 7 qLMXBs without powerlaw components,<br>
and limits on variations below 20% for 3 other qLMXBs that do show non-thermal<br>
emission. However, in 2 qLMXBs showing powerlaw components in their spectra<br>
(NGC 6440 CX 1 & Terzan 5 CX 12) we find marginal evidence for a 10% decline in<br>
temperature, suggesting the presence of continuing low-level accretion. This<br>
work adds to the evidence that the thermal X-ray component in quiescent neutron<br>
stars without powerlaw components can be explained by heat deposited in the<br>
core during outbursts. Finally, we also investigate the correlation between<br>
hydrogen column density (N$_H$) and optical extinction (A$_V$) using our sample<br>
and current models of interstellar X-ray absorption, finding $N_H ({\rm<br>
cm}^{-2}) = (2.81\pm0.13)\times10^{21} A_V$.<br>

Magnetohydrodynamic accretion disk simulations suggest that much of the<br>
energy liberated by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) can be channeled<br>
into large-scale toroidal magnetic fields through dynamo action. Under certain<br>
conditions, this field can dominate over gas and radiation pressure in<br>
providing vertical support against gravity, even close to the midplane. Using a<br>
simple model for the creation of this field, its buoyant rise, and its coupling<br>
to the gas, we show how disks could be driven into this magnetically dominated<br>
state and deduce the resulting vertical pressure and density profiles. Applying<br>
an established criterion for MRI to operate in the presence of a toroidal<br>
field, we show that magnetically supported disks can have two distinct<br>
MRI-active regions, separated by a "dead zone" where local MRI is suppressed,<br>
but where magnetic energy continues to flow upward from the dynamo region<br>
below. We suggest that the relative strengths of the MRI zones, and the local<br>
poloidal flux, determine the spectral states of X-ray binaries. Specifically,<br>
"intermediate" and "hard" accretion states occur when MRI is triggered in the<br>
hot, upper zone of the corona, while disks in "soft" states do not develop the<br>
upper MRI zone. We discuss the conditions under which various transitions<br>
should take place and speculate on the relationship of dynamo activity to the<br>
various types of quasi-periodic oscillations that sometimes appear in the hard<br>
spectral components. The model also explains why luminous accretion disks in<br>
the "soft" state show no signs of the thermal/viscous instability predicted by<br>
standard alpha models.<br>

$\gamma$-ray radiation from pulsars is usually thought to be mostly produced<br>
by the synchro-curvature losses of accelerated particles. Here we present a<br>
systematic study of all currently reported, good-quality Fermi-LAT pulsar<br>
spectral data. We do so by applying a model which follows the particle dynamics<br>
and consistently computes the emission of synchro-curvature radiation. By<br>
fitting observational data on a case by case basis, we are able to obtain<br>
constraints about the parallel electric field, the typical lengthscale over<br>
which particles emit the bulk of the detected radiation, and the number of<br>
involved particles. The model copes well with data of several dozens of<br>
millisecond and young pulsars. By correlating the inferred model parameters<br>
with the observed timing properties, some trends are discovered. First, a<br>
non-negligible part of the radiation comes from the loss of perpendicular<br>
momentum soon after pair creation. Second, the electric field strongly<br>
correlates with both the inverse of the emission lengthscale and the magnetic<br>
field at light cylinder, thus ruling out models with high-energy photon<br>
production close to the surface. These correlations unify young and millisecond<br>
pulsars under the same physical scenario, and predict that magnetars are<br>
intrinsically $\gamma$-ray quiet via syncrhro-curvature processes, since<br>
magnetospheric particles are not accelerated enough to emit a detectable<br>
$\gamma$-ray flux.<br>

We present results from multi-wavelength simultaneous X-ray and radio<br>
observations of the black hole X-ray binary V404 Cyg in quiescence. Our<br>
coverage with NuSTAR provides the very first opportunity to study the X-ray<br>
spectrum of V404 Cyg at energies above 10 keV. The unabsorbed broad-band<br>
(0.3-30 keV) quiescent luminosity of the source is 8.9$\times$10$^{32}$ erg<br>
s$^{-1}$ for a distance of 2.4 kpc. The source shows clear variability on short<br>
time scales in radio, soft X-ray and hard X-ray bands in the form of multiple<br>
flares. The broad-band X-ray spectra obtained from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR can be<br>
characterized with a power-law model having photon index {\Gamma}=2.13$\pm$0.07<br>
(90% confidence errors); however, residuals at high energies indicate spectral<br>
curvature significant at a 3{\sigma} confidence level with e-folding energy of<br>
the cutoff to be 19$^{+19}_{-7}$ keV. Such curvature can be explained using<br>
synchrotron emission from the base of a jet outflow. Radio observations using<br>
the JVLA reveal that the spectral index evolves on very fast time-scales,<br>
switching between optically thick and thin synchrotron emission, possibly due<br>
to instabilities in the compact jet or stochastic instabilities in accretion<br>
rate. We explore different scenarios to explain this fast variability.<br>

Many jets are detected at X-ray wavelengths in the Sun's polar regions, and<br>
the ejected plasma along the jets has been suggested to contribute mass to the<br>
fast solar wind. From in-situ measurements in the magnetosphere, it has been<br>
found that the fast solar wind has photospheric abundances while the slow solar<br>
wind has coronal abundances. Therefore, we investigated the abundances of polar<br>
jets to determine whether they are the same as that of the fast solar wind. For<br>
this study, we selected 22 jets in the polar region observed by Hinode/EIS (EUV<br>
Imaging Spectrometer) and XRT (X-Ray Telescope) simultaneously on 2007 November<br>
1-3. We calculated the First Ionization Potential (FIP) bias factor from the<br>
ratio of the intensity between high (S) and low (Si, Fe) FIP elements using the<br>
EIS spectra. The values of the FIP bias factors for the polar jets are around<br>
0.7-1.9, and 75$\%$ of the values are in the range of 0.7-1.5, which indicates<br>
that they have photospheric abundances similar to the fast solar wind. The<br>
results are consistent with the reconnection jet model where photospheric<br>
plasma emerges and is rapidly ejected into the fast wind.<br>

SDSS J082053.53+000843.4 belongs to the HW Vir family of short period binary<br>
systems and was first identified by Geier in 2011. Whilst three subsequent<br>
papers have focused on the morphology of this system, little has been published<br>
on the system period and its constancy. Here we provide the first published<br>
times of minima together with a revised ephemeris and a binary period,<br>
0.0962404(1)d, that is four orders of magnitude more precise than previous<br>
declared values.<br>

We apply our recently suggested statistical approach to thermal evolution of<br>
isolated neutron stars and accreting quasistationary neutron stars in X-ray<br>
transients for constraining the position and relative broadening alpha of the<br>
direct Urca threshold of powerful neutrino emission in neutron star cores. We<br>
show that most likely explanation of observations corresponds to alpha = 0.08 -<br>
0.10 and to the neutron star mass, at which the direct Urca process is open,<br>

4U 1538-52, an absorbed high mass X-ray binary with an orbital period of 3.73<br>
days, shows moderate orbital intensity modulations with a low level of counts<br>
during the eclipse. Several models have been proposed to explain the accretion<br>
at different orbital phases by a spherically symmetric stellar wind from the<br>
companion. The aim of this work is to study both the light curve and orbital<br>
phase spectroscopy of this source in the long term. Particularly, the folded<br>
light curve and the changes of the spectral parameters with orbital phase to<br>
analyse the stellar wind of QV Nor, the mass donor of this binary system. We<br>
used all the observations made from the Gas Slit Camera on board MAXI of 4U<br>
1538-52 covering many orbits continuously. We obtained the good interval times<br>
for every orbital phase range which were the input to extract our data. We<br>
estimated the orbital period of the system and then folded the light curves and<br>
we fitted the X-ray spectra with the same model for every orbital phase<br>
spectrum. We also extracted the averaged spectrum of all the MAXI data<br>
available. The MAXI spectra in the 2-20 keV energy range were fitted with an<br>
absorbed Comptonization of cool photons on hot electrons. We found a strong<br>
orbital dependence of the absorption column density but neither the<br>
fluorescence iron emission line nor low energy excess were needed to fit the<br>
MAXI spectra. The variation of the spectral parameters over the binary orbit<br>
were used to examine the mode of accretion onto the neutron star in 4U 1538-52.<br>
We deduce a best value of $\dot{M}/v_\infty=0.65\times 10^{-9}$ $M_{\odot} \,<br>
yr^{-1}/(km \, s^{-1})$ for QV Nor.<br>

We analytically calculate the influence of a plasma on the shadow of a black<br>
hole (or of another compact object). We restrict to spherically symmetric and<br>
static situations, where the shadow is circular. The plasma is assumed to be<br>
non-magnetized and pressure-less. We derive the general formulas for a<br>
spherically symmetric plasma density on an unspecified spherically symmetric<br>
and static spacetime. The formalism applies not only to black holes but also,<br>
e.g., to wormholes. As examples for the underlying spacetime model, we consider<br>
the Schwarzschild spacetime and the Ellis wormhole. In particular, we treat the<br>
case that the plasma is in radial free fall from infinity onto a Schwarzschild<br>
black hole. The perspectives of actually observing the influence of a plasma on<br>
the shadows of supermassive black holes are discussed.<br>

The so called $f(X)$ hybrid metric-Palatini gravity presents a unique viable<br>
generalisation of the $f(R)$ theories within the metric-affine formalism. Here<br>
the cosmology of the $f(X)$ theories is studied using the dynamical system<br>
approach. The method consists of formulating the propagation equation in terms<br>
of suitable (expansion-normalised) variables as an autonomous system. The fixed<br>
points of the system then represent exact cosmological solutions described by<br>
power-law or de Sitter expansion. The formalism is applied to two classes of<br>
$f(X)$ models, revealing both standard cosmological fixed points and new<br>
accelerating solutions that can be attractors in the phase space. In addition,<br>
the fixed point with vanishing expansion rate are considered with special care<br>
in order to characterise the stability of Einstein static spaces and bouncing<br>
solutions.<br>

The scattering cross sections of the unpolarized electromagnetic and<br>
gravitational waves are shown to be equal for the extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"om<br>
black hole using $N=2$ supergravity. The conversion cross sections between the<br>
unpolarized electromagnetic and gravitational waves are also shown to coincide.<br>
The gravitational and electromagnetic scattering cross sections are computed<br>
numerically for Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes for several charge-to-mass<br>
ratios and the coincidence between the two scattering cross sections for the<br>
extremal case is confirmed.<br>

Motivated by the discovery of floating orbits and the potential to provide<br>
extra constraints on alternative theories, in this paper we derive the<br>
self-force equation for a small compact object moving on an accelerated world<br>
line in a background spacetime which is a solution of the coupled gravitational<br>
and scalar field equations of scalar-tensor theory. In the Einstein frame, the<br>
coupled field equations governing the perturbations sourced by the particle<br>
share the same form as the field equations for perturbations of a scalarvac<br>
spacetime, with both falling under the general class of hyperbolic field<br>
equations studied by Zimmerman and Poisson. Here, we solve the field equations<br>
formally in terms of retarded Green functions, which have explicit<br>
representations as Hadamard forms in the neighbourhood of the world line. Using<br>
a quasi-local expansion of the Hadamard form, we derive the regular solutions<br>
in Fermi normal coordinates according to the Detweiler-Whiting prescription. To<br>
compute the equation of motion, we parameterize the world line in terms of a<br>
mass and "charge", which we define in terms of the original Jordan frame mass,<br>
its derivative, and the parameter which translates the proper time in the<br>
Jordan frame to the Einstein frame. These parameters depend on the value of the<br>
background scalar field and its self-field corrections. The equation of motion<br>
which follows from the regular fields strongly resembles the equation for the<br>
self-force acting on a charged, massive particle in a scalarvac geometry of<br>
general relativity. Unlike the scalar vacuum scenario, the "charge" parameter<br>
in the scalar-tensor self-force equation is time variable and leading to<br>
additional local and tail terms. We also provide evolution equations for the<br>
world line parameters under the influence of the self-fields.<br>

Title: A New Class of Asymptotically Non-Chaotic Vacuum Singularities<br>

The BKL conjecture, stated in the 60s and early 70s by Belinski, Khalatnikov<br>
and Lifshitz, proposes a detailed description of the generic asymptotic<br>
dynamics of spacetimes as they approach a spacelike singularity. It predicts<br>
complicated chaotic behaviour in the generic case, but simpler non-chaotic one<br>
in cases with symmetry assumptions or certain kinds of matter fields.<br>
Here we construct a new class of four-dimensional vacuum spacetimes<br>
containing spacelike singularities which show non-chaotic behaviour. In<br>
contrast with previous constructions, no symmetry assumptions are made. Rather,<br>
the metric is decomposed in Iwasawa variables and conditions on the asymptotic<br>
evolution of some of them are imposed. The constructed solutions contain five<br>
free functions of all space coordinates, two of which are constrained by<br>
inequalities. We investigate continuous and discrete isometries and compare the<br>
solutions to previous constructions. Finally, we give the asymptotic behaviour<br>
of the metric components and curvature.<br>

It has been pointed out by Bekenstein and Mayo that the behavior of the Black<br>
hole's entropy or information flow is similar to that through one-dimensional<br>
channel. Here I analyse the same issue with the use of gravitational anomalies.<br>
The rate of the entropy change ($\dot{S}$) and the power ($P$) of the Hawking<br>
emission are calculated from the relevant components of the anomalous<br>
stress-tensor under the Unruh vacuum condition. I show that the dependence of<br>
$\dot{S}$ on power is $\dot{S}\propto P^{1/2}$ which is identical to that for<br>
the information flow in one dimensional system. This is established by using<br>
the ($1+1$) dimensional gravitational anomalies first. Then the fact is further<br>
bolstered by considering the ($1+3$) dimensional gravitational anomalies. It is<br>
found that in the former case, the proportionality constant is exactly<br>
identical to one dimensional situation, known as Pendry's formula, while in<br>
later situation its value decreases.<br>

We explore the implications of hidden symmetries present in a particular<br>
quantum cosmological setting, extending the results reported in \cite{10,11}.<br>
In more detail, our case study is constituted by a spatially closed<br>
Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe, in the presence of a<br>
conformally coupled scalar field. The $su(1,1)$ hidden symmetries of this<br>
model, together with the Hamiltonian constraint, lead to the gauge invariance<br>
of its corresponding Bargmann indices. We subsequently show that some<br>
factor-ordering choices can be related to the allowed spectrum of Bargmann<br>
indices and hence, to the hidden symmetries. Moreover, the presence of those<br>
hidden symmetries also implies a set of appropriate boundary conditions to<br>
choose from. In summary, our results suggest that factor ordering and boundary<br>
conditions can be intertwined when a quantum cosmological model has hidden<br>
symmetries.<br>

We analytically calculate the influence of a plasma on the shadow of a black<br>
hole (or of another compact object). We restrict to spherically symmetric and<br>
static situations, where the shadow is circular. The plasma is assumed to be<br>
non-magnetized and pressure-less. We derive the general formulas for a<br>
spherically symmetric plasma density on an unspecified spherically symmetric<br>
and static spacetime. The formalism applies not only to black holes but also,<br>
e.g., to wormholes. As examples for the underlying spacetime model, we consider<br>
the Schwarzschild spacetime and the Ellis wormhole. In particular, we treat the<br>
case that the plasma is in radial free fall from infinity onto a Schwarzschild<br>
black hole. The perspectives of actually observing the influence of a plasma on<br>
the shadows of supermassive black holes are discussed.<br>

The Hartle-Thorne metric defines a reliable spacetime for most astrophysical<br>
purposes, for instance for the simulation of slowly rotating stars. Solving the<br>
Einstein field equations, we added terms of second order in the quadrupole<br>
moment to its post-linear version without rotation in order to compare it with<br>
solutions found by Blanchet in the frame of the multi-polar post-Minkowskian<br>
framework. We first derived the extended Hartle-Thorne metric in harmonic<br>
coordinates and then showed agreement with the corresponding post-linear metric<br>
from Blanchet.<br>
We also found a coordinate transformation from the post-linear Erez-Rosen<br>
metric to our extended Hartle-Thorne spacetime. It is well known that the<br>
Hartle-Thorne solution can be smoothly matched with an interior perfect fluid<br>
solution with physically appropriate properties. A comparison among these<br>
solutions provides a validation of them. It is clear that in order to represent<br>
realistic solutions of self-gravitating (axially symmetric) matter<br>
distributions of perfect fluid, the quadrupole moment has to be included as a<br>
physical parameter.<br>

Large-scale peculiar motions are believed to reflect the local inhomogeneity<br>
and anisotropy of the universe, triggered by the ongoing process of structure<br>
formation. As a result, realistic observers do not follow the smooth Hubble<br>
flow, but have a peculiar, `tilt', velocity relative to it. Our Local Group of<br>
galaxies, in particular, moves with respect to the universal expansion at a<br>
speed of roughly 600~km/sec. Relative motion effects are known to interfere<br>
with the observations and their interpretation. The strong dipolar anisotropy<br>
seen in the the Cosmic Microwave Background, for example, is not a sign of real<br>
universal anisotropy, but a mere artifact of our peculiar motion relative to<br>
the Hubble flow. With these in mind, we look into the implications of<br>
large-scale bulk motions for the kinematics of their associated observers, by<br>
adopting a `tilted' Friedmann model. Our aim is to examine whether the<br>
deceleration parameter measured in the rest-frame of the bulk flow can differ<br>
from that of the actual universe due to relative-motion effects alone. We find<br>
that there is a difference, which depends on the speed as well as the scale of<br>
the bulk motion. The faster and the smaller the drifting domain, the larger the<br>
difference. In principle, this allows relatively slow peculiar velocities to<br>
have a disproportionately strong effect on the value of the deceleration<br>
parameter measured by observers within bulk flows of, say, few hundred<br>
megaparsecs. In fact, under certain circumstances, it is even possible to<br>
change the sign of the deceleration parameter. It goes without saying that all<br>
these effects vanish identically in the Hubble frame, which makes then an<br>
illusion and mere artifact of the observers' relative motion.<br>

The so called $f(X)$ hybrid metric-Palatini gravity presents a unique viable<br>
generalisation of the $f(R)$ theories within the metric-affine formalism. Here<br>
the cosmology of the $f(X)$ theories is studied using the dynamical system<br>
approach. The method consists of formulating the propagation equation in terms<br>
of suitable (expansion-normalised) variables as an autonomous system. The fixed<br>
points of the system then represent exact cosmological solutions described by<br>
power-law or de Sitter expansion. The formalism is applied to two classes of<br>
$f(X)$ models, revealing both standard cosmological fixed points and new<br>
accelerating solutions that can be attractors in the phase space. In addition,<br>
the fixed point with vanishing expansion rate are considered with special care<br>
in order to characterise the stability of Einstein static spaces and bouncing<br>
solutions.<br>
