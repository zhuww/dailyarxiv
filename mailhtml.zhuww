          The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is a promising<br>
          mechanism to amplify the magnetic field in fast rotating<br>
          proto-neutron stars (PNS). The diffusion of neutrinos trapped in<br>
          the proto-neutron star induces a transport of momentum, which<br>
          can be modeled as a viscosity on length scales longer than the<br>
          neutrino mean free path. This neutrino-viscosity can slow down<br>
          the growth of MRI modes to such an extent that a minimum initial<br>
          magnetic field strength of $\gtrsim 10^{12}\, {\rm G}$ is needed<br>
          for the MRI to grow on a sufficiently short timescale to<br>
          potentially affect the explosion. It is uncertain whether the<br>
          magnetic field of fast rotating progenitor cores is strong<br>
          enough to yield such an initial magnetic field in proto-neutron<br>
          stars. At MRI wavelengths shorter than the neutrino mean free<br>
          path, on the other hand, neutrino radiation does not act as a<br>
          viscosity but rather induces a drag on the velocity with a<br>
          damping rate independent of the wavelength. We perform a linear<br>
          analysis of the MRI in this regime, and apply our analytical<br>
          results to the proto-neutron star structure from a<br>
          one-dimensional numerical simulation. We show that in the outer<br>
          layers of the PNS, the MRI can grow from weak magnetic fields at<br>
          wavelengths shorter than the neutrino mean free path, while<br>
          deeper in the PNS MRI growth takes place in the viscous regime<br>
          and requires a minimum magnetic field strength.<br>

          Aims: We present a polarimetric and spectroscopic study of the<br>
          persistent ultra compact X-ray binary 4U 0614+091 aimed at<br>
          searching for the emission of a relativistic particle jet and at<br>
          unveiling the orbital period of the system. Methods: We obtained<br>
          r-band polarimetric observations with the Telescopio Nazionale<br>
          Galileo (TNG) equipped with the PAOLO polarimeter and with the<br>
          Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC<br>
          instrument, covering ~ 2 hours and ~ 0.5 hours observations,<br>
          respectively. We carried out low resolution spectroscopy of the<br>
          system using the ESO Very Large Telescope equipped with FORS1<br>
          for ~ 1.5 hours (16 spectra covering the range 430-800 nm).<br>
          Results: The polarimetric analysis performed starting from the<br>
          TNG dataset revealed a polarisation degree in the r-band of 3 %<br>
          +/- 1 %. From the NOT dataset, due to the lower S/N ratio, we<br>
          could obtain only a 3 sigma upper limit of 3.4 %. From the<br>
          joining of a spectroscopic and photometric analysis, through the<br>
          study of the equivalent width variations of the CII 724 nm line<br>
          and the r-band light curve, we could find a hint of a ~ 45 min<br>
          periodicity. Conclusions: A polarisation degree P of ~ 3 % in<br>
          the r-band is consistent with the emission of a relativistic<br>
          particle jet, which is supposed to emit intrinsically linearly<br>
          polarised synchrotron radiation. Since no variations of P with<br>
          time have been detected, and the accretion disc of the system<br>
          does not contain ionised hydrogen, scattering by free electrons<br>
          in the accretion disc has been rejected. The period of ~ 45 min<br>
          obtained through the analysis of the system light curve and of<br>
          the equivalent width variations of the selected spectral line is<br>
          probably linked to the presence of a hot spot or a superhump in<br>
          the accretion disc, and lead to an orbital period > 1 hour for<br>
          the binary system.<br>

          Hybrid inflation models are especially interesting as they lead<br>
          to a spike in the density power spectrum on small scales,<br>
          compared to the CMB. Here we study hybrid inflation with<br>
          $\mathcal{N}$ waterfall fields sharing a global<br>
          $SO(\mathcal{N})$ symmetry. The inclusion of many waterfall<br>
          fields has the obvious advantage of avoiding topologically<br>
          stable defects for $\mathcal{N}>3$. We find that it also has<br>
          another advantage: it is easier to engineer models that can<br>
          simultaneously (i) be compatible with constraints on the<br>
          primordial spectral index, which tends to otherwise disfavor<br>
          hybrid models, and (ii) produce a spike on astrophysically large<br>
          length scales. The latter may have significant consequences,<br>
          possibly seeding the formation of astrophysically large black<br>
          holes. We calculate correlation functions of the time-delay, a<br>
          measure of density perturbations, produced by the waterfall<br>
          fields, as a convergent power series in both $1/\mathcal{N}$ and<br>
          the field's correlation function $\Delta(x)$. We show that for<br>
          large $\mathcal{N}$, the two-point function is $<\delta t({\bf<br>
          x})\,\delta t({\bf 0})>\propto\Delta^2(|{\bf x}|)/\mathcal{N}$<br>
          and the three-point function is $<\delta t({\bf x})\,\delta<br>
          t({\bf y})\,\delta t({\bf 0})>\propto\Delta(|{\bf x}-{\bf<br>
          y}|)\Delta(|{\bf x}|)\Delta(|{\bf y}|)/\mathcal{N}^2$. In<br>
          accordance with the central limit theorem, the density<br>
          perturbations on the scale of the spike are Gaussian for large<br>
          $\mathcal{N}$ and non-Gaussian for small $\mathcal{N}$.<br>

          We report new observations of Galactic Center source G2 from the<br>
          W. M. Keck Observatory. G2 is a dusty red object associated with<br>
          gas that shows tidal interactions as it nears closest approach<br>
          (periapse) with the Galaxy's central black hole. Our<br>
          observations, conducted as G2 passed through periapse, were<br>
          designed to test the proposal that G2 is a 3 earth mass gas<br>
          cloud. Such a cloud should be tidally disrupted during periapse<br>
          passage. The data were obtained using the Keck II laser guide<br>
          star adaptive optics system (LGSAO) and the facility<br>
          near-infrared camera (NIRC2) through the K' [2.1 $\mu$m] and L'<br>
          [3.8 $\mu$m] broadband filters. Several key results emerge from<br>
          these observations: 1) G2 has survived its closest approach to<br>
          the central black hole as a compact, unresolved source at L'; 2)<br>
          G2's L' brightness measurements are consistent with those over<br>
          the last decade; 3) G2's motion continues to be consistent with<br>
          a Keplerian model. These results rule out G2 as a pure gas cloud<br>
          and imply that G2 has a central star. This star has a luminosity<br>
          of 30 $L_{\odot} $ and is surrounded by a large (2 AU) optically<br>
          thick dust shell. We suggest that G2 is a binary star merger<br>
          product and will ultimately appear similar to the B-stars that<br>
          are tightly clustered around the black hole (the so-called<br>
          S-star cluster). In memoriam of Gerry Neugebauer (1932-2014).<br>

          Growing interests in neutron star (NS) mergers as the origin of<br>
          r-process elements have sprouted since the discovery of evidence<br>
          for the ejection of these elements from a short-duration<br>
          gamma-ray burst. The hypothesis of a NS merger origin is<br>
          reinforced by a theoretical update of nucleosynthesis in NS<br>
          mergers successful in yielding r-process nuclides with A>130. On<br>
          the other hand, whether the origin of light r-process elements<br>
          are associated with nucleosynthesis in NS merger events remains<br>
          unclear. We find a signature of nucleosynthesis in NS mergers<br>
          from peculiar chemical abundances of stars belonging to the<br>
          Galactic globular cluster M15. This finding combined with the<br>
          recent nucleosynthesis results implies a potential diversity of<br>
          nucleosynthesis in NS mergers. Based on these considerations, we<br>
          are successful in the interpretation of an observed correlation<br>
          between [light r-process/Eu] and [Eu/Fe] among Galactic halo<br>
          stars and accordingly narrow down the role of supernova<br>
          nucleosynthesis in the r-process production site. We conclude<br>
          that the tight correlation by a large fraction of halo stars is<br>
          attributable to the fact that core-collapse supernovae produce<br>
          light r-process elements while heavy r-process elements such as<br>
          Eu and Ba are produced by NS mergers. On the other hand, stars<br>
          in the outlier, composed of r-enhanced stars ([Eu/Fe]>+1) such<br>
          as CS22892-052, were exclusively enriched by matter ejected by a<br>
          subclass of NS mergers that is inclined to be massive and<br>
          consist of both light and heavy r-process nuclides.<br>

          When a core-collapse supernova (SN) happens in our galaxy,<br>
          various detectors will detect gravitational waves (GWs) and<br>
          neutrinos. Current numerical simula- tions have successfully<br>
          introduced multi-dimensional effects to produce exploding SN<br>
          models, but thus far the explosion mechanism is not well<br>
          understood. In this paper, we focus on an investigation of<br>
          progenitor core rotation via comparison of the start time of GW<br>
          emission and that of the neutronization burst. The GW and<br>
          neutrino detectors are assumed to be the KAGRA detector and<br>
          EGADS detector, respectively. Our detection simulation studies<br>
          show that for a nearby supernova(<0.2 kpc) we can confirm the<br>
          lack of core rotation close to 100% of the time, and the<br>
          presence of core rotation about 90% of the time.<br>

          We performed digital processing of a large set of photographic<br>
          plates for X-ray binary system V4641 Sgr containing a black<br>
          hole. A total of 277 plates were found in archives dated between<br>
          1960 and 1992. Photographic observations revealed lower level of<br>
          outburst activity if to compare with CCD data after the large<br>
          1999 outburst. Only single outburst which happened in 1978 was<br>
          confirmed. If archive photographic data are used along with<br>
          contemporary CCD observations, the orbital period may be<br>
          improved, and its value is 2.81728 +/-0.00004 day.<br>

          (abbreviated) We aim to study the inner wind of the well-known<br>
          AGB star CW Leo. Different diagnostics probing different<br>
          geometrical scales have pointed toward a non-homogeneous<br>
          mass-loss process: dust clumps are observed at milli-arcsec<br>
          scale, a bipolar structure is seen at arcsecond-scale and<br>
          multi-concentric shells are detected beyond 1". We present the<br>
          first ALMA Cycle 0 band 9 data around 650 GHz. The<br>
          full-resolution data have a spatial resolution of 0".42x0".24,<br>
          allowing us to study the morpho-kinematical structure within<br>
          ~6". Results: We have detected 25 molecular lines. The emission<br>
          of all but one line is spatially resolved. The dust and<br>
          molecular lines are centered around the continuum peak position.<br>
          The dust emission has an asymmetric distribution with a central<br>
          peak flux density of ~2 Jy. The molecular emission lines trace<br>
          different regions in the wind acceleration region and suggest<br>
          that the wind velocity increases rapidly from about 5 R* almost<br>
          reaching the terminal velocity at ~11 R*. The channel maps for<br>
          the brighter lines show a complex structure; specifically for<br>
          the 13CO J=6-5 line different arcs are detected within the first<br>
          few arcseconds. The curved structure present in the PV map of<br>
          the 13CO J=6-5 line can be explained by a spiral structure in<br>
          the inner wind, probably induced by a binary companion. From<br>
          modeling the ALMA data, we deduce that the potential orbital<br>
          axis for the binary system lies at a position angle of ~10-20<br>
          deg to the North-East and that the spiral structure is seen<br>
          almost edge-on. We infer an orbital period of 55 yr and a binary<br>
          separation of 25 au (or ~8.2 R*). We tentatively estimate that<br>
          the companion is an unevolved low-mass main-sequence star. The<br>
          ALMA data hence provide us for the first time with the crucial<br>
          kinematical link between the dust clumps seen at milli-arcsecond<br>
          scale and the almost concentric arcs seen at arcsecond scale.<br>

          We report the results of a search for variable stars in the open<br>
          cluster NGC 2141. Ten variable stars are detected, among which<br>
          nine are new variable stars and they are classified as three<br>
          short period W UMa type eclipsing binaries, two EA type<br>
          eclipsing binaries, one EB type eclipsing binary, one very short<br>
          period RS CVn type eclipsing binary, one d type RR Lyrae<br>
          variable star, and one unknown type variable star. The<br>
          membership and physical properties are discussed, based on their<br>
          light curves, positions in the CMDs, spatial locations and<br>
          periods. A known EB type eclipsing binary is also identified as<br>
          a blue struggler candidate of the cluster. Furthermore, we find<br>
          that all eclipsing contact binaries have prominently asymmetric<br>
          eclipses and O Connell effect (O Connell 1951) which increases<br>
          with the decrease of the orbital periods. This suggests that the<br>
          O Connell effect is probably related to the evolution of the<br>
          orbital period in short period eclipsing binary systems.<br>

          Nuclear pasta, with non-spherical shapes, is expected near the<br>
          base of the crust in neutron stars. Large scale molecular<br>
          dynamics simulations of pasta show long lived topological<br>
          defects that could increase electron scattering and reduce both<br>
          the thermal and electrical conductivities. We model a possible<br>
          low conductivity pasta layer by increasing an impurity parameter<br>
          Q_{imp}. Predictions of light curves for the low mass X-ray<br>
          binary MXB 1659-29, assuming a large Q_{imp}, find continued<br>
          late time cooling that is consistent with Chandra observations.<br>
          The electrical and thermal conductivities are likely related.<br>
          Therefore observations of late time crust cooling can provide<br>
          insight on the electrical conductivity and the possible decay of<br>
          neutron star magnetic fields (assuming these are supported by<br>
          currents in the crust).<br>

          We present narrow-band Halpha and [OIII] images, and<br>
          high-resolution, long-slit spectra of the planetary nebulae<br>
          (PNe) Abell36, DeHt2, and RWT152 aimed at studying their<br>
          morphology and internal kinematics. These data are complemented<br>
          with intermediate-resolution, long-slit spectra to describe the<br>
          spectral properties of the central stars and nebulae. The<br>
          morphokinematical analysis shows that Abell36 consists of an<br>
          inner spheroid and two bright point-symmetric arcs; DeHt2 is<br>
          elliptical with protruding polar regions and a bright<br>
          non-equatorial ring; and RWT152 is bipolar. The formation of<br>
          Abell36 and DeHt2 requires several ejection events including<br>
          collimated bipolar outflows that probably are younger than and<br>
          have disrupted the main shell. The nebular spectra of the three<br>
          PNe show a high excitation and also suggest a possible<br>
          deficiency in heavy elements in DeHt2 and RWT152. The spectra of<br>
          the central stars strongly suggest an sdO nature and their<br>
          association with PNe points out that they have most probably<br>
          evolved through the asymptotic giant branch. We analyze general<br>
          properties of the few known sdOs associated to PNe and find that<br>
          most of them are relatively or very evolved PNe, show complex<br>
          morphologies, host binary central stars, and are located at<br>
          relatively high Galactic latitudes.<br>

          Dark matter is a vital component of the current best model of<br>
          our universe, $\Lambda$CDM. There are leading candidates for<br>
          what the dark matter could be (e.g. weakly-interacting massive<br>
          particles, or axions), but no compelling observational or<br>
          experimental evidence exists to support these particular<br>
          candidates, nor any beyond-the-Standard-Model physics that might<br>
          produce such candidates. This suggests that other dark matter<br>
          candidates, including ones that might arise in the Standard<br>
          Model, should receive increased attention. Here we consider a<br>
          general class of dark matter candidates with characteristic<br>
          masses and interaction cross-sections characterized in units of<br>
          grams and cm$^2$, respectively -- we therefore dub these<br>
          macroscopic objects as Macros. Such dark matter candidates could<br>
          potentially be assembled out of Standard Model particles (quarks<br>
          and leptons) in the early universe. A combination of<br>
          earth-based, astrophysical, and cosmological observations<br>
          constrain a portion of the Macro parameter space; however a<br>
          large region remains, most notably for nuclear-dense objects<br>
          with masses in the range between about $50 - 10^{17}$g and<br>
          $10^{20} - 10^{24}$g.<br>

          We study dualities of the general Galileon theory in d<br>
          dimensions in terms of coordinate transformations on the coset<br>
          space corresponding to the spontaneously broken Galileon group.<br>
          The most general duality transformation is found to be<br>
          determined uniquely up to four free parameters and under<br>
          compositions these transformations form a group which can be<br>
          identified with GL(2,R). This group represents a unified<br>
          framework for all the up to now known Galileon dualities. We<br>
          discuss a representation of this group on the Galileon theory<br>
          space and using concrete examples we illustrate its<br>
          applicability both on the classical and quantum level.<br>

          Lightspheres, surfaces where massless particles are confined in<br>
          closed orbits, are expected to be common astrophysical<br>
          structures surrounding ultra-compact objects. In this paper a<br>
          semi-classical treatment to photons in a lightspheres is<br>
          proposed. We consider the quantum Maxwell field and derive its<br>
          energy spectra. A thermodynamic approach for the quantum<br>
          lightsphere is explored. Within this treatment, an expression<br>
          for the spectral energy density of the emitted radiation is<br>
          presented. Our results suggest that lightspheres populated by<br>
          photons, when thermalized with their environment, have non-usual<br>
          thermodynamic properties, which could lead to distinct<br>
          observational signatures.<br>

          We present a new quasidilaton theory of Poincare invariant<br>
          massive gravity, based on the recently proposed framework of<br>
          matter coupling that makes it possible for the kinetic energy of<br>
          the quasidilaton scalar to couple to both physical and fiducial<br>
          metrics simultaneously. We find a scaling-type exact solution<br>
          that expresses a self-accelerating de Sitter universe, and then<br>
          analyze linear perturbations around it. It is shown that in a<br>
          range of parameters all physical degrees of freedom have<br>
          non-vanishing quadratic kinetic terms and are stable in the<br>
          subhorizon limit, while the effective Newton's constant for the<br>
          background is kept positive.<br>

          This review describes the events leading up to the discovery of<br>
          the Kerr metric in 1963 and the enormous impact the discovery<br>
          has had in the subsequent 50 years. The review discusses the<br>
          Penrose process, the four laws of black hole mechanics,<br>
          uniqueness of the solution, and the no-hair theorems. It also<br>
          includes Kerr perturbation theory and its application to black<br>
          hole stability and quasi-normal modes. The Kerr metric's<br>
          importance in the astrophysics of quasars and accreting<br>
          stellar-mass black hole systems is detailed. A theme of the<br>
          review is the "miraculous" nature of the solution, both in<br>
          describing in a simple analytic formula the most general<br>
          rotating black hole, and in having unexpected mathematical<br>
          properties that make many calculations tractable. Also included<br>
          is a pedagogical derivation of the solution suitable for a first<br>
          course in general relativity.<br>
