          We  have  studied  the  nuclear  activity  in  a  sample  of six
          quiescent   early-type  galaxies,  with  new  Chandra  data  and
          archival  HST  optical  images. Their nuclear sources have X-ray
          luminosities  ~  10^{38}  - 10^{39} erg/s (L_X/L_Edd ~ 10^{-8} -
          10^{-7}),  and  colors  or  spectra  consistent  with  accreting
          supermassive  black holes (SMBHs)--except for the nucleus of NGC
          4486B, which is softer than typical AGN spectra. In a few cases,
          the  X-ray  morphology  of  the  nuclear  sources shows hints of
          marginally  extended  structures, in addition to the surrounding
          diffuse  thermal  emission  from hot gas, which is detectable on
          scales  >~  1  kpc.  In  one  case  (NGC 5845), a dusty disk may
          partially  obstruct  our  direct  view  of  the  SMBH.  We  have
          estimated  the  temperature  and density of the hot interstellar
          medium,  which  is  one  major  source of fuel for the accreting
          SMBH;  typical  central  densities  are  n_e  ~  (0.02 +/- 0.01)
          cm^{-3}.  Assuming  that  the hot gas is captured by the SMBH at
          the Bondi rate, we show that the observed X-ray luminosities are
          too  faint  to  be  consistent with standard disk accretion, but
          brighter  than  predicted  by  radiatively-inefficient solutions
          (eg,  ADAF).  In  total,  there are ~ 20 galaxies for which SMBH
          mass,   hot  gas  density,  and  nuclear  X-ray  luminosity  are
          simultaneously  known.  In  some  cases, the nuclear sources are
          brighter  than predicted by the ADAF model; in other cases, they
          are  consistent  or  fainter.  We  discuss  the apparent lack of
          correlations  between  Bondi  rate  and  X-ray  luminosity,  and
          suggest  that, in order to understand the observed distribution,
          we  need  to  know  two additional parameters: the amount of gas
          supplied  by the stellar population inside the accretion radius,
          and the fraction (possibly << 1) of the total gas available that
          is  accreted  by  the SMBH. We shall discuss these issues in our
          Paper II.

          Title:   Formation   of   Magnetically  Supported  Disks  During
          Hard-to-Soft Transition in Black Hole Accretion Flows
          Authors: Mami Machida, Kenji Nakamura, Ryoji Matsumoto

          resolution figures, see this http URL
          We    carried    out    three-dimensional    global    resistive
          magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the cooling instability
          in  optically  thin  hot  black hole accretion flows by assuming
          bremsstrahlung   cooling.   General   relativistic  effects  are
          simulated  by  using  the  pseudo-Newtonian  potential.  Cooling
          instability grows when the density of the accretion disk becomes
          sufficiently  large.  We found that as the instability grows the
          accretion   flow  changes  from  an  optically  thin,  hot,  gas
          pressure-supported   state   (low/hard   state)   to  a  cooler,
          magnetically   supported,   quasi-steady   state.   During  this
          transition,  magnetic  pressure exceeds the gas pressure because
          the disk shrinks in the vertical direction almost conserving the
          toroidal  magnetic  flux.  Since further vertical contraction of
          the disk is suppressed by magnetic pressure, the cool disk stays
          in an optically thin, spectrally hard state. In the magnetically
          supported  disk,  the  heating  rate balances with the radiative
          cooling  rate.  The  magnetically supported disk exists for time
          scale  much longer than the thermal time scale and comparable to
          the accretion time scale.
          We  examined  the  stability  of the magnetically supported disk
          analytically,  assuming  that  the  toroidal  magnetic  flux  is
          conserved,  and  found  it  thermally  and secularly stable. Our
          findings may explain why black hole candidates stay in luminous,
          X-ray   hard  state  even  when  their  luminosity  exceeds  the
          threshold for the onset of the cooling instability.

          Title:  Variations  in the spectral slope of Sgr A* during a NIR
          flare

          We  have  observed a bright flare of Sgr A* in the near infrared
          with  the  adaptive  optics assisted integral field spectrometer
          SINFONI.  The  observed  spectrum  is  featureless  and  can  be
          described  by  a  power law. We show for the first time that the
          spectral  index  is  correlated  with the instantaneous flux and
          that both flux and spectral index experience significant changes
          within  less  than  one  hour.  We  argue that the near infrared
          flares   from   Sgr  A*  are  due  to  synchrotron  emission  of
          transiently  heated  electrons,  the  emission being affected by
          orbital   dynamics  and  synchrotron  cooling,  both  acting  on
          timescales  of  ~20 minutes. The synchrotron cooling process may
          account  for  the observed variation in spectral index, which in
          turn  requires  a  magnetic  field  ~30G,  consistent  with  the
          equipartition  field  in  a hot accretion flow with an accretion
          rate of ~10^{-8} solar masses per year.

          Title:   Steady   shocks   around   black   holes   produced  by
          sub-keplerian flows with negative energy
          Authors: D. Molteni, G. Gerardi, V. Teresi
          Comments:  5  pages, 5 figures, accepted by MNRAS on 10 November
          2005
          We discuss a special case of formation of axisymmetric shocks in
          the accretion flow of ideal gas onto a Schwarzschild black hole:
          when the total energy of the flow is negative. The result of our
          analysis  enlarges  the  parameter  space for which these steady
          shocks  are  exhibited  in  the accretion of gas rotating around
          relativistic   stellar   objects.  Since  keplerian  disks  have
          negative  total energy, we guess that, in this energy range, the
          production  of  the shock phenomenon might be easier than in the
          case of positive energy. So our outcome reinforces the view that
          sub-keplerian  flows  of  matter  may  significantly  affect the
          physics  of  the  high energy radiation emission from black hole
          candidates.  We  give  a simple procedure to obtain analytically
          the  position  of  the  shocks. The comparison of the analytical
          results  with  the  data  of  1D  and  2D axisymmetric numerical
          simulations confirms that the shocks form and are stable.

          Title:   High-resolution  Millimeter  Imaging  of  Submillimeter
          Galaxies

          R.J.Ivison, F.Bertoldi, A.Blain, P.Cox, T.Greve, A.Omont
          Comments: accepted to be published in ApJ, 9 Figures
          We  present sub-arcsecond resolution IRAM PdBI interferometry of
          eight  submillimeter  galaxies at redshifts from 2 to 3.4, where
          we detect continuum at 1mm and/or CO lines at 3 and 1 mm. The CO
          3-2/4-3  line profiles in five of the sources are double-peaked,
          indicative of orbital motion either in a single rotating disk or
          of  a  merger of two galaxies. The millimeter line and continuum
          emission is compact; we marginally resolve the sources or obtain
          tight  upper  limits  to their intrinsic sizes in all cases. The
          median  FWHM  diameter  for  these  sources  and  the previously
          resolved  sources,  SMMJ023952-0136  and SMMJ140104+0252 is less
          than  or  equal  to 0.5" (4 kpc). The compactness of the sources
          does  not  support  a  scenario  where the far-IR/submm emission
          comes  from  a  cold,  very  extended  dust  distribution. These
          measurements  clearly  show  that  the submillimeter galaxies we
          have  observed  resemble scaled-up and more gas rich versions of
          the  local  Universe,  ultra-luminous galaxy (ULIRG) population.
          Their  central  densities  and  potential  well  depths are much
          greater  than  in  other  redshift 2-3 galaxy samples studied so
          far.  They  are  comparable  to  those of elliptical galaxies or
          massive  bulges.  The  SMG  properties  fulfill  the criteria of
          'maximal' starbursts, in which most of the available initial gas
          reservoir of 10^10-10^11 solar masses is converted to stars on a
          few dynamical timescales.

          Title: OVI in Elliptical Galaxies: Indicators of Cooling Flows
          Authors:  Joel  N. Bregman, Eric D. Miller, Alex E. Athey, Jimmy
          A. Irwin
          Comments: 49 pages, 26 figures, ApJ, in press
          Early-type   galaxies   often   contain  a  hot  X-ray  emitting
          interstellar medium (3-8E6 K) with an apparent radiative cooling
          time  much  less  than  a Hubble time. If unopposed by a heating
          mechanism, the gas will radiatively cool to temperatures <= 10E4
          K  at  a  rate proportional to L_X/T_X, typically 0.03-1 M_solar
          yr^-1.  We can test if gas is cooling through the 3E5 K range by
          observing  the  OVI doublet, whose luminosity is proportional to
          the  cooling  rate.  Here  we  report  on a study of an unbiased
          sample  of  24 galaxies, obtaining Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic
          Explorer  spectra  to  complement  the  X-ray data of ROSAT} and
          Chandra.  The OVI line emission was detected in about 40% of the
          galaxies  and  at  a  luminosity level similar to the prediction
          from  the  cooling  flow  model.  There is a correlation between
          Mdot_OVI  and  Mdot_X,  although there is significant dispersion
          about the relationship, where the OVI is brighter or dimmer than
          expected  by  a  factor  of  three  or more. If the cooling flow
          picture is to be retained, this dispersion requires that cooling
          flows  be  time-dependent,  as might occur by the activity of an
          AGN.  However,  of  detected  objects, those with the highest or
          lowest  values  of Mdot_OVI/Mdot_X are not systematically hot or
          cool, as one might predict from AGN heating.

          Title:  On  the spin-up/spin-down transitions in accreting X-ray
          binaries
          Authors:  Rosalba  Perna  (Colorado/JILA),  Enrico  Bozzo  (OAR,
          Rome), Luigi Stella (OAR, Rome)
          Comments:  37  pages,  11 figures, accepted to the Astrophysical
          Journal
          Accreting  X-Ray  Binaries  display  a wide range of behaviours.
          Some  of  them  are  observed  to  spin  up  steadily, others to
          alternate   between  spin-up  and  spin-down  states,  sometimes
          superimposed  on  a longer trend of either spin up or spin down.
          Here  we interpret this rich phenomenology within a new model of
          the  disk-magnetosphere  interaction.  Our  model,  based on the
          simplest  version  of a purely material torque, accounts for the
          fact  that,  when  a  neutron star is in the propeller regime, a
          fraction  of the ejected material does not receive enough energy
          to  completely  unbind,  and  hence falls back into the disk. We
          show  that  the  presence of this feedback mass component causes
          the occurrence of multiple states available to the system, for a
          given,  constant  value of the mass accretion rate dot{M}_* from
          the companion star. If the angle chi of the magnetic dipole axis
          with  respect  to the perpendicular to the disk is larger than a
          critical  value  chi_crit,  the  system  eventually settles in a
          cycle  of  spin-up/spin-down transitions for a constant value of
          dot{M}_*  and independent of the initial conditions. No external
          perturbations  are  required to induce the torque reversals. The
          transition  from  spin up to spin down is often accompanied by a
          large  drop  in  luminosity. The frequency range spanned in each
          cycle and the timescale for torque reversals depend on dot{M}_*,
          the magnetic field of the star, the magnetic colatitude chi, and
          the  degree  of  elasticity  regulating  the  magnetosphere-disk
          interaction. The critical angle chi_crit ranges from \~25-30 deg
          for a completely elastic interaction to ~40-45 deg for a totally
          anelastic  one.  For  chi  ~<  chi_crit,  cycles  are  no longer
          possible  and  the  long-term  evolution of the system is a pure
          spin  up.  We  specifically illustrate our model in the cases of
          the X-ray binaries GX 1+4 and 4U 1626-67.

          detection  of  three cyclotron resonance features at 27, 51, and
          74  keV  in  the  phase-averaged  data, corresponding to a polar

          V0332+53  the  second  accreting neutron star in which more than
          two  cyclotron  lines have been detected; this has now also been
          confirmed   by   INTEGRAL.   Pulse-phase   spectroscopy  reveals

          25 pages, 14 figures
          We  investigate  the  properties  of massive galaxies at z=1-3.5
          using   HST  observations,  ground-based  near-IR  imaging,  and
          Spitzer Space Telescope observations at 3-24 micron. We identify
          153 distant red galaxies (DRGs) with J-K > 2.3 mag (Vega) in the
          southern  GOODS  field. This sample is approximately complete in
          stellar  mass  for passively evolving galaxies above 10^11 solar
          masses  and z < 3. The galaxies identified by this selection are
          roughly   split   between  objects  whose  optical  and  near-IR
          rest-frame  light  is  dominated  by evolved stars combined with
          ongoing star formation, and galaxies whose light is dominated by
          heavily  reddened  starbursts.  Very few of the galaxies (< 10%)
          have   no  indication  of  current  star  formation.  Using  SFR
          estimates  that  include the reradiated IR emission, the DRGs at
          z=1.5-3  with  stellar masses > 10^11 solar masses have specific
          SFRs (SFRs per unit stellar mass) ranging from 0.2 to 10 Gyr^-1,
          with a mean value of ~2.4 Gyr^-1. The DRGs with stellar masses >
          10^11 solar masses and 1.5 < z < 3 have integrated specific SFRs
          greater the global value over all galaxies. In contrast, we find
          that  galaxies  at  z  = 0.3-0.75 with these stellar masses have
          integrated  specific  SFRs  less than the global value, and more
          than an order of magnitude lower than that for massive DRGs at z
          =  1.5-3.  At  z  <  1, lower-mass galaxies dominate the overall
          cosmic  mass  assembly.  This  suggests  that  the  bulk of star
          formation  in massive galaxies occurs at early cosmic epochs and
          is largely complete by z~1.5. [Abridged]

          Title:  Bimodal  Galaxies  and  Bimodality  in  Globular Cluster
          Systems
          Authors: Duncan A. Forbes
          Comments:  11 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, accepted for publication
          in ApJ Letters
          Various  galaxy properties are not continuous over a large range
          in   mass,   but   rather  reveal  a  remarkable  transition  or
          `bimodality'  at  a  stellar  mass  of  3  x  10^{10}  Mo. These
          properties  include  colors,  stellar populations, Xray emission
          and  mass-to-light ratios. This behavior has been interpreted as
          the  transition  from  hot  to  cold  flows  by Dekel & Birnboim
          (2005).
          Here  we  explore  whether  globular  cluster  (GC) systems also
          reveal a bimodal nature with regard to this critical mass scale.
          Globular  clusters  probe  star formation at early epochs in the
          Universe  and  survive subsequent galaxy mergers and accretions.
          We  use  new  data  from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (Peng etal
          2005),  which  provides  a  homogeneous sample of the GC systems
          around one hundred Virgo early-type galaxies covering a range of
          five  hundred  in  galaxy  mass.  Their classification of the GC
          color  distributions  is  taken to examine a key quantity -- the
          number  of  GCs  per  unit galaxy luminosity. Below the critical
          mass, this quantity (called the GC specific frequency) increases
          dramatically  in its mean value and spread. This increase may be
          due  to  regulated star formation in low mass galaxies, which in
          turn  is  due to mass loss via winds and the transition from hot
          to  cold  gas  accretion  flows.  We  also  note  that above the
          critical mass, galaxies possess two GC subpopulations (with blue
          and  red  mean  colors)  but below this mass, galaxies reveal an
          increasing proportion of single (blue) GC systems.

          We  investigate marginally stable nuclear burning on the surface
          of  accreting  neutron  stars  as  an  explanation  for  the mHz
          quasi-periodic  oscillations (QPOs) observed from three low mass
          X-ray  binaries.  At  the  boundary  between unstable and stable
          burning,  the temperature dependence of the nuclear heating rate
          and  cooling  rate  almost  cancel. The result is an oscillatory
          mode  of  burning,  with  an  oscillation  period  close  to the
          geometric  mean  of the thermal and accretion timescales for the
          burning  layer.  We  describe  a  simple  one-zone  model  which
          illustrates  this  basic  physics,  and  then  present  detailed
          multizone  hydrodynamical  calculations of nuclear burning close
          to  the  stability  boundary  using  the KEPLER code. Our models
          naturally  explain the characteristic 2 minute period of the mHz
          QPOs, and why they are seen only in a very narrow range of X-ray
          luminosities.   The  oscillation  period  is  sensitive  to  the
          accreted hydrogen fraction and the surface gravity, suggesting a
          new  way  to  probe these parameters. A major puzzle is that the
          accretion   rate   at  which  the  oscillations  appear  in  the
          theoretical models is an order of magnitude larger than the rate
          implied  by  the X-ray luminosity when the mHz QPOs are seen. We
          discuss  the  implications  for  our  general  understanding  of
          nuclear  burning  on accreting neutron stars. One possibility is
          that  the accreted material covers only part of the neutron star
          surface at luminosities Lx > ~1E37 erg/s.

          We  have  studied  the  nuclear  activity  in  a  sample  of six
          quiescent   early-type  galaxies,  with  new  Chandra  data  and
          archival  HST  optical  images. Their nuclear sources have X-ray
          luminosities  ~  10^{38}  - 10^{39} erg/s (L_X/L_Edd ~ 10^{-8} -
          10^{-7}),  and  colors  or  spectra  consistent  with  accreting
          supermassive  black holes (SMBHs)--except for the nucleus of NGC
          4486B, which is softer than typical AGN spectra. In a few cases,
          the  X-ray  morphology  of  the  nuclear  sources shows hints of
          marginally  extended  structures, in addition to the surrounding
          diffuse  thermal  emission  from hot gas, which is detectable on
          scales  >~  1  kpc.  In  one  case  (NGC 5845), a dusty disk may
          partially  obstruct  our  direct  view  of  the  SMBH.  We  have
          estimated  the  temperature  and density of the hot interstellar
          medium,  which  is  one  major  source of fuel for the accreting
          SMBH;  typical  central  densities  are  n_e  ~  (0.02 +/- 0.01)
          cm^{-3}.  Assuming  that  the hot gas is captured by the SMBH at
          the Bondi rate, we show that the observed X-ray luminosities are
          too  faint  to  be  consistent with standard disk accretion, but
          brighter  than  predicted  by  radiatively-inefficient solutions
          (eg,  ADAF).  In  total,  there are ~ 20 galaxies for which SMBH
          mass,   hot  gas  density,  and  nuclear  X-ray  luminosity  are
          simultaneously  known.  In  some  cases, the nuclear sources are
          brighter  than predicted by the ADAF model; in other cases, they
          are  consistent  or  fainter.  We  discuss  the apparent lack of
          correlations  between  Bondi  rate  and  X-ray  luminosity,  and
          suggest  that, in order to understand the observed distribution,
          we  need  to  know  two additional parameters: the amount of gas
          supplied  by the stellar population inside the accretion radius,
          and the fraction (possibly << 1) of the total gas available that
          is  accreted  by  the SMBH. We shall discuss these issues in our
          Paper II.

          Title: A High-Mass Protobinary System in the Hot Core W3(H2O)
          Authors: Huei-Ru Chen, William J. Welch, David J. Wilner, Edmund
          C. Sutton
          Comments:  38  pages,  9  figures, accepted by The Astrophysical
          Journal
          We  have observed a high-mass protobinary system in the hot core
          W3(H2O)  with  the BIMA Array. Our continuum maps at wavelengths
          of   1.4mm   and   2.8mm   both  achieve  sub-arcsecond  angular
          resolutions  and  show  a  double-peaked morphology. The angular
          separation   of  the  two  sources  is  1.19"  corresponding  to
          2.43X10^3  AU  at  the  source  distance  of  2.04 kpc. The flux
          densities  of the two sources at 1.4mm and 2.8mm have a spectral
          index  of  3,  translating  to an opacity law of kappa ~ nu. The
          small  spectral  indices  suggest that grain growth has begun in
          the  hot core. We have also observed 5 K components of the CH3CN
          (12-11)  transitions.  A radial velocity difference of 2.81 km/s
          is found towards the two continuum peaks. Interpreting these two
          sources as binary components in orbit about one another, we find
          a  minimum  mass  of  22 Msun for the system. Radiative transfer
          models  are constructed to explain both the continuum and methyl
          cyanide    line   observations   of   each   source.   Power-law
          distributions  of  both  density  and  temperature  are derived.
          Density  distributions close to the free-fall value, r^-1.5, are
          found  for both components, suggesting continuing accretion. The
          derived  luminosities  suggest  the  two sources have equivalent
          zero-age  main  sequence  (ZAMS)  spectral  type  B0.5 - B0. The
          nebular masses derived from the continuum observations are about
          5 Msun for source A and 4 Msun for source C. A velocity gradient
          previously  detected  may  be  explained  by  unresolved  binary
          rotation with a small velocity difference.

          Title:   Formation   of   Magnetically  Supported  Disks  During
          Hard-to-Soft Transition in Black Hole Accretion Flows
          Authors: Mami Machida, Kenji Nakamura, Ryoji Matsumoto

          resolution figures, see this http URL
          We    carried    out    three-dimensional    global    resistive
          magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the cooling instability
          in  optically  thin  hot  black hole accretion flows by assuming
          bremsstrahlung   cooling.   General   relativistic  effects  are
          simulated  by  using  the  pseudo-Newtonian  potential.  Cooling
          instability grows when the density of the accretion disk becomes
          sufficiently  large.  We found that as the instability grows the
          accretion   flow  changes  from  an  optically  thin,  hot,  gas
          pressure-supported   state   (low/hard   state)   to  a  cooler,
          magnetically   supported,   quasi-steady   state.   During  this
          transition,  magnetic  pressure exceeds the gas pressure because
          the disk shrinks in the vertical direction almost conserving the
          toroidal  magnetic  flux.  Since further vertical contraction of
          the disk is suppressed by magnetic pressure, the cool disk stays
          in an optically thin, spectrally hard state. In the magnetically
          supported  disk,  the  heating  rate balances with the radiative
          cooling  rate.  The  magnetically supported disk exists for time
          scale  much longer than the thermal time scale and comparable to
          the accretion time scale.
          We  examined  the  stability  of the magnetically supported disk
          analytically,  assuming  that  the  toroidal  magnetic  flux  is
          conserved,  and  found  it  thermally  and secularly stable. Our
          findings may explain why black hole candidates stay in luminous,
          X-ray   hard  state  even  when  their  luminosity  exceeds  the
          threshold for the onset of the cooling instability.

          Title:  Variations  in the spectral slope of Sgr A* during a NIR

          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, emulateapj.cls, submitted to ApJL
          We  have  observed a bright flare of Sgr A* in the near infrared
          with  the  adaptive  optics assisted integral field spectrometer
          SINFONI.  The  observed  spectrum  is  featureless  and  can  be
          described  by  a  power law. We show for the first time that the
          spectral  index  is  correlated  with the instantaneous flux and
          that both flux and spectral index experience significant changes
          within  less  than  one  hour.  We  argue that the near infrared
          flares   from   Sgr  A*  are  due  to  synchrotron  emission  of
          transiently  heated  electrons,  the  emission being affected by
          orbital   dynamics  and  synchrotron  cooling,  both  acting  on
          timescales  of  ~20 minutes. The synchrotron cooling process may
          account  for  the observed variation in spectral index, which in
          turn  requires  a  magnetic  field  ~30G,  consistent  with  the
          equipartition  field  in  a hot accretion flow with an accretion
          rate of ~10^{-8} solar masses per year.

          Title:   Steady   shocks   around   black   holes   produced  by
          sub-keplerian flows with negative energy
          Authors: D. Molteni, G. Gerardi, V. Teresi
          Comments:  5  pages, 5 figures, accepted by MNRAS on 10 November
          2005
          We discuss a special case of formation of axisymmetric shocks in
          the accretion flow of ideal gas onto a Schwarzschild black hole:
          when the total energy of the flow is negative. The result of our
          analysis  enlarges  the  parameter  space for which these steady
          shocks  are  exhibited  in  the accretion of gas rotating around
          relativistic   stellar   objects.  Since  keplerian  disks  have
          negative  total energy, we guess that, in this energy range, the
          production  of  the shock phenomenon might be easier than in the
          case of positive energy. So our outcome reinforces the view that
          sub-keplerian  flows  of  matter  may  significantly  affect the
          physics  of  the  high energy radiation emission from black hole
          candidates.  We  give  a simple procedure to obtain analytically
          the  position  of  the  shocks. The comparison of the analytical
          results  with  the  data  of  1D  and  2D axisymmetric numerical
          simulations confirms that the shocks form and are stable.

          Title:   Spitzer/IRAC   Photometry   of   the  Eta  Chameleontis
          Association
          Authors:  S.  T. Megeath (1), L. Hartmann (2), K. L. Luhman (3),
          G. G. Fazio (1)
          Comments: Accepted to ApJ letters
          We present IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 micron photometry for the 17
          A,  K  and  M  type members of the Eta Chameleontis association.
          These  data  show infrared excesses toward six of the 15 K and M
          stars, indicating the presence of circumstellar disks around 40%
          of  the  stars  with masses of 0.1-1 solar mass. The two A-stars
          show no infrared excesses. The excess emission around one of the
          stars  is  comparable to the median excess for classical T Tauri
          stars  in  the  Taurus  association;  the  remaining  five  show
          comparatively   weak   excess   emission.  Taking  into  account
          published  Halpha  spectroscopy  that shows that five of the six
          stars   are  accreting,  we  argue  that  the  disks  with  weak
          mid-infrared  excesses  are  disks in which the inner disks have
          been  largely  depleted  of small grains by grain growth, or, in
          one  case,  the  small grains have settled to the midplane. This
          suggests that Eta Cha has a much higher fraction of disks caught
          in  the act of transitioning into optically thin disks than that
          measured in younger clusters and associations.

          Authors: A. Georgakakis (1,2), I. Georgantopoulos (2), A. Akylas
          (2) ((1) Imperial College, (2) National Athens Observatory)
          Comments: Accepted by MNRAS
          In  this  paper  we  combine archival and proprietary XMM-Newton
          observations  (about 5deg^2) that overlap with the Sloan Digital
          Sky  Survey  to  explore  the  nature  of  the  moderate-z X-ray
          population. We focus on X-ray sources with optically red colours
          (g-r>0.4),  which  we  argue are important for understanding the
          origin   of   the   X-ray  background.  Firstly,  these  systems
          constitute  a  significant fraction, about 2/3, of the z<1 X-ray
          population  to  the  limit  f(2-8keV)~2e-14cgs.  Secondly, their
          luminosity   function  under  evolution  of  the  form  ~(1+z)^3
          suggests that they could be responsible for about 17 per cent of
          the  diffuse  X-ray  background  to  z=1. Thirdly, their stacked
          X-ray  spectrum  in  the  range  1-8keV  is  consistent  with  a
          power-law distribution with Gamma~1.4 (without fitting intrinsic
          absorption),  i.e.  similar  to the diffuse X-ray background. We
          find  that  the optically red X-ray population comprises a mixed
          bag  of objects, both obscured (N_H>1e22 cm^{-2}) and unobscured
          (N_H<1e22  cm^{-2}),  with a wide range of X-ray luminosities up
          L_X~1e44cgs. We argue that dilution of the AGN light by the host
          galaxy may play a role in shaping the continuum optical emission
          of  this  population. Finally, we explore a possible association
          of  these  sources  and  the  moderate-z  red  (J-Ks>2mag)  AGNs
          identified  in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). The median
          N_H of the red X-ray sources studied here is ~1e21cm^{-2}, lower
          than  that  found  for  the  2MASS  AGNs,  suggesting  different
          populations.

          We  present sub-arcsecond resolution IRAM PdBI interferometry of
          eight  submillimeter  galaxies at redshifts from 2 to 3.4, where
          we detect continuum at 1mm and/or CO lines at 3 and 1 mm. The CO
          3-2/4-3  line profiles in five of the sources are double-peaked,
          indicative of orbital motion either in a single rotating disk or
          of  a  merger of two galaxies. The millimeter line and continuum
          emission is compact; we marginally resolve the sources or obtain
          tight  upper  limits  to their intrinsic sizes in all cases. The
          median  FWHM  diameter  for  these  sources  and  the previously
          resolved  sources,  SMMJ023952-0136  and SMMJ140104+0252 is less
          than  or  equal  to 0.5" (4 kpc). The compactness of the sources
          does  not  support  a  scenario  where the far-IR/submm emission
          comes  from  a  cold,  very  extended  dust  distribution. These
          measurements  clearly  show  that  the submillimeter galaxies we
          have  observed  resemble scaled-up and more gas rich versions of
          the  local  Universe,  ultra-luminous galaxy (ULIRG) population.
          Their  central  densities  and  potential  well  depths are much
          greater  than  in  other  redshift 2-3 galaxy samples studied so
          far.  They  are  comparable  to  those of elliptical galaxies or
          massive  bulges.  The  SMG  properties  fulfill  the criteria of
          'maximal' starbursts, in which most of the available initial gas
          reservoir of 10^10-10^11 solar masses is converted to stars on a
          few dynamical timescales.

          We  report  the discovery of a 16th magnitude star, HE0437-5439,
          with   a   heliocentric   radial   velocity  of  +723+-3km/s.  A
          quantitative   spectral   analysis  of  high-resolution  optical
          spectra  obtained  with  the VLT and the UVES spectrograph shows
          that   HE0437-5439   is   a   main  sequence  B-type  star  with
          Teff=20350K,  log  g=3.77, solar within a factor of a few helium
          abundance  and  metal content, rotating at v sin i=54km/s. Using
          appropriate evolutionary tracks we derive a mass of 8 Msun and a
          corresponding  distance  of  61  kpc.  Its  galactic  rest frame
          velocity  is  at  least 563km/s, almost twice the local Galactic
          escape  velocity,  indicating  that  the  star is unbound to the
          Galaxy.  Numerical  kinematical  experiments  are carried out to
          constrain  its  place  of birth. It has been suggested that such
          hyper-velocity  stars can be formed by the tidal disruption of a
          binary  through interaction with the super-massive black hole at
          the  Galactic  center  (GC).  HE0437-5439 needs about 100Myrs to
          travel  from the GC to its presentposition, much longer than its
          main sequence lifetime of 25Myrs. This can only be reconciled if
          HE0437-5439  is  a  blue  straggler  star.  In  this  case,  the
          predicted proper motion is so small that it can only be measured
          by  future  space missions. Since the star is much closer to the
          Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, 18kpc) than to the GC, it can reach
          its  position  from  the  center  of  the LMC. The proper motion
          predicted  in  this  case is about 2mas/y (relative to the LMC),
          large  enough to be measurable with conventional techniques from
          the   ground.   The  LMC  origin  could  also  be  tested  by  a
          high-precision abundance analysis.

          shows  that  US  708 is an extremely helium-rich (N(He)/N(H)=10)
          subluminous  O  type  star  with  Teff=44500K,  log  g=5.23 at a
          distance  of 19kpc. Its Galactic rest frame velocity is at least
          751km/s,  much  higher  than  the local Galactic escape velocity
          indicating  that  the star is unbound to the Galaxy. It has been
          suggested  that  such  hyper-velocity stars can be formed by the
          tidal  disruption  of  a  binary  through  interaction  with the
          super-massive  black  hole  (SMBH)  at the Galactic centre (GC).
          Numerical kinematical experiments are carried out to reconstruct
          the  path  from the GC.U S 708 needs about 32Myrs to travel from
          the  GC  to  its  present  position,  less than its evolutionary
          lifetime.     Its    predicted    proper    motion    mue(alpha)
          cos(delta)=-2.3mas/y    and   mue(delta)=-2.4mas/y   should   be
          measurable  by  future space missions. We conjecture that US 708
          is  formed  by  the merger of two helium white dwarfs in a close
          binary  induced  by  the interaction with the SMBH in the GC and
          then escaped.

          The basic theory of dynamic tides in close binaries is reviewed.
          Particular attention is paid to resonances between dynamic tides
          and free oscillation modes and to the role of the apsidal-motion
          rate in probing the internal structure of binary components. The
          discussed  effects  are generally applicable to stars across the
          entire   Hertzsprung-Russell   diagram,   including  the  binary
          OB-stars discussed at this meeting.

          Title: Turbulent Mixing in the Outer Solar Nebula
          Authors: N. J. Turner, K. Willacy, G. Bryden, H. W. Yorke
          Comments:  To  appear  in the Astrophysical Journal; 20 pages, 9
          figures
          The effects of turbulence on the mixing of gases and dust in the
          outer  Solar  nebula  are examined using 3-D MHD calculations in
          the shearing-box approximation with vertical stratification. The
          turbulence  is driven by the magneto-rotational instability. The
          magnetic  and hydrodynamic stresses in the turbulence correspond
          to  an  accretion  time  at  the  midplane  about  equal  to the
          lifetimes  of  T  Tauri  disks,  while  accretion in the surface
          layers  is  thirty  times  faster. The mixing resulting from the
          turbulence  is  also  fastest  in the surface layers. The mixing
          rate  is  similar  to  the  rate  of  radial exchange of orbital
          angular  momentum, so that the Schmidt number is near unity. The
          vertical  spreading  of  a  trace  species  is  well-matched  by
          solutions   of   a   damped  wave  equation  when  the  flow  is
          horizontally-averaged.  The  damped wave description can be used
          to  inexpensively  treat mixing in 1-D chemical models. However,
          even  in  calculations  reaching a statistical steady state, the
          concentration  at  any  given  time  varies  substantially  over
          horizontal planes, due to fluctuations in the rate and direction
          of  the transport. In addition to mixing species that are formed
          under  widely  varying conditions, the turbulence intermittently
          forces  the  nebula  away  from  local chemical equilibrium. The
          different transport rates in the surface layers and interior may
          affect estimates of the grain evolution and molecular abundances
          during the formation of the Solar system.

          Title:  Accurate  Evolutions  of  Orbiting  Black-Hole  Binaries

          Comments: 4 pages, revtex4, 3 figs
          We  present  a  new  algorithm  for evolving orbiting black-hole
          binaries  that  does not require excision or a corotating shift.
          Our  algorithm  is  based  on  a  novel  technique to handle the
          singular  puncture  conformal  factor. This system, based on the
          BSSN  formulation  of  Einstein's  equations,  when  used with a
          `pre-collapsed'  initial  lapse, is non-singular at the start of
          the evolution, and remains non-singular and stable provided that
          a good choice is made for the gauge. As a test case, we use this
          technique to fully evolve orbiting black-hole binaries from near
          the  Innermost  Stable  Circular  Orbit  (ISCO)  regime. We show
          fourth  order  convergence of waveforms and compute the radiated
          gravitational energy and angular momentum from the plunge. These
          results  are  in  good  agreement  with  those  predicted by the
          Lazarus approach.

          Compton  Gamma  Ray  Observatory,  OSSE, SMM, TGRS, balloon and
          recent  INTEGRAL  data  reveal  a  feature  of  the  0.511  MeV
          annihilation  radiation  of  the Galactic Center with a flux of
          approximately  5x  10^{-4}~0.511 MeV photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. We
          argue that e+e- pairs can be generated when the X-ray radiation
          photons  and ~10-30 MeV photons interact with each other in the
          compact  region  in  the proximity of the Galactic Center black
          hole.  In fact, disks formed near black holes of 10^{17} g mass
          should  emit  the  ~ 10 MeV temperature blackbody radiation. If
          positron  e+ sources are producing about 10^{42} e+ s^{-1} near
          the  Galactic  Center  they would annihilate on the way out and
          result  in 0.511 MeV emission. We suggest that the annihilation
          radiation   can   be   an   observational  consequence  of  the
          interaction  of  the accretion disk radiation of the SMall Mass
          Black  Holes  (SMMBHs)  with  X-ray  radiation  in the Galactic
          Center.  This  is probably the only way to identify and observe
          these SMMBHs.

          Title:  A  Dynamical  Model  for the Extra-planar Gas in Spiral
          Galaxies
          Authors:   Filippo  Fraternali,  James  Binney  (University  of

          Comments:  19  pages,  20  figures, accepted for publication in
          MNRAS. High resolution version available at this http URL
          Recent HI observations reveal that the discs of spiral galaxies
          are  surrounded  by  extended gaseous haloes. This extra-planar
          gas  reaches  large  distances  (several kpc) from the disc and
          shows  peculiar  kinematics  (low rotation and inflow). We have
          modelled  the extra-planar gas as a continuous flow of material
          from  the  disc  of  a  spiral galaxy into its halo region. The
          output of our models are pseudo-data cubes that can be directly
          compared  to  the  HI data. We have applied these models to two
          spiral   galaxies   (NGC891   and  NGC2403)  known  to  have  a
          substantial  amount of extra-planar gas. Our models are able to
          reproduce  accurately the vertical distribution of extra-planar
          gas for an energy input corresponding to a small fraction (<4%)
          of  the energy released by supernovae. However they fail in two
          important  aspects: 1) they do not reproduce the right gradient
          in  rotation velocity; 2) they predict a general outflow of the
          extra-planar  gas,  contrary  to what is observed. We show that
          neither  of  these  difficulties  can  be removed if clouds are
          ionized and invisible at 21cm as they leave the disc but become
          visible  at some point on their orbits. We speculate that these
          failures  indicate  the need for accreted material from the IGM
          that   could  provide  the  low  angular  momentum  and  inflow
          required.

          Comments: 10 pages, 6 colour figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          Recent  observations  of the distant Universe suggest that much
          of  the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at
          $z>1$. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation
          because  massive  halos  are  assembled  late  in  hierarchical
          cosmologies  such  as cold dark matter (CDM). In this paper, we
          discuss  a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model
          in  which  feedback  due  to  active  galactic  nuclei (AGN) is
          assumed   to  quench  cooling  flows  in  massive  halos.  This
          mechanism  naturally  creates  a  break  in  the  local  galaxy
          luminosity   function   at  bright  magnitudes.  The  model  is
          implemented   within  the  Millennium  N-body  simulation;  the
          accurate   dark   matter  merger  trees  and  large  number  of
          realizations   of   the   galaxy  formation  process  that  the
          simulation  provides  results  in  highly  accurate statistics.
          After  adjusting  the  values of the physical parameters in the
          model  by reference to the properties of local galaxies, we use
          it  to  investigate  the evolution of the K-band luminosity and
          galaxy  stellar  mass  functions.  We also calculate the volume
          averaged  star  formation  rate  density  of  the Universe as a
          function  of  redshift and the way in which this is apportioned
          amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts
          a  substantial  population  of massive galaxies out to redshift
          $z\sim  5$  and  a star formation rate density which rises with
          increasing   redshift   in  objects  of  all  masses.  Although
          observational  data  on  these  properties  have  been cited as
          evidence  for  ``anti-hierarchical''  galaxy formation, we find
          that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally
          hierachical  CDM  model  provides  a  very  good match to these
          observations.

astro-ph/0511293
          Our  X-ray study of the nuclear activity in a new sample of six
          quiescent  early-type galaxies, and in a larger sample from the
          literature,  confirmed  (Soria  et al., Paper I) that the Bondi
          accretion  rate  of  diffuse hot gas is not a good indicator of
          the  supermassive  black  hole (SMBH) X-ray luminosity. Here we
          suggest  that  a  more  reliable estimate of the accretion rate
          must  include the gas released by the stellar population inside
          the  sphere  of influence of the SMBH, in addition to the Bondi
          inflow   of  hot  gas  across  that  surface.  We  use  optical
          surface-brightness profiles to estimate the mass-loss rate from
          stars  in  the  nuclear  region: we show that for our sample of
          galaxies  it  is  an  order  of  magnitude  higher (~ 10^{-4} -
          10^{-3}  M_sun/yr)  than  the  Bondi inflow rate of hot gas, as
          estimated  from  Chandra (Paper I). Only by taking into account
          both  sources of fuel can we constrain the true accretion rate,
          the  accretion  efficiency,  and  the power budget. Radiatively
          efficient  accretion  is  ruled  out,  for quiescent SMBHs. For
          typical  radiatively  inefficient  flows,  the  observed  X-ray
          luminosities  of  the SMBHs imply accretion fractions ~ 1 - 10%
          (ie,  ~  90 - 99% of the available gas does not reach the SMBH)
          for  at  least five of our six target galaxies, and most of the
          other   galaxies   with  known  SMBH  masses.  We  discuss  the
          conditions   for   mass   conservation  inside  the  sphere  of
          influence,  so  that  the  total  gas  injection is balanced by
          accretion  plus  outflows. We show that a fraction of the total
          accretion power (mechanical plus radiative) would be sufficient
          to  sustain  a self-regulating, slow outflow which removes from
          the  nuclear  region all the gas that does not sink into the BH
          (``BH  feedback'').  The  rest  of  the  accretion power may be
          carried  out  in  a jet, or advected. We also discuss scenarios
          that would lead to an intermittent nuclear activity.

          In   this   work   we   present  a  system  for  the  automatic

          Title: Common envelope evolution through planetary nebula eyes
          Authors: Orsola De Marco, Maxwell Moe
          Comments:  4  pages, one figure, proceedings of the 2005 Gdansk
          meeting PN as astronomical tools, in press
          The  common  envelope  interaction  is  responsible for evolved
          close  binaries.  Among them are a minority of central stars of
          planetary  nebula  (PN). Recent observational results, however,
          point to most PN actually being in binary systems. We therefore
          ask  the  question  if  it  is  feasible that most, or even all
          Galactic  PN  derive  from  a  common envelope interaction. Our
          recent  calculation finds that if all single and binary primary
          stars with mass between ~1-8 Mo eject a PN, there would be many
          more  PN  in  the  galaxy than observed. On the other hand, the
          predicted   number  of  post-common  envelope  PN  is  more  in
          agreement  with the total number of PN in the Galaxy. This is a
          new  indication that binary interactions play a functional role
          in the creation of PN and an encouragement to intensify efforts
          to detect binary companions.

          regions
          Authors: Sergey Mashchenko, H. M. P. Couchman, Alison Sills
          Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ApJ
          Using  a  large  set  of  high resolution numerical simulations
          incorporating  non-equilibrium molecular hydrogen chemistry and
          a  constant source of external radiation, we study gas collapse
          in   previously   photo-ionized   mini-galaxies   with   virial
          temperatures  less than 10^4 K in the early universe (redshifts
          z=10-20). We confirm that the mechanism of positive feedback of
          ionizing  radiation on star formation in mini-galaxies proposed
          by  Ricotti,  Gnedin, & Shull (2002) can be efficient despite a
          significant  flux of metagalactic photo-dissociating radiation.
          We  derive  critical  fluxes  for  the  Lyman-Werner background
          radiation   sufficient  to  prevent  the  collapse  of  gas  in
          mini-galaxies  as a function of the virial mass of the halo and
          redshift.  In  our  model,  the  formation  of mini-galaxies in
          defunct HII regions is most efficient at large redshifts (z>15)
          and/or  for  large local gas overdensity delta>10. We show that
          non-equilibrium chemistry plays an important dynamical role not
          only  during  the initial evolutionary phase leading to the gas
          becoming  gravitationally  unstable  inside  the mini-halo, but
          also  at the advanced stages of the core collapse, resulting in
          efficient  gas  accretion in the core region. We speculate on a
          possible connection between our objects and metal-poor globular
          clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

          should  emit  the  ~  10 MeV temperature blackbody radiation. If
          positron  e+  sources are producing about 10^{42} e+ s^{-1} near
          the  Galactic  Center  they  would annihilate on the way out and
          result  in  0.511 MeV emission. We suggest that the annihilation
          radiation can be an observational consequence of the interaction
          of  the  accretion  disk radiation of the SMall Mass Black Holes
          (SMMBHs)  with  X-ray  radiation in the Galactic Center. This is
          probably the only way to identify and observe these SMMBHs.

          Title:  A  Dynamical  Model  for  the Extra-planar Gas in Spiral
          Galaxies
          Authors: Filippo Fraternali, James Binney (University of Oxford)
          Comments:  19  pages,  20  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS. High resolution version available at this http URL
          Recent  HI observations reveal that the discs of spiral galaxies
          are surrounded by extended gaseous haloes. This extra-planar gas
          reaches  large  distances  (several kpc) from the disc and shows
          peculiar  kinematics (low rotation and inflow). We have modelled
          the  extra-planar  gas as a continuous flow of material from the
          disc  of a spiral galaxy into its halo region. The output of our
          models  are  pseudo-data  cubes that can be directly compared to
          the HI data. We have applied these models to two spiral galaxies
          (NGC891  and  NGC2403)  known  to  have  a substantial amount of
          extra-planar  gas.  Our  models are able to reproduce accurately
          the  vertical  distribution  of  extra-planar  gas for an energy
          input  corresponding  to  a  small  fraction (<4%) of the energy
          released  by  supernovae.  However  they  fail  in two important
          aspects: 1) they do not reproduce the right gradient in rotation
          velocity;  2) they predict a general outflow of the extra-planar
          gas, contrary to what is observed. We show that neither of these
          difficulties  can be removed if clouds are ionized and invisible
          at  21cm as they leave the disc but become visible at some point
          on  their  orbits. We speculate that these failures indicate the
          need  for  accreted material from the IGM that could provide the
          low angular momentum and inflow required.

          Comments: 10 pages, 6 colour figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of
          the  stellar  mass  of  bright  galaxies was already in place at
          $z>1$.  This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation
          because   massive  halos  are  assembled  late  in  hierarchical
          cosmologies  such  as  cold dark matter (CDM). In this paper, we
          discuss  a  new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model
          in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed
          to  quench  cooling  flows  in  massive  halos.  This  mechanism
          naturally  creates  a  break  in  the  local  galaxy  luminosity
          function  at  bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within
          the  Millennium  N-body  simulation;  the  accurate  dark matter
          merger  trees  and  large  number  of realizations of the galaxy
          formation process that the simulation provides results in highly
          accurate  statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical
          parameters  in the model by reference to the properties of local
          galaxies,  we  use it to investigate the evolution of the K-band
          luminosity  and galaxy stellar mass functions. We also calculate
          the  volume averaged star formation rate density of the Universe
          as  a  function  of  redshift  and  the  way  in  which  this is
          apportioned  amongst  galaxies  of  different  mass.  The  model
          robustly  predicts  a substantial population of massive galaxies
          out  to  redshift  $z\sim  5$  and a star formation rate density
          which  rises  with increasing redshift in objects of all masses.
          Although  observational data on these properties have been cited
          as  evidence for ``anti-hierarchical'' galaxy formation, we find
          that  when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally
          hierachical  CDM  model  provides  a  very  good  match to these
          observations.

astro-ph/0511293
          Our  X-ray  study of the nuclear activity in a new sample of six
          quiescent  early-type  galaxies, and in a larger sample from the
          literature,  confirmed  (Soria  et  al., Paper I) that the Bondi
          accretion rate of diffuse hot gas is not a good indicator of the
          supermassive black hole (SMBH) X-ray luminosity. Here we suggest
          that a more reliable estimate of the accretion rate must include
          the  gas released by the stellar population inside the sphere of
          influence  of  the  SMBH, in addition to the Bondi inflow of hot
          gas  across  that  surface.  We  use  optical surface-brightness
          profiles  to  estimate  the  mass-loss  rate  from  stars in the
          nuclear region: we show that for our sample of galaxies it is an
          order  of  magnitude  higher (~ 10^{-4} - 10^{-3} M_sun/yr) than
          the  Bondi  inflow  rate  of  hot gas, as estimated from Chandra
          (Paper  I). Only by taking into account both sources of fuel can
          we  constrain the true accretion rate, the accretion efficiency,
          and  the  power budget. Radiatively efficient accretion is ruled
          out,  for  quiescent  SMBHs. For typical radiatively inefficient
          flows,  the  observed  X-ray  luminosities  of  the  SMBHs imply
          accretion  fractions  ~ 1 - 10% (ie, ~ 90 - 99% of the available
          gas does not reach the SMBH) for at least five of our six target
          galaxies, and most of the other galaxies with known SMBH masses.
          We  discuss  the  conditions  for  mass  conservation inside the
          sphere of influence, so that the total gas injection is balanced
          by accretion plus outflows. We show that a fraction of the total
          accretion  power (mechanical plus radiative) would be sufficient
          to  sustain  a  self-regulating, slow outflow which removes from
          the  nuclear  region  all the gas that does not sink into the BH
          (``BH  feedback'').  The  rest  of  the  accretion  power may be
          carried  out  in  a  jet, or advected. We also discuss scenarios
          that would lead to an intermittent nuclear activity.

          In   this   work   we   present   a  system  for  the  automatic
          classification  of  the light curves of eclipsing binaries. This
          system is based on a classification scheme that aims to separate
          eclipsing   binary   sistems   according  to  their  geometrical
          configuration   in   a   modified  version  of  the  traditional
          classification  scheme.  The  classification  is  performed by a
          Bayesian   ensemble   of   neural  networks  trained  with  {\em
          Hipparcos}   data   of   seven  different  categories  including
          eccentric  binary systems and two types of pulsating light curve
          morphologies.

          Title: Common envelope evolution through planetary nebula eyes
          Authors: Orsola De Marco, Maxwell Moe
          Comments:  4  pages,  one figure, proceedings of the 2005 Gdansk
          meeting PN as astronomical tools, in press
          The common envelope interaction is responsible for evolved close
          binaries.  Among  them  are  a  minority  of  central  stars  of
          planetary  nebula  (PN).  Recent observational results, however,
          point  to most PN actually being in binary systems. We therefore
          ask  the  question  if  it  is  feasible  that most, or even all
          Galactic  PN  derive  from  a  common  envelope interaction. Our
          recent  calculation  finds that if all single and binary primary
          stars  with mass between ~1-8 Mo eject a PN, there would be many
          more  PN  in  the  galaxy  than observed. On the other hand, the
          predicted number of post-common envelope PN is more in agreement
          with  the  total  number  of  PN  in  the  Galaxy. This is a new
          indication  that  binary  interactions play a functional role in
          the  creation of PN and an encouragement to intensify efforts to
          detect binary companions.

          Title:  Formation  of  mini-galaxies in defunct cosmological HII
          regions
          Authors: Sergey Mashchenko, H. M. P. Couchman, Alison Sills
          Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ApJ
          Using  a  large  set  of  high  resolution numerical simulations
          incorporating non-equilibrium molecular hydrogen chemistry and a
          constant  source of external radiation, we study gas collapse in
          previously  photo-ionized mini-galaxies with virial temperatures
          less  than  10^4 K in the early universe (redshifts z=10-20). We
          confirm  that  the  mechanism  of  positive feedback of ionizing
          radiation   on  star  formation  in  mini-galaxies  proposed  by
          Ricotti,  Gnedin,  &  Shull  (2002)  can  be efficient despite a
          significant  flux  of metagalactic photo-dissociating radiation.
          We  derive  critical  fluxes  for  the  Lyman-Werner  background
          radiation   sufficient   to  prevent  the  collapse  of  gas  in
          mini-galaxies  as  a function of the virial mass of the halo and
          redshift.  In  our  model,  the  formation  of  mini-galaxies in
          defunct  HII regions is most efficient at large redshifts (z>15)
          and/or  for  large  local gas overdensity delta>10. We show that
          non-equilibrium  chemistry plays an important dynamical role not
          only  during  the  initial evolutionary phase leading to the gas
          becoming gravitationally unstable inside the mini-halo, but also
          at  the  advanced  stages  of  the  core  collapse, resulting in
          efficient  gas  accretion  in the core region. We speculate on a
          possible  connection between our objects and metal-poor globular
          clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

          Title:  The  Dynamical  Evolution  of  Black  Hole-Neutron Star
          Binaries in General Relativity: Simulations of Tidal Disruption
          Authors:  Joshua  A.  Faber,  Thomas  W.  Baumgarte,  Stuart L.

          PRD
          We  calculate  the  first dynamical evolutions of merging black
          hole-neutron  star  binaries  that construct the combined black
          hole-neutron   star   spacetime   in   a  general  relativistic
          framework.  We  treat  the  metric  in  the  conformal flatness
          approximation,   and   assume  that  the  black  hole  mass  is
          sufficiently large compared to that of the neutron star so that
          the  black  hole  remains  fixed  in  space. Using a spheroidal
          spectral methods solver, we solve the resulting field equations
          for  a  neutron  star  orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole. The
          matter  is  evolved  using a relativistic, Lagrangian, smoothed
          particle  hydrodynamics (SPH) treatment. We take as our initial
          data  recent  quasiequilibrium  models for synchronized neutron
          star   polytropes  generated  as  solutions  of  the  conformal
          thin-sandwich   (CTS)   decomposition  of  the  Einstein  field
          equations.  We  are able to construct from these models relaxed
          SPH  configurations whose profiles show good agreement with CTS
          solutions.  Our  adiabatic  evolution  calculations for neutron
          stars  with  low  compactness  show that mass transfer, when it
          begins  while  the  neutron  star  orbit  is  still outside the
          innermost  stable  circular  orbit,  is  more  unstable than is
          typically  predicted  by  analytical formalisms. This dynamical
          mass  loss  is found to be the driving force in determining the
          subsequent  evolution of the binary orbit and the neutron star,
          which  typically  disrupts  completely  within  a  few  orbital
          periods.  The  majority  of the mass transferred onto the black
          hole is accreted promptly; a significant fraction (~30%) of the
          mass  is  shed  outward  as  well,  some  of  which will become
          gravitationally unbound and ejected completely from the system.
          The  remaining portion forms an accretion disk around the black
          hole,  and  could  provide the energy source for short-duration
          gamma ray bursts.

          Comments:  16 pages, 4 color figures, one line figure. Accepted
          for March 2006 issue of Publ. Ast. Soc. Pacific
          We  present  the  software  tool  FITDisk, a precompiled-binary
          Windows  GUI  version  of  our  smoothed particle hydrodynamics
          cataclysmic  variable accretion disk research code. Cataclysmic
          variables  are  binary  star systems in which a compact stellar
          remnant, typically a white dwarf star, is stripping mass from a
          lower-main-sequence companion star by way of an accretion disk.
          Typically  the  disk  is the brightest component of the system,
          because the plasma is heated dramatically as it spirals down in
          the  gravitational  well  of  the primary white dwarf star. The
          shortest-period    systems   can   display   disk   "superhump"
          oscillations   driven  by  the  rotating  tidal  field  of  the
          secondary  star.  FITDisk models these accretion disk phenomena
          using  a fully three-dimensional hydrodynamics calculation, and
          data  can  be visualized as they are computed or stored to hard
          drive  for later playback at a fast frame rate. Simulations are
          visualized  using  OpenGL graphics and the viewing angle can be
          changed interactively. Pseudo light curves of simulated systems
          can  be  plotted  along  with  the associated Fourier amplitude
          spectrum.   FITDisk   is   available   for   free  download  at

          Title:  The  Evolution  of  the Water Distribution in a Viscous
          Protoplanetary Disk
          Authors: Fred J. Ciesla, Jeffrey N. Cuzzi
          Comments:  45  pages,  7  figures,  revised  for publication in
          Icarus
          (Abridged)    Astronomical   observations   have   shown   that
          protoplanetary  disks are dynamic objects through which mass is
          transported  and  accreted  by  the central star. Age dating of
          meteorite  constituents  shows  that their creation, evolution,
          and  accumulation occupied several Myr, and over this time disk
          properties   would  evolve  significantly.  Moreover,  on  this
          timescale,  solid  particles  decouple from the gas in the disk
          and their evolution follows a different path. Here we present a
          model  which tracks how the distribution of water changes in an
          evolving   disk   as   the   water-bearing  species  experience
          condensation,  accretion,  transport,  collisional destruction,
          and  vaporization.  Because solids are transported in a disk at
          different rates depending on their sizes, the motions will lead
          to  water  being  concentrated  in  some  regions of a disk and
          depleted  in  others.  These  enhancements  and  depletions are
          consistent  with  the conditions needed to explain some aspects
          of  the  chemistry  of  chondritic  meteorites and formation of
          giant  planets.  The  levels of concentration and depletion, as
          well  as  their  locations,  depend  strongly  on  the combined
          effects of the gaseous disk evolution, the formation of rapidly
          migrating  rubble, and the growth of immobile planetesimals. We
          present  examples  of  evolution  under  a  range  of plausible
          assumptions  and  demonstrate how the chemical evolution of the
          inner  region  of a protoplanetary disk is intimately connected
          to the physical processes which occur in the outer regions.

          Title:  Eddington-limited  X-ray Bursts as Distance Indicators.

          Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, accepted by ApJ
          We analyzed 123 thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts observed by
          the  Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer from the low-mass X-ray binary
          4U  1636-536.  All  but two of the 40 radius-exansion bursts in
          this sample reached peak fluxes which were normally distributed
          about  a  mean of 6.4e-8 ergs/cm^2/s, with a standard deviation
          of 7.6%. The remaining two radius-expansion bursts reached peak
          fluxes a factor of 1.69+/-0.13 lower than this mean value; as a
          consequence,  the  overall  variation  in  the peak flux of the
          radius-expansion  bursts  was a factor of ~2. This variation is
          comparable to the range of the Eddington limit between material
          with solar H-fraction (X=0.7) and pure He. Such a variation may
          arise  if,  for the bright radius-expansion bursts, most of the
          accreted  H  is  eliminated either by steady hot CNO burning or
          expelled  in a radiatively-driven wind. However, steady burning
          cannot  exhaust  the  accreted H for solar composition material
          within  the  typical  ~2  hr  burst recurrence time, nor can it
          result   in   sufficient   elemental  stratification  to  allow
          selective  ejection of the H only. An additional stratification
          mechanism  appears  to  be  required  to  separate the accreted
          elements  and thus allow preferential ejection of the hydrogen.
          We  found  no  evidence for a gap in the peak flux distribution
          between  the  radius-expansion and non-radius expansion bursts,
          previously observed in smaller samples. Assuming that the faint
          radius-expansion  bursts reached the Eddington limit for H-rich
          material (X~0.7), and the brighter bursts the limit for pure He
          (X=0), we estimate the distance to 4U 1636-536 (for a canonical
          neutron  star  with  M_NS=1.4M_sun, R_NS=10 km) to be 6.0+/-0.5
          kpc, or for M_NS=2M_sun at most 7.1 kpc. (Abstract abridged)

          Title:  Detection  of  the  Buried  AGN  in  NGC  6240 with the
          Infrared Spectrograph on The Spitzer Space Telescope

          Comments:  18 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in The
          Astrophysical Journal
          We  present  mid-infrared  spectra of the nearby, Ultraluminous
          Infrared  Galaxy  NGC  6240  taken with the IRS on Spitzer. The
          spectrum  of  NGC  6240  is  dominated by strong fine-structure
          lines,  rotational  H2 lines, and PAH emission features. The H2
          line fluxes suggest molecular gas at a variety of temperatures.
          A  simple  two-temperature  fit  to the S(0) through S(7) lines
          implies  a mass of 6.7E6 solar masses at T=957K and 1.6E9 solar
          masses  at T=164K, or about 15% of the total molecular gas mass
          in  this  system.  Noteably,  we  have  detected the [NeV] 14.3
          micron   emission  line,  with  a  flux  of  5E-14  erg/cm^2/s,
          providing  the  first direct detection of the buried AGN in the
          mid-infrared.   Modelling   of  the  total  SED  from  near  to
          far-infrared  wavelengths  requires  the presence of a hot dust
          (T=700K)  component,  which  we  also associate with the buried
          AGN.  The  small  [NeV]/[NeII]  and  [NeV]/IR  flux ratios, the
          relative  fraction  of  hot dust emission, as well as the large
          6.2  micron  PAH  EQW,  are all consistent with an apparent AGN
          contribution   of  only  3-5%  to  the  bolometric  luminosity.
          However,  correcting  the measured [NeV] flux by the extinction
          implied  by  the  silicate  optical  depth and our SED fitting,
          suggests  an  intrinsic  fractional  AGN  contribution  to  the
          bolometric  luminosity  of about 20-24% in NGC 6240, which lies
          within the range implied by fits to the hard X-ray spectrum.

          Title:  QPO  as  the Rosetta Stone for understanding black hole
          accretion
          Authors: Marek A. Abramowicz
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
          Journal-ref: Astronomische Nachrichten / AN 326, No. 9 (2005)
          Quasi  periodic  oscillations (QPO) seen in the X-ray fluxes of
          individual neutron stars and black hole sources are one of most
          intriguing phenomena in today's astrophysics. The QPO nature is
          visibly  determined by super-strong Einstein's gravity. I argue
          here  that  it also profoundly depends on the MRI turbulence in
          accretion  flows.  Understanding  the QPO physics may therefore
          guide accretion theory out of its present state of confusion.

          Title:  A  prominent  relativistic  iron  line in the Seyfert 1
          MCG-02-14-009
          Authors: Delphine Porquet
          Comments:  Accepted  for  publication,  A&A Letters, 5 pages, 3
          figures, and 1 table
          I  report  the  discovery of a prominent broad and asymmetrical
          feature  near  6.4 keV in the Seyfert 1 MCG-02-14-009 (z=0.028)
          with  XMM-Newton/EPIC.  The present short X-ray observation (PN
          net  exposure  time  ~5  ks)  is  the first one above 2 keV for
          MCG-02-14-009.  The  feature  can  be  explained  by  either  a
          relativistic   iron   line   around   either   a  Schwarzschild
          (non-rotating)  or a Kerr (rotating) black hole. If the feature
          is  a relativistic iron line around a Schwarzschild black hole,
          the  line  energy  is 6.51 (+0.21,-0.12) keV with an equivalent
          width  of  631 (+259,-243) eV and that the inclination angle of
          the   accretion   disc  should  be  less  than  43  degrees.  A
          relativistically  blurred  photoionized disc model gives a very
          good  spectral  fit over the broad band 0.2-12keV energy range.
          The  spectrum  is  reflection dominated and this would indicate
          that  the primary source in MCG-02-14-009 is located very close
          to  the black hole, where gravitational light bending effect is
          important  (about  3-4 Rg), and that the black hole may rapidly
          rotate.

          The  low mass X-ray binary system 4U 1812-12 was monitored with
          the  INTEGRAL  observatory  in  the  period  2003-2004 and with
          BeppoSAX  on April 20, 2000. We report here on the spectral and
          temporal  analysis  of  both persistent and burst emission. The
          full  data  set confirms the persistent nature of this burster,
          and  reveals  the  presence  of  emission  up  to  200 keV. The
          persistent  spectrum  is  well  described  by  a comptonization
          (CompTT)  model plus a soft blackbody component. The source was
          observed  in  a hard spectral state with a 1-200 keV luminosity
          of  2*10^(36)  ergs/s  and  L/LEdd~1%  and  no  meaningful flux
          variation  has  been revealed, as also confirmed by a 2004 RXTE
          observation.  We  have  also  detected  4 bursts showing double
          peaked profiles and blackbody spectra with temperatures ranging
          from 1.9 to 3.1 keV.

          Title:  Evolution  of Massive Blackhole Triples I -- Equal-mass
          binary-single systems
          Authors: Masaki Iwasawa, Yoko Funato, Junichiro Makino
          Comments: 20 pages, 12 figures
          We  present  the  result  of  $N$-body simulations of dynamical
          evolution  of triple massive blackhole (BH) systems in galactic
          nuclei.  We found that in most cases two of the three BHs merge
          through gravitational wave (GW) radiation in the timescale much
          shorter  than the Hubble time, before ejecting one BH through a
          slingshot.  In  order  for a binary BH to merge before ejecting
          out  the third one, it has to become highly eccentric since the
          gravitational  wave  timescale  would  be  much longer than the
          Hubble time unless the eccentricity is very high. We found that
          two  mechanisms  drive  the increase of the eccentricity of the
          binary.   One   is  the  strong  binary-single  BH  interaction
          resulting in the thermalization of the eccentricity. The second
          is  the  Kozai  mechanism which drives the cyclic change of the
          inclination  and  eccentricity  of the inner binary of a stable
          hierarchical  triple  system.  Our  result implies that many of
          supermassive blackholes are binaries.

          Title: Saturn's internal structure and carbon enrichment
          Authors: Olivier Mousis, Yann Alibert, Willy Benz
          Comments: accepted in A&A
          We  use  the clathrate hydrate trapping theory to calculate the
          enrichments  in  O,  N,  S,  Xe, Ar and Kr compared to solar in
          Saturn's  atmosphere.  For  this, we calibrate our calculations
          using  two different carbon abundance determinations that cover
          the  domain  of measurements published in the last decades: one
          derived   from   the   NASA   $Kuiper$   Airborne   Observatory
          measurements and the other obtained from the Cassini spacecraft
          observations.   We   show   that  these  two  different  carbon
          abundances  imply  quite  a  different  minimum  heavy  element
          content  for  Saturn.  Using  the  Kuiper  Airborne Observatory
          measurement  for  calibration,  the  amount of ices accreted by
          Saturn  is  found to be consistent with current interior models
          of   this   planet.  On  the  other  hand,  using  the  Cassini
          measurement  for  calibration  leads  to  an ice content in the
          planet's envelope which is higher than the one derived from the
          interior  models. In this latter case, reconciling the interior
          models  with the amount of C measured by the Cassini spacecraft
          requires  that  significant differential sedimentation of water
          and  volatile  species  have  taken  place in Saturn's interior
          during its lifetime.

          Title:    Models    of   Ultraluminous   X-Ray   Sources   with
          Intermediate-Mass Black Holes
          Authors:  N.  Madhusudhan, S. Justham, L. Nelson, B. Paxton, E.
          Pfahl, Ph. Podsiadlowski, S. Rappaport
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We   have  computed  models  for  ultraluminous  X-ray  sources
          ("ULXs")  consisting  of  a black-hole accretor of intermediate
          mass  ("IMBH"; e.g., ~1000 Msun) and a captured donor star. For
          each of four different sets of initial donor masses and orbital
          separations, we computed 30,000 binary evolution models using a
          full  Henyey  stellar  evolution code. To our knowledge this is
          the  first  time that a population of X-ray binaries this large
          has been carried out with other than approximation methods, and
          it  serves  to  demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to
          large-scale  population  studies  of mass-transfer binaries. In
          the  present  study,  we find that in order to have a plausible
          efficiency  for  producing active ULX systems with IMBHs having
          luminosities   >   10^{40}   ergs/sec,   there  are  two  basic
          requirements  for  the capture of companion/donor stars. First,
          the  donor stars should be massive, i.e., > 8 Msun. Second, the
          initial  orbital  separations, after circularization, should be
          close,  i.e., < 6-30 times the radius of the donor star when on
          the  main  sequence. Even under these optimistic conditions, we
          show  that  the  production  rate  of IMBH-ULX systems may fall
          short of the observed values by factors of 10-100.

          Title:  Discovery  and  disentangling  of  multi-mode delta-Sct
          pulsations in the eclipsing binary V994 Her
          Authors: S. Dallaporta, U. Munari
          Comments: submitted on Oct 27 to IBVS
          Accurate   and  extensive  photoelectric  photometry  has  been
          obtained  of  V994  Her  which  was  discovered as an eclipsing
          binary  by  Hipparcos satellite. A marked pulsation activity is
          evident   in   the   light-curve,   with  periods  0.152100488,
          0.116836079   and   0.09466580  day  that  appears  to  be  the
          contemporanous   presence  of  fundamental,  first  and  second
          overtone  periods  of  a  multi-mode  delta-Sct  pulsation. The
          latter is observed to remain stable in amplitude and phase over
          the whole observaing campaign that lasted between June 10, 2002

          Title:  Entropy  Profiles in the Cores of Cooling Flow Clusters
          of Galaxies
          Authors: Megan Donahue, Donald J. Horner, Kenneth W. Cavagnolo,
          G. Mark Voit
          Comments:  4 figures, as submitted to the Astrophysical Journal
          (except for a typo correction in the abstract)
          The  X-ray  properties  of  a  relaxed  cluster of galaxies are
          determined  primarily  by  its gravitational potential well and
          the  entropy distribution of its intracluster gas. That entropy
          distribution reflects both the accretion history of the cluster
          and  the  feedback  processes  which  limit the condensation of
          intracluster  gas.  Here we present Chandra observations of the
          core  entropy  profiles of nine classic "cooling-flow" clusters
          that appear relaxed and contain intracluster gas with a cooling
          time  less  than  a  Hubble  time.  We  show that those entropy
          profiles  are  remarkably  similar,  despite  the fact that the
          clusters  range  over  a  factor  of three in temperature. They
          typically  have  an  entropy level of ~ 130 keV cm^2 at 100 kpc
          that  declines  to  a  plateau ~10 keV cm^2 at \lesssim 10 kpc.
          Between  these  radii, the entropy profiles are \propto r^alpha
          with  alpha ~ 1.0 - 1.3. The non-zero central entropy levels in
          these   clusters   correspond  to  a  cooling  time  ~10^8  yr,
          suggesting  that  episodic  heating on this timescale maintains
          the central entropy profile in a quasi-steady state.

          Title: Lithium isotopes in population II dwarfs
          Authors: Laurent Piau
          Comments: 18 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables
          We  investigate  the history of $^6$Li and $^7$Li in population
          II  dwarfs  during the pre main sequence and main sequence. The
          evolution  is  followed  using  the  CESAM code and taking into
          account  the  most  recent  physics.  The effective temperature
          ranges  from $\approx$ 4700 K to $\approx$ 6400 K and therefore
          concerns  objects on the so-called Spite plateau and cooler. We
          find  the  $^7$Li  pre  main  sequence  depletion  is unable to
          account for the observations in the halo whatever the effective
          temperature.   This   supports  microscopic  diffusion  and  an
          additional  non  standard mixing process both acting during the
          main  sequence.  On  the  contrary  the  models $^6$Li pre main
          sequence   depletion  appears  too  strong  and  is  marginally
          compatible with recent detections.
          During the main sequence we introduce the effects of tachocline
          diffusion.  This  process  is  a  rotationnally  induced mixing
          acting  at  the  top  of  the  radiative core. We show that the
          differences  in  the  early  rotation  history cannot result in
          scattered lithium abundances on the Spite plateau. Moreover the
          tachocline  mixing  process  predicts $^7$Li abundances in good
          agreement   with  the  observations.  We  briefly  address  the
          question  of  turn off $^7$Li poor stars. A modest accretion of
          lithium  free  matter  would  be  enough  to  explain their low
          abundance in this element.
          We  expect  the  scatter  in $^7$Li abundances is correlated to
          variations  in  [Fe/O]  ratio  for  dwarfs  cooler than 5500 K.
          Finally  the  tachocline  mixing  is robust with respect to the
          recent  $^6$Li  observations  around the turn-off. We similarly
          suggest  the [Fe/O] should be higher in objects with $^6$Li and
          effective temperature below 6000 K.

          Many  EHB stars have been found in short-period binaries, where
          the companions in these post-common envelope systems are either
          white  dwarfs  or dM stars; these systems are catalogued as hot
          subdwarfs  because the subdwarf is the more luminous component.
          Hypothesized  Roche-lobe  overflow  systems  (with more massive
          companions) may largely be uncatalogued, since the G band or Ca
          II  K-line  from  the  companion  may  have  caused  them to be
          overlooked  or discarded. In particular, many candidate objects
          were excluded from the PG catalog because of such spectroscopic
          indicators.  Could  these  rejects  include  large  numbers  of
          "missing"  hot  subdwarfs?  We  have  examined 2MASS, SDSS, and
          GALEX  archival data for large subsets of these rejected stars,
          and conclude that only a handful (about 3%) show indications of
          binarity; most are consistent with (single) metal-poor F stars,
          as was originally supposed.

          Astronomy
          We  present  the results of a study of the late-type companions
          in  hot  subdwarf composite spectrum binaries. The exact nature
          of   these  late-type  companions  has  been  disputed  in  the
          literature -- some argue that they are main sequence stars, and
          others  have  claimed  they  are  subgiants.  To  determine the
          properties  of  the  late-type companions, we first conducted a
          survey  utilizing the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) All-Sky
          Data  Release Catalog to identify composite-colored binaries in
          the  "Catalogue  of Spectroscopically Identified Hot Subdwarfs"
          (Kilkenny,  Heber,  & Drilling 1988, 1992). We then conducted a
          spectroscopic    study   of   a   sub-sample   of   the   2MASS
          composite-colored   hot   subdwarfs.  The  sample  consists  of
          photometrically  and spectroscopically single and composite hot
          subdwarfs  (14  single  and  51  composite).  We  also obtained
          spectra  of 59 single late-type stars with Hipparcos parallaxes
          for calibration. We used measured equivalent width (EW) indices
          from  the  composite  systems  to  estimate the temperature and
          gravity of the late-type star, taking into account the dilution
          of  its  spectral  features  by  light  from  the hot subdwarf.
          Results from combining the spectroscopic data with model energy
          distributions   indicate   that  the  late-type  companions  in
          composite-spectrum  systems are best described by main sequence
          companions overall.

          Authors: Martin Bojowald, Aureliano Skirzewski
          Comments: 29 pages
          Subj-class: Mathematical Physics
          In  many  situations,  one  can  approximate  the behavior of a
          quantum  system,  i.e.  a  wave  function  subject to a partial
          differential  equation,  by effective classical equations which
          are  ordinary  differential  equations.  A  general  method and
          geometrical  picture  is  developed  and  shown  to  agree with
          effective   action   results,  commonly  derived  through  path
          integration,  for  perturbations  around  a harmonic oscillator
          ground  state.  The same methods are used to describe dynamical
          coherent states, which in turn provide means to compute quantum
          corrections to the symplectic structure of an effective system.

          Title:  Wind  accretion in the massive X-ray binary 4U 2206+54:
          abnormally slow wind and moderately eccentric orbit
          Authors:  M.  Ribo,  I.  Negueruela, P. Blay, J.M. Torrejon, P.
          Reig
          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A
          Massive  X-ray binaries are usually classified depending on the
          properties  of  the  donor star in classical, supergiant and Be
          X-ray  binaries.  The  massive X-ray binary 4U 2206+54 does not
          fit  in  any  of these groups, and deserves a detailed study to
          understand  how  the transfer of matter and the accretion on to
          the  compact  object  take  place.  To this end we study an IUE
          spectrum  of  the  donor  and  obtain  a wind terminal velocity
          (v_inf) of ~350 km/s, which is abnormally slow for its spectral
          type.  We  also  analyse  here  more  than 9 years of available
          RXTE/ASM  data. We study the long-term X-ray variability of the
          source  and  find  it  to  be  similar  to that observed in the
          wind-fed  supergiant system Vela X-1, reinforcing the idea that
          4U  2206+54  is  also a wind-fed system. We find a quasi-period
          decreasing  from  ~270 to ~130 d, noticed in previous works but
          never  studied  in  detail.  We  discuss possible scenarios and
          conclude   that  long-term  quasi-periodic  variations  in  the
          mass-loss  rate  of  the  primary  are  probably  driving  such
          variability  in  the measured X-ray flux. We obtain an improved
          orbital  period  of  9.5591  d  with  maximum X-ray flux at MJD
          51856.6.  Our  study  of  the  orbital X-ray variability in the
          context  of  wind  accretion  suggests  a moderate eccentricity
          around  0.15.  Moreover,  the  low  value  of  v_inf solves the
          long-standing  problem  of the relatively high X-ray luminosity
          for  the  unevolved  nature of the donor, BD +53 2790, which is
          probably  an  O9.5 V star. We note that changes in v_inf and/or
          the  mass-loss  rate  of  the  primary alone cannot explain the
          diferent  patterns  displayed by the orbital X-ray variability.
          We  finally  emphasize  that 4U 2206+54, together with LS 5039,
          could  be  part of a new population of wind-fed HMXBs with main
          sequence  donors,  the  natural progenitors of supergiant X-ray
          binaries. (Abridged)

          We  present  optical  long-slit  spectra  of  the  Virgo  dwarf
          elliptical   galaxy  VCC  510  at  high  spectral  and  spatial
          resolution. Heliocentric velocities and velocity dispersions as
          functions   of   galaxy  radius  are  derived  by  deconvolving
          line-of-sight   velocity   distributions.  A  maximum  rotation
          v_rot=8  km/s  inside  half the effective radius (re~20 arcsec)
          and a mean, radially flat velocity dispersion sigma=44 km/s are
          measured.  The core extending over the inner 2 arcsec (~140 pc)
          is  found  to  rotate  in the opposite sense with v_rot(core) ~
          -1/2  v_rot.  VCC  510  (M_B  ~  -15.7) is therefore by far the
          faintest  and  smallest  galaxy  with  a  counter-rotating core
          known.  From the main body rotation and the velocity dispersion
          profile  we  deduce that VCC 510 is anisotropic and clearly not
          entirely   supported   by   rotation.  By  comparison  of  Lick
          absorption-line  indices  with  stellar  population  models  we
          derive  an  old  luminosity-weighted age (10 Gyr) and sub-solar
          metallicity  ([Z/H]=-0.4) inside the effective radius. There is
          tentative  evidence  that  the  counter-rotating  core might be
          younger and less alpha/Fe enhanced. From the stellar population
          parameters  we  obtain  a  total stellar mass-to-light ratio of
          ~3.6  (M/L_B)_sun  which  is  significantly  lower than a rough
          dynamical  estimate  obtained  from  the kinematics through the
          virial   theorem  (~15).  This  discrepancy  hints  toward  the
          possible  presence  of dark matter in the centre of VCC 510. We
          discuss  the  origin  of  the counter-rotating core and exclude
          fly-by  encounters  as  a  viable possibility. Gas accretion or
          galaxy  merging  provide  more  likely explanations. VCC 510 is
          therefore the direct observational evidence that such processes
          do occur in cluster satellite galaxies on dwarf galaxy scales.

          Title:  The  Highest Dynamical Frequency in the Inner Region of
          an Accretion Disk
          Authors:  M.  Ali Alpar (Sabanci University), Dimitrios Psaltis
          (U. of Arizona)
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJ Letters
          In the inner regions of accretion disks around compact objects,
          the  orbital  frequency  of  the  gas  deviates  from the local
          Keplerian  value. For long-wavelength modes in this region, the
          radial  epicyclic  frequency kappa is higher than the azimuthal
          frequency  Omega.  This has significant implications for models
          of the twin kHz QPOs observed in many neutron-star sources that
          traditionally identify the frequencies of the two kHz QPOs with
          dynamical  frequencies  in  the accretion disk. The recognition
          that the highest frequency in the transition or boundary region
          of  the  disk is actually the epicyclic frequency also modifies
          significantly  the  constraints  imposed  by the observation of
          high-frequency  QPOs  on  the  mass  and  radius of the compact
          objects.

          Astrophysical Journal
          We  present  a photometric search for objects with point-source
          components   that  are  optically  variable  on  timescales  of
          weeks--months   in  the  Hubble  Ultra  Deep  Field  (HUDF)  to
          i'(AB)=28.0  mag.  The  data  are split into four sub-stacks of
          approximately  equal  exposure  times.  Objects  exhibiting the
          signature  of  optical variability are selected by studying the
          photometric  error  distribution  between  the  four  different
          epochs, and selecting 622 candidates as 3.0 sigma outliers from
          the original catalog of 4644 objects. Of these, 45 are visually
          confirmed  as  free  of  contamination  from close neighbors or
          various  types of image defects. Four lie within the positional
          error  boxes  of  Chandra  X-ray  sources, and two of these are
          spectroscopically   confirmed  AGN.  The  photometric  redshift
          distribution  of  the  selected  variable sample is compared to
          that of field galaxies, and we find that a constant fraction of
          ~1%  of  all  field  objects show variability over the range of
          0.1<z<4.5.  Combined with other recent HUDF results, as well as
          those  of  recent  state-of-the-art  numerical  simulations, we
          discuss  a  potential  link between the hierarchical merging of
          galaxies and the growth of AGN.

          Title:  First  Detection of PAHs and Warm Molecular Hydrogen in
          Tidal Dwarf Galaxies
          Authors: S. J. U. Higdon, J. L. Higdon, J. Marshall
          Comments: Accepted ApJ. 30 pages 14 figures
          We  observed  two  faint tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs), NGC 5291N
          and  NGC  5291  S with the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer
          Space   Telescope.   We   detect   strong  polycyclic  aromatic
          hydrocarbon  (PAH)  emission,  which  match models of groups of
          \~100 carbon atoms with an equal mixture of neutral and ionized
          PAHs.  The  TDGs  have a dominant warm ~140 K dust component in
          marked  contrast to the cooler, 40-60 K dust found in starburst
          galaxies.  For  the  first  time we detect the low-J rotational
          lines  from  molecular  hydrogen.  Adopting  LTE there is ~10^5
          solar  masses  of  ~400  K gas, which is <0.1 % of the cold gas
          mass.  The  combination  of  one-third solar metallicity with a
          recent, <5 million year, epsiode of star formation is reflected
          in  the  S and Ne ratios. The excitation is higher than typical
          values  for  starburst  galaxies  and  similar to that found in
          BCDs.  Using the Infared Array Camera we identify an additional
          13  PAH-rich  candidate  TDGs.  These sources occupy a distinct
          region of IRAC color space with [3.6] - [4.5] < 0.4 and [4.5] -
          [8.0]  >  3.2. NGC 5291 N and S have stellar masses of (1.5 and
          3.0)  10^8  solar  masses,  which  is  comparable to BCDs. This
          system appears to be a remarkable TDG nursery.

          Astrophysical Journal
          In  the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) an abundance of galaxies
          is  seen  with  a  knot  at  one  end  plus  an  extended tail,
          resembling   a   tadpole.   These   "tadpole  galaxies"  appear
          dynamically   unrelaxed--presumably   in   an   early   merging
          state--where  tidal  interactions  likely created the distorted
          knot-plus-tail   morphology.   Here  we  systematically  select
          tadpole  galaxies from the HUDF and study their properties as a
          function  of  their  photometric redshifts. In a companion HUDF
          variability  study,  Cohen et al. (2005) revealed a total of 45
          variable  objects  believed to be Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
          Here we show that this faint AGN sample has no overlap with the
          tadpole  galaxy  sample,  as predicted by theoretical work. The
          tadpole  morphology--combined with the lack of overlap with the
          variable  objects--supports the idea that these galaxies are in
          the  process  of  an early-stage merger event, i.e., at a stage
          that likely precedes the "turn-on" of any AGN component and the
          onset of any point-source variability.

          Title:  Connecting  Dense  Gas Tracers of Star Formation in our

          Authors:  Jingwen  Wu,  Neal  J.  Evans  II,  Yu Gao, Philip M.
          Solomon, Yancy L. Shirley, Paul A. Vanden Bout
          Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures. In press for ApJ Letters
          Observations have revealed prodigious amounts of star formation
          in starburst galaxies as traced by dust and molecular emission,
          even at large redshifts. Recent work shows that for both nearby
          spiral   galaxies  and  distant  starbursts,  the  global  star
          formation  rate, as indicated by the infrared luminosity, has a
          tight  and  almost  linear correlation with the amount of dense
          gas as traced by the luminosity of HCN. Our surveys of Galactic
          dense  cores  in  HCN  1-0  emission show that this correlation
          continues  to  a much smaller scale, with nearly the same ratio
          of  infrared luminosity to HCN luminosity found over 7-8 orders
          of magnitude in L_IR, with a lower cutoff around 10^{4.5} L_sun
          of infrared luminosity. The linear correlation suggests that we
          may  understand  distant  star  formation in terms of the known
          properties  of local star-forming regions. Both the correlation
          and the luminosity cutoff can be explained if the basic unit of
          star  formation  in  galaxies is a dense core, similar to those
          studied in our Galaxy.

          We present long-slit H- and K-band spectroscopy of the low-mass
          outflow  source  SVS  13,  obtained  with  the  adaptive-optics
          assisted  imager-spectrometer  NACO  on the VLT. With a spatial
          resolution  of  < 0.25 arcsec and a pixel scale of 0.027 arcsec
          we  precisely establish the relative offsets of H2, [FeII], CO,
          HI  and  NaI  components  from the source continuum. The H2 and
          [FeII] peaks are clearly associated with the jet, while the CO,
          HI  and  NaI peaks are spatially unresolved and coincident with
          the  source,  as  is  expected  for  emission  associated  with
          accretion  processes. The H2 profile along the slit is resolved
          into   multiple  components,  which  increase  in  size  though
          decrease in intensity with distance from the source. This trend
          might  be  consistent  with thermal expansion of packets of gas
          ejected during periods of increased accretion activity. Indeed,
          for  the  brightest component nearest the source, proper motion
          measurements   indicate   a   tangential   velocity   of  0.028
          arcsec/year.  It  therefore  seems  unlikely that this emission
          peak  is  associated  with a stationary zone of warm gas at the
          base  of  the  jet.  However,  the same can not be said for the
          [FeII]  peak, for which we see no evidence for motion downwind,
          even  though  radial  velocity  measurements  indicate that the
          emission is associated with higher jet velocities. We postulate
          that the [FeII] could be associated with a collimation shock at
          the base of the jet.

          Astrofisica de Canarias, Tenerife)
          Comments:  23  pages,  20  figures. Accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We  describe  improved  modelling  of the emission by dust in a
          toroidal--like  structure  heated  by  a  central  illuminating
          source  within  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We chose a simple
          but  realistic  torus geometry, a flared disc, and a dust grain
          distribution  function  including  a full range of grain sizes.
          The optical depth within the torus is computed in detail taking
          into  account  the  different  sublimation  temperatures of the
          silicate  and graphite grains, which solves previously reported
          inconsistencies in the silicate emission feature in type-1 AGN.
          We   exploit   this   model   to   study  the  spectral  energy
          distributions  (SEDs)  of  58  extragalactic  (both  type-1 and
          type-2)  sources using archival optical and infrared (IR) data.
          We  find  that  both  AGN and starburst contributions are often
          required  to  reproduce  the  observed  SEDs, although in a few
          cases  they  are  very well fitted by a pure AGN component. The
          AGN contribution to the far-IR luminosity is found to be higher
          in  type-1 sources, with all the type-2 requiring a substantial
          contribution  from  a  circum-nuclear  starburst.  Our  results
          appear  in  agreement  with  the  AGN Unified Scheme, since the
          distributions of key parameters of the torus models turn out to
          be compatible for type-1 and type-2 AGN. Further support to the
          unification     concept     comes    from    comparison    with
          medium-resolution  IR  spectra  of  type-1  AGN  by the Spitzer

          We  report  on observations of the X-ray pulsar IGR J16320-4751
          (a.k.a. AX J1631.9-4752) performed simultaneously with INTEGRAL
          and  XMM-Newton. We refine the source position and identify the
          most  likely  infrared  counterpart.  Our simultaneous coverage
          allows  us to confirm the presence of X-ray pulsations at ~1300
          s,  that  we  detect  above  20 keV with INTEGRAL for the first
          time. The pulse fraction is consistent with being constant with
          energy,  which is compatible with a model of polar accretion by
          a  pulsar.  We study the spectral properties of IGR J16320-4751
          during  two  major  periods  occurring  during the simultaneous
          coverage  with  both satellites, namely a flare and a non-flare
          period. We detect the presence of a narrow 6.4 keV iron line in
          both  periods.  The  presence  of  such a feature is typical of
          supergiant  wind  accretors  such  as  Vela X-1 or GX 301-2. We
          inspect the spectral variations with respect to the pulse phase
          during  the non-flare period, and show that the pulse is solely
          due  to  variations of the X-ray flux emitted by the source and
          not to variations of the spectral parameters.
          Our  results  are  therefore compatible with the source being a
          pulsar  in  a  High  Mass X-ray Binary. We detect a soft excess
          appearing  in  the spectra as a blackbody with a temperature of
          ~0.07  keV.  We discuss the origin of the X-ray emission in IGR
          J16320-4751:  while  the  hard  X-rays are likely the result of
          Compton  emission produced in the close vicinity of the pulsar,
          based  on  energy  argument  we suggest that the soft excess is
          likely the emission by a collisionally energised cloud in which
          the compact object is embedded.

          Title:  Masses  and  Radii  of  Low-Mass  Stars:  Theory versus
          Observations
          Authors: Ignasi Ribas (CSIC, IEEC, Spain)
          Comments:  8 pages, 1 figure, proceedings of the meeting "Close
          Binaries in the 21st Century"
          Eclipsing  binaries  with  M-type  components  are  still  rare
          objects.  Strong observational biases have made that today only
          a  few  eclipsing binaries with component masses below 0.6 Msun
          and  well-determined fundamental properties are known. However,
          even  in  these  small  numbers  the detailed comparison of the
          observed  masses  and  radii  with  theoretical predictions has
          revealed  large  disagreements.  Current models seem to predict
          radii  of  stars  in  the  0.4-0.8  Msun range to be some 5-15%
          smaller than observed. Given the high accuracy of the empirical
          measurements  (a  few  percent  in both mass and radius), these
          differences   are   highly   significant.   I  review  all  the
          observational  evidence  on  the properties of M-type stars and
          discuss  a  possible  scenario  based  on  stellar  activity to
          explain the observed discrepancies.

          Conference on "Astrophysics of Variable Stars"
          Binary  systems  have  long  been  recognized  as the source of
          powerful astrophysical diagnostics. Among the many applications
          of  binary  stars,  they  have  been  used as probes of stellar
          structure  and evolution (both of single and binary stars) in a
          broad  range  of  masses,  evolutionary  stages,  and  chemical
          compositions,  and as indicators of distance and time. With the
          numerous   ongoing   photometric  surveys  and  upcoming  space
          astrometry  and  photometry  missions,  the  future of binaries
          looks    bright.   The   various   aspects   of   binaries   as
          astrophysically  useful  laboratories  are  reviewed here, with
          emphasis   on   the   currently   open  problems  and  research
          opportunities.

          We  use  the  very deep XMM-Newton observations in the CDF-S to
          measure  the  distribution of absorption in the AGN population.
          We describe the Monte Carlo method used to unveil the intrinsic
          properties of the AGN using their multi-band X-ray colours. The
          measured  distribution  of  AGN  in  z,  L_X  and  N_H space is
          compared  with  the distributions predicted by a number of XLFs
          and  absorption models. In contrast to other studies, we do not
          find any evidence that the absorption distribution is dependent
          on redshift or intrinsic luminosity.

          In  the  recent  literature  on AGNs it has been often reported
          that  spectra  of  Seyfert  1 Galaxies show resonant absorption
          lines  of  Fe  K  which  are  redshifted  from  the  rest frame
          position. Such lines are often found with marginal significance
          but,  if  real,  could potentially open up new avenues to study
          the circumnuclear gas in the black hole environment. It is also
          extremely important to take them into account in X-ray spectral
          analysis  because  of  the  influence  they have in the correct
          estimation  of  spectral parameters, Fe K alpha line in primis.
          An XMM-Newton observation of Mrk 335 is reported here as a case
          study: a narrow feature has been detected at 5.9 keV, i.e. with
          a   redshift   corresponding  to  a  velocity  of  v  ~  0.15c.
          Preliminary  results  on the statistical significance of narrow
          absorption  and  emission lines in a sample of PG QSOs observed
          by XMM-Newton are also included.

          Metallicity:  Mass Loss, Explosions, Cosmology, Lamers, Langer,
          Nugis, Annuk (eds.), ASP Conf. Ser
          At  very  low metallicity, the effects of differential rotation
          have  a more important impact on the evolution of stars than at
          high  metallicity. Rotational mixing leads to the production of
          great  quantities  of helium and of primary $^{14}$N by massive
          stars. Rotation induces important mass loss and allows stars to
          locally   strongly   enrich  the  interstellar  medium  in  CNO
          elements. Stars formed from interstellar clouds enriched by the
          winds  of  fast  rotating  massive  stars would present surface
          abundances  similar  to  those  of  C-rich extremely metal-poor
          stars.  C-rich  stars can also be formed by mass accretion in a
          binary  system  where  the  primary  would  be  a fast rotating
          intermediate  mass  star  in the early-AGB phase. Fast rotation
          may  also  lead to the formation of collapsars even at very low
          metallicity  and  make  the  most  massive stars avoid the pair
          instability.

          Gamma  ray bursts (GRBs) belong to the most energetic events in
          the  Universe.  Recently,  the  extragalactic  nature  of these
          sources  has  been confirmed with the discovery of several host
          galaxies  (HGs)  and  the  measurement  of  their redshifts. To
          explain  the  origin of GRBs several models have been proposed,
          among   which  the  coalescence  of  compact  objects  and  the
          hypernova (or collapsar) scenarios are the most representative,
          being  the collapsar model one of the most accepted nowadays. A
          natural  consequence  of  the  collapsar model is that the GRBs
          would trace the star formation rate (SFR) of their HGs. In this
          contributed   paper  we  present  preliminary  results  of  the
          development  of  a  Montecarlo-based  model for hypernova event
          formation    which    is   coupled   to   chemical-cosmological
          simulations, with the aim at studying the GRB relationship with
          the  SFR  cosmic  history  and the properties of their HGs in a
          hierarchical scenario.

          Physics
          The  most precise measurements are done at present by timing of
          radiopulsars  in  binary  systems  with  two neutron stars. The
          timing  measurements  of  the Taylor-Hulse pulsar give the most
          precise  results on testing of general relativity (GR), finding
          implicit  proof  of  existence  of gravitational waves. We show
          that   the   existing   measurements,  used  for  checking  the
          variability  of the fundamental constants, give the upper limit
          for   the   variation  of  the  gravitational  constant  ${\dot
          G}/{G}=(4.3\pm   4.9)\cdot   10^{-12}$   year{$^{-1}$}.  Timing
          measurements  of  the  binary  pulsar  J0737-3039  undoubtfully
          should give more precise results in the nearest future.

          Title: An Explanation for the soft X-ray excess in AGN
          Authors: J Crummy, AC Fabian, L Gallo, RR Ross
          Comments: 16 pages, MNRAS accepted
          We  present  a  large  sample  of type 1 active galactic nuclei
          (AGN) spectra taken with XMM-Newton, and fit them with both the
          conventional  model  (a  power  law  and  black  body)  and the
          relativistically-blurred  photoionized disc reflection model of
          Ross  and Fabian (2005). We find the disc reflection model is a
          better  fit.  The disc reflection model successfully reproduces
          the  continuum  shape,  including  the  soft excess, of all the
          sources.  The  model  also  reproduces many features that would
          conventionally  be interpreted as absorption edges. We are able
          to  use  the  model  to  infer  the  properties of the sources;
          specifically that the majority of black holes in the sample are
          strongly  rotating  and that there is a deficit in sources with
          an  inclination  >  70  degrees.  We  conclude  that  the  disc
          reflection model is an important tool in the study of AGN X-ray
          spectra.

          We  report  the first significant detection of an X-ray cluster
          associated  with  a  powerful (L(bol) ~1e47 erg/sec) radio-loud
          quasar  at  high  redshift  (z=1.06). Diffuse X-ray emission is
          detected  out  to ~120 kpc from the CSS quasar 3C 186. A strong
          Fe-line  emission  at  the  z(rest)=1.06  confirms  its thermal
          nature.   We   find   that  the  CSS  radio  source  is  highly
          overpressured  with  respect  to  the thermal cluster medium by
          ~2-3  orders  of  magnitude. This provides direct observational
          evidence  that  the  radio  source is not thermally confined as
          posited   in  the  ``frustrated''  scenario  for  CSS  sources.
          Instead, the radio source may be young and at an early stage of
          its  evolution. This source provides the first detection of the
          AGN  in  outburst  in  the  center  of  a cooling flow cluster.
          Powerful  radio  sources  are  thought  to  be triggered by the
          cooling   flows.   The   evidence  for  the  AGN  activity  and
          intermittent  outbursts  comes from the X-ray morphology of low
          redshift  clusters, which usually do not harbour quasars. 3C186
          is a young active radio source which can supply the energy into
          the  cluster  and  potentially  prevent its cooling. We discuss
          energetics  related  to  the  quasar  activity  and the cluster
          cooling  flow, and possible feedback between the evolving radio
          source and the cluster.

          Comments:   30  pages,  12  figures,  6  tables,  accepted  for
          publication in the Astronomical Journal
          We  present  new  radial  velocity results for 178 stars in the
          Fornax  dwarf  spheroidal  galaxy,  of  which  at least 158 are
          probable  Fornax  members. We combine with previously published
          data  to  obtain  a  radial  velocity sample with 209 stars, of
          which  at  least 179 are probable Fornax members. We detect the
          hint  of  rotation  about  an  axis near Fornax's morphological
          minor  axis,  though the significance of the rotation signal in
          the Galactocentric rest frame is sensitive to the adopted value
          of  Fornax's  proper  motion.  Regardless, the observed stellar
          kinematics  are dominated by random motions, and we do not find
          kinematic  evidence of tidal disruption. The projected velocity
          dispersion  profile of the binned dataset remains flat over the
          sampled  region,  which  reaches a maximum angular radius of 65
          arcmin.  Single-component  King  models  in  which mass follows
          light  fail  to reproduce the observed flatness of the velocity
          dispersion  profile.  Two-component (luminous plus dark matter)
          models  can  reproduce  the  data,  provided the dark component
          extends  sufficiently  beyond  the  luminous component, and the
          central dark matter density is of the same order as the central
          luminous  density.  These  requirements suggest a more massive,
          darker   Fornax   than   standard  core-fitting  analyses  have
          previously  concluded,  with  M/L_V  over  the  sampled  region
          reaching 10 to 40 times the M/L_V of the luminous component. We
          also   apply   a   non-parametric  mass  estimation  technique,
          introduced  in  a  companion  paper.  Though  it is designed to
          operate  on  datasets  containing velocities for $>$1000 stars,
          the estimation yields preliminary results suggesting M/L_V ~ 15
          inside r < 1.5 kpc.

          period,  have  been  found  during the superoutburst and may be
          positive  superhumps.  A  maximum  trough-to-peak  amplitude of
          around 0.3 magnitude is determined for this superhump.
          The  spectra  show  broad,  absorption-line profiles. The lines
          display  blue  and  red  troughs  which alternate in depth. The
          radial  velocity  curve of the absorption wings of H$\beta$ has
          an  amplitude  of  $40\pm11$  km s$^{-1}$ and a phase offset of
          $0.12\pm0.03$.  The  $\gamma$ velocity of the binary is $3\pm9$
          km  s$^{-1}$  and varies on an order of 50 km s$^{-1}$ from day
          to  day. From another clear evidence for a precessing eccentric
          disk,   we  obtain  a  solution  to  an  eccentric  outer  disk
          consistent  with  theoretical  works,  which  demonstrates  the
          validity  of the relation between superhumps and tidal effects.
          The  inner  part  of the disk is also eccentric as evidenced by
          asymmetric  and  symmetric  wings  in the lines. Therefore, the
          whole  disk is eccentric and the variation of $\gamma$ velocity
          and   the   evolutionary  asymmetric  line  profiles  could  be
          criterions for an precessing eccentric accretion disk.

          Title: X-ray source populations in galaxies
          Authors: G. Fabbiano
          Comments: 40 pages. This is a review submitted to Annual Review
          of  Astronomy  &  Astrophysics Comments are welcome and will be
          considered in a revised version
          Today's sensitive, high-resolution X-ray observations allow the
          study  of populations of X-ray sources, in the luminosity range
          of  Galactic  X-ray  binaries,  in galaxies as distant as 20-30
          Mpc. The traditional astronomical tools of photometric diagrams
          and  luminosity functions are now applied to these populations,
          providing  a  direct  probe  of the evolved binary component of
          different   stellar   populations.   The  study  of  the  X-ray
          populations of E and S0 galaxies has revamped the debate on the
          formation  and evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and
          on  the  role  of  globular  clusters in these processes. While
          overall stellar mass drives the amount of X-ray binaries in old
          stellar  populations,  the  amount  of  sources in star forming
          galaxies  is  related  to the star formation rate. Short-lived,
          luminous,  high-mass  binaries  (HMXBs)  dominate  these  young
          populations. The most luminous sources in these systems are the
          debated  ULXs,  which  have been suggested to be ~100-1000 Msol
          black  holes,  but  could  alternatively  include  a  number of
          binaries  with stellar mass black holes. Very soft sources have
          also  been  discovered  in  many  galaxies  and their nature is
          currently  being  debated.  Observations of the deep X-ray sky,
          and  comparison  with  deep  optical surveys, are providing the
          first evidence of the X-ray evolution of galaxies.

          Title:  Circular  Polarimetry  and  the Line of Sight to the BN
          Object
          Authors: D.K. Aitken, J.H. Hough, A. Chrysostomou
          Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures, accepted for MNRAS
          The  3.1  micron  absorption  feature  of  water-ice  has  been
          observed  spectroscopically  in many molecular clouds and, when
          it  has been observed spectropolarimetrically, usually a corre-
          sponding  polarization  feature  is  seen.  Typically  on these
          occasions,  and  particularly  for  the  BN  object, a distinct
          position angle shift between the feature and continuum is seen,
          which  indicates both a fractionation of the icy material and a
          changing alignment direction along the line of sight.
          Here  the  dependence  of circular polarimetry on fractionation
          along  the  line  of sight is investigated and it is shown that
          the  form  of  its  spectrum,  together  with  the  sign of the
          position  angle  shift, indicates where along the line of sight
          the  icy material lies. More specifically a coincidence between
          the sign of the position angle displacement in the ice feature,
          measured   north   through  east,  and  that  of  the  circular
          polarization ice feature means that the icy grains are overlaid
          by bare grains. Some preliminary circular polarimetry of BN has
          this  characteristic  and  a  similar situation is found in the
          only  two  other  cases  for which relevant observations so far
          exist.

          Title: The faintest accretors
          Authors: Andrew King, Rudy Wijnands
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS Letter
          Recent  X-ray  observations have detected a class of very faint
          X-ray   transients  in  the  Galaxy  which  probably  reveal  a
          previously  unrecognised  type of accretion on to neutron stars
          or  black  holes.  We  show  that  these  systems  cannot  have
          descended  from binaries with stellar-mass components of normal
          composition.   Accretion  of  hydrogen-depleted  matter  on  to
          stellar-mass  black  holes  can account for individual systems,
          but requires that these transients should be observed to repeat
          within  a  few  years,  and  does  not explain why the class is
          distinctly faint.
          Two  other explanations appear to be quite natural. One invokes
          accretion  by  neutron  stars  or stellar-mass black holes from
          companions  which were already brown dwarfs or planets when the
          systems formed, i.e. which did not descend from low-mass stars.
          The  other  possibility is that these systems are the endpoints
          of  primordial (zero-metallicity) binaries in which the primary
          was  extremely massive, and collapsed to a black hole of mass >
          1000  solar masses. The (primordial) companion must by now have
          reached  an  extremely  low  mass  (<  0.01  solar mass) and be
          transferring  mass  at  a very low rate to the black hole. This
          picture  avoids  the  main  difficulty  encountered  by  models
          invoking    intermediate-mass    black    hole   formation   at
          non-primordial  metallicities,  and is a natural consequence of
          some current ideas about Population III star formation.

          Title: The maximum contribution to reionization from metal-free
          stars
          Authors:   Jose   M.   Rozas,   Jordi   Miralda-Escude,  Eduard
          Salvador-Sole
          Comments: 34 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  estimate  the maximum contribution to reionization from the
          first generation of massive stars, with zero metallicity, under
          the  assumption that one of these stars forms with a fixed mass
          in  every  collapsed  halo  in  which metal-free gas is able to
          cool.  We  assume  that  any  halo  that  has already had stars
          previously  formed  in  one of their halo progenitors will form
          only  stars  with  metals,  which are assigned an emissivity of
          ionizing  radiation  equal  to  that determined at z=4 from the
          measured  intensity  of the ionizing background. We examine the
          impact  of molecular hydrogen photodissociation (which tends to
          reduce  cooling when a photodissociating background is produced
          by  the  first  stars)  and X-Ray photoheating (which heats the
          atomic  medium,  raising  the  entropy  of  the  gas  before it
          collapses  into  halos). We find that in the CDM$\Lambda$ model
          supported   by  present  observations,  and  even  assuming  no
          negative  feedbacks  for  the  formation of metal-free stars, a
          reionized  mass  fraction  of 50% is not reached until redshift
          $z\sim  12$.  The  combination of ordinary metal-enriched stars
          and  early  metal-free  stars  can yield a CMB optical depth to
          electron  scattering  of  at  most  0.13.  The  contribution of
          metal-free  stars to the present Cosmic Infrarred Background is
          negligibly small.

          Comments: 17 pages, 4 figures; ApJ, in press
          We  report  identification of the radio loud narrow-line quasar
          SDSS  J172206.03+565451.6  which  we  found  in the course of a
          search for radio loud narrow-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
          SDSSJ172206.03+565451.6  is  only  the ~4th securely identified
          radio loud narrow-line quasar and the second-most radio loudest
          with a radio index R_1.4 ~ 100-700. Its black hole mass, M_BH =
          (2-3)  10^7 M_sun, is unusually small given its radio loudness,
          and   the   combination   of   mass   and   radio   index  puts
          SDSSJ172206.03+565451.6  in  a  scarcely  populated  region  of
          M_BH-R   diagrams.   SDSSJ172206.03+565451.6   is  a  classical
          Narrow-Line  Seyfert1-type  object with FWHM_Hbeta = 1490 km/s,
          an  intensity  ratio  of  [OIII]/Hbeta  = 0.7 and FeII emission
          complexes  with  FeII4570/Hbeta = 0.7. The ionization parameter
          of  its  narrow-line  region,  estimated  from  the  line ratio
          [OII]/[OIII],  is  similar  to  Seyferts  and its high ratio of
          [NeV]/[NeIII]  indicates  a strong EUV to soft-X-ray excess. We
          advertise  the combined usage of [OII]/[OIII] and [NeV]/[NeIII]
          diagrams  as  a  useful  diagnostic tool to estimate ionization
          parameters  and to constrain the EUV continuum shape relatively
          independent from other parameters.

          Title:  Dissipative  Effects in the Worldline Approach to Black
          Hole Dynamics
          Authors: Walter D. Goldberger (Yale), Ira Z. Rothstein (CMU)
          Comments: 19 pages 2 figures
          We   derive   a   long   wavelength  effective  point  particle
          description  of  four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. In
          this  effective  theory, absorptive effects are incorporated by
          introducing  degrees of freedom localized on the worldline that
          mimic  the interaction between the horizon and bulk fields. The
          correlation  functions of composite operators in this worldline
          theory  can  be obtained by standard matching calculations. For
          example,  we  obtain  the  low  frequency two-point function of
          multipole  worldline  operators  by  relating  them to the long
          wavelength  graviton  black  hole absorptive cross section. The
          effective theory is then used to predict the leading effects of
          absorption   in  several  astrophysically  motivated  examples,
          including  the  dynamics  of non-relativistic black hole binary
          inspirals  and the motion of a small black hole in an arbitrary
          background  geometry.  Our  results can be written compactly in
          terms  of  absorption cross sections, and can be easily applied
          to the dissipative dynamics of any compact object, e.g. neutron
          stars. The relation of our methodology to that developed in the
          context of the AdS/CFT correspondence is discussed.

          Comments: 19 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; submitted to ApJ
          We present the discovery of the optical afterglow of GRB 050505
          and  an  optical  absorption  spectrum obtained with the Keck I
          10-m   telescope.   The   spectrum  exhibits  three  redshifted
          absorption  systems  with  the highest, at z=4.2748, arising in
          the  GRB host galaxy. The host absorption system is marked by a
          damped  Ly-alpha  (DLA)  feature with a neutral hydrogen column
          density  of  logN(HI)=22.05+/-0.10,  higher  than  that  of any
          QSO-DLA  detected  to date, but similar to several other recent
          measurements   from   GRB   spectra.  In  addition,  we  detect
          absorption  lines  from  both  low- and high-ionization species
          from  which  we  deduce  a  metallicity, Z~0.06 Z_solar, with a
          depletion  pattern  that  is  roughly  similar  to  that of the
          Galactic  warm halo, warm disk, or disk+halo. More importantly,
          we  detect  strong  absorption  from  SiII*  indicating a dense
          environment, n_H>10^2 cm^-3, in the vicinity of the burst, with
          a  size  of  about 4 pc. In addition, the CIV absorption system
          spans  a  velocity  range  of  about  1000  km/s,  which is not
          detected in any other absorption feature. We show that the most
          likely   interpretation   for   this  wide  velocity  range  is
          absorption  in  the  wind  from  the  progenitor  star. In this
          context,  the  lack  of corresponding SiIV absorption indicates
          that the progenitor had a mass of <25 M_solar and a metallicity
          <0.1  Z_solar,  and  therefore  required  a binary companion to
          eject  its  hydrogen  envelope  prior  to  the  GRB  explosion.
          Finally,  by extending the GRB-DLA sample to z~4.3 we show that
          these  objects  appear to follow a similar metallicity-redshift
          relation   as  in  QSO-DLAs,  but  with  systematically  higher
          metallicities.  It  remains  to  be  seen whether this trend is
          simply  due to the higher neutral hydrogen columns in GRB-DLAs,
          or  if  it  is  a  manifestation  of  different  star formation
          properties in GRB-DLAs. [abridged]

          Title:  AGN  Feedback  and Cooling Flows: The Failure of Simple
          Hydrodynamical Models
          Authors:  John C. Vernaleo, Christopher S. Reynolds (University
          of Maryland)
          Comments:   14  pages,  Submitted  to  ApJ.  PDF  version  with

          URL  Our  modified  version of the ZEUS-MP code is available at
          this http URL
          In  recent  years  it has become increasingly clear that Active
          Galactic  Nuclei,  and  radio-galaxies  in  particular, have an
          impact  on  large  scale  structure  and  galaxy  formation. In
          principle,  radio-galaxies  are  energetic  enough  to halt the
          cooling in the inner regions clusters, solving the cooling flow
          problem  and  explaining the high-mass truncation of the galaxy
          luminosity  function.  We explore this process through a series
          of  high resolution, three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations
          of   jetted   active   galaxies   which   act  in  response  to
          cooling-mediated  accretion  of an ICM atmosphere. We find that
          such  models  are incapable of producing a long term balance of
          heating and cooling; catastrophic cooling can be delayed by the
          jet  action  but  inevitably  takes  hold.  At the heart of the
          failure  of  these  models  is  the  formation of a low density
          channel  through  which  the  jet can freely flow, carrying its
          energy out of the cooling core. While this obviously highlights
          the  need  to  include  physics  beyond the ideal hydrodynamics
          considered   here,   it  also  underscores  the  importance  of
          including  jet  dynamics  in  such  models  as  opposed  to the
          isotropically inflated bubble approach.

          Title:  Flares  in  long  and  short Gamma-Ray Bursts: a common
          origin in a hyperaccreting accretion disk
          Authors:  Rosalba  Perna  (Colorado/JILA),  Philip  J. Armitage
          (Colorado/JILA), Bing Zhang (U. of Nevada)
          Comments: Accepted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters
          Early-time  X-ray observations of GRBs with the Swift satellite
          have  revealed  a more complicated phenomenology than was known
          before.  In  particular,  the presence of flaring activity on a
          wide  range  of  time scales probably requires late-time energy
          production within the GRB engine. Since the flaring activity is
          observed in both long and short GRBs, its origin must be within
          what  is  in  common  for the two likely progenitors of the two
          classes  of  bursts:  a  hyperaccreting accretion disk around a
          black  hole  of  a few solar masses. Here, we show that some of
          the  observational  properties  of  the  flares,  such  as  the
          duration-time   scale   correlation,   and   the  duration-peak
          luminosity  anticorrelation  displayed  by most flares within a
          given  burst,  are  qualitatively  consistent with viscous disk
          evolution,  provided  that  the  disk  at  large  radii  either
          fragments  or otherwise suffers large amplitude variability. We
          discuss the physical conditions in the outer parts of the disk,
          and  conclude that gravitational instability, possibly followed
          by  fragmentation,  is  the  most  likely  candidate  for  this
          variability.

          We  investigate  the  nature  of a sample of 92 Spitzer/MIPS 24
          micron  selected  galaxies  in the CDFS, showing power law-like
          emission  in the Spitzer/IRAC 3.6-8 micron bands. The main goal
          is  to  determine  whether  the galaxies not detected in X-rays
          (47%  of the sample) are part of the hypothetical population of
          obscured  AGN  not  detected  even  in  deep X-ray surveys. The
          majority  of  the  IR power-law galaxies are ULIRGs at z>1, and
          those  with  LIRG-like  IR luminosities are usually detected in
          X-rays.  The optical to IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
          of  the  X-ray  detected  galaxies  are  almost equally divided
          between  a  BLAGN  SED  class (similar to an optically selected
          QSO)  and  a  NLAGN  SED  (similar to the BLAGN SED but with an
          obscured  UV/optical  continuum).  A  small  fraction  of  SEDs
          resemble  warm ULIRG galaxies (e.g., Mrk231). Most galaxies not
          detected  in  X-rays have SEDs in the NLAGN+ULIRG class as they
          tend  to  be  optically  fainter,  and  possibly more obscured.
          Moreover,  the  IR  power-law  galaxies have SEDs significantly
          different from those of high-z (z_sp>1) IR (24 micron) selected
          and  optically  bright  (VVDS  I_AB<=24)  star-forming galaxies
          whose  SEDs  show  a very prominent stellar bump at 1.6 micron.
          The  galaxies  detected  in  X-rays  have  2-8  keV  rest-frame
          luminosities  typical  of  AGN.  The  galaxies  not detected in
          X-rays  have  global  X-ray  to mid-IR SED properties that make
          them  good  candidates to contain IR bright X-ray absorbed AGN.
          If  all  these  sources  are  actually  obscured  AGN, we would
          observe  a  ratio  of obscured to unobscured 24 micron detected
          AGN  of  2:1,  whereas  models  predict  a  ratio of up to 3:1.
          Additional  studies using Spitzer to detect X-ray-quiet AGN are
          likely to find more such obscured sources.

          Title: Extended X-Ray Emission from QSOs
          Authors:  Alan  Stockton (1), Hai Fu (1), J. Patrick Henry (1),
          Gabriela Canalizo (2) ((1) IfA Hawaii, (2) Univ. of California,
          Riverside)
          Comments: Accepted by ApJ. 9 pages including 5 figures
          We  report  Chandra  ACIS  observations of the fields of 4 QSOs
          showing  strong  extended optical emission-line regions. Two of
          these show no evidence for significant extended X-ray emission.
          The  remaining two fields, those of 3C 249.1 and 4C 37.43, show
          discrete (but resolved) X-ray sources at distances ranging from
          ~10 to ~40 kpc from the nucleus. In addition, 4C 37.43 also may
          show  a  region  of diffuse X-ray emission extending out to ~65
          kpc  and  centered  on  the  QSO.  It  has  been suggested that
          extended  emission-line  regions such as these may originate in
          the  cooling  of  a  hot  intragroup medium. We do not detect a
          general  extended  medium  in  any of our fields, and the upper
          limits  we  can place on its presence indicate cooling times of
          at  least a few 10^9 years. The discrete X-ray emission sources
          we detect cannot be explained as the X-ray jets frequently seen
          associated  with  radio-loud  quasars,  nor  can they be due to
          electron  scattering  of  nuclear  emission. The most plausible
          explanation  is  that  they  result from high-speed shocks from
          galactic  superwinds  resulting  either from a starburst in the
          QSO  host  galaxy  or  from  the  activation of the QSO itself.
          Evidence  from  densities  and velocities found from studies of
          the  extended  optical  emission around QSOs also supports this
          interpretation.

          Title: A Possible Rossby Wave Instability Origin for the Flares
          in Sagittarius A*
          Authors: Michel Tagger, Fulvio Melia
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters
          In  recent  years,  near-IR and X-ray flares have been detected
          from  the  Galaxy's  central radio point source, Sagittarius A*
          (Sgr  A*),  believed to be a \~3.10^6 solar masses supermassive
          black hole. In some cases, the transient emission appears to be
          modulated  with a (quasi-)periodic oscillation (QPO) of ~ 17-20
          minutes.  The  implied ~ 3 r_S size of the emitter (where r_S =
          2GM/c^2 is the Schwarzschild radius) points to an instability -
          possibly  induced  by  accretion  -  near the Marginally Stable
          Orbit  (MSO)  of  a  slowly  spinning object. But Sgr A* is not
          accreting  via  a  large,  `standard'  disk;  instead,  the low
          density  environment  surrounding it apparently feeds the black
          hole   with   low   angular  momentum  clumps  of  plasma  that
          circularize  within  ~ 10-300 r_S and merge onto a compact, hot
          disk.  In  this  Letter,  we  follow  the evolution of the disk
          following   such   an  event,  and  show  that  a  Rossby  wave
          instability,  particularly  in  its  magnetohydrodynamic  (MHD)
          form, grows rapidly and produces a period of enhanced accretion
          lasting several hours. Both the amplitude of this response, and
          its  duration,  match the observed flare characteristics rather
          well.

          Comments: 19 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  report  the  discovery  of  PSR  J1906+0746, a young 144-ms
          pulsar   in   a  highly  relativistic  3.98-hr  orbit  with  an
          eccentricity   of   0.085   and   expected  gravitational  wave
          coalescence  time  of  300 Myr. The new pulsar was found during
          precursor  survey  observations  with  the Arecibo 1.4-GHz feed
          array   system  and  retrospectively  detected  in  the  Parkes
          Multibeam  plane  pulsar  survey  data.  From  radio  follow-up
          observations  with  Arecibo,  Jodrell  Bank,  Green  Bank,  and
          Parkes, we have measured the spin-down and binary parameters of
          the  pulsar and its basic spectral and polarization properties.
          We  also present evidence for pulse profile evolution, which is
          likely due to geodetic precession, a relativistic effect caused
          by  the  misalignment  of  the  pulsar  spin  and total angular
          momentum  vectors. Our measurements show that PSR J1906+0746 is
          a  young  object with a characteristic age of 112 kyr. From the
          measured rate of orbital periastron advance 7.57+/-0.03 deg/yr,
          we  infer  a total system mass of 2.61+/-0.02 Msun. While these
          parameters  suggest that the PSR J1906+0746 binary system might
          be  a  younger  version  of the double pulsar system, intensive
          searches  for  radio pulses from the companion have so far been
          unsuccessful.  It  is therefore not known whether the companion
          is another neutron star or a massive white dwarf. Regardless of
          the nature of the companion, a simple calculation suggests that
          the  Galactic  birth rate of binaries similar to PSR J1906+0746
          is  60/Myr.  This  implies  that  PSR  J1906+0746  will  make a
          significant  contribution  to the computed cosmic inspiral rate
          of compact binary systems.

          we  study  the long-term evolution of the accretion disk around
          the  neutron  star in Be/X-ray binaries. We confirm the earlier
          result by Hayasaki & Okazaki (2004) that the disk evolves via a
          two-stage  process,  which  consists  of the initial developing
          stage  and  the  later developed stage. The peak mass-accretion
          rate  is  distributed  around  apastron after the disk is fully
          developed.  This  indicates  that  the  modulation  of the mass
          accretion  rate  is essentially caused by an inward propagation
          of  the one-armed spiral wave. The X-ray luminosity peak around
          the  apastron  could  provide  circumstatial  evidence  for  an
          persistent disk around the neutron star in Be/X-ray binaries.

          We  compare the accretion flow onto the neutron star induced by
          Roche lobe overflow with that by the overflow from the Be disk,
          in  a zero eccentricity, short period binary with the same mass
          transfer  rate,  performing three-dimensional Smoothed Particle
          Hydrodynamics  simulations. We find that a persistent accretion
          disk  is  formed  around  the  neutron  star in both cases. The
          circularization  radius  of  the material transferred via Roche
          lobe  overflow  is  larger than that of the material transfered
          from the Be disk. Thus, the growth of the accretion disk in the
          former  case  becomes  significantly  slower than in the latter
          case.  In both cases, the mass accretion rate is very small and
          varies  little with orbital phase, which is consistent with the
          observed  X-ray  behaviour  of  Be/X-ray binaries with circular
          orbits (e.g. XTE J1543-568).

          Title: X-ray reflections on AGN
          Authors: A.C. Fabian (Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge, UK)
          Comments:  5  pages,  9  figures, to appear in Proc. "The X-ray
          Universe  2005",  San  Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain, September
          2005
          X-ray  reflection  generates much of the spectral complexity in
          the X-ray spectra of AGN. It is argued that strong relativistic
          blurring of the reflection spectrum should commonly be expected
          from  objects  accreting  at  a  high  Eddington rate. The good
          agreement  found  between  the  local  density in massive black
          holes  and  the energy density in quasar and AGN light requires
          that   the  accretion  which  built  massive  black  holes  was
          radiatively  efficient, involving thin discs extending within 6
          gravitational  radii.  The  soft excess found in the spectra of
          many  AGN  can  be  explained  by  X-ray  reflection  when such
          blurring  is  included  in  the  spectral analysis. Some of the
          continuum   variability   and   in   particular   the  puzzling
          variability  of  the  broad  iron  line can be explained by the
          strong  light bending expected in the region immediately around
          a  black  hole. Progress in understanding this behaviour in the
          brightest  sources can be made now with long observations using
          instruments on XMM-Newton and Suzaku. Future missions like Xeus
          and  Con-X, with large collecting areas, are required to expand
          the  range  of  accessible  objects  and  to make reverberation
          studies possible.

          Title: RODEO: a new method for planet-disk interaction
          Authors: S. Paardekooper, G. Mellema
          Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A
          In  this  paper  we  describe  a  new  method  for studying the
          hydrodynamical  problem of a planet embedded in a gaseous disk.
          We  use  a  finite  volume  method  with an approximate Riemann
          solver  (the  Roe  solver),  together  with  a  special  way to
          integrate  the  source  terms. This new source term integration
          scheme sheds new light on the Coriolis instability, and we show
          that  our  method  does  not  suffer from this instability. The
          first   results   on  flow  structure  and  gap  formation  are
          presented,  as well as accretion and migration rates. For Mpl <
          0.1  M_J and Mpl > 1.0 M_J (M_J = Jupiter's mass) the accretion
          rates do not depend sensitively on numerical parameters, and we
          find  that  within the disk's lifetime a planet can grow to 3-4
          M_J.  In  between  these two limits numerics play a major role,
          leading  to  differences  of  more  than  50  %  for  different
          numerical  parameters.  Migration  rates  are  not  affected by
          numerics  at  all  as long as the mass inside the Roche lobe is
          not  considered.  We  can  reproduce  the  Type  I  and Type II
          migration for low-mass and high-mass planets, respectively, and
          the  fastest  moving  planet of 0.1 M_J has a migration time of
          only 2.0 10^4 yr.

          Title:   An   Optical   Study   of   Stellar  and  Interstellar

          Comments: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal
          We  have  studied  the stellar and interstellar environments of
          two luminous X-ray sources and five ultraluminous X-ray sources
          (ULXs)  in  order  to  gain insight into their nature. Archival
          Hubble Space Telescope images were used to identify the optical
          counterparts  of  the  ULXs  Ho IX X-1 and NGC 1313 X-2, and to
          make  photometric measurements of the local stellar populations
          of  these  and  the  luminous  source  IC  10  X-1. We obtained
          high-dispersion   spectroscopic  observations  of  the  nebulae
          around  these  seven  sources  to  search for He II lambda-4686
          emission  and  to estimate the expansion velocities and kinetic
          energies  of  these  nebulae.  Our  observations did not detect
          nebular  He  II emission from any source, with the exception of
          LMC X-1; this is either because we missed the He III regions or
          because  the  nebulae  are too diffuse to produce He II surface
          brightnesses  that  lie  within our detection limit. We compare
          the  observed  ionization  and  kinematics  of  the supershells
          around  the  ULXs  Ho  IX  X-1 and NGC 1313 X-2 with the energy
          feedback  expected  from  the  underlying stellar population to
          assess  whether  additional  energy contributions from the ULXs
          are  needed.  In  both cases, we find insufficient UV fluxes or
          mechanical  energies  from  the  stellar population; thus these
          ULXs  may  be  partially  responsible  for  the  ionization and
          energetics  of  their supershells. All seven sources we studied
          are  in young stellar environments and six of them have optical
          counterparts  with  masses  >~7  M_sun; thus, these sources are
          most likely high-mass X-ray binaries.

          content.  The  HI  mass of the cloud is 2.0 x 10^7 (d/27 kpc)^2
          Msun,  making  Complex  H  one  of the most massive HVCs if its
          distance is > ~20 kpc. Virtually all similar HI clouds in other
          galaxy  groups  are  associated  with  LSB  dwarf  galaxies. We
          selected  mid-IR MSX sources in the direction of Complex H that
          appeared likely to be star-forming regions and observed them at
          the  wavelength of the CO 1-0 transition. 59 of the 60 observed
          sources  show emission at Milky Way velocities, and we detected
          no emission at velocities consistent with that of Complex H. We
          use  these  observations  to  set an upper limit on the ongoing
          star  formation  rate  in the HVC of < 5 x 10^-4 Msun yr^-1. We
          also   searched   the   2MASS  database  for  evidence  of  any
          dwarf-galaxy-like  stellar  population  in the direction of the
          HVC  and found no trace of a distant red giant population, with
          an  upper  limit  on  the stellar mass of ~10^6 Msun. Given the
          lack  of  evidence  for  either  current  star  formation or an
          evolved  population,  we  conclude  that  Complex H cannot be a
          dwarf  galaxy with properties similar to those of known dwarfs.
          Complex  H is therefore one of the most massive known HI clouds
          without stars. If Complex H is self-gravitating, then it is one
          of  the  few  known  dark galaxy candidates. These findings may
          offer  observational  support  for  the idea that the Cold Dark
          Matter  substructure  problem  is  related to the difficulty of
          forming  stars  in  low-mass  dark matter halos; alternatively,
          Complex H could be an example of a cold accretion flow onto the
          Milky Way. [slightly abridged]

          Title:  Ultraluminous  X-ray  Sources  Powered  by  Radiatively
          Efficient  Two-Phased  Super-Eddington  Accretion  onto Stellar
          Mass Black holes
          Authors: Aristotle Socrates, Shane W. Davis
          Comments: 11 pages
          The  radiation  spectra  of many of the brightest ultraluminous
          X-ray  sources  (ULXs)  are  dominated  by  a  hard  power  law
          component,  likely powered by a hot, optically thin corona that
          Comptonizes  soft  seed  photons emitted from a cool, optically
          thick  black  hole  accretion  disk. Before its dissipation and
          subsequent conversion into coronal photon power, the randomized
          gravitational  binding  energy  responsible  for  powering  ULX
          phenomena  must separate from the mass of its origin by a means
          other  than,  and  quicker  than,  electron scattering-mediated
          radiative  diffusion. Therefore, the release of accretion power
          in  ULXs is not necessarily subject to Eddington-limited photon
          trapping,  as long as it occurs in a corona. Motivated by these
          basic  considerations,  we  present  a model of ULXs powered by
          geometrically  thin accretion onto stellar mass black holes. We
          argue that the radiative efficiency of the flow remains high if
          the  corona is magnetized or optically thin and the majority of
          the  accretion  power  escapes  in the form of radiation rather
          than  an  outflow. Within the context of the current black hole
          X-ray  binary  paradigm,  our  ULX  model  may  be viewed as an
          extension  of the very high state observed in Galactic sources.

          2005
          X-ray  surveys  of  the  extragalactic universe are now able to
          detect  significant  numbers of AGN out to high redshift (z~5).
          We  highlight  some  results  from  the Chandra Multiwavelength
          Project (ChaMP) to measure the X-ray luminosity function out to
          these  early  epochs. At z > 3, we show that the comoving space
          density  of luminous (log Lx > 44.5) AGN has a behavior similar
          to  the  optical QSO luminosity function. With a newly compiled
          sample   of   AGN  from  ChaMP  supplemented  with  those  from
          additional  surveys  including  the  Chandra  Deep  fields,  we
          present a preliminary measure of the luminosity function in the
          hard (2-8 keV) band. With 37 AGN at z > 3, we continue to see a
          decline  in  the  space  density  at high redshift over a wider
          range  in  luminosity. We discuss the need to identify a larger
          sample  of  obscured  AGN  at  high redshift to determine if an
          early epoch of hidden supermassive black hole growth occurred.

          Title:  A  closer  look  at  the X-ray transient XTE J1908+094:
          identification of two new near-infrared candidate counterparts
          Authors:  Sylvain  Chaty  (AIME),  Roberto  P.  Mignani (AIME),
          Gianluca Israel (AIME)
          Comments: accepted for publication in MNRAS, 5 pages, 3 figures
          We  had  reported  in  Chaty,  Mignani,  Israel  (2002)  on the
          near-infrared (NIR) identification of a possible counterpart to
          the  black  hole  candidate  XTE  J1908+094  obtained  with the
          ESO/NTT.  Here, we present new, follow-up, CFHT adaptive optics
          observations  of  the  XTE  J1908+094 field, which resolved the
          previously  proposed  counterpart  in  two objects separated by
          about  0.8". Assuming that both objects are potential candidate
          counterparts,  we  derive  that the binary system is a low-mass
          system   with  a  companion  star  which  could  be  either  an
          intermediate/late  type  (A-K) main sequence star at a distance
          of  3-10  kpc,  or  a  late-type ($>$K) main sequence star at a
          distance  of 1-3 kpc. However, we show that the brighter of the
          two  objects  (J ~ 20.1, H ~ 18.7, K' ~ 17.8) is more likely to
          be  the  real  counterpart of the X-ray source. Its position is
          more  compatible with our astrometric solution, and colours and
          magnitudes  of  the  other  object  are not consistent with the
          lower  limit  of  3  kpc  derived  independently  from the peak
          bolometric  flux  of  XTE  J1908+094.  Further multi-wavelength
          observations  of  both  candidate  counterparts  are crucial in
          order to solve the pending identification.

          Title: Effects of Dust Growth and Settling in T Tauri Disks

          Comments:  53 pages, 18 figures. To appear in The Astrophysical
          Journal
          We  present self-consistent disk models for T Tauri stars which
          include  a  parameterized  treatment of dust settling and grain
          growth,  building on techniques developed in a series of papers
          by    D'Alessio   etal.   The   models   incorporate   depleted
          distributions   of   dust  in  upper  disk  layers  along  with
          larger-sized  particles  near  the  disk  midplane, as expected
          theoretically  and  as  we  suggested  earlier  is necessary to
          account for mm-wave emission, SEDs, scattered light images, and
          silicate  emission  features  simultaneously.  By comparing the
          models  with recent mid- and near-IR observations, we find that
          the  dust to gas mass ratio of small grains at the upper layers
          should  be  <  10 % of the standard value. The grains that have
          disappeared from the upper layers increase the dust to gas mass
          ratio  of  the  disk  interior; if those grains grow to maximum
          sizes of the order of mm during the settling process, then both
          the   millimeter-wave   fluxes   and  spectral  slopes  can  be
          consistently explained. Depletion and growth of grains can also
          enhance   the   ionization   of  upper  layers,  enhancing  the
          possibility  of  the  magnetorotational instability for driving
          disk accretion.

          Title: The Slingshot Revisited
          Authors:  Sverre Aarseth (Institute of Astronomy, University of
          Cambridge, England)
          Comments:  8  pages,  3 figures. To appear in Few-Body Problem,
          Annales Universitatis Turkuensis, C. Flynn, ed
          (Abridged)  In  this  celebratory contribution, we present some
          new  data  from  standard  star  cluster  modelling  containing
          primordial  binaries  and  triples,  as  well as results from a
          binary  black  hole simulation with two massive members. In the
          star  cluster  case,  the  process  of  mass loss from evolving
          stars,   together   with  general  mass  segregation,  promotes
          favourable   interactions   involving   compact  subsystems  of
          binaries   and   triples  in  the  central  region.  Three-body
          interactions  often  lead  to  energetic ejections, with one or
          more  of  the  components  attaining  relatively large terminal
          velocities  which can be observed in principle. The second type
          of  stellar  system to be discussed is based on the scenario of
          two  approaching galactic cores with density cusps, each having
          a  massive  black hole. After the subsystems become well mixed,
          the  two massive components soon form a hard binary which gains
          energy  by  ejecting other members. Such a massive binary has a
          large  cross  section  and  can  be very effective in depleting
          bound  stars  from  the  core. Again high-velocity escapers are
          produced,  with  their terminal speeds related to the shrinking
          binary size which eventually leads to coalescence.

          Title:  An  explanation  for  the  soft  X-ray  excess  in  AGN
          (Conference proceedings version)

          Comments:  5  pages,  Proceedings of "The X-ray Universe 2005",
          Madrid, Spain, 2005-9-26 to 2005-9-30
          We  present  a  large  sample  of type 1 AGN spectra taken with
          XMM-Newton.  We  fit  them  with  the  relativistically blurred
          photoionized  disc model of Ross & Fabian (2005). This model is
          based  on  an  illuminated  accretion  disc  of fluorescing and
          Compton-scattering   gas,  and  includes  relativistic  Doppler
          effects  due  to  the  rapid  motion  of  the  disc and general
          relativistic  effects  such  as  gravitational  redshift due to
          presence  of  the  black  hole.  The  disc  model  successfully
          reproduces  the  X-ray  continuum  shape,  including  the  soft
          excess,  of  all the sources. It provides a natural explanation
          for  the  observation  that  the  soft  excess is at a constant
          temperature over a wide range of AGN properties. The model also
          reproduces   many   features   that   would  conventionally  be
          interpreted  as  absorption  edges. We use the model to measure
          properties of the AGN such as inclination, black hole rotation,
          and metallicity.

          Title: A possible mechanism for QPOs modulation in neutron star
          sources

          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
          Journal-ref: Astronomische Nachrichten 326 (2005), 845-848
          It   was  pointed  out  by  Paczynski  (1987)  that  the  X-ray
          luminosity  of accreting neutron stars is very sensitive to the
          physical   properties  of  the  accretion  flow  close  to  the
          innermost   stable  circular  orbit.  The  X-ray  radiation  is
          dominated by that emitted in the boundary layer, where accreted
          matter  hits  a  star  surface.  The  X-ray  luminosity  of the
          boundary  layer is proportional to the local accretion rate. In
          this note, we estimate local accretion rate variations from the
          disk  that undergoes non-stationary axisymmetric perturbations.
          The perturbations are given by the poloidal-velocity potential.
          We  obtain  a  simple  formula describing the modulation of the
          accretion  rate for the particular case of global vertical disk
          oscillations  that  have been recently studied by Abramowicz et
          al. (2005).

          Two  short  (<2  s)  g-ray  bursts  (GRBs)  have  recently been
          localized  and  fading  afterglow  counterparts  detected.  The
          combination of these two results left unclear the nature of the
          host  galaxies  of  the  bursts, because one was a star-forming
          dwarf,  while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. Here
          we  report the X-ray localization of a short burst (GRB 050724)
          with  unusual  g-ray  and X-ray properties. The X-ray afterglow
          lies  off  the  centre of an elliptical galaxy at a redshift of
          z=0.258,   coincident   with   the   position   determined   by
          ground-based  optical  and radio observations. The low level of
          star   formation  typical  for  elliptical  galaxies  makes  it
          unlikely  that  the burst originated n a supernova explosion. A
          supernova origin was also ruled out for GRB 050709, even though
          that  burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation.
          The  isotropic  energy  for  the  short bursts is 2-3 orders of
          magnitude  lower  han  that  for  the  long bursts. Our results
          therefore  suggest  that an alternative source of bursts -- the
          of binary systems of neutron stars or a neutron star-black hole
          pair -- are the progenitors of short bursts.

          We present new techniqes for evolving binary black hole systems
          which   allow   the  accurate  determination  of  gravitational
          waveforms  directly  from the wave zone region of the numerical
          simulations. Rather than excising the black hole interiors, our
          approach  follows  the "puncture" treatment of black holes, but
          utilzing  a new gauge condition which allows the black holes to
          move  successfully  through  the computational domain. We apply
          these   techniques  to  an  inspiraling  binary,  modeling  the
          radiation  generated  during  the final plunge and ringdown. We
          demonstrate  convergence of the waveforms and good conservation
          of  mass-energy,  with  just  over  3%  of  the  system's  mass
          converted to gravitional radiation.

          In  this  brief note, we investigate some possible experimental
          consequences  of  the  de-Sitter  or  Anti-de-Sitter background
          spacetime  structure for d-dimensional evaporating black holes.
          Possible  observational  signatures  in  Large  Hadron Collider
          (LHC)   events   are   considered   in  the  framework  of  the
          Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali  (ADD)  braneworld  model.  Lower
          bounds  on the value of the bulk cosmological constant required
          to  produce  visible  effects are derived thanks to a dynamical
          Monte-Carlo  simulation.  This  preliminary  study  has  to  be
          refined by the accurate computation of the greybody factors. It
          opens   a   new   way   to   investigate   the   structure   of

          Title: Metal Enrichment Discriminators of Cold Fronts
          Authors: Renato Dupke (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor)
          Comments:  2  pages,  6  figures, to appear in Proc. "The X-ray
          Universe  2005",  San  Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain, September
          2005
          Cold   fronts  are  sharp  surface  brightness  discontinuities
          characterized  by  a  jump  in gas temperature accompanied by a
          decline  in X-ray surface brightness such that the gas pressure
          remains continuous across the front and, thus, these structures
          differ  from bow shocks. Models suggest that cold fronts can be
          generated  by  external mechanisms involving the accretion of a
          subsystem   with  a  remnant  "cold  core".  However,  internal
          mechanisms  can  also create cold fronts, such as gravitational
          scattering  of subclumps or cD oscillation around the bottom of
          the  potential well. These competing models for their formation
          can  be  discriminated  through the measurements of the SN Type
          contamination across the front, which in turn can be determined
          from  metal  abundance  ratios  as measured from an ensemble of
          elements.  Here  we  present  the  preliminary  results of such
          analysis using a sample of clusters observed with Chandra.

          We  use the available radio, optical and X-ray measurements for
          the  afterglows  of  the  short  bursts  050709  and  050724 to
          constrain  the  blast-wave  energy,  its  collimation  and  the
          density  of  the  circumburst  medium.  For  GRB  050709 (whose
          duration was 0.07 s), we identify two models: i) a high-density
          solution,   where  the  ejecta  are  collimated  in  a  jet  of
          half-angle  theta_{jet}  >  6 deg and interact with a medium of
          particle density 10^{-4}/cc < n < 0.1/cc, and ii) a low-density
          solution  with  theta_{jet}  >  2 deg and n < 10^{-5}/cc. These
          density  ranges  are  compatible  with  those  expected  in the
          vicinity  of  the  host galaxy and in the intergalactic medium,
          lending  support  to  the hypothesis that the progenitor of GRB
          050907 is a NS-NS or NS-BH merger. For GRB 050724 (which last 3
          s), we obtain 0.1/cc < n < 1000/cc and theta_{jet} > 8 deg. The
          range  of  allowed  densities shows that this burst occurred in
          the  intragalactic environment. The dynamical parameters of the
          high-density  model for the GRB afterglow 050709 are similar to
          those  for  050724.  If these parameters are representative for
          short-GRB  outflows,  then  these  jets are less collimated and
          have  a  lower  kinetic energy than those of long bursts, which
          suggests  that GRB jets are not magnetically collimated and are
          powered  by  the  gravitational energy of the torus. Evidently,
          the  analysis  of  more  short-GRB afterglows is required for a
          more robust conclusion.

          Title:  Thermal  X-Ray  Iron  Line  Emission  from the Galactic
          Center Black Hole Sagittarius A*
          Authors:  Ya-Di  Xu, Ramesh Narayan, Eliot Quataert, Feng Yuan,

          Astrophysical Journal
          We model thermal X-ray emission from the accreting supermassive
          black  hole  Sagittarius  A*  at  the  Galactic Center. For the
          region  inside  $1.^{\prime\prime}5$  of  the  center, we use a
          {generalized}  radiatively  inefficient  accretion  flow (RIAF)
          model,  and  for  the  region out to $10^{\prime\prime}$ we use
          published  models  of  the  ambient  hot  gas. We calculate the
          equivalent  widths  of  Hydrogen-like  and Helium-like emission
          lines  of  various  elements,  notably  iron. We predict that a
          strong  Helium-like  iron line with an equivalent width $\sim1$
          keV should be emitted by both the external medium and the RIAF.
          The equivalent width in the external medium is sensitive to the
          metallicity $Z$ of the gas as well as the mean temperature. For
          reasonable  choices of these parameters, the calculated results
          agree  with  Chandra's  detection  of  an  iron  line  with  an
          equivalent  width  of  1.3  keV within $10^{\prime\prime}$. The
          emission  from  within $1.^{\prime\prime}5$ is not sensitive to
          the  external temperature, but is sensitive to the density and,
          especially,  temperature  profile  inside the Bondi radius. For
          the  range of profiles we consider, we calculate the equivalent
          width  of  the  iron  line to be $\sim0.6-1.5 (Z/Z_\odot)$ keV,
          where  $Z_\odot$  is  the  solar  metallicity. We present a new
          Chandra    spectrum    of   the   quiescent   emission   within
          $1.^{\prime\prime}5$  of  Sgr A*. The measured equivalent width
          of  the  iron  line is 0.7 keV. Although this measurement has a
          large  uncertainty,  it  is  consistent  with  our predictions,
          provided the metallicity of the gas is approximately solar.

          We  present  Spitzer  24micron imaging of 1.5 < z < 2.5 Distant
          Red Galaxies (DRGs) in the 10arcmin by 10arcmin Extended Hubble
          Deep  Field  South of the Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile.
          We  detect 65% of the DRGs with K_AB < 23.2 mag at S_24micron >
          40uJy,  and  conclude  that  the bulk of the DRG population are
          dusty active galaxies. A mid-infrared (MIR) color analysis with
          IRAC  data  suggests  that  the MIR fluxes are not dominated by
          buried  AGN,  and  we  interpret  the  high  detection  rate as
          evidence  for  a  high  average  star formation rate of <SFR> =
          130+/-30  M/yr.  From  this,  we  infer that DRGs are important
          contributors  to  the cosmic star formation rate density at z ~
          2, at a level of \~0.02 M/yr/Mpc^3 to our completeness limit of

          Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures, see animation in this http URL
          We   report  the  discovery  of  propeller-driven  outflows  in
          axisymmetric  magnetohydrodynamic simulations of disk accretion
          to rapidly rotating magnetized stars. Matter outflows in a wide
          cone and is centrifugally ejected from the inner regions of the
          disk.  Closer  to  the  axis  there  is  a  strong, collimated,
          magnetically  dominated  outflow of energy and angular momentum
          carried  by  the  open  magnetic field lines from the star. The
          ``efficiency'' of the propeller may be very high in the respect
          that  most  of  the  incoming  disk matter is expelled from the
          system  in  winds.  The  star  spins-down  rapidly  due  to the
          magnetic  interaction  with the disk through closed field lines
          and with corona through open field lines. Diffusive and viscous
          interaction  between  magnetosphere and the disk are important:
          no  outflows  were  observed  for  very  small  values  of  the
          diffusivity   and   viscosity.  These  simulation  results  are
          applicable  to  the  early  stages  of evolution of classical T
          Tauri stars and to different stages of evolution of cataclysmic
          variables  and  neutron stars in binary systems. As an example,
          we  have  shown  that  young  rapidly rotating magnetized CTTSs
          spin-down  to  their  present  slow  rotation in less than 10^6
          years.

          determined  by  cyclotron  line  studies of all accreting X-ray

          rather  at  ~50  or  above  100  keV  as  observed by different
          instruments  in past outbursts. The source went into quiescence
          for  more  than  ten  years  since  its last outbursts in 1994.
          Observing during a `normal' outburst August/September 2005 with

          Comments:  14  pages,  6  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We present an extensive X-ray spectral analysis of the cores of
          19  FRII  sources  in  the  redshift range 0.5<z<1.0 which were
          selected  to  be  matched  in isotropic radio power. The sample
          consists  of  10  radio  galaxies and 9 quasars. We compare our
          results  with  the  expectations  from a unification model that
          ascribes  the  difference between these two types of sources to
          the  viewing  angle  to  the  line  of  sight,  beaming and the
          presence  of a dust and gas torus. We find that the spectrum of
          all the quasars can be fitted with a single power law, and that
          the  spectral  index flattens with decreasing angle to the line
          of  sight.  We  interpret  this  as  the effect of increasingly
          dominant  inverse  Compton X-ray emission, beamed such that the
          jet  emission outshines other core components. For up to 70 per
          cent  of  the  radio  galaxies  we detect intrinsic absorption;
          their  core  spectra  are  best fitted with an unabsorbed steep
          power  law  of  average  spectral  index  $\Gamma=2.1$  and  an
          absorbed  power  law  of  spectral  index  Gamma=1.6,  which is
          flatter  than that observed for radio-quiet quasars. We further
          conclude  that  the  presence  of  a  jet  affects the spectral
          properties  of  absorbed  nuclear  emission  in  AGN.  In radio
          galaxies,   any   steep-spectrum  component  of  nuclear  X-ray
          emission,  similar to that seen in radio-quiet quasars, must be
          masked by a jet or by jet-related emission.

          Title:  Collimation  of  astrophysical  jets  - the role of the
          accretion disk magnetic field distribution
          Authors: Christian Fendt
          Comments: 27 pp, 11 figs, submitted to ApJ
          We  have  applied  axisymmetric  MHD  simulations  in  order to
          investigate  the  impact  of  the  accretion disk magnetic flux
          profile  on  jet  collimation.  Our  simulations evolve from an
          initially  hydrostatic  equilibrium  and  a force-free magnetic
          field  configuration.  We apply a self-consistent model for the
          turbulent  magneticdiffusivity  and internal turbulent Alfvenic
          pressure.  Considering  a  power  law  for  the  disk  poloidal
          magnetic  field  profile  $B_p \sim r^{-\mu}$ and the mass flow
          rate  from  the  disk surface into the jet, we have performed a
          systematic  study over a wide range of parameters. We find that
          the  degree  of collimation decreases for steeper disk magnetic
          field.  Varying  the  total  magnetic  flux does not change the
          degree of jet collimation substantially. As our major result we
          find a general interrelation between the collimation degree and
          the  disk  wind  magnetization  power  law  exponent.  We  also
          performed   simulations  of  jet  formation  with  artificially
          enhanced  decay  of  the  toroidal  magnetic  field in order to
          investigate   the  idea  of  a  purely  "poloidal  collimation"
          previously discussed in the literature. These outflows are only
          weakly  collimated and have lower velocity. Thanks to our large
          numerical  grid of about 7 x 14 AU, we may apply our results to
          recently   observed   protostellar  jet  rotation  of  DG  Tau,
          indicating  a  flat  disk magnetic field profile in this source
          $\mu  \simeq 0.5$. Our results in general are applicable to all
          sources of MHD jets.

          Following  the  suggestion of Zuckerman et al. (2001, ApJ, 562,
          L87),  we  consider the evidence that 51 Eri (spectral type F0)
          and  GJ  3305  (M0),  historically classified as unrelated main
          sequence  stars  in  the solar neighborhood, are instead a wide
          physical binary system and members of the young beta Pic moving
          group  (BPMG).  The  BPMG is the nearest (d < 50 pc) of several
          groups  of  young  stars  with  ages  around  10  Myr  that are
          kinematically   convergent  with  the  Oph-Sco-Cen  Association
          (OSCA), the nearest OB star association. Combining SAAO optical
          photometry,      Hobby-Eberly     Telescope     high-resolution
          spectroscopy, Chandra X-ray data, and UCAC2 catalog kinematics,
          we  confirm  with  high  confidence  that  the system is indeed
          extremely  young.  GJ 3305 itself exhibits very strong magnetic
          activity  but  has rapidly depleted most of its lithium. The 51
          Eri/GJ 3305 system is the westernmost known member of the OSCA,
          lying  110 pc from the main subgroups. The system is similar to
          the  BPMG  wide  binary HD 172555/CD -64d1208 and the HD 104237
          quintet,  suggesting  that dynamically fragile multiple systems
          can  survive  the  turbulent  environments of their natal giant
          molecular  cloud  complexes,  while  still  being imparted high
          dispersion  velocities.  Nearby young systems such as these are
          excellent  targets for evolved circumstellar disk and planetary
          studies,  having  stellar  ages  comparable to that of the late
          phases of planet formation.

          Title: Perturbations of self-similar Bondi accretion
          Authors: Jose Gaite
          Comments:  10  pages,  2  figures,  accepted  in  Astronomy and
          Astrophysics
          The  question  of  stability  of steady spherical accretion has
          been  studied  for  many  years  and,  recently, the concept of
          spatial   instability   has  been  introduced.  Here  we  study
          perturbations   of  steady  spherical  accretion  flows  (Bondi
          solutions),  restricting  ourselves to the case of self-similar
          flow,  as  a  case  amenable  to  analytic  treatment  and with
          physical   interest.  We  further  restrict  ourselves  to  its
          acoustic perturbations. The radial perturbation equation can be
          solved  in  terms of Bessel functions. We study the formulation
          of   adequate   boundary   conditions   and   decide   for   no
          matter-flux-perturbation conditions (at the Bondi radius and at
          r=0).  We  also  consider the problem of initial conditions and
          time  evolution,  in  particular,  of  radial perturbations. No
          spatial instability at r=0 is found. The time evolution is such
          that  perturbations  eventually become ergodic-like and show no
          trace of instability or of acquiring any remarkable pattern.

          Comments:  5 pages, 1 Figure, Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          (Letters)
          We consider the production of $^6$Li in spallation reactions by
          cosmic  rays in order to explain the observed abundance in halo
          metal-poor stars. We show that heating of ambient gas by cosmic
          rays is an inevitable consequence of this process, and estimate
          the  energy  input required to reproduce the observed abundance
          of  $^6$Li/H$\sim 10^{-11}$ to be of order a few hundred eV per
          particle.  We draw attention to the possibility that this could
          explain  the  excess  entropy  in  gas  in  galaxy  groups  and
          clusters.  The evolution of $^6$Li and the accompanying heating
          of  gas  is calculated for structures collapsing at the present
          epoch  with  injection  of  cosmic  rays  at  high redshift. We
          determine  the  energy  required  to  explain  the abundance of
          $^6$Li  at  $z  \sim 2$ corresponding to the formation epoch of
          halo  metal-poor  stars, and also an increased entropy level of
          $\sim  300$  keV cm$^2$ necessary to explain X-ray observations
          of  clusters.  The energy budget for this process is consistent
          with  the  expected  energy  output of radio-loud AGNs, and the
          diffusion  length  scale  of cosmic-ray protons responsible for
          heating  is  comparable  to  the  size  of  regions with excess
          entropy.  We  also  discuss  the  constraints  imposed  by  the
          extragalactic gamma-ray background.

          Probe of Asteroids, Cosmology and Astrophysics

          The  Advanced  Liquid-Mirror  Probe of Asteroids, Cosmology and
          Astrophysics  (ALPACA)  is  a  proposed  8-meter  liquid mirror
          telescope    surveying    ~1000    square    degree    of   the
          southern-hemisphere  sky.  It  will  be a remarkably simple and
          inexpensive telescope, that nonetheless will deliver a powerful
          sample  of  optical  data for studying dark energy. The bulk of
          the    cosmological    data    consists    of   nightly,   high
          signal-to-noise, multiband light curves of SN Ia. At the end of
          the  three-years run ALPACA is expected to collect >100,000 SNe
          Ia  up  to  z~1.  This  will  allow to accurately calibrate the
          standard-candle   relation   and   reduce   present  systematic
          uncertainties.  The  survey  will  also  provide  several other
          datasets  such as the detection of baryon acoustic oscillations
          in   the   matter   power   spectrum  and  shear  weak  lensing
          measurements.   In   this   preliminary  analysis  we  forecast
          constraints  on  dark  energy  parameters from SN Ia and baryon
          acoustic  oscillations.  The  combination of these two datasets
          will   provide  competitive  constraints  on  the  dark  energy
          parameters under minimal prior assumptions. Further studies are
          needed to address the accuracy of weak lensing measurements.

          Title: Galactic Globular Clusters with Luminous X-Ray Binaries
          Authors: Joel N. Bregman
          Comments:  20  pages,  8 figures; accepted in The Astrophysical
          Journal
          Luminous  X-ray  binaries  (>1E34  erg/s, LMXBs) have a neutron
          star  or  black hole primary, and in globular clusters, most of
          these close binaries are expected to be have evolved from wider
          binaries  through  dynamical  interactions with other stars. We
          sought  to  find  a  predictor  of  this formation rate that is
          representative  of  the initial properties of globular clusters
          rather  than  of  the  highly  evolved  core quantities. Models
          indicate  the  half-light  quantities  best reflect the initial
          conditions,  so  we  examine  whether  the associated dynamical
          interaction  rate,  proportional  to L^1.5 r^-2.5, is useful in
          understanding  the  presence  of luminous LMXBs in the Galactic
          globular  cluster system. We find that while LMXB clusters with
          large  values  of  L^1.5  r^-2.5 preferentially host LMXBs, the
          systems  must  also have half-mass relaxation times below about
          1E9  yr.  This  relaxation  time effect probably occurs because
          several   relaxation   times  are  required  to  modify  binary
          separations,  a  timescale  that  must  be shorter than cluster
          ages.  The  frequency of finding an LMXB cluster is enhanced if
          the  cluster  is  metal-rich  and  if  it is close to the bulge
          region.  The  dependence  upon  metallicity  is most likely due
          either  to  differing  initial  mass functions at the high mass
          end,  or  because  bulge systems evolve more rapidly from tidal
          interactions  with  the  bulge.  This  approach  can be used to
          investigate  globular  cluster  systems  in  external galaxies,
          where core properties are unresolved.

          Comments:  To  be  published  in  the  March  2006 issue of the
          Astronomical  Journal.  Paper  consists  of  40  pages  with 10
          figures.  Complete  set  of  47  figures  and 2 full electronic
          tables can be found at this http URL
          We  present  near and mid-infrared photometry obtained with the
          Spitzer  Space  Telescope  of  300  known  members of the IC348
          cluster.  We  merge  this photometry with existing ground-based
          optical  and  near-infrared  photometry  in  order to construct
          optical-infrared  spectral  energy distributions (SEDs) for all
          the cluster members and present a complete atlas of these SEDs.
          We  employ these observations to both investigate the frequency
          and nature of the circumstellar disk population in the cluster.
          The observations are sufficiently sensitive to enable the first
          detailed  measurement  of  the disk frequency for very low mass
          stars  at  the  peak  of the stellar IMF. Using measurements of
          infrared  excess  between  3.6  and 8 microns we find the total
          frequency of disk-bearing stars in the cluster to be 50 +/- 6%.
          However,  only  30 +/- 4% of the member stars are surrounded by
          optically   thick,   primordial   disks,  while  the  remaining
          disk-bearing   stars  are  surrounded  by  what  appear  to  be
          optically  thin,anemic disks. The disk fraction appears to be a
          function  of spectral type and stellar mass. The disk longevity
          and  thus  conditions  for  planet  formation appear to be most
          favorable  for  stars  which are of comparable mass to the sun.
          The optically thick disks around later type (> M4) stars appear
          to  be  less  flared  than the disks around earlier type stars.
          This  may indicate a greater degree of dust settling and a more
          advanced  evolutionary  state  for  the late M disk population.
          Finally  we  find  that the presence of an optically thick dust
          disk  is  correlated  with gaseous accretion as measured by the
          strength  of  Halpha emission. These results suggest that it is
          more  likely for dust disks to persist in the absence of active
          gaseous  accretion  than for active accretion to persist in the
          absence of dusty disks.

          Title:   Precession   of  neutrino-cooled  accretion  disks  in
          gamma-ray burst engines
          Authors: Matias M. Reynoso, Gustavo E. Romero, Oscar A. Sampayo
          Comments: 6 pages, 7 figures, submitted
          We  study  the  precession of accretion disks in the context of
          gamma-ray  burst  inner  engines.  With an accretion disk model
          that  allows  for  neutrino  cooling,  we evaluate the possible
          periods   of   disk   precession   and   nutation  due  to  the
          Lense-Thirring  effect.  Assuming jet ejection perpendicular to
          the  disk  midplane and a typical intrinsic time dependence for
          the  burst,  we  find  possible  gamma-ray  light  curves  with
          temporal  microstructure  similar  to  what is observed in some
          subsamples.  We  conclude that the precession and nutation of a
          neutrino-cooled  accretion  disk  in  the burst engine might be
          responsible for some events.

          Title:  A  Blue  Straggler  Binary  System  with at least Three
          Progenitors in the Core of a Globular Cluster

          Comments: 15 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We  show  that the X-ray source W31 in the core of the globular
          cluster  47  Tucanae  is  physically associated with the bright
          blue  straggler  BSS-7.  The  two  sources  are astrometrically
          matched   to   0.061  arcseconds,  with  a  chance  coincidence
          probability  of  less  than 1 per cent. We then analyse optical
          time-series photometry obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope
          (HST)  and  find that BSS-7 displays a 1.56 day periodic signal
          in  the I band. We also construct a broad-band (far-ultraviolet
          through far-red) spectral energy distribution for BSS-7 and fit
          this  with  single  and  binary  models.  The binary model is a
          better fit to the data, and we derive the corresponding stellar
          parameters.
          All of our findings suggest that the BSS-7 system consists of a
          blue     straggler     primary     with     an    X-ray-active,
          upper-main-sequence  companion.  The formation of such a system
          must  have  involved at least three stars, so the simplest blue
          straggler  formation scenarios -- primordial binary coalescence
          or a single 2-body collision -- cannot account for it. However,
          our  results are consistent with recent N-body models, in which
          blue  stragglers  often  form  via multiple encounters that can
          involve both single and binary stars.

          Title:  Interferometric Measurements of Variable 340 GHz Linear
          Polarization in Sagittarius A*
          Authors:  D.  P.  Marrone,  J.  M.  Moran,  J.-H.  Zhao, R. Rao
          (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)
          Comments: 12 pages, 4 figures. To appear in ApJ
          Using  the  Submillimeter  Array,  we  have made the first high
          angular  resolution  measurements of the linear polarization of
          Sagittarius  A*  at  submillimeter  wavelengths,  and the first
          detection  of intra-day variability in its linear polarization.
          We  detected  linear polarization at 340 GHz (880um) at several
          epochs.  At  the  typical resolution of 1.4"x2.2", the expected
          contamination  from  the surrounding (partially polarized) dust
          emission  is  negligible.  We  found that both the polarization
          fraction and position angle are variable, with the polarization
          fraction  dropping  from  8.5% to 2.3% over three days. This is
          the  first significant measurement of variability in the linear
          polarization fraction in this source. We also found variability
          in  the  polarization and total intensity within single nights,
          although  the  relationship  between  the two is not clear from
          these  data.  The  simultaneous 332 and 342 GHz position angles
          are  the  same, setting a one-sigma rotation measure (RM) upper
          limit  of  7x10^5  rad/m^2.  From position angle variations and
          comparison  of "quiescent" position angles observed here and at
          230  GHz  we  infer  that the RM is a few times 10^5 rad/m^2, a
          factor of a few below our direct detection limit. A generalized
          model  of  the  RM produced in the accretion flow suggests that
          the accretion rate at small radii must be low, below 10^{-6} to
          10^{-7}  M_{sun}/year  depending  on  the  radial  density  and
          temperature  profiles,  but  in all cases below the gas capture
          rate inferred from X-ray observations.

          Title:  Thick  fireballs and the steep decay in the early X-ray
          afterglow of gamma-ray bursts
          Authors:  Davide  Lazzati, Mitch Begelman (JILA - University of
          Colorado)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          We  study  the early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts produced by
          geometrically thick fireballs, following the development of the
          external shock as energy is continually supplied to the shocked
          material.  We study the dependence of the early afterglow slope
          on  the luminosity history of the central engine. The resulting
          light  curves  are  modeled  with  power-law  functions and the
          importance  of  a  correct  choice of the reference time t_0 is
          investigated.  We  find that deviations from a simple power-law
          are observed only if a large majority of the energy is released
          at late times. The light curve in this case can be described as
          a  simple power-law if the reference time is set to be close to
          the  end  of the burst. We applied our analysis to the cases of
          GRB  050219a and GRB 030515. We show that the early steep decay
          of  the  afterglow  cannot  result  from the interaction of the
          fireball  with  the  ambient medium. We conclude that the early
          X-ray  afterglow  emission  is associated with the prompt phase
          and  we  derive  limits  on  the  radius  at  which  the prompt
          radiation is produced.

          figures available at this http URL
          Only  seven  radio-quiet isolated neutron stars (INSs) emitting
          thermal X rays are known, a sample that has yet to definitively
          address  such  fundamental  issues  as the equation of state of
          degenerate  neutron  matter.  We describe a selection algorithm
          based on a cross-correlation of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS)
          and  the  Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that identifies X-ray
          error  circles  devoid of plausible optical counterparts to the
          SDSS  g~22  magnitudes  limit.  We  quantitatively characterize
          these  error  circles as optically blank; they may host INSs or
          other  similarly  exotic  X-ray  sources such as radio-quiet BL
          Lacs,  obscured  AGN,  etc. Our search is an order of magnitude
          more  selective than previous searches for optically blank RASS
          error  circles,  and  excludes  the 99.9% of error circles that
          contain  more  common  X-ray-emitting  subclasses.  We  find 11
          candidates, nine of which are new. While our search is designed
          to  find  the best INS candidates and not to produce a complete
          list  of  INSs in the RASS, it is reassuring that our number of
          candidates  is  consistent with predictions from INS population
          models.   Further   X-ray  observations  will  obtain  pinpoint
          positions  and  determine  whether  these  sources are entirely
          optically  blank  at  g~22,  supporting  the presence of likely
          isolated  neutron stars and perhaps enabling detailed follow-up
          studies of neutron star physics.

          Process
          Authors: Govind Menon, Charles D. Dermer
          Comments: 8 pages, no figures
          We  analyze  the  constraint  equation giving allowed solutions
          describing  fields  and  currents in a force-free magnetosphere
          around   a   rotating  black  hole.  Utilizing  the  divergence
          properties  of  the  energy  and  angular-momentum  fluxes  for
          physically   allowed   solutions,  we  conclude  that  poloidal
          surfaces  are  independent  of  the radial coordinate for large
          values  of  $r$.  Using  this  fact  and  the Znajek regularity
          condition,  we  explicitly  derive all possible exact solutions
          admitted   by  the  constraint  equation  for  $r$  independent
          poloidal   surfaces,   which   are   given   in  terms  of  the
          electromagnetic    angular    velocity   function   $\Omega   =
          1/a\sin^2\theta$,  where  $a$  is the angular momentum per unit
          mass of the black hole.

          Title: Observational Constraints on the Braneworld Geometry
          Authors: Gonzalo A. Palma (DAMTP, University of Cambridge)
          Comments: 11 pages, 6 figures
          The  low  energy  regime  of  5-D braneworld models with a bulk
          scalar  field  is  studied.  The  setup  is  rather general and
          includes  the  Randall-Sundrum and dilatonic braneworlds models
          as  particular  cases. We discuss the cosmological evolution of
          the  system  and  conclude  that,  in  a  two brane system, the
          negative  tension brane is generally expected to evolve towards
          a   null   warp-factor  state.  This  implies,  for  late  time
          cosmology,  that both branes end up interacting weakly. We also
          analyze  the  observational constraints imposed by solar-system
          and  binary-pulsar  tests on the braneworld configuration. This
          is  done  by  considering  the small deviations produced by the
          branes  on  the 4-D gravitational interaction between bodies in
          the  same  brane.  Using  these  constraints  we  show that the
          geometry  around  the  braneworld  is strongly warped, and that
          both branes must be far apart.

          Title:  Gamma-Ray  Burst  Synthetic  Spectra from Collisionless
          Shock PIC Simulations
          Authors: Christian Busk Hededal, ke Nordlund
          Comments:  5  pages,  4 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical
          Journal Letters
          The  radiation from afterglows of gamma-ray bursts is generated
          in   the   collisionless   plasma  shock  interface  between  a
          relativistic  outflow  and a quiescent circum-burst medium. The
          two   main   ingredients  responsible  for  the  radiation  are
          high-energy, non-thermal electrons and a strong magnetic field.
          In  this  Letter  we  present,  for  the  first time, synthetic
          spectra    extracted    directly    from    first    principles
          particle-in-cell simulations of relativist collisionless plasma
          shocks.  The  spectra  are  generated  by  a  numerical Fourier
          transformation of the electrical far-field from each of a large
          number of particles, sampled directly from the particle-in-cell
          simulations. Both the electromagnetic field and the non-thermal
          particle  acceleration  are  self-consistent  products  of  the
          Weibel  two-stream  instability.  We  find  that  the radiation
          spectrum   from  a  $\Gamma=15$  shock  simulation  show  great
          resemblance   with   observed   GRB   spectra   --  we  compare
          specifically with that of GRB000301C.

          Title: ISM gas removal from starburst galxies and the premature
          death of star clusters
          Authors: C. Melioli, E. M. de Gouveia Dal Pino
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, A&A Letter accepted
          Recent  observational  studies  of the age distribution of star
          clusters in nearby merging galaxies and starburst (SB) galaxies
          indicate  a  premature death of the young clusters. The fate of
          an  evolving star cluster crucially depends of its gas content.
          This  behaves  like  a  glue that helps to keep the star system
          gravitationally   bound.  In  SB  systems  where  the  rate  of
          supernovae  (SNe)  explosions  is elevated one should expect an
          efficient  heating  of  the  gas and its complete removal which
          could  then  favor  the rapid dissociation of the evolving star
          clusters.  Based  on  a  contemporaneous study of the dynamical
          evolution of the interstellar gas in SB environments (Melioli &
          de Gouveia Dal Pino 2004) where it has been considered also the
          presence   of   dense  clouds  that  may  inhibit  the  heating
          efficiency  of  the  interstellar  gas by the SNe, we have here
          computed  the  timescales  for  gas removal from young clusters

          We  present  the results of a deep optical survey in the Corona
          Australis  and  Chamaeleon II star forming regions. Our optical
          photometry  is  combined  with available near- and mid-infrared
          photometry to identify very low-mass candidate members in these
          dark  clouds.  In  our  Chamaeleon  II  field,  only one object
          exhibits  clear  H-alpha  emission, but the discrepancy between
          its optical and near-infrared colours suggests that it might be
          a foreground star. We also identify two objects without H-alpha
          emission that could be planetary mass members of Chamaeleon II.
          In  Corona  Australis,  we find ten stars and three brown dwarf
          candidates  in the Coronet cluster. Five of our new members are
          identified  with  ISOCAM  sources.  Only  two  of  them  have a
          mid-infrared  excess,  indicating  the presence of an accretion
          disk.  On the other hand, one brown dwarf candidate has a faint
          close  companion,  seen  only  in our deepest I-band image. For
          many  of the candidates in both clouds, membership could not be
          inferred  from their H-alpha emission or near-infrared colours;
          these objects need spectroscopic confirmation of their status.

          Here  we  investigate the variability of physical parameters in
          the  broad  line  region  (BLR) of NGC 5548 using the BP method
          given  by  Popovic  (2003).  We  apply the method on the Balmer
          lines  observed from 1996 till 2004, and found that variability
          seen  in lines, is also present in the electron temperature. We
          found that the averaged electron temperature for the period was
          T=  22600 K, and that varies from 12 000 K (in 2002) till 34000
          K  (in  1998).  This  variation  cannot  be  explained  with an
          intrinsic  extinction  and  it  presents  real  variability  in
          physical  parameters:  the electron temperature and density. We
          found   a   high  correlation  between  the  optical  continuum
          intensity  and  electron  temperature  (r=0.85)  that  supports
          existence of an accretion disk in the BLR of NGC 5548.

          Title:  Gamma-Ray  Burst  Synthetic  Spectra from Collisionless
          Shock PIC Simulations
          Authors: Christian Busk Hededal, ke Nordlund
          Comments:  5  pages,  4 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical
          Journal Letters
          The  radiation from afterglows of gamma-ray bursts is generated
          in   the   collisionless   plasma  shock  interface  between  a
          relativistic  outflow  and a quiescent circum-burst medium. The
          two   main   ingredients  responsible  for  the  radiation  are
          high-energy, non-thermal electrons and a strong magnetic field.
          In  this  Letter  we  present,  for  the  first time, synthetic
          spectra    extracted    directly    from    first    principles
          particle-in-cell simulations of relativist collisionless plasma
          shocks.  The  spectra  are  generated  by  a  numerical Fourier
          transformation of the electrical far-field from each of a large
          number of particles, sampled directly from the particle-in-cell
          simulations. Both the electromagnetic field and the non-thermal
          particle  acceleration  are  self-consistent  products  of  the
          Weibel  two-stream  instability.  We  find  that  the radiation
          spectrum   from  a  $\Gamma=15$  shock  simulation  show  great
          resemblance   with   observed   GRB   spectra   --  we  compare
          specifically with that of GRB000301C.

          Title: ISM gas removal from starburst galxies and the premature
          death of star clusters
          Authors: C. Melioli, E. M. de Gouveia Dal Pino
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures, A&A Letter accepted
          Recent  observational  studies  of the age distribution of star
          clusters in nearby merging galaxies and starburst (SB) galaxies
          indicate  a  premature death of the young clusters. The fate of
          an  evolving star cluster crucially depends of its gas content.
          This  behaves  like  a  glue that helps to keep the star system
          gravitationally   bound.  In  SB  systems  where  the  rate  of
          supernovae  (SNe)  explosions  is elevated one should expect an
          efficient  heating  of  the  gas and its complete removal which
          could  then  favor  the rapid dissociation of the evolving star
          clusters.  Based  on  a  contemporaneous study of the dynamical
          evolution of the interstellar gas in SB environments (Melioli &
          de Gouveia Dal Pino 2004) where it has been considered also the
          presence   of   dense  clouds  that  may  inhibit  the  heating
          efficiency  of  the  interstellar  gas by the SNe, we have here
          computed  the  timescales  for  gas removal from young clusters
          embedded  in  these  systems and found that they are consistent
          with  the  very  short timescales for cluster dissolution which
          are  inferred from the observational studies above. Our results
          indicate   that  typical  SB  proto-clusters  should  start  to

          Comments: New Astronomy, in press
          Hot  gaseous  haloes  surrounding  galaxies  and extending well
          beyond the distribution of stars are a ubiquitous prediction of
          galaxy  formation scenarios. The haloes are believed to consist
          of  gravitationally  trapped gas with a temperature of millions
          of  Kelvin.  The  existence  of  such hot haloes around massive
          elliptical  galaxies  has  been established through their X-ray
          emission.  While gas out-flowing from starburst spiral galaxies
          has  been  detected,  searches  for  hot  haloes around normal,
          quiescent spiral galaxies have so far failed, casting doubts on
          the  fundamental  physics  in  galaxy formation models. Here we
          present  the first detection of a hot, large-scale gaseous halo
          surrounding  a  normal,  quiescent  spiral  galaxy,  NGC  5746,
          alleviating   a  long-standing  problem  for  galaxy  formation
          models. In contrast to starburst galaxies, where the X-ray halo
          can  be powered by the supernova energy, there is no such power
          source  in NGC 5746. The only compelling explanation is that we
          are  here witnessing a galaxy forming from gradually in-flowing
          hot and dilute halo gas.

          Title:  Reviving  Dead  Zones  in  Accretion  Disks  by  Rossby
          Vortices at their Boundaries
          Authors: P.varniere, M.Tagger
          Comments: accepted by A&A letters
          Models  of  the  accretion  disks of Young Stellar Objects show
          that  they should not be ionized at a few AU from the star, and
          thus  not  subject  to  the  MHD  turbulence  believed to cause
          accretion.  This  has  been  suggested  to create a 'Dead Zone'
          where  accretion  remains  unexplained.  Here  we show that the
          existence  of the Dead Zone self-consistently creates a density
          profile favorable to the Rossby Wave Instability of Lovelace et
          al.  (1999).  This  instability  will create and sustain Rossby
          vortices  in  the  disk  which  could  lead  to enhanced planet
          formation.

          Title: Direct magnetic field detection in the innermost regions
          of an accretion disc

          Models  predict that magnetic fields play a crucial role in the
          physics  of  astrophysical accretion disks and their associated
          winds  and  jets.  For example, the rotation of the disk twists
          around the rotation axis the initially vertical magnetic field,
          which  responds  by  slowing down the plasma in the disk and by
          causing  it  to  fall  towards  the  central star. The magnetic
          energy flux produced in this process points away from the disk,
          pushing the surface plasma outwards, leading to a wind from the
          disk and sometimes a collimated jet. But these predictions have
          hitherto not been supported by observations. Here we report the
          direct  detection  of  the  magnetic  field  in the core of the
          protostellar  accretion  disk  FU  Orionis.  The  surface field
          reaches  strengths  of  about  1  kG close to the centre of the
          disk,  and  it  includes  a significant azimuthal component, in
          good  agreement  with recent models. But we find that the field
          is  very  filamentary  and slows down the disk plasma much more
          than  models  predict,  which  may  explain why FU Ori fails to
          collimate its wind into a jet.

          The  most  intense  monitoring  observations  yet  made  in the
          optical  (UBV)  and near-infrared (JHK) wave bands were carried
          out  for  nearby  Seyfert1  galaxies of NGC 5548, NGC 4051, NGC
          3227,  and  NGC  7469.  Over  three  years of observations with
          MAGNUM  telescope since early 2001, clear time-delayed response
          of the K-band flux variations to the V-band flux variations was
          detected for all of these galaxies. Their H-K color temperature
          was  estimated  to  be  1500-1800  K  from  the  observed  flux
          variation gradients, which supports a view that the bulk of the
          K  flux  should  originate in the thermal radiation of hot dust
          that  surrounds  the central engine. Cross-correlation analysis
          was  performed  to  quantify  the lag time corresponding to the
          light-travel  distance  of the hot dust region from the central
          engine. The measured lag time is 47-53 days for NGC 5548, 11-18
          days  for  NGC 4051, about 20 days for NGC 3227, and 65-87 days
          for  NGC 7469. We found that the lag time is tightly correlated
          with the optical luminosity as expected from dust reverberation
          ($\Delta  t  \propto  L^{0.5}$),  while  only  weakly  with the
          central virial mass, which suggests that an inner radius of the
          dust   torus   around  the  active  nucleus  has  a  one-to-one
          correspondence  to  central  luminosity. In the lag time versus
          central luminosity diagram, the K-band lag times place an upper
          boundary  on  the  similar lag times of broad-emission lines in
          the  literature.  This  not only supports the unified scheme of
          AGNs,  but  also implies a physical transition from the BLR out
          to  the  dust  torus  that  encircles the BLR. Furthermore, our
          V-band  flux  variations  of NGC 5548 on timescales of up to 10
          days  are  found  to  correlate with X-ray variations and delay
          behind  them  by  one  or  two  days,  indicating  the  thermal
          reprocessing of X-ray emission by the central accretion flow.

          Title: Curvature effect in structured GRB jets
          Authors: J. Dyks, Bing Zhang, Y. Z. Fan
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We study the influence of jet structure on the curvature effect
          in a GRB-lightcurve. Using a simple model of jet emissivity, we
          numerically  calculate  lightcurves  for  a  short flash from a
          relativistic  outflow  having  various  profiles of the Lorentz
          factor     and    outflowing    energy    density    (gaussian,
          core+power-law).  We  find that for "on-beam" viewing geometry,
          with  the  line of sight passing through the bright core of the
          outflow,  the  shape  of  the  lightcurve  practically does not
          depend  on  the jet structure, initially following the temporal
          slope  2+delta,  where  delta  is  the spectral index. When the
          viewing angle is larger than the core, the light curve decaying
          slope  is shallower. We discuss the implications of our results
          for the Swift data.

          Title: Resonance Overlap is Responsible for Ejecting Planets in
          Binary Systems
          Authors: Lawrence R. Mudryk, Yanqin Wu
          Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophyical Journal.
          Consists of 8 pages, 6 figures
          A  planet  orbiting  around  a  star  in a binary system can be
          ejected  if  it  lies  too far from its host star. We find that
          instability  boundaries first obtained in numerical studies can
          be   explained   by   overlap   between  sub-resonances  within
          mean-motion resonances (mostly of the j:1 type). Strong secular
          forcing from the companion displaces the centroids of different
          sub-resonances,  producing  large regions of resonance overlap.
          Planets  lying  within  these  overlapping  regions  experience
          chaotic  diffusion, which in most cases leads to their eventual
          ejection.  The  overlap region extends to shorter-period orbits
          as  either  the  companion's mass or its eccentricity increase.
          Our   analytical   calculations   reproduce   the   instability
          boundaries   observed   in  numerical  studies  and  yield  the
          following  two  additional  results.  Firstly,  the instability
          boundary  as  a  function  of eccentricity is jagged; thus, the
          widest  stable  orbit  could  be reduced from previously quoted
          values  by as much as 20%. Secondly, very high order resonances
          (e.g.,  50:3)  do  not  significantly  modify  the  instability
          boundary  despite  the  fact  that  these  weak  resonances can
          produce   slow   chaotic  diffusion  which  may  be  missed  by
          finite-duration   numerical   integrations.   We  present  some
          numerical   evidence  for  the  first  result.  More  extensive
          experiments  are  called  for to confirm these conclusions. For
          the  special  case  of circular binaries, we find that the Hill
          criterion  (based  on  the  critical Jacobi integral) yields an
          instability  boundary  that is very similar to that obtained by
          resonance overlap arguments, making the former both a necessary
          and a sufficient condition for planet instability.

          Title: Roche Lobe Sizes in Deep-MOND Gravity
          Authors: HongSheng Zhao
          Comments:  4  pages,  2  figures,  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics
          Letter, in press
          MOdified   Newtonian   Dynamics  (MOND)  is  evolving  from  an
          empirical  to  a  decent  theory respecting fundamental physics
          after   Bekenstein   (2004)  showed  that  lensing  and  Hubble
          expansion  can be modeled rigourously in a Modified Relativity.
          However, many properties of MOND are obscured by its non-linear
          Poisson's  equation.  Here  we  study the effect of tides for a
          binary  stellar  system  or  a  baryonic  satellite-host galaxy
          system.  We  show that the Roche lobe is more squashed than the
          Newtonian  case  due  to  the  anisotropic  dilation  effect in
          deep-MOND.  We  prove  analytically  that the Roche lobe volume
          scales  linearly  with  the  "true" baryonic mass ratio in both
          Newtonian   and   deep-MOND   regimes,   insensitive   to   the
          modification to the inertia mass. Hence accurate Roche radii of
          satellites  can  break  the  degeneracy of MOND and dark matter
          theory.  Globular  clusters  and  dwarf  galaxies of comparable
          luminosities  and  distances  show  a  factor of ten scatter in
          limiting   radii;   this   is   difficult  to  explain  in  any
          "mass-tracing-light" universe.

          We  report  on  high  resolution  spectra  of  the  bright  QSO
          HS0747+4259  (zem  =  1.90,  V  =  15.8) observed to search for
          intermediate  redshift OVI absorption systems. The spectra were
          obtained  by  means of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
          (STIS)  at  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  (HST)  and  the High
          Resolution  Echelle  Spectrometer  (HIRES)  at  the  W. M. Keck
          telescope. We identify 16 OVI systems in the range 1.07 <= z <=
          1.87.  Among  them,  six systems with zabs = 1.46-1.8 exhibit a
          sufficient  number  of  lines of different ionic transitions to
          estimate the shape of the ionizing radiation field in the range
          1  Ryd  <  E  <  10  Ryd. All recovered UV ionizing spectra are
          characterized  by  the enhanced intensity at E > 3 Ryd compared
          to  the  model  spectrum of Haardt and Madau (1996). This is in
          line  with the observational evidence of a deficiency of strong
          Ly-alpha  absorbers with N(HI) > 10^{15} cm^{-2}, at z < 2. The
          UV  background shows significant local variations: the spectral
          shape  estimated  at z = 1.59 differs from that obtained at z =
          1.81  and  1.73.  A  possible  cause of these variations is the
          presence  of  a  QSO/AGN at z ~= 1.54-1.59 close to the line of
          sight.  No  features favoring the input of stellar radiation to
          the  ionizing  background  are  detected,  limiting  the escape
          fraction of the galactic UV photons to f_esc < 0.05.

          Astronomy and Astrophysics
          We  report  the  results  of  an observation of Cygnus X-1 with
          INTEGRAL,  that we combine with simultaneous radio observations
          with   the   Ryle  telescope.  Both  spectral  and  variability
          properties  of  the  source  indicate that Cygnus X-1 was in an
          Intermediate  State.  The INTEGRAL spectrum shows a high-energy
          cut-off  or  break  around  100  keV. The shape of this cut-off
          differs   from  pure  thermal  Comptonisation,  suggesting  the
          presence  of  a  non-thermal  component  at higher energies.The
          average  broad  band  spectrum  is  well  represented by hybrid
          thermal/non-thermal  Comptonisation  models.  During  the 4 day
          long  observation  the  source showed an important spectral and
          flux  variability.  A principal component analysis demonstrates
          that  most  of  this  variability  occurs through 2 independent
          modes.  The  first  mode  consists  in  changes  in the overall
          luminosity  on time scale of hours with almost constant spectra
          that  are strikingly uncorrelated with the variable radio flux.
          We  interpret  this  variability  mode  as  variations  of  the
          dissipation  rate  in  the  corona. The second variability mode
          consists  in  a pivoting of the spectrum around 10 keV. It acts
          on a longer time-scale: initially soft, the spectrum hardens in
          the  first part of the observation and then softens again. This
          pivoting pattern is strongly correlated with the radio (15 GHz)
          emission:  radio fluxes are stronger when the INTEGRAL spectrum
          is  harder.  We  propose  that  the  pivoting mode represents a
          'mini'  state  transition  from  a  nearly High Soft State to a
          nearly  Low Hard State, and back. This mini-transition would be
          caused  by  changes in the soft cooling photons flux in the hot
          Comptonising   plasma   associated  with  an  increase  of  the
          temperature  of  the accretion disc. The jet power then appears
          to be anti-correlated with the disc luminosity and unrelated to
          the coronal power.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJS
          We present integrated optical spectrophotometry for a sample of
          417  nearby  galaxies.  Our  observations  consist of spatially
          integrated,  S/N=10-100  spectroscopy  between  3600  and  6900
          Angstroms  at  ~8  Angstroms  FWHM  resolution. In addition, we
          present  nuclear  (2.5"x2.5")  spectroscopy  for  153  of these
          objects.  Our  sample  targets a diverse range of galaxy types,
          including  starbursts,  peculiar  galaxies, interacting/merging
          systems,  dusty,  infrared-luminous galaxies, and a significant
          number of normal galaxies. We use population synthesis to model
          and  subtract  the  stellar  continuum  underlying  the nebular
          emission   lines.   This  technique  results  in  emission-line
          measurements  reliably  corrected for stellar absorption. Here,
          we  present  the  integrated  and  nuclear spectra, the nebular
          emission-line fluxes and equivalent widths, and a comprehensive
          compilation  of  ancillary data available in the literature for
          our  sample. In a series of subsequent papers we use these data
          to   study  optical  star-formation  rate  indicators,  nebular
          abundance diagnostics, the luminosity-metallicity relation, the
          dust  properties  of  normal  and  starburst  galaxies, and the

          Hot  gaseous  haloes  surrounding  galaxies  and extending well
          beyond the distribution of stars are a ubiquitous prediction of
          galaxy  formation scenarios. The haloes are believed to consist
          of  gravitationally  trapped gas with a temperature of millions
          of  Kelvin.  The  existence  of  such hot haloes around massive
          elliptical  galaxies  has  been established through their X-ray
          emission.  While gas out-flowing from starburst spiral galaxies
          has  been  detected,  searches  for  hot  haloes around normal,
          quiescent spiral galaxies have so far failed, casting doubts on
          the  fundamental  physics  in  galaxy formation models. Here we
          present  the first detection of a hot, large-scale gaseous halo
          surrounding  a  normal,  quiescent  spiral  galaxy,  NGC  5746,
          alleviating   a  long-standing  problem  for  galaxy  formation
          models. In contrast to starburst galaxies, where the X-ray halo
          can  be powered by the supernova energy, there is no such power
          source  in NGC 5746. The only compelling explanation is that we
          are  here witnessing a galaxy forming from gradually in-flowing
          hot and dilute halo gas.

          Title:  Reviving  Dead  Zones  in  Accretion  Disks  by  Rossby
          Vortices at their Boundaries
          Authors: P.varniere, M.Tagger
          Comments: accepted by A&A letters
          Models  of  the  accretion  disks of Young Stellar Objects show
          that  they should not be ionized at a few AU from the star, and
          thus  not  subject  to  the  MHD  turbulence  believed to cause
          accretion.  This  has  been  suggested  to create a 'Dead Zone'
          where  accretion  remains  unexplained.  Here  we show that the
          existence  of the Dead Zone self-consistently creates a density
          profile favorable to the Rossby Wave Instability of Lovelace et
          al.  (1999).  This  instability  will create and sustain Rossby
          vortices  in  the  disk  which  could  lead  to enhanced planet
          formation.

          Journal-ref: Nature 438, 466-469 (2005)
          Models  predict that magnetic fields play a crucial role in the
          physics  of  astrophysical accretion disks and their associated
          winds  and  jets.  For example, the rotation of the disk twists
          around the rotation axis the initially vertical magnetic field,
          which  responds  by  slowing down the plasma in the disk and by
          causing  it  to  fall  towards  the  central star. The magnetic
          energy flux produced in this process points away from the disk,
          pushing the surface plasma outwards, leading to a wind from the
          disk and sometimes a collimated jet. But these predictions have
          hitherto not been supported by observations. Here we report the
          direct  detection  of  the  magnetic  field  in the core of the
          protostellar  accretion  disk  FU  Orionis.  The  surface field
          reaches  strengths  of  about  1  kG close to the centre of the
          disk,  and  it  includes  a significant azimuthal component, in
          good  agreement  with recent models. But we find that the field
          is  very  filamentary  and slows down the disk plasma much more
          than  models  predict,  which  may  explain why FU Ori fails to
          collimate its wind into a jet.

          The  most  intense  monitoring  observations  yet  made  in the
          optical  (UBV)  and near-infrared (JHK) wave bands were carried
          out  for  nearby  Seyfert1  galaxies of NGC 5548, NGC 4051, NGC
          3227,  and  NGC  7469.  Over  three  years of observations with
          MAGNUM  telescope since early 2001, clear time-delayed response
          of the K-band flux variations to the V-band flux variations was
          detected for all of these galaxies. Their H-K color temperature
          was  estimated  to  be  1500-1800  K  from  the  observed  flux
          variation gradients, which supports a view that the bulk of the
          K  flux  should  originate in the thermal radiation of hot dust
          that  surrounds  the central engine. Cross-correlation analysis
          was  performed  to  quantify  the lag time corresponding to the
          light-travel  distance  of the hot dust region from the central
          engine. The measured lag time is 47-53 days for NGC 5548, 11-18
          days  for  NGC 4051, about 20 days for NGC 3227, and 65-87 days
          for  NGC 7469. We found that the lag time is tightly correlated
          with the optical luminosity as expected from dust reverberation
          ($\Delta  t  \propto  L^{0.5}$),  while  only  weakly  with the
          central virial mass, which suggests that an inner radius of the
          dust   torus   around  the  active  nucleus  has  a  one-to-one
          correspondence  to  central  luminosity. In the lag time versus
          central luminosity diagram, the K-band lag times place an upper
          boundary  on  the  similar lag times of broad-emission lines in
          the  literature.  This  not only supports the unified scheme of
          AGNs,  but  also implies a physical transition from the BLR out
          to  the  dust  torus  that  encircles the BLR. Furthermore, our
          V-band  flux  variations  of NGC 5548 on timescales of up to 10
          days  are  found  to  correlate with X-ray variations and delay
          behind  them  by  one  or  two  days,  indicating  the  thermal
          reprocessing of X-ray emission by the central accretion flow.

          Title: Curvature effect in structured GRB jets
          Authors: J. Dyks, Bing Zhang, Y. Z. Fan
          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We study the influence of jet structure on the curvature effect
          in a GRB-lightcurve. Using a simple model of jet emissivity, we
          numerically  calculate  lightcurves  for  a  short flash from a
          relativistic  outflow  having  various  profiles of the Lorentz
          factor     and    outflowing    energy    density    (gaussian,
          core+power-law).  We  find that for "on-beam" viewing geometry,
          with  the  line of sight passing through the bright core of the
          outflow,  the  shape  of  the  lightcurve  practically does not
          depend  on  the jet structure, initially following the temporal
          slope  2+delta,  where  delta  is  the spectral index. When the
          viewing angle is larger than the core, the light curve decaying
          slope  is shallower. We discuss the implications of our results
          for the Swift data.

          Title: Resonance Overlap is Responsible for Ejecting Planets in
          Binary Systems
          Authors: Lawrence R. Mudryk, Yanqin Wu
          Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophyical Journal.
          Consists of 8 pages, 6 figures
          A  planet  orbiting  around  a  star  in a binary system can be
          ejected  if  it  lies  too far from its host star. We find that
          instability  boundaries first obtained in numerical studies can
          be   explained   by   overlap   between  sub-resonances  within
          mean-motion resonances (mostly of the j:1 type). Strong secular
          forcing from the companion displaces the centroids of different
          sub-resonances,  producing  large regions of resonance overlap.
          Planets  lying  within  these  overlapping  regions  experience
          chaotic  diffusion, which in most cases leads to their eventual
          ejection.  The  overlap region extends to shorter-period orbits
          as  either  the  companion's mass or its eccentricity increase.
          Our   analytical   calculations   reproduce   the   instability
          boundaries   observed   in  numerical  studies  and  yield  the
          following  two  additional  results.  Firstly,  the instability
          boundary  as  a  function  of eccentricity is jagged; thus, the
          widest  stable  orbit  could  be reduced from previously quoted
          values  by as much as 20%. Secondly, very high order resonances
          (e.g.,  50:3)  do  not  significantly  modify  the  instability
          boundary  despite  the  fact  that  these  weak  resonances can
          produce   slow   chaotic  diffusion  which  may  be  missed  by
          finite-duration   numerical   integrations.   We  present  some
          numerical   evidence  for  the  first  result.  More  extensive
          experiments  are  called  for to confirm these conclusions. For
          the  special  case  of circular binaries, we find that the Hill
          criterion  (based  on  the  critical Jacobi integral) yields an
          instability  boundary  that is very similar to that obtained by
          resonance overlap arguments, making the former both a necessary
          and a sufficient condition for planet instability.

          Title: Roche Lobe Sizes in Deep-MOND Gravity
          Authors: HongSheng Zhao
          Comments:  4  pages,  2  figures,  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics
          Letter, in press
          MOdified   Newtonian   Dynamics  (MOND)  is  evolving  from  an
          empirical  to  a  decent  theory respecting fundamental physics
          after   Bekenstein   (2004)  showed  that  lensing  and  Hubble
          expansion  can be modeled rigourously in a Modified Relativity.
          However, many properties of MOND are obscured by its non-linear
          Poisson's  equation.  Here  we  study the effect of tides for a
          binary  stellar  system  or  a  baryonic  satellite-host galaxy
          system.  We  show that the Roche lobe is more squashed than the
          Newtonian  case  due  to  the  anisotropic  dilation  effect in
          deep-MOND.  We  prove  analytically  that the Roche lobe volume
          scales  linearly  with  the  "true" baryonic mass ratio in both
          Newtonian   and   deep-MOND   regimes,   insensitive   to   the
          modification to the inertia mass. Hence accurate Roche radii of
          satellites  can  break  the  degeneracy of MOND and dark matter
          theory.  Globular  clusters  and  dwarf  galaxies of comparable
          luminosities  and  distances  show  a  factor of ten scatter in
          limiting   radii;   this   is   difficult  to  explain  in  any
          "mass-tracing-light" universe.

          Title:  Spectral  shape  of  the UV ionizing background and OVI
          absorbers at z ~ 1.5 towards HS0747+4259

          publication in A&A
          We  report  on  high  resolution  spectra  of  the  bright  QSO
          HS0747+4259  (zem  =  1.90,  V  =  15.8) observed to search for
          intermediate  redshift OVI absorption systems. The spectra were
          obtained  by  means of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
          (STIS)  at  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  (HST)  and  the High
          Resolution  Echelle  Spectrometer  (HIRES)  at  the  W. M. Keck
          telescope. We identify 16 OVI systems in the range 1.07 <= z <=
          1.87.  Among  them,  six systems with zabs = 1.46-1.8 exhibit a
          sufficient  number  of  lines of different ionic transitions to
          estimate the shape of the ionizing radiation field in the range
          1  Ryd  <  E  <  10  Ryd. All recovered UV ionizing spectra are
          characterized  by  the enhanced intensity at E > 3 Ryd compared
          to  the  model  spectrum of Haardt and Madau (1996). This is in
          line  with the observational evidence of a deficiency of strong
          Ly-alpha  absorbers with N(HI) > 10^{15} cm^{-2}, at z < 2. The
          UV  background shows significant local variations: the spectral
          shape  estimated  at z = 1.59 differs from that obtained at z =
          1.81  and  1.73.  A  possible  cause of these variations is the
          presence  of  a  QSO/AGN at z ~= 1.54-1.59 close to the line of
          sight.  No  features favoring the input of stellar radiation to
          the  ionizing  background  are  detected,  limiting  the escape
          fraction of the galactic UV photons to f_esc < 0.05.

          Astronomy and Astrophysics
          We  report  the  results  of  an observation of Cygnus X-1 with
          INTEGRAL,  that we combine with simultaneous radio observations
          with   the   Ryle  telescope.  Both  spectral  and  variability
          properties  of  the  source  indicate that Cygnus X-1 was in an
          Intermediate  State.  The INTEGRAL spectrum shows a high-energy
          cut-off  or  break  around  100  keV. The shape of this cut-off
          differs   from  pure  thermal  Comptonisation,  suggesting  the
          presence  of  a  non-thermal  component  at higher energies.The
          average  broad  band  spectrum  is  well  represented by hybrid
          thermal/non-thermal  Comptonisation  models.  During  the 4 day
          long  observation  the  source showed an important spectral and
          flux  variability.  A principal component analysis demonstrates
          that  most  of  this  variability  occurs through 2 independent
          modes.  The  first  mode  consists  in  changes  in the overall
          luminosity  on time scale of hours with almost constant spectra
          that  are strikingly uncorrelated with the variable radio flux.
          We  interpret  this  variability  mode  as  variations  of  the
          dissipation  rate  in  the  corona. The second variability mode
          consists  in  a pivoting of the spectrum around 10 keV. It acts
          on a longer time-scale: initially soft, the spectrum hardens in
          the  first part of the observation and then softens again. This
          pivoting pattern is strongly correlated with the radio (15 GHz)
          emission:  radio fluxes are stronger when the INTEGRAL spectrum
          is  harder.  We  propose  that  the  pivoting mode represents a
          'mini'  state  transition  from  a  nearly High Soft State to a
          nearly  Low Hard State, and back. This mini-transition would be
          caused  by  changes in the soft cooling photons flux in the hot
          Comptonising   plasma   associated  with  an  increase  of  the
          temperature  of  the accretion disc. The jet power then appears
          to be anti-correlated with the disc luminosity and unrelated to
          the coronal power.

          Title:   An  Integrated  Spectrophotometric  Survey  of  Nearby
          Star-Forming Galaxies
          Authors: John Moustakas, Robert C. Kennicutt Jr
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJS
          We present integrated optical spectrophotometry for a sample of
          417  nearby  galaxies.  Our  observations  consist of spatially
          integrated,  S/N=10-100  spectroscopy  between  3600  and  6900
          Angstroms  at  ~8  Angstroms  FWHM  resolution. In addition, we
          present  nuclear  (2.5"x2.5")  spectroscopy  for  153  of these
          objects.  Our  sample  targets a diverse range of galaxy types,
          including  starbursts,  peculiar  galaxies, interacting/merging
          systems,  dusty,  infrared-luminous galaxies, and a significant
          number of normal galaxies. We use population synthesis to model
          and  subtract  the  stellar  continuum  underlying  the nebular
          emission   lines.   This  technique  results  in  emission-line
          measurements  reliably  corrected for stellar absorption. Here,
          we  present  the  integrated  and  nuclear spectra, the nebular
          emission-line fluxes and equivalent widths, and a comprehensive
          compilation  of  ancillary data available in the literature for
          our  sample. In a series of subsequent papers we use these data
          to   study  optical  star-formation  rate  indicators,  nebular
          abundance diagnostics, the luminosity-metallicity relation, the
          dust  properties  of  normal  and  starburst  galaxies, and the
          star-formation histories of infrared-luminous galaxies.

          Title:  The nature of X-ray absorbed starburst QSOs and the QSO
          evolutionary scheme
          Authors:  M.J.Page  (UCL-MSSL),  F.J.Carrera  (IFCA),  J.Ebrero
          (IFCA), J.A. Stevens (IFCA), R.J. Ivison (ATC)
          Comments:  To  appear in the proceedings of "The X-Ray Universe
          2005" conference, 2005 Sept 26-30, El Escorial, Madrid, Spain
          In  contradiction  to the simple AGN unification schemes, there
          exists  a  significant population of broad line, z~2 QSOs which
          have   heavily  absorbed  X-ray  spectra.  These  objects  have
          luminosities  and  redshifts characteristic of the sources that
          produce  the  bulk  of  the QSO luminosity in the universe. Our
          follow  up  observations  in  the submillimetre show that these
          QSOs  are  embedded in ultraluminous starburst galaxies, unlike
          most  unabsorbed  QSOs  at the same redshifts and luminosities.
          The  radically  different star formation properties between the
          absorbed  and unabsorbed QSOs implies that the X-ray absorption
          is  unrelated  to the torus invoked in AGN unification schemes.
          The most puzzling question about these objects is the nature of
          the X-ray absorber. We present our study of the X-ray absorbers
          based   on   deep   (50-100ks)   XMM-Newton  spectroscopy.  The
          hypothesis  of  a  normal QSO continuum, coupled with a neutral
          absorber  is  strongly  rejected.  We  consider the alternative
          hypotheses  for  the absorber, originating either in the QSO or
          in   the   surrounding   starburst.   Finally  we  discuss  the
          implications  for  QSO/host  galaxy  formation,  in terms of an
          evolutionary  sequence of star formation and black hole growth.
          We  propose  that  both  processes  occur simultaneously in the
          gas-and-dust-rich  heavily  obscured centres of young galaxies,
          and  that  absorbed QSOs form a transitional stage, between the
          main obscured growth phase, and the luminous QSO.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  present  XMM-Newton  observations  of  the  Seyfert  1  AGN
          H0557-385.  We  have  conducted  a study into the warm absorber
          present  in  this source, and using high-resolution RGS data we
          find  that the absorption can be characterised by two phases: a
          phase  with log ionisation parameter xi of 0.50 (where xi is in
          units  of  ergs cm/s) and a column of 0.2e21 cm^-2, and a phase
          with  log  xi  of  1.62 and a column of 1.3e22 cm^-2. An iron K
          alpha  line  is detected. Neutral absorption is also present in
          the  source,  and  we discuss possible origins for this. On the
          assumption  that  the ionised absorbers originate as an outflow
          from  the  inner  edge  of  the  torus, we use a new method for
          finding  the  volume  filling  factor. Both phases of H0557-385
          have  small  volume  filling factors (< 1%). We also derive the
          volume  filling  factors  for  a  sample  of  23 AGN using this
          assumption  and  for  the  absorbers  with log xi > 0.7 we find
          reasonable  agreement with the filling factors obtained through
          the  alternative  method  of  equating the momentum flow of the
          absorbers  to  the  momentum  loss  of  the radiation field. By
          comparing  the  filling factors obtained by the two methods, we
          infer   that  some  absorbers  with  log  xi  <  0.7  occur  at
          significantly  larger distances from the nucleus than the inner
          edge of the torus.

          Title:  Magnetic Braking of Ap/Bp Stars: Application to Compact
          Black-Hole X-Ray Binaries
          Authors: S. Justham, S. Rappaport, Ph. Podsiadlowski
          Comments:  Accepted  by  MNRAS.  10  pages  with 5 figures (one
          reduced-quality to minimise file size)
          We  examine  the  proposal  that the subset of neutron-star and
          black-hole  X-ray  binaries  that  form  with  Ap  or  Bp  star
          companions will experience systemic angular-momentum losses due
          to    magnetic    braking,   not   otherwise   operative   with
          intermediate-mass  companion  stars.  We suggest that for donor
          stars   possessing   the   anomalously   high  magnetic  fields
          associated  with  Ap  and  Bp  stars,  a  magnetically coupled,
          irradiation-driven   stellar   wind  can  lead  to  substantial
          systemic  loss of angular-momentum. In this paper we apply this
          mechanism  to  a  specific  astrophysics  problem involving the
          formation  of  compact  black-hole binaries with low-mass donor
          stars. At present, it is not understood how these systems form,
          given  that  low-mass companion stars are not likely to provide
          sufficient  gravitational  potential  to unbind the envelope of
          the  massive  progenitor  of  the  black  hole  during  a prior
          `common-envelope'  phase.  However,  in the absence of magnetic
          braking,  such  systems tend to evolve to long orbital periods.
          We  show  that,  with  the proposed magnetic braking properties
          afforded  by  Ap and Bp companions, such a scenario can lead to
          the  formation  of  compact  black-hole  binaries  with orbital
          periods, donor masses, lifetimes, and production rates that are
          in  accord  with the observations. In spite of these successes,
          our   models  reveal  a  significant  discrepancy  between  the
          calculated  effective  temperatures  and  the observed spectral
          types   of   the  donor  stars.  Finally,  we  show  that  this
          temperature  discrepancy  would still exist for other scenarios
          invoking  initially  intermediate-mass  donor  stars,  and this
          presents a substantial unresolved mystery.

          The  physical  mechanism that allows massive stars to form is a
          major  unsolved  problem  in  astrophysics.  Stars  with masses
          $\gtsim  20$  $\msun$  reach  the  main  sequence  while  still
          embedded  in  their  natal  clouds,  and  the immense radiation
          output  they  generate  once  fusion  begins  can exert a force
          stronger  than  gravity  on  the dust and gas around them. They
          also  produce  huge  Lyman  continuum  luminosities,  which can
          ionize  and  potentially unbind their parent clouds. This makes
          massive  star  formation  a  more  daunting  problem  than  the
          formation  of  low  mass  stars.  In  this review I present the
          current  state  of  the  field,  and  discuss  the  two primary
          approaches  to  massive star formation. One holds that the most
          massive  stars  form  by  direct  collisions between lower mass
          stars  and  their  disks.  The  other approach is to see if the
          radiation  barrier can be overcome by improved treatment of the
          radiation-hydrodynamic   accretion   process.   I  discuss  the
          theoretical   background   to  each  model,  the  observational
          predictions  that can be used to test them, and the substantial
          parts of the problem that neither theory has fully addressed.

          Title:   Statistics   of  Pressure  Fluctuations  in  Decaying,

          Dynamics
          We   present   results   from   a  systematic  direct-numerical
          simulation  study  of  pressure  fluctuations  in  an unforced,
          incompressible,  homogeneous,  and isotropic, three-dimensional
          turbulent  fluid.  At  cascade  completion,  isosurfaces of low
          pressure  are  found  to  be  organised  as  slender filaments,
          whereas  the  predominant  isostructures  appear sheet-like. We
          exhibit  several  new  results,  including plots of probability
          distributions   of   the   spatial   pressure-difference,   the
          pressure-gradient    norm,   and   the   eigenvalues   of   the
          pressure-hessian tensor. Plots of the temporal evolution of the
          mean  pressure-gradient  norm,  and the mean eigenvalues of the
          pressure-hessian   tensor  are  also  exhibited.  We  find  the
          statistically  preferred  orientations between the eigenvectors
          of  the  pressure-hessian  tensor,  the  pressure-gradient, the
          eigenvectors  of the strain-rate tensor, the vorticity, and the
          velocity.  Statistical  properties of the non-local part of the
          pressure-hessian tensor are also exhibited, for the first time.
          We  present  numerical  tests  (in  the  viscous  case) of some
          conjectures  of  Ohkitani [Phys. Fluids A {\bf 5}, 2570 (1993)]

          Title:   Post-Minkowski   action   for  point-particles  and  a
          helically symmetric binary solution
          Authors: John L. Friedman (UWM), Koji Uryu (SISSA)
          Comments: 32 pages, 7 figures
          Two  Fokker  actions  and corresponding equations of motion are
          obtained for two point particles in a post-Minkowski framework,
          in   which   the  field  of  each  particle  is  given  by  the
          half-retarded   +  half-advanced  solution  to  the  linearized
          Einstein   equations.   The  first  action  is  parametrization
          invariant,   the   second  a  generalization  of  the  affinely
          parametrized  quadratic  action  for  a  relativistic particle.
          Expressions  for  a  conserved  4-momentum and angular momentum
          tensor  are obtained in terms of the particles' trajectories in
          this  post-Minkowski  approximation.  A  formal solution to the
          equations  of motion is found for a binary system with circular
          orbits.  For  a  bound  system of this kind, the post-Minkowski
          solution  is a toy model that omits nonlinear terms of relevant
          post-Newtonian  order;  and we also obtain a Fokker action that
          is  accurate  to  first  post-Newtonian order, by adding to the
          post-Minkowski  action  a  term  cubic  in the particle masses.
          Curiously, the conserved energy and angular momentum associated
          with  the  Fokker  action  are each finite and well-defined for
          this  bound  2-particle  system despite the fact that the total
          energy  and  angular  momentum  of the radiation field diverge.
          Corresponding  solutions  and conserved quantites are found for
          two  scalar charges (for electromagnetic charges we exhibit the
          solution   found   by   Schild).   For   a   broad   class   of
          parametrization-invariant  Fokker  actions and for the affinely
          parametrized   action,  binary  systems  with  circular  orbits
          satisfy  the relation $dE = \Omega dL$ (a form of the first law
          of  thermodynamics),  relating  the energy,angular velocity and
          angular momentum of nearby equilibrium configurations.

          Title: Binary neutron stars in a waveless approximation

          Comments: 4 pages, 6 figures
          Equilibria of binary neutron stars in close circular orbits are
          computed  numerically  in  a  waveless approximation to general
          relativity.  The full Einstein equation is solved on an initial
          hypersurface  to  obtain  an  asymptotically  flat  form of the
          4-metric  and  an  extrinsic  curvature  whose  time derivative
          vanishes  in a comoving frame. Two independent numerical codes,
          one  based  on  a  finite  difference  method,  the  other on a
          spectral  method,  are  developed,  and solution sequences that
          model inspiraling binary neutron stars during the final several
          orbits  are  successfully  computed.  The binding energy of the
          system  near  its  final orbit deviates from earlier results of
          third   post-Newtonian   and   of  spatially  conformally  flat
          calculations.  The  new solutions may serve as initial data for
          merger simulations and as members of quasiequilibrium sequences
          to  generate  gravitational  wave  templates,  and  may improve
          estimates of the gravitational-wave cutoff frequency set by the
          last inspiral orbit.

          Title:  The nature of X-ray absorbed starburst QSOs and the QSO
          evolutionary scheme
          Authors:  M.J.Page  (UCL-MSSL),  F.J.Carrera  (IFCA),  J.Ebrero
          (IFCA), J.A. Stevens (IFCA), R.J. Ivison (ATC)
          Comments:  To  appear in the proceedings of "The X-Ray Universe
          2005" conference, 2005 Sept 26-30, El Escorial, Madrid, Spain
          In  contradiction  to the simple AGN unification schemes, there
          exists  a  significant population of broad line, z~2 QSOs which
          have   heavily  absorbed  X-ray  spectra.  These  objects  have
          luminosities  and  redshifts characteristic of the sources that
          produce  the  bulk  of  the QSO luminosity in the universe. Our
          follow  up  observations  in  the submillimetre show that these
          QSOs  are  embedded in ultraluminous starburst galaxies, unlike
          most  unabsorbed  QSOs  at the same redshifts and luminosities.
          The  radically  different star formation properties between the
          absorbed  and unabsorbed QSOs implies that the X-ray absorption
          is  unrelated  to the torus invoked in AGN unification schemes.
          The most puzzling question about these objects is the nature of
          the X-ray absorber. We present our study of the X-ray absorbers
          based   on   deep   (50-100ks)   XMM-Newton  spectroscopy.  The
          hypothesis  of  a  normal QSO continuum, coupled with a neutral
          absorber  is  strongly  rejected.  We  consider the alternative
          hypotheses  for  the absorber, originating either in the QSO or
          in   the   surrounding   starburst.   Finally  we  discuss  the
          implications  for  QSO/host  galaxy  formation,  in terms of an
          evolutionary  sequence of star formation and black hole growth.
          We  propose  that  both  processes  occur simultaneously in the
          gas-and-dust-rich  heavily  obscured centres of young galaxies,
          and  that  absorbed QSOs form a transitional stage, between the
          main obscured growth phase, and the luminous QSO.

          Title: XMM-Newton observations of the Seyfert 1 AGN H0557-385

          G.Branduardi-Raymont (UCL-MSSL), A.J.Blustin (UCL-MSSL)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  present  XMM-Newton  observations  of  the  Seyfert  1  AGN
          H0557-385.  We  have  conducted  a study into the warm absorber
          present  in  this source, and using high-resolution RGS data we
          find  that the absorption can be characterised by two phases: a
          phase  with log ionisation parameter xi of 0.50 (where xi is in
          units  of  ergs cm/s) and a column of 0.2e21 cm^-2, and a phase
          with  log  xi  of  1.62 and a column of 1.3e22 cm^-2. An iron K
          alpha  line  is detected. Neutral absorption is also present in
          the  source,  and  we discuss possible origins for this. On the
          assumption  that  the ionised absorbers originate as an outflow
          from  the  inner  edge  of  the  torus, we use a new method for
          finding  the  volume  filling  factor. Both phases of H0557-385
          have  small  volume  filling factors (< 1%). We also derive the
          volume  filling  factors  for  a  sample  of  23 AGN using this
          assumption  and  for  the  absorbers  with log xi > 0.7 we find
          reasonable  agreement with the filling factors obtained through
          the  alternative  method  of  equating the momentum flow of the
          absorbers  to  the  momentum  loss  of  the radiation field. By
          comparing  the  filling factors obtained by the two methods, we
          infer   that  some  absorbers  with  log  xi  <  0.7  occur  at
          significantly  larger distances from the nucleus than the inner
          edge of the torus.

          Title:  Magnetic Braking of Ap/Bp Stars: Application to Compact
          Black-Hole X-Ray Binaries
          Authors: S. Justham, S. Rappaport, Ph. Podsiadlowski
          Comments:  Accepted  by  MNRAS.  10  pages  with 5 figures (one
          reduced-quality to minimise file size)
          We  examine  the  proposal  that the subset of neutron-star and
          black-hole  X-ray  binaries  that  form  with  Ap  or  Bp  star
          companions will experience systemic angular-momentum losses due
          to    magnetic    braking,   not   otherwise   operative   with
          intermediate-mass  companion  stars.  We suggest that for donor
          stars   possessing   the   anomalously   high  magnetic  fields
          associated  with  Ap  and  Bp  stars,  a  magnetically coupled,
          irradiation-driven   stellar   wind  can  lead  to  substantial
          systemic  loss of angular-momentum. In this paper we apply this
          mechanism  to  a  specific  astrophysics  problem involving the
          formation  of  compact  black-hole binaries with low-mass donor
          stars. At present, it is not understood how these systems form,
          given  that  low-mass companion stars are not likely to provide
          sufficient  gravitational  potential  to unbind the envelope of
          the  massive  progenitor  of  the  black  hole  during  a prior
          `common-envelope'  phase.  However,  in the absence of magnetic
          braking,  such  systems tend to evolve to long orbital periods.
          We  show  that,  with  the proposed magnetic braking properties
          afforded  by  Ap and Bp companions, such a scenario can lead to
          the  formation  of  compact  black-hole  binaries  with orbital
          periods, donor masses, lifetimes, and production rates that are
          in  accord  with the observations. In spite of these successes,
          our   models  reveal  a  significant  discrepancy  between  the
          calculated  effective  temperatures  and  the observed spectral
          types   of   the  donor  stars.  Finally,  we  show  that  this
          temperature  discrepancy  would still exist for other scenarios
          invoking  initially  intermediate-mass  donor  stars,  and this
          presents a substantial unresolved mystery.

          Equilibria of binary neutron stars in close circular orbits are
          computed  numerically  in  a  waveless approximation to general
          relativity.  The full Einstein equation is solved on an initial
          hypersurface  to  obtain  an  asymptotically  flat  form of the
          4-metric  and  an  extrinsic  curvature  whose  time derivative
          vanishes  in a comoving frame. Two independent numerical codes,
          one  based  on  a  finite  difference  method,  the  other on a
          spectral  method,  are  developed,  and solution sequences that
          model inspiraling binary neutron stars during the final several
          orbits  are  successfully  computed.  The binding energy of the
          system  near  its  final orbit deviates from earlier results of
          third   post-Newtonian   and   of  spatially  conformally  flat
          calculations.  The  new solutions may serve as initial data for
          merger simulations and as members of quasiequilibrium sequences
          to  generate  gravitational  wave  templates,  and  may improve
          estimates of the gravitational-wave cutoff frequency set by the
          last inspiral orbit.

          Title:  The nature of X-ray absorbed starburst QSOs and the QSO
          evolutionary scheme
          Authors:  M.J.Page  (UCL-MSSL),  F.J.Carrera  (IFCA),  J.Ebrero
          (IFCA), J.A. Stevens (IFCA), R.J. Ivison (ATC)
          Comments:  To  appear in the proceedings of "The X-Ray Universe
          2005" conference, 2005 Sept 26-30, El Escorial, Madrid, Spain
          In  contradiction  to the simple AGN unification schemes, there
          exists  a  significant population of broad line, z~2 QSOs which
          have   heavily  absorbed  X-ray  spectra.  These  objects  have
          luminosities  and  redshifts characteristic of the sources that
          produce  the  bulk  of  the QSO luminosity in the universe. Our
          follow  up  observations  in  the submillimetre show that these
          QSOs  are  embedded in ultraluminous starburst galaxies, unlike
          most  unabsorbed  QSOs  at the same redshifts and luminosities.
          The  radically  different star formation properties between the
          absorbed  and unabsorbed QSOs implies that the X-ray absorption
          is  unrelated  to the torus invoked in AGN unification schemes.
          The most puzzling question about these objects is the nature of
          the X-ray absorber. We present our study of the X-ray absorbers
          based   on   deep   (50-100ks)   XMM-Newton  spectroscopy.  The
          hypothesis  of  a  normal QSO continuum, coupled with a neutral
          absorber  is  strongly  rejected.  We  consider the alternative
          hypotheses  for  the absorber, originating either in the QSO or
          in   the   surrounding   starburst.   Finally  we  discuss  the
          implications  for  QSO/host  galaxy  formation,  in terms of an
          evolutionary  sequence of star formation and black hole growth.
          We  propose  that  both  processes  occur simultaneously in the
          gas-and-dust-rich  heavily  obscured centres of young galaxies,
          and  that  absorbed QSOs form a transitional stage, between the
          main obscured growth phase, and the luminous QSO.

          Title: XMM-Newton observations of the Seyfert 1 AGN H0557-385

          G.Branduardi-Raymont (UCL-MSSL), A.J.Blustin (UCL-MSSL)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  present  XMM-Newton  observations  of  the  Seyfert  1  AGN
          H0557-385.  We  have  conducted  a study into the warm absorber
          present  in  this source, and using high-resolution RGS data we
          find  that the absorption can be characterised by two phases: a
          phase  with log ionisation parameter xi of 0.50 (where xi is in
          units  of  ergs cm/s) and a column of 0.2e21 cm^-2, and a phase
          with  log  xi  of  1.62 and a column of 1.3e22 cm^-2. An iron K
          alpha  line  is detected. Neutral absorption is also present in
          the  source,  and  we discuss possible origins for this. On the
          assumption  that  the ionised absorbers originate as an outflow
          from  the  inner  edge  of  the  torus, we use a new method for
          finding  the  volume  filling  factor. Both phases of H0557-385
          have  small  volume  filling factors (< 1%). We also derive the
          volume  filling  factors  for  a  sample  of  23 AGN using this
          assumption  and  for  the  absorbers  with log xi > 0.7 we find
          reasonable  agreement with the filling factors obtained through
          the  alternative  method  of  equating the momentum flow of the
          absorbers  to  the  momentum  loss  of  the radiation field. By
          comparing  the  filling factors obtained by the two methods, we
          infer   that  some  absorbers  with  log  xi  <  0.7  occur  at
          significantly  larger distances from the nucleus than the inner
          edge of the torus.

          Title:  Magnetic Braking of Ap/Bp Stars: Application to Compact
          Black-Hole X-Ray Binaries
          Authors: S. Justham, S. Rappaport, Ph. Podsiadlowski
          Comments:  Accepted  by  MNRAS.  10  pages  with 5 figures (one
          reduced-quality to minimise file size)
          We  examine  the  proposal  that the subset of neutron-star and
          black-hole  X-ray  binaries  that  form  with  Ap  or  Bp  star
          companions will experience systemic angular-momentum losses due
          to    magnetic    braking,   not   otherwise   operative   with
          intermediate-mass  companion  stars.  We suggest that for donor
          stars   possessing   the   anomalously   high  magnetic  fields
          associated  with  Ap  and  Bp  stars,  a  magnetically coupled,
          irradiation-driven   stellar   wind  can  lead  to  substantial
          systemic  loss of angular-momentum. In this paper we apply this
          mechanism  to  a  specific  astrophysics  problem involving the
          formation  of  compact  black-hole binaries with low-mass donor
          stars. At present, it is not understood how these systems form,
          given  that  low-mass companion stars are not likely to provide
          sufficient  gravitational  potential  to unbind the envelope of
          the  massive  progenitor  of  the  black  hole  during  a prior
          `common-envelope'  phase.  However,  in the absence of magnetic
          braking,  such  systems tend to evolve to long orbital periods.
          We  show  that,  with  the proposed magnetic braking properties
          afforded  by  Ap and Bp companions, such a scenario can lead to
          the  formation  of  compact  black-hole  binaries  with orbital
          periods, donor masses, lifetimes, and production rates that are
          in  accord  with the observations. In spite of these successes,
          our   models  reveal  a  significant  discrepancy  between  the
          calculated  effective  temperatures  and  the observed spectral
          types   of   the  donor  stars.  Finally,  we  show  that  this
          temperature  discrepancy  would still exist for other scenarios
          invoking  initially  intermediate-mass  donor  stars,  and this
          presents a substantial unresolved mystery.

          Authors:   Mark   R.   Krumholz  (Department  of  Astrophysical
          Sciences, Princeton University)
          Comments:  15 pages, 3 figures, ASP conference style; to appear

          The  physical  mechanism that allows massive stars to form is a
          major  unsolved  problem  in  astrophysics.  Stars  with masses
          $\gtsim  20$  $\msun$  reach  the  main  sequence  while  still
          embedded  in  their  natal  clouds,  and  the immense radiation
          output  they  generate  once  fusion  begins  can exert a force
          stronger  than  gravity  on  the dust and gas around them. They
          also  produce  huge  Lyman  continuum  luminosities,  which can
          ionize  and  potentially unbind their parent clouds. This makes
          massive  star  formation  a  more  daunting  problem  than  the
          formation  of  low  mass  stars.  In  this review I present the
          current  state  of  the  field,  and  discuss  the  two primary
          approaches  to  massive star formation. One holds that the most
          massive  stars  form  by  direct  collisions between lower mass
          stars  and  their  disks.  The  other approach is to see if the
          radiation  barrier can be overcome by improved treatment of the
          radiation-hydrodynamic   accretion   process.   I  discuss  the
          theoretical   background   to  each  model,  the  observational
          predictions  that can be used to test them, and the substantial
          parts of the problem that neither theory has fully addressed.

          Title:   Statistics   of  Pressure  Fluctuations  in  Decaying,
          Isotropic Turbulence
          Authors: Chirag Kalelkar
          Comments: 9 pages, 29 figures, submitted to Physical Review E
          Subj-class:  Statistical  Mechanics;  Fluid  Dynamics;  Chaotic
          Dynamics
          We   present   results   from   a  systematic  direct-numerical
          simulation  study  of  pressure  fluctuations  in  an unforced,
          incompressible,  homogeneous,  and isotropic, three-dimensional
          turbulent  fluid.  At  cascade  completion,  isosurfaces of low
          pressure  are  found  to  be  organised  as  slender filaments,
          whereas  the  predominant  isostructures  appear sheet-like. We
          exhibit  several  new  results,  including plots of probability
          distributions   of   the   spatial   pressure-difference,   the
          pressure-gradient    norm,   and   the   eigenvalues   of   the
          pressure-hessian tensor. Plots of the temporal evolution of the
          mean  pressure-gradient  norm,  and the mean eigenvalues of the
          pressure-hessian   tensor  are  also  exhibited.  We  find  the
          statistically  preferred  orientations between the eigenvectors
          of  the  pressure-hessian  tensor,  the  pressure-gradient, the
          eigenvectors  of the strain-rate tensor, the vorticity, and the
          velocity.  Statistical  properties of the non-local part of the
          pressure-hessian tensor are also exhibited, for the first time.
          We  present  numerical  tests  (in  the  viscous  case) of some
          conjectures  of  Ohkitani [Phys. Fluids A {\bf 5}, 2570 (1993)]
          and  Ohkitani  and  Kishiba  [Phys. Fluids {\bf 7}, 411 (1995)]
          concerning  the  pressure-hessian  and the strain-rate tensors,
          for   the  unforced,  incompressible,  three-dimensional  Euler
          equations.

          Title:   Post-Minkowski   action   for  point-particles  and  a
          helically symmetric binary solution
          Authors: John L. Friedman (UWM), Koji Uryu (SISSA)
          Comments: 32 pages, 7 figures
          Two  Fokker  actions  and corresponding equations of motion are
          obtained for two point particles in a post-Minkowski framework,
          in   which   the  field  of  each  particle  is  given  by  the
          half-retarded   +  half-advanced  solution  to  the  linearized
          Einstein   equations.   The  first  action  is  parametrization
          invariant,   the   second  a  generalization  of  the  affinely
          parametrized  quadratic  action  for  a  relativistic particle.
          Expressions  for  a  conserved  4-momentum and angular momentum
          tensor  are obtained in terms of the particles' trajectories in
          this  post-Minkowski  approximation.  A  formal solution to the
          equations  of motion is found for a binary system with circular
          orbits.  For  a  bound  system of this kind, the post-Minkowski
          solution  is a toy model that omits nonlinear terms of relevant
          post-Newtonian  order;  and we also obtain a Fokker action that
          is  accurate  to  first  post-Newtonian order, by adding to the
          post-Minkowski  action  a  term  cubic  in the particle masses.
          Curiously, the conserved energy and angular momentum associated
          with  the  Fokker  action  are each finite and well-defined for
          this  bound  2-particle  system despite the fact that the total
          energy  and  angular  momentum  of the radiation field diverge.
          Corresponding  solutions  and conserved quantites are found for
          two  scalar charges (for electromagnetic charges we exhibit the
          solution   found   by   Schild).   For   a   broad   class   of
          parametrization-invariant  Fokker  actions and for the affinely
          parametrized   action,  binary  systems  with  circular  orbits
          satisfy  the relation $dE = \Omega dL$ (a form of the first law
          of  thermodynamics),  relating  the energy,angular velocity and
          angular momentum of nearby equilibrium configurations.

          Title:  Time  Variability in the X-ray Nebula Powered by Pulsar
          B1509-58
          Authors: T. DeLaney, B. M. Gaensler, J. Arons, M. J. Pivovaroff
          Comments: accepted to ApJ, 14 pages, 8 figures
          We  use  new  and  archival Chandra and ROSAT data to study the
          time  variability  of  the  X-ray emission from the pulsar wind
          nebula  (PWN) powered by PSR B1509-58 on timescales of one week
          to  twelve years. There is variability in the size, number, and
          brightness of compact knots appearing within 20" of the pulsar,
          with  at  least one knot showing a possible outflow velocity of
          ~0.6c  (assuming  a  distance  to  the  source of 5.2 kpc). The
          transient  nature  of  these  knots  may indicate that they are
          produced  by  turbulence in the flows surrounding the pulsar. A
          previously  identified  prominent  jet  extending  12 pc to the
          southeast  of  the pulsar increased in brightness by 30% over 9
          years;  apparent outflow of material along this jet is observed
          with a velocity of ~0.5c. However, outflow alone cannot account
          for   the   changes  in  the  jet  on  such  short  timescales.
          Magnetohydrodynamic  sausage or kink instabilities are feasible
          explanations  for  the jet variability with timescale of ~1.3-2
          years.  An  arc structure, located 30"-45" north of the pulsar,
          shows  transverse  structural  variations  and  appears to have
          moved  inward  with  a velocity of ~0.03c over three years. The
          overall structure and brightness of the diffuse PWN exterior to
          this  arc  and excluding the jet has remained the same over the
          twelve  year  span.  The  photon indices of the diffuse PWN and
          possibly   the  jet  steepen  with  increasing  radius,  likely
          indicating synchrotron cooling at X-ray energies.

          Title:  Probing for evolutionary links between local ULIRGs and
          QSOs from NIR spectroscopy

          Comments:  To  appear  in the "QSO Host Galaxies: Evolution and
          Environment"  conference  proceedings;  meeting held in Leiden,
          August 2005
          We  present a study of the dynamical evolution of Ultraluminous
          Infrared   Galaxies  (ULIRGs),  merging  galaxies  of  infrared
          luminosity  >10^12 L_sun. During our Very Large Telescope large
          program,  we have obtained ISAAC near-infrared, high-resolution
          spectra  of  54  ULIRGs (at several merger phases) and 12 local
          Palomar-Green  QSOs  to investigate whether ULIRGs go through a
          QSO  phase  during  their  evolution. One possible evolutionary
          scenario  is  that  after  nuclear  coalescence, the black hole
          radiates  close  to  Eddington to produce QSO luminosities. The
          mean  stellar  velocity  dispersion  that  we  measure from our
          spectra  is  similar (~160 km/s) for 30 post-coalescence ULIRGs
          and  7 IR-bright QSOs. The black holes in both populations have
          masses  of  order 10^7-10^8 M_sun (calculated from the relation
          to  the  host  dispersion) and accrete at rates >0.5 Eddington.
          Placing  ULIRGs  and IR-bright QSOs on the fundamental plane of
          early-type  galaxies  shows  that they are located on a similar
          region  (that  of  moderate-mass  ellipticals),  in contrast to

          comparison  of  the  ULIRG  and QSO host kinematical properties
          indicates  that  (some) ULIRGs may undergo a QSO phase in their
          evolutionary  history  before  they settle down as ellipticals,
          further  data  on non-IR excess QSOs are necessary to test this
          scenario.

          Title:  GMRT  observations  of  the  field  of  INTEGRAL  X-ray
          sources- II (newly discovered hard X-ray sources)
          Authors:  M. Pandey, A. P. Rao, R. Manchanda, P. Durouchoux, C.

          Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures. Accepted A&A
          We  have  conducted  low-frequency  radio observations with the
          Giant  Metrewave  Radio  Telescope  (GMRT) of 40 new hard X-ray
          sources  discovered  by the INTEGRAL satellite. This survey was
          conducted  in  order,  to  study  radio  emissions  from  these
          sources,  to  provide  precise  position  and  to  identify new
          microquasar  candidates.  From our observations we find that 24
          of  the X-ray sources have radio candidates within the INTEGRAL
          error  circle.  Based  on the radio morphology, variability and
          information available from different wavelengths, we categorize
          them as seventeen Galactic sources (4 unresolved, 7 extended, 6
          extended  sources  in  diffuse  region) and seven extragalactic
          sources  (2  unresolved,  5  extended).  Detailed  account  for
          seventeen  of  these  sources  was  presented in earlier paper.
          Based  on the radio data for the remaining sources at 0.61 GHz,
          and the available information from NVSS, DSS, 2MASS and NED, we
          have  identified possible radio counterparts for the hard X-ray
          sources.  The  three unresolved sources, viz IGR J17303$-$0601,
          IGR  J17464$-$3213,  and  IGR  J18406$-$0539  are  discussed in
          detail.  These  sources  have been identified as X-ray binaries
          with  compact  central  engine and variable in X-ray and in the
          radio,   and   are  most  likely  microquasar  candidates.  The
          remaining  fourteen  sources have extended radio morphology and
          are either diffuse Galactic regions or extragalactic in origin.

          Title:  Imaging  and  integral field spectroscopy of shocked H2
          around G25.65+1.05

          MNRAS
          Near-infrared  imaging  of the emission from molecular hydrogen
          is  a  powerful method for discovering outflows in star-forming
          regions.  We  present  new  near-infrared images, long slit and
          integral  field  spectroscopy  of  the ultra-compact HII region
          G25.65+1.05.  These new observations reveal shocked H2 emission
          associated  with  a bipolar outflow from a young high mass star
          at  the  centre  of  the source. The physical parameters of the
          outflow  are  discussed  and  compared with outflows from lower
          mass stars.

          Title:  Revealing  the  mid-infrared emission structure of IRAS
          16594-4656 and IRAS 07027-7934

          resolution) accepted for publication in ApJ
          TIMMI2  diffraction-limited mid-infrared images of a multipolar
          proto-planetary   nebula  IRAS  16594-4656  and  a  young  [WC]
          elliptical  planetary  nebula  IRAS  07027-7934  are presented.
          Their  dust  shells  are  for  the  first  time  resolved (only
          marginally  in  the  case  of  IRAS 07027-7934) by applying the
          Lucy-Richardson  deconvolution  algorithm  to  the  data, taken
          under   exceptionally  good  seeing  conditions  (<0.5").  IRAS
          16594-4656  exhibits  a  two-peaked morphology at 8.6, 11.5 and
          11.7  microns which is mainly attributed to emission from PAHs.
          Our observations suggest that the central star is surrounded by
          a  toroidal  structure  observed  edge-on with a radius of 0.4"
          (~640 AU at an assumed distance of 1.6 kpc) with its polar axis
          at  P.A.~80 degrees, coincident with the orientation defined by
          only  one of the bipolar outflows identified in the HST optical
          images.  We suggest that the material expelled from the central
          source is currently being collimated in this direction and that
          the  multiple  outflow  formation  has  not  been  coeval. IRAS
          07027-7934   shows   a  bright,  marginally  extended  emission
          (FWHM=0.3") in the mid-infrared with a slightly elongated shape
          along   the  N-S  direction,  consistent  with  the  morphology
          detected by HST in the near-infrared. The mid-infrared emission
          is  interpreted  as  the result of the combined contribution of
          small,  highly  ionized PAHs and relatively hot dust continuum.
          We propose that IRAS 07027-7934 may have recently experienced a
          thermal pulse (likely at the end of the AGB) which has produced
          a radical change in the chemistry of its central star.

          Title:   Stochastic   Background  from  Coalescences  of  NS-NS
          Binaries
          Authors: T. Regimbau, J.A de Freitas Pacheco
          Comments: 22 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          In  this  work,  numerical simulations were used to investigate
          the    gravitational    stochastic   background   produced   by
          coalescences  occurring up to $z \sim 5$ of double neutron star
          systems.  The  cosmic  coalescence  rate was derived from Monte
          Carlo methods using the probability distributions for forming a
          massive  binary and to occur a coalescence in a given redshift.
          A  truly  continuous  background  is produced by events located
          only   beyond  the  critical  redshift  $z_*  =  0.23$.  Events
          occurring  in  the redshift interval $0.027<z<0.23$ give origin
          to  a  "popcorn"  noise,  while  those arising closer than $z =
          0.027$   produce   a  shot  noise.  The  gravitational  density
          parameter $\Omega_{gw}$ for the continuous background reaches a
          maximum around 670 Hz with an amplitude of $1.1\times 10^{-9}$,
          while  the  "popcorn" noise has an amplitude about one order of
          magnitude  higher  and the maximum occurs around a frequency of
          1.2  kHz.  The  signal  is  below  the sensitivity of the first
          generation  of  detectors but could be detectable by the future
          generation  of  ground  based  interferometers. Correlating two
          coincident  advanced-LIGO detectors or two EGO interferometers,
          the expected S/N ratio are respectively 0.5 and 10.

          Title: A survey of weak MgII absorbers at redshift <z>=1.78
          Authors: Ryan S. Lynch, Jane C. Charlton, Tae-Sun Kim
          Comments: 25 pages, 14 figures, to be published in ApJ 01 March
          2006, v639, 1
          The exact nature of weak MgII absorbers (those with W_r(2796) <
          0.3  A)  is  a matter of debate, but most are likely related to
          areas of local star formation or supernovae activity outside of
          giant   galaxies.  Using  18  QSO  spectra  obtained  with  the
          Ultra-Violet  Echelle  Spectrograph  (UVES)  on  the Very Large
          Telescope  (VLT),  we  have  conducted  a  survey for weak MgII
          absorbers  at 1.4 < z < 2.4. We searched a redshift path length
          of  8.51, eliminating regions badly contaminated by atmospheric
          absorption  so  that  the  survey  is close to 100% complete to
          W_r(2796)  =  0.02  A.  We  found  a total of 9 weak absorbers,
          yielding a number density of absorbers of dN/dz = 1.06 +/- 0.12
          for  0.02  <=  W_r(2796) < 0.3 A. Narayanan et al. (2005) found
          dN/dz  =  1.00  +/-  0.20  at  0 < z < 0.3 and Churchill et al.
          (1999) found dN/dz = 1.74 +/- 0.10 at 0.4 < z < 1.4. Therefore,
          the  population  of weak MgII absorbers appears to peak at z~1.
          We  explore  the  expected evolution of the absorber population
          subject  to a changing extragalactic background radiation (EBR)
          from  z  = 0.9 to z = 1.78 (the median redshift of our survey),
          and  find that the result is higher than the observed value. We
          point  out  that the peak epoch for weak MgII absorption at z~1
          may  coincide  with  the peak epoch of global star formation in
          the dwarf galaxy environment.

          appear in 01 April 2006 issue of the Astrophysical Journal
          (Abridged)    We    present   spectroscopic   and   photometric
          observations of the eclipsing system V1061 Cyg (P = 2.35 days).
          We  show  that  it  is a hierarchical triple in which the third
          star   is  visible  in  the  spectra.  We  combine  the  radial
          velocities   for   the  three  stars,  times  of  eclipse,  and
          intermediate   astrometric  data  from  the  HIPPARCOS  mission
          (abscissa  residuals)  to  establish  the elements of the outer
          orbit  (P  =  15.8  yr)  and accurate values for the masses and
          radii  (1-2%  errors)  and  the  effective  temperatures of the
          binary  components.  Both  stars  are rotating rapidly and have
          their  rotation synchronized with the orbital motion. There are
          signs  of activity including strong X-ray emission and possibly
          spots.  Current  stellar  evolution  models agree well with the
          properties of the primary, but show a very large discrepancy in
          the radius of the secondary: the predicted values are about 10%
          smaller than observed (a 5-sigma effect). Also, the temperature
          is cooler than predicted by some 200 K. These discrepancies are
          quite  remarkable  given  that the star is only 7% less massive
          than  the  Sun, the calibration point of all stellar models. We
          identify  the chromospheric activity as the likely cause of the
          effect.  Inactive  stars agree very well with the models, while
          active  ones  such  as  V1061  Cyg Ab appear systematically too
          large and too cool. Theory provides an understanding of this in
          terms  of  the  strong magnetic fields commonly associated with
          stellar   activity,  which  tend  to  inhibit  convective  heat
          transport.

          Kokubo, Daisuke Kinoshita

          Mechanics,  eds. E. Kokubo, H. Arakida, and T. Yamamoto. Tokyo,
          Japan, 2003
          Recent  observations  (Burnes2002,Veillet2002,Margot2002a) have
          revealed   an  unexpectedly  high  binary  fraction  among  the
          Trans-Neptunian  Objects  (TNOs) that populate the Kuiper Belt.
          The   TNO  binaries  are  strikingly  different  from  asteroid
          binaries  in four respects (Veillet2002): their frequency is an
          order  of  magnitude larger, the mass ratio of their components
          is  closer  to  unity,  and  their  orbits are wider and highly
          eccentric.  Two  explanations  have  been  proposed  for  their
          formation,   one  assuming  large  numbers  of  massive  bodies
          (Weidenschilling2002),  and one assuming large numbers of light
          bodies  (Goldreich2002).  We  argue  that  both assumptions are
          unwarranted,  and we show how TNO binaries can be produced from
          a  modest  number  of  intermediate-mass  bodies  of  the  type
          predicted  by  the  gravitational  instability  theory  for the
          formation  of  planetesimals (Goldreich and Ward1973). We start
          with  a  TNO  binary  population similar to the asteroid binary
          population,  but  subsequently  modified by three-body exchange
          reactions,  a  process that is far more efficient in the Kuiper
          belt,  because  of  the much smaller tidal perturbations by the
          Sun.   Our   mechanism  can  naturally  account  for  all  four
          characteristics  that  distinguish  TNO binaries from main-belt
          asteroid binaries.

          Title:   Cannonballs  in  the  context  of  Gamma  Ray  Bursts:
          Formation sites ?
          Authors: Jan E. Staff, Christian Fendt, Rachid Ouyed
          Comments: 10 pages, 12 figures
          We  investigate possible formation sites of the cannonballs (in
          the  gamma  ray  bursts  context) by calculating their physical
          parameters,  such  as  density,  magnetic field and temperature
          close  to  the  origin.  Our  results favor scenarios where the
          cannonballs  form  as  instabilities  (knots) within magnetized
          jets  from hyperaccreting disks. These instabilities would most
          likely  set  in  beyond  the light cylinder where flow velocity
          with  Lorentz  factors  as  high  as  2000 can be achieved. Our
          findings  challenge the cannonball model of gamma ray bursts if
          these  indeed  form  inside  core-collapse  supernovae (SNe) as
          suggested  in  the  literature; unless hyperaccreting disks and
          the  corresponding jets are common occurrences in core-collapse
          SNe.

          Title: Birth and fate of hot-Neptune planets
          Authors: I. Baraffe, Y. Alibert, G. Chabrier, W. Benz
          Comments:  4 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and
          Astrophysics
          This  paper  presents a consistent description of the formation
          and  the  subsequent evolution of gaseous planets, with special
          attention   to   short-period,   low-mass  hot-Neptune  planets
          characteristic  of  $\mu$  Ara-like  systems. We show that core
          accretion including migration and disk evolution and subsequent
          evolution  taking  into  account  irradiation  and  evaporation
          provide  a viable formation mechanism for this type of strongly
          irradiated light planets. At an orbital distance $a \simeq$ 0.1
          AU, this revised core accretion model leads to the formation of
          planets  with  total  masses  ranging  from $\sim$ 14 $\mearth$
          (0.044  $\mjup$)  to  $\sim$  400 $\mearth$ (1.25 $\mjup$). The
          newly  born  planets  have  a dense core of $\sim$ 6 $\mearth$,
          independent of the total mass, and heavy element enrichments in
          the envelope, $M_{\rm Z,env}/M_{\rm env} $, varying from 10% to
          80%  from  the  largest to the smallest planets. We examine the
          dependence   of  the  evolution  of  the  born  planet  on  the
          evaporation rate due to the incident XUV stellar flux. In order
          to  reach  a  $\mu$  Ara-like  mass ($\sim$ 14 $\mearth$) after
          $\sim  $  1  Gyr,  the  initial planet mass must range from 166
          $\mearth$  ($\sim$  0.52  $\mjup$)  to  about 20 $\mearth$, for
          evaporation   rates   varying   by   2   orders  of  magnitude,
          corresponding  to  90%  to  20% mass loss during evolution. The
          presence  of  a core and heavy elements in the envelope affects
          appreciably  the  structure and the evolution of the planet and
          yields  $\sim  8%-9%$ difference in radius compared to coreless
          objects  of  solar  composition  for Saturn-mass planets. These
          combinations  of  evaporation  rates  and internal compositions
          translate  into  different  detection  probabilities,  and thus
          different   statistical   distributions  for  hot-Neptunes  and
          hot-Jupiters.

          Title: On the Detection of Artefacts in Spectro-astrometry
          Authors: E. Brannigan, M. Takami, A. Chrysostomou, J. Bailey
          Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We   demonstrate  that  artificial  bipolar  structure  can  be
          detected   using   spectro-astrometry  when  the  point  spread
          function  (PSF)  of  a  point  source  suffers  distortion in a
          relatively  wide  slit. Spectro-astrometry is a technique which
          allows  us  to  probe  the  spatial  structure  of astronomical
          sources  on  milliarcsecond scales making it possible to detect
          close  binaries  and  to  study  the geometry and kinematics of
          outflowing  gas  on  scales much smaller than the seeing or the
          diffraction  limit  of  the  telescope. It is demonstrated that
          distortion  of  the  PSF,  caused  by  tracking  errors  of the
          telescope  or  unstable  active  optics  during an exposure can
          induce  artificial  signals  which  may  be misinterpreted as a
          real-astrometric  signal.  Using simulations we show that these
          may be minimised by using a narrow slit relative to the seeing.
          Spectra  should  be  obtained  at  anti-parallel  slit position
          angles (eg. 0 and 180 degrees) for comparison in order to allow
          artificial signatures to be identified.

          laboratory  to  probe  the velocity and density profile of such
          winds.  Here,  we have measured the variation of the absorption
          column  density  along  with other spectral parameters over the
          binary  orbit  for  two HMXBP in elliptical orbits, as observed
          with  the  Rossi  X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the BeppoSAX
          satellites.  A spherically symmetric wind profile was used as a
          model  to compare the observed column density variations. In 4U
          1538-52,  we  find  the  model  corroborating the observations;
          whereas in GX 301-2, the stellar wind appears to be very clumpy
          and  a  smooth  symmetric  wind model seems to be inadequate in
          explaining the variation in column density.

          and Astrophysics
          We present a NIR analysis of a sample of H2 outflows from young
          embedded sources to compare the physical properties and cooling
          mechanisms  of  the  different  flows.  The sample comprises 23
          outflows   driven   by   Class   0   and   I   sources   having
          low-intermediate  luminosity.  We  have  obtained  narrow  band
          images   in   H2  2.12um  and  FeII  1.64um  and  spectroscopic
          observations  in  the  range  1-2.5um. H2 line ratios have been
          used  to estimate the visual extinction and average temperature
          of  the molecular gas. Av values range from 2 to 15mag; average
          temperatures  range  between 2000 and 4000K. In several knots a
          stratification  of temperatures is found with maximum values up
          to  5000K.  Such  a stratification is more commonly observed in
          those  knots which also show FeII emission, while a thermalized
          gas  at  a  single  temperature  is  generally  found  in knots
          emitting only in molecular lines. Combining narrow band imaging
          with  the parameters derived from the spectral analysis, we are
          able to measure the total luminosity of the H2 and FeII shocked
          regions  in  each  flow.  H2  is  the  major IR coolant with an
          average L(H2)/L(FeII) ratio of 10^{-2}. 83% of the sources have
          a  L(H2)/L(bol) ratio of 0.04, irrespective of the Class of the
          driving   source,   while  a  smaller  group  of  sources  have
          L(H2)/L(bol)  an  order  of magnitude smaller.Such a separation
          reveals  the non-homogeneous behaviour of ClassI, where sources
          with  very  different  outflow  activity  can be found. This is
          consistent with other studies showing that among ClassI one can
          find   objects  with  different  accretion  properties  and  it
          demonstrates  that  the  H2  power in the jet can be a powerful
          tool to identify the most active sources of this class.

          Title:  Do  fast  winds  dominate  the  dynamics  of  planetary

          A  review  of  recent  observations  of  the  kinematics of six
          objects  that  represent  the  broad  range of phenomena called
          planetary  nebulae  (PNe) is presented. It is demonstrated that
          Hubble-type outflows are predominant, consequently it is argued
          that  ballistic  ejections  from  the  central stars could have
          dominated  the  dynamical effects of the fast winds in several,
          and  perhaps all, of these objects. An alternative possibility,
          which  involves an extension to the Interacting Winds model, is
          considered   to  explain  the  dynamics  of  evolved  planetary
          nebuale.

          Title: Multiplicity-Study of Exoplanet Host Stars
          Authors: M. Mugrauer, R. Neuhuser, T.Mazeh, E. Guenther
          Comments: 3 pages, 1 figure
          We  carry  out a systematic search campaign for wide companions
          of  exoplanet  host  stars  to study their multiplicity and its
          influence on the long-term stability and the orbital parameters
          of  the  exoplanets.  We  have already found 6 wide companions,
          raising  the  number  of confirmed binaries among the exoplanet
          host  stars  to  20  systems.  We  have  also searched for wide
          companions  of Gl86, the first known exoplanet host star with a
          white  dwarf companion. Our Sofi/NTT observations are sensitive
          to  substellar  companions  with  a minimum-mass of 35 Mjup and
          clearly  rule  out  further  stellar  companions with projected
          separations between 40 and 670AU.

          Title: Probing dark matter with X-ray binaries
          Authors: Walter Dehnen, Andrew King (Leicester)
          Comments: 3 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Low-mass  X-ray  binaries  (LMXBs),  which occur in old stellar
          populations,  have  velocities  exceeding those of their parent
          distribution  by at least 20 km/s. This makes them ideal probes
          for  dark  matter,  in  particular in dwarf spheroidals (dSph),
          where  the  LMXBs  should  penetrate  well  outside the visible
          galaxy.  We  argue  that  the  most  likely  explanation of the
          observation  of  LMXBs  in the Sculptor dSph by Maccarone et al
          (2005)  is  the presence of a dark matter halo of >~ 10^9 Msun,
          corresponding  to  a  total-mass  to  light  ratio  of  >~  600
          (M/L_V)_sun.  In  this case there should be an extended halo of
          LMXBs which may be observable.

          Title: A model for the X-ray absorption in Compton--thin AGN
          Authors: Alessandra Lamastra, G. Cesare Perola, Giorgio Matt
          Comments: Astronomy and Astrophysics, in press
          The fraction of AGN with photoelectric absorption in the X-rays
          ranging  from  NH  of  10^{22}  up  to  about  10^{24}  cm^{-2}
          (Compton-thin)  appears observationally to be anticorrelated to
          their  luminosity  Lx.  This recently found evidence is used to
          investigate  the  location  of the absorbing gas. The molecular
          torus  invoked  in  the unified picture of AGN, while it can be
          regarded  as  confirmed  on  several  grounds  to  explain  the
          Compton-thick  objects,  do not conform to this new constraint,
          at  least  in  its  physical models as developed so far. In the
          frame  of  observationally  based evidence that in Compton-thin
          sources  the  absorbing  gas might be located far away from the
          X-ray source, it is shown that the gravitational effects of the
          black  hole  (BH) on the molecular gas in a disk, within 25-450
          pc  (depending on the BH mass, from 10^6 to 10^9 M_solar, leads
          naturally to the observed anticorrelation, under the assumption
          of  a  statistical  correlation between the BH mass and Lx. Its
          normalization  is  also  reproduced  provided  that the surface
          density,  Sigma,  of  this  gas  is  larger  than about 150-200
          M_solar pc^{-2}, and assuming that the bolometric luminosity is
          one  tenth  of the Eddington limit. Interestingly, the required
          values  are  consistent  with the value of the 300 pc molecular
          disk in our own galaxy, namely 500 M_solar pc^{-2}. In a sample
          of  nearby galaxies from the BIMA SONG survey, it is found that
          half  of the objects have central Sigma larger than 150 M_solar
          pc${-2}.  Given  the  simplicity  of  the  proposed model, this
          finding   is   very  encouraging,  waiting  for  future  higher
          resolution surveys in CO on more distant galaxies.

          Title: Chaplygin gas may prevent big trip
          Authors: Jos A. Jimnez Madrid (IAA, Granada & IMAFF, Madrid)
          Comments: 6 pages, no figures, uses Revtex
          This  paper  deals  with  the  study  of  the  accretion  of  a
          generalized    Chaplygin    gas    with   equation   of   state
          $p=-A/\rho^\alpha$  onto  wormholes. We have obtained that when
          dominant  energy  condition  is  violated  the size of wormhole
          increases  with  the scale factor up to a given plateau. On the
          regime  where  the  dominant  energy condition is satisfied our
          model  predicts  a  steady  decreasing  of the wormhole size as
          generalized  Chaplygin  gas is accreted. Our main conclusion is
          that  the  big trip mechanism is prevented in a large region of
          the physical parameters of the used model.

          We present the first images of the 691.473 GHz CO J=6-5 line in
          a  protoplanetary  disk,  obtained  along with the 690 GHz dust
          continuum,  toward  the classical T Tauri star TW Hya using the
          Submillimeter  Array.  Imaging  in  the CO J=6-5 line reveals a
          rotating  disk,  consistent  with  previous  observations of CO
          J=3-2  and  2-1 lines. Using an irradiated accretion disk model
          and  2D Monte Carlo radiative transfer, we find that additional
          surface  heating  is  needed to fit simultaneously the absolute
          and relative intensities of the CO J=6-5, 3-2 and 2-1 lines. In
          particular,  the  vertical gas temperature gradient in the disk
          must  be  steeper  than that of the dust, mostly likely because
          the  CO emission lines probe nearer to the surface of the disk.
          We  have  used an idealized X-ray heating model to fit the line
          profiles  of CO J=2-1 and 3-2 with Chi-square analysis, and the
          prediction  of  this  model yields CO J=6-5 emission consistent
          with the observations.

          Title:   Polarization  of  light  from  warm  clouds  above  an
          accretion disk: effects of strong-gravity near a black hole
          Authors: J. Horak, V. Karas
          Comments: Accepted for publication in PASJ; 7 pages, 4 figures
          We  study  polarization  from scattering of light on a cloud in
          radial  motion  along  the  symmetry axis of an accretion disk.
          Radiation  drag  from  the disk and gravitational attraction of
          the  central  black hole are taken into account, as well as the
          effect  of  the  cloud  cooling  in  the  radiation field. This
          provides  us  with  a  self-consistent  toy-model for predicted
          lightcurves, including the linear polarization that arises from
          the  scattering.  Strong gravitational lensing creates indirect
          images;  these  are  formed  by photons that originate from the
          disk,  get  backscattered  onto  the  photon circular orbit and
          eventually  redirected  towards  an  observer.  Under  suitable
          geometrical   conditions   the  indirect  photons  may  visibly
          influence   the   resulting   magnitude   of  polarization  and
          light-curve  profiles.  Relevant  targets  are  black  holes in
          active  galactic  nuclei  and stellar-mass Galactic black-holes
          exhibiting episodic accretion/ejection events.

          Title: Roche Lobes in the Second Post-Newtonian Approximation
          Authors: Sasa Ratkovic, Madappa Prakash, James M. Lattimer
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          Close  binary  systems of compact stars, due to the emission of
          gravitational  radiation,  may evolve into a phase in which the
          less  massive star transfers mass to its companion. We describe
          mass  transfer  by  using  the model of Roche lobe overflow, in
          which  mass  is  transferred  through  the first, or innermost,
          Lagrange  point.  Under  conditions in which gravity is strong,
          the  shapes  of  the equipotential surfaces and the Roche lobes
          are  modified  compared  to  the  Newtonian  case.  We  present
          calculations  of  the  Roche  lobe  utilizing  the second order
          post-Newtonian (2PN) approximation in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner
          gauge.  Heretofore,  calculations  of  the  Roche lobe geometry
          beyond  the  Newtonian  case have not been available. Beginning
          from  the  general  N-body  Lagrangian  derived  by  Damour and
          Schaffer,  we develop the Lagrangian for a test particle in the
          vicinity of two massive compact objects. As an exact result for
          the   transverse-traceless   part  of  the  Lagrangian  is  not
          available, we devise an approximation that is valid for regions
          close  to  the  less  massive star. We calculate the Roche lobe
          volumes, and provide a simple fitting formula for the effective
          Roche  lobe  radius  analogous  to  that for the Newtonian case
          furnished  by  Eggleton.  In contrast to the Newtonian case, in
          which  the  effective  Roche  radius depends only upon the mass
          ratio  $q=m_1/m_2$,  in  the  2PN case the effective Roche lobe
          radius also depends on the ratio $z=2 (m_1+m_2)/a$ of the total
          mass and the orbital separation.

          Title: The Role of the Equation of State in Binary Mergers
          Authors: Sasa Ratkovic, Madappa Prakash, James M.Lattimer
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          Binary  mergers  involving  black  holes and neutron stars have
          been   proposed   as  major  sources  of  gravitational  waves,
          r--process   nucleosynthesis,   and   gamma  ray  bursters.  In
          addition,  they  represent  an  important, and possibly unique,
          observable   that   could   distinguish   between   normal  and
          self--bound  neutron  stars.  These  two families of stars have
          distinctly  different mass--radius relationships resulting from
          their  equations  of  state  which can be revealed during their
          mergers  if  stable mass transfer ensues. We consider two cases
          of  gravitational-radiation induced binary mergers: (i) a black
          hole  and  a  normal  neutron star, and (ii) a black hole and a
          self-bound  strange  quark  matter  star.  We  extend  previous
          Newtonian    analyses   to   incorporate   the   pseudo-general
          relativistic Paczy\'nski-Wiita potential or a potential correct
          to second--order post-Newtonian order in
          Arnowitt--Deser--Misner   coordinates.   These  potentials  are
          employed  to study both the orbital evolution of the binary and
          the Roche lobe geometry that determines when and if stable mass
          transfer  between  the  components  is possible. The Roche lobe
          geometry  with  pseudo-general  relativistic  or post-Newtonian
          potentials  has  not  heretofore  been considered. Our analysis
          shows that differences in the evolution of normal neutron stars
          and  strange  quark  matter  stars are significant and could be
          detected  in  gravity waves. Both the amplitude and frequencies
          of  the  wave pattern are affected. In addition, details of the
          equation  of  state  for either normal neutron stars or strange
          quark stars may be learned. A single merger could reveal one or
          two   individual   points  of  the  mass-radius  relation,  and
          observations of several mergers could map a significant portion
          of this relation.

          Hydrodynamical  simulations of semi-detached, polytropic binary
          stars  are  presented  in  an  effort  to  study  the onset and
          stability   of   dynamical   mass   transfer  events.  Initial,
          synchronously rotating equilibrium models are constructed using
          a  self-consistent-field  technique  and  then  evolved with an
          Eulerian  hydrodynamics code in a fully self-consistent manner.
          We  describe  code  improvements  introduced  over the past few
          years  that  permit us to follow dynamical mass-transfer events
          through  more  than  30  orbits.  Mass-transfer  evolutions are
          presented   for   two   different   initial  configurations:  A
          dynamically   unstable   binary   with   initial   mass   ratio
          (donor/accretor) $q_0 = 1.3$ that leads to a complete merger in
          $\sim  10$  orbits; and a double-degenerate binary with initial
          mass ratio $q_0 = 0.5$ that, after some initial unstable growth
          of  mass  transfer, tends to separate as the mass-transfer rate
          levels off.

          We  observed a new and poorly studied cataclysmic variable (CV)
          SDSS  J123813.73-033933.0  to  determine its classification and
          binary  parameters.  Simultaneous time-resolved photometric and
          spectroscopic  observations  were carried out to conduct period
          analysis  and  Doppler tomography mapping. From radial velocity
          measurements of the Ha line we determined its orbital period to
          be  0.05592+/-0.00035$  days  (80.53min). This period is longer
          than  the first estimate of 76 min by Szkody et al. (2003), but
          still  at  the  very edge of the period limit for hydrogen-rich
          CVs.  The  spectrum  shows  double-peaked Balmer emission lines
          flanked   by  strong  broad  Balmer  absorption,  indicating  a
          dominant  contribution  by the white dwarf primary star, and is
          similar  to  the  spectra  of short-period low-mass transfer WZ
          Sge-like  systems.  The  photometric  light curve shows complex
          variability.  The system undergoes cyclic brightening up to 0.4
          mags,  which  are  of  semi-periodic nature with periods of the
          order  of 8-12 hours. We also detect a 40.25 min variability of
          ~0.15   mag  corresponding  to  half  of  the  orbital  period.
          Amplitude  of  the latter increases with the cyclic brightening
          of  the  system. We discuss the variable accretion rate and its

          Title:  Discovery  of  Counter-Rotating  Gas  in  the  Galaxies
          NGC1596  and  NGC3203 and the Incidence of Gas Counter-Rotation
          in S0 Galaxies

          We  have  identified two new galaxies with gas counter-rotation
          (NGC1596  and  NGC3203) and have confirmed similar behaviour in
          another  one (NGC128), this using results from separate studies
          of  the  ionized-gas  and  stellar kinematics of a well-defined
          sample  of  30 edge-on disc galaxies. Gas counter-rotators thus
          represent  10+/-5%  of  our  sample, but the fraction climbs to
          21+/-11%  when only lenticular (S0) galaxies are considered and
          to  27+/-13%  for  S0s  with  detected  ionized-gas only. Those
          fractions are consistent with but slightly higher than previous
          studies.  A compilation from well-defined studies of S0s in the
          literature   yields   fractions   of   15+/-4%   and   23+/-5%,
          respectively. Although mainly based on circumstantial evidence,
          we  argue  that  the  counter-rotating gas originates primarily
          from  minor  mergers  and  tidally-induced transfer of material
          from  nearby objects. Assuming isotropic accretion, twice those
          fractions  of  objects  must  have undergone similar processes,
          underlining  the  importance  of  (minor)  accretion for galaxy
          evolution.  Applications  of  gas  counter-rotators  to  barred
          galaxy dynamics are also discussed.

          Title: The periods of the intermediate polar RX J0153.3+7446
          Authors: A.J. Norton, J.D. Tanner (The Open University)
          Comments: 4 pages, submitted to A&A Letters
          We  present  the first optical photometry of the counterpart to
          the  candidate intermediate polar RX J0153.3+7446. This reveals
          an  optical  pulse  period  of  2333s +/- 5s. Reanalysis of the
          previously  published  ROSAT  X-ray  data reveals that the true
          X-ray  pulse  period is probably 1974s +/- 30s, rather than the
          1414  s  previously  reported.  Given that the previously noted
          orbital period of the system is 3.94 h, we are able to identify
          the X-ray pulse period with the white dwarf spin period and the
          optical  pulse  period  with  the  rotation period of the white
          dwarf  in the binary reference frame, as commonly seen in other
          intermediate  polars.  We  thus confirm that RX J0153.3+7446 is
          indeed a typical intermediate polar.

          Title: NLTE analyses of sdB stars: progress and prospects
          Authors: N. Przybilla, M.F. Nieva, H. Edelmann
          Comments:  8  pages, 5 figures; to appear in: Baltic Astronomy,
          Proceedings  of  the  Second  Meeting  on Hot Subdwarf Stars an
          Related Objects, La Palma, June 2005
          We  report  on preliminary results of a hybrid non-LTE analysis
          of   high-resolution,   high-S/N  spectra  of  the  helium-rich
          subdwarf  B  star  Feige49  and  the  helium-poor sdB HD205805.
          Non-LTE  effects  are  found  to  have  a notable impact on the
          stellar  parameter  and  abundance determination. In particular
          the   HeI  lines  show  significant  deviations  from  detailed
          balance, with the computed equivalent widths strengthened by up
          to ~35%. Non-LTE abundance corrections for the metals (C, N, O,
          Mg,  S)  are  of  the  order  ~0.05-0.25 dex on the mean, while
          corrections  of  up  to  ~0.7  dex  are  derived for individual
          transitions. The non-LTE approach reduces systematic trends and
          the  statistical  uncertainties in the abundance determination.
          Consequently,  non-LTE  analyses  of a larger sample of objects
          have  the  potential  to  put  much  tighter constraints on the
          formation   history  of  the  different  sdB  populations  than
          currently discussed.

          Proceedings  of  the  Second  Meeting  on Hot Subdwarf Stars an
          Related Objects, La Palma, June 2005
          Two  evolutionary  scenarios  are proposed for the formation of
          extreme  helium  stars:  a  post-AGB star suffering from a late
          thermal   pulse,   or  the  merger  of  two  white  dwarfs.  An
          identification  of  the  evolutionary  channel  for  individual
          objects   has   to  rely  on  surface  abundances.  We  present
          preliminary  results  from  a non-LTE analysis of CNO, Mg and S
          for   two  unique  objects,  V652  Her  and  HD144941.  Non-LTE
          abundance  corrections for these elements range from negligible
          values   to   ~0.7  dex.  Non-LTE  effects  typically  lead  to
          systematic  shifts in the abundances relative to LTE and reduce
          the uncertainties.

          Title:  Accreting White Dwarfs among the Planetary Nebulae Most
          Luminous in [O III]5007 Emission
          Authors: Noam Soker (Technion, Israel)
          Comments: The Astrophysical Journal, in press (5 pages)
          I  propose  that  some  of  the most luminous planetary nebulae
          (PNs)  are  actually  proto-PNs,  where a companion white dwarf
          (WD)   accretes  mass  at  a  relatively  high  rate  from  the
          post-asymptotic  giant branch star that blew the nebula. The WD
          sustains  a  continuous nuclear burning and ionizes the nebula.
          The  WD is luminous enough to make the dense nebula luminous in
          the  [O  III]5007  line,  In young stellar populations these WD
          accreting   systems   account   for  a  small  fraction  of  [O
          III]-luminous   PNs,  but  in  old  stellar  populations  these
          binaries   might   account  for  most,  or  even  all,  of  the
          [OIII]-luminous  PNs.  This might explain the puzzling constant
          cutoff (maximum) [O III]5007 luminosity of the planetary nebula
          luminosity function across different galaxy types.

          Title:  Possible  evidence  for  "dark radiation" from Big Bang
          Nucleosynthesis Data
          Authors: V.V. Flambaum, E.V. Shuryak
          We  address  the  emerging  discrepancy  between  the  Big Bang
          Nucleosynthesis  data  and standard cosmology, which asks for a
          bit longer evolution time. If this effect is real, one possible
          implication  (in  a framework of brane cosmology model) is that
          there  is  a ``dark radiation'' component which is negative and
          makes  few  percents  of  ordinary  matter  density. If so, all
          scales  of  this  model  can  be  fixed, provided brane-to-bulk
          leakage problem is solved.

          Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to MNRAS
          We  present  a 19 ks Chandra ACIS-S observation of the globular
          cluster  Terzan  1.  Fourteen  sources  are detected within 1.4
          arcmin  of the cluster center with 2 of these sources predicted
          to  be  not  associated  with  the  cluster  (background AGN or
          foreground   objects).   The   neutron  star  X-ray  transient,
          X1732-304, has previously been observed in outburst within this
          globular cluster with the outburst seen to last for at least 12
          years.  Here  we  find  4  sources that are consistent with the
          ROSAT  position for this transient, but none of the sources are
          fully  consistent  with the position of a radio source detected
          with  the VLA that is likely associated with the transient. The
          most  likely  candidate  for  the  quiescent counterpart of the
          transient  has  a  relatively  soft  spectrum and an unabsorbed
          0.5-10  keV luminosity of 2.6E32 ergs/s, quite typical of other
          quiescent  neutron  stars. Assuming standard core cooling, from
          the  quiescent  flux  of  this source we predict long (>400 yr)
          quiescent   episodes   to  allow  the  neutron  star  to  cool.
          Alternatively,  enhanced  core  cooling processes are needed to
          cool  down the core. However, if we do not detect the quiescent
          counterpart  of  the  transient this gives an unabsorbed 0.5-10
          keV  luminosity  upper  limit  of  8E31 ergs/s. We also discuss
          other X-ray sources within the globular cluster.
          From  the  estimated  stellar  encouter rate of this cluster we
          find  that  the  number  of  sources we detect is significantly
          higher  than  expected  by  the  relationship  of Pooley et al.
          (2003).

          Comments: 9 pages, 3 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          Using  RXTE  archival  observations  of  4U 1907+09 between MJD
          $\sim$51980 and $\sim$52340, we found the source, after a $\sim
          0$  spin-down  rate  episode,  to be spinning-down at a rate of
          $(-1.887\mp  0.042)\times  10^{-14}$  Hz s$^-1$ which is $\sim$
          0.60 times lower than the long term ($\sim 14$ years) spin-down
          rate (Baykal et al. 2001). Our pulse frequency measurements for
          the   first   time   resolved   significant   pulse   frequency
          fluctuations  since  the  discovery  of the source. We have not
          observed  any  significant  change  in  X-ray flux and spectral
          parameters  after  the spin-down rate of the source changed. We
          stated  that  the  apparent uncorrelation between the spin-down
          rate  and  the X-ray flux might be related to the fact that the
          source  accretes  not  only  via transient retrograde accretion
          disc  but  also  via the stellar wind of the companion, so that
          the  variation  of  the  accretion  rate from the disc does not
          cause significant variation in the observed X-ray flux. Lack of
          significant  change in spectral parameters was interpreted as a
          sign  of  the fact that the change in the spin-down rate of the
          source  is  not  related  to  a  significant  variation  in the
          accretion geometry.

          Title:   Two-dimensional   radiation-hydrodynamic   model   for
          limit-cycle oscillations of luminous accretion disks
          Authors: K. Ohsuga
          Comments:  6  pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          (ApJ 01 April 2006, v640, 2 issue)
          We  investigate  the time evolution of luminous accretion disks
          around    black    holes,    conducting   the   two-dimensional
          radiation-hydrodynamic   simulations.   We   adopt   the  alpha
          prescription  for the viscosity. The radial-azimuthal component
          of  viscous  stress tensor is assumed to be proportional to the
          total  pressure  in  the  optically thick region, while the gas
          pressure in the optically thin regime. The viscosity parameter,
          alpha, is taken to be 0.1. We find the limit-cycle variation in
          luminosity  between  high  and low states. When we set the mass
          input  rate from the outer disk boundary to be 100 L_E/c^2, the
          luminosity suddenly rises from 0.3L_E to 2L_E, where L_E is the
          Eddington  luminosity. It decays after retaining high value for
          about  40  s.  Our  numerical results can explain the variation
          amplitude  and  duration of the recurrent outbursts observed in
          microquasar,  GRS  1915+105. We show that the multi-dimensional
          effects play an important role in the high-luminosity state. In
          this  state,  the  outflow  is  driven  by the strong radiation
          force,  and some part of radiation energy dissipated inside the
          disk  is swallowed by the black hole due to the photon-trapping
          effects.  This  trapped  luminosity  is  comparable to the disk
          luminosity.  We  also calculate two more cases: one with a much
          larger   accretion   rate  than  the  critical  value  for  the
          instability  and the other with the viscous stress tensor being
          proportional  to  the gas pressure only even when the radiation
          pressure   is   dominant.   We  find  no  quasi-periodic  light
          variations  in  these cases. This confirms that the limit-cycle
          behavior  found  in  the  simulations  is  caused  by  the disk
          instability.

          Title:  The  Very  Early  Gamma-ray Burst Afterglows Powered by
          Structured Jets
          Authors: T. Yan, D. M. Wei, Y. Z. Fan
          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          If  X-ray flashes (XRFs) and X-ray rich Gamma-ray Bursts(XRRGs)
          have  the  same  origin  with  Gamma-ray  Bursts (GRBs) but are
          viewed  from  larger  angles  of  structured  jets, their early
          afterglows   may   differ   from   those   of  GRBs.  When  the
          ultra-relativistic   outflow   interact  with  the  surrounding
          medium,  there  are  two shocks formed, one is a forward shock,
          the  other  is  a  reverse  shock.  In  this paper we calculate
          numerically   the  early  afterglow  powered  by  uniform  jet,
          Gaussian  jet  and  power-law  jet in the forward-reverse shock
          scenario.  A  set  of differential equations are used to govern
          the dynamical evolution and synchrotron self-Compton effect has
          been  taken  into account to calculate the emission. In uniform
          jets,   the  very  early  afterglows  of  XRRGs  and  XRFs  are
          significantly lower than GRBs and the observed peak times of RS
          emission  are longer in interstellar medium environment. The RS
          components  in XRRGs and XRFs are difficult to be detected. But
          in stellar wind, the reduce of very early flux and the delay of
          RS  peak time are not so remarkable. In nonuniform jet(Gaussian
          jet  and  power-law jet), where there are emission materials on
          the  line  of  sight,  the  very  early  light  curve resembles
          isotropic-equivalent  ejecta  in  general  although the RS flux
          decay   index   shows   notable   deviation   if   the   RS  is
          relativistic(in stellar wind).

          Title: Reduced Wolf-Rayet Line Luminosities at Low Metallicity
          Authors: Paul A Crowther, L J Hadfield (Sheffield)
          Comments: 14 pages, 12 figures, accepted for A&A
          New  NTT/EMMI  spectrophotometry  of  single WN2-5 stars in the
          Magellanic  Clouds  are  presented,  from  which HeII 4686 line
          luminosities  have been derived, and compared with observations
          of  other  Magellanic  Cloud  WR stars. SMC WN3-4 stars possess
          line  luminosities which are a factor of 4 times lower than LMC
          counterparts,  incorporating  several  binary  SMC WN3-4 stars.
          Similar  results  are  found  for  WN5-6 stars, despite reduced
          statistics,  incorporating  observations  of  single  LMC WN5-9
          stars.  CIV  5808 line luminosities of carbon sequence WR stars
          in  the  SMC  and  IC1613  (both WO subtypes) are a factor of 3
          lower  than LMC WC stars from Mt Stromlo/DBS spectrophotometry,
          although  similar results are also obtained for the sole LMC WO
          star.  We  demonstrate  how  reduced  line  luminosities at low
          metallicity  follow  naturally  if WR winds are Z-dependent, as
          recent  results  suggest.  We  apply  mass  loss-Z  scalings to
          atmospheric  non-LTE  models  of  Milky Way and LMC WR stars to
          predict  the wind signatures of WR stars in the metal-poor star
          forming  WR  galaxy  IZw18.  WN HeII 4686 line luminosities are
          7-20  times  lower  than  in  Z-rich  counterparts of identical
          bolometric luminosity, whilst WC CIV 5808 line luminosities are
          3-6  times  lower.  Significant He^+ Lyman continuum fluxes are
          predicted  for  Z-poor  early-type  WR stars. Consequently, our
          results  suggest  the need for larger population of WR stars in
          IZw18  than  is  presently  assumed, particularly for WN stars,
          potentially posing a severe challenge to evolutionary models at
          very  low  Z.  Finally, reduced wind strengths from WR stars at
          low  Z  impacts upon the immediate circumstellar environment of
          long  duration  GRB  afterglows,  particularly  since  the host
          galaxies of high-redshift GRBs tend to be Z-poor.

          Title: Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays from Sequestered X Bursts
          Authors: Peter L. Biermann, Paul H. Frampton
          Comments: 12 pages LaTeX
          Assuming that there is no GZK (Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin) cut-off
          and  that  super-GZK  cosmic  rays  correlate  with AGN (Active
          Galactic  Nuclei)  at  cosmological distances, it is speculated
          that  a relic superheavy particle (X) has its lifetime enhanced
          by  sequestration  in an extra dimension. This sequestration is
          assumed  to  be  partially  liberated  by  proximity of merging
          supermassive black holes in an AGN, temporarily but drastically
          reducing  the  lifetime,  thus stimulating an X burst. Based on
          sequestration  of  the  decay  products  of  X,  a  speculative
          explanation of the observed $\gamma/N$ ratio is proposed.

          Title: SS 433 : a phenomenon imitating a Wolf-Rayet star

          ((1)  SAp  CEA/Saclay,  France; (2) LAOG, Grenoble, France; (3)

          Comments:  12  pages, 6 figures (3 colour figures), accepted by
          A&A (in press)
          We   present   mid-infrared   (2-12   micron)  spectra  of  the
          microquasar SS 433 obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory
          (spectroscopic  mode of ISOPHOT and ISOCAM). We compare them to
          the  spectra  of four Wolf-Rayet stars: WR78, WR134, WR136, and
          WR147  in  the same wavelength range. The mid-infrared spectrum
          of  SS  433  mainly shows HI and HeI emission lines and is very
          similar  to  the  spectrum of WR147, a WN8(h)+B0.5V binary. The
          2-12  micron  continuum  emission  of  SS  433  corresponds  to
          optically   thin   and   partially  optically  thick  free-free
          emission,  from  which  we  calculate a mass loss rate of 2-3 x
          10^{-4} Msun/yr if the wind is homogeneous and a third of these
          values  if  it  is  clumped.  This  is consistent with a strong
          stellar  wind from a WN star. However, following recent studies
          concluding  that  the  mass  donor  star  of  SS  433  is not a
          Wolf-Rayet  star,  we  propose  that this strong wind out flows
          from  a geometrically thick envelope of material that surrounds
          the  compact  object  like  a stellar atmosphere, imitating the
          Wolf-Rayet phenomenon. This wind could also wrap the mass donor
          star,  and  at larger distances (~ 40 AU), it might form a dust
          envelope from which the thermal emission, detected with ISOPHOT
          at  25  micron  and  60 micron, would originate. This wind also
          probably  feeds  the  material  that  is ejected in the orbital
          plane  of  the  binary  system  and  that  forms the equatorial
          outflow detected in radio at distances > 100 AU.

          We  present  preliminary  results  from  the  first part of the
          LuckyCam late M-dwarf binarity survey. We survey a sample of 48
          nearby  ($<$40  pc)  and  red (M5-M9) stars with the novel high
          angular   resolution  visible  light  imaging  technique  Lucky
          Imaging, in only 8 hours of 2.5m telescope time. We discover 10
          new  binaries;  although the survey is sensitive to brown dwarf
          companions  none  are detected. The orbital radius distribution
          of  the  newly  discovered  binaries  broadly  matches  that of
          previous  detections  by  other groups, although we do discover
          one wide binary at ~40AU.

          Aims.  Filamentary  structures of early type stars are found to
          be  a  common feature of the Magellanic Clouds formed at an age
          of  about  0.9-2*10^8  yr. As we go to younger ages these large
          structures  appear  fragmented  and  sooner or later form young
          clusters  and  associations.  In  the  optical  domain  we have
          detected  56  such  large structures of young objects, known as
          stellar  complexes in the LMC for which we give coordinates and
          dimensions.  We  also  investigate  star formation activity and
          evolution  of  these  stellar  complexes  and  define  the term
          "starburst  region".  Methods.  IR  properties of these regions
          have  been  investigated  using  IRAS  data. A colour-magnitude
          diagram  (CMD) and a two-colour diagram from IRAS data of these
          regions  ware  compared with observations of starburst galaxies
          and  cross-matching  with HII regions and SNRs was made . Radio
          emission  maps  at  8.6-GHz  and the CO (1 to 0) line were also
          cross  correlated  with  the  map  of  the  stellar  complexes.
          Results.  It  has  been  found  that  nearly 1/3 of the stellar
          complexes  are  extremely active resembling the IR behaviour of
          starburst  galaxies  and  HII  regions. These stellar complexes
          illustrating   such   properties  are  called  here  "starburst
          regions".  They  host  an  increased  number of HII regions and
          SNRs.  The  main starburst tracers are their IR luminosity (F60
          well  above 5.4 Jy) and the 8.6-GHz radio emission. Finally the
          evolution of all stellar complexes is discussed based on the CO
          emission.

          Title: Constraints on Alternatives to Supermassive Black Holes
          Authors: M. Coleman Miller (University of Maryland)
          Comments: 5 pages including 1 figure, accepted by MNRAS
          Observations of the centers of galaxies continue to evolve, and
          it is useful to take a fresh look at the constraints that exist
          on  alternatives  to supermassive black holes at their centers.
          We  discuss  constraints  complementary to those of Maoz (1998)
          and   demonstrate   that  an  extremely  wide  range  of  other
          possibilities  can  be  excluded. In particular, we present the
          new  argument  that  for  the velocity dispersions inferred for
          many galactic nuclei, even binaries made of point masses cannot
          stave off core collapse because hard binaries are so tight that
          they  merge via emission of gravitational radiation before they
          can  engage  in  three-body  or four-body interactions. We also
          show that under these conditions core collapse leads inevitably
          to  runaway  growth  of a central black hole with a significant
          fraction  of  the initial mass, regardless of the masses of the
          individual  stars.  For  clusters  of  noninteracting  low-mass
          objects   (from   low-mass   stars  to  elementary  particles),
          relaxation  of  stars  and compact objects that pass inside the
          dark  region  will be accelerated by interactions with the dark
          mass.  If  the  dark  region is instead a self-supported object
          such  as a fermion ball, then if stellar-mass black holes exist
          they  will collide with the object, settle, and consume it. The
          net  result  is  that the keyhole through which alternatives to
          supermassive black holes must pass is substantially smaller and
          more contrived than it was even a few years ago.

          Title:  Spatially-resolved  mid-infrared  spectroscopy  of  NGC
          1068: the nature and distribution of the nuclear material

          2006, ApJ, 640, 2
          We   present  spatially-resolved,  near-diffraction-limited  10
          micron spectra of the nucleus of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068,
          obtained  with  Michelle, the mid-IR imager and spectrometer on
          the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope. The spectra cover the nucleus
          and  the  central  6.0"  x  0.4"  of  the ionization cones at a
          spatial  resolution of approximately 0.4" (approx. 30 parsecs).
          The  spectra  extracted  in  0.4"  steps  along the slit reveal
          striking   variations  in  continuum  slope,  silicate  feature
          profile   and   depth,   and  fine  structure  line  fluxes  on
          subarcsecond  scales,  illustrating in unprecedented detail the
          complexity  of  the  circumnuclear  regions  of  this galaxy at
          mid-IR  wavelengths.  A  comparison  of  photometry  in various
          apertures  reveals  two  distinct components: a compact (radius
          <15  pc),  bright  source  within  the  central 0.4" x 0.4" and
          extended,  lower  brightness  emission. We identify the compact
          source  with the AGN obscuring torus, and the diffuse component
          with  the  AGN-heated  dust  in the ionization cones. While the
          torus  emission dominates the flux observed in the near-IR, the
          mid-IR  flux  measured  with  apertures larger than about 1" is
          dominated  instead  by  the  dust  emission from the ionization
          cones.  Many  previous attempts to determine the torus spectral
          energy   distribution  are  thus  likely  to  be  significantly
          affected  by  contamination  from  the  extended  emission. The
          observed spectrum of the compact source is compared with clumpy
          torus  models, which require most of the mid-IR emitting clouds
          to  be  located  within a few parsecs of the central engine. We
          also  present  a UKIRT/CGS4 5 micron spectrum covering the R(0)
          --  R(4)  lines  of  the fundamental vibration-rotation band of
          12CO.  None  of  these lines was detected, and we discuss these
          non-detections  in  terms of the filling factor and composition
          of the nuclear clouds. (Abridged)

          Title: First Resolved Images of the Mira AB Symbiotic Binary at

          Authors:     Lynn     D.     Matthews,    Margarita    Karovska
          (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)
          Comments: accepted to ApJ Letters
          We   report   the  first  spatially  resolved  radio  continuum
          measurements  of  the Mira AB symbiotic binary system, based on
          observations  obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA). This is
          the  first  time  that  a  symbiotic  binary  has been resolved
          unambiguously   at  centimeter  wavelengths.  We  describe  the
          results  of  VLA  monitoring  of  both  stars  over a ten month
          period,  together with constraints on their individual spectral
          energy   distributions,   variability,   and   radio   emission
          mechanisms.  The  emission  from  Mira  A  is  consistent  with
          originating  from  a radio photosphere, while the emission from
          Mira  B  appears  best  explained as free-free emission from an
          ionized circumstellar region ~(1-10)x10**13 cm in radius.

          Title:  On  The Nature of the Compact Dark Mass at the Galactic

          Authors:  Avery  E.  Broderick  (1),  Ramesh Narayan (1,2) ((1)
          Institute for Theory and Computation, (2) Harvard University)
          Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJ Letters
          We  consider  a  model  in  which  Sgr  A*,  the 3.5x10^6 M_sun
          supermassive  black hole candidate at the Galactic Center, is a
          compact  object  with  a  surface. Given the very low quiescent
          luminosity  of  Sgr A* in the near infrared, the existence of a
          hard  surface, even in the limit in which the radius approaches
          the  horizon,  places  severe  constraints upon the steady mass
          accretion   rate  in  the  source,  requiring  dM/dt  <  10^-12
          M_sun/yr.  This  limit is well below the minimum accretion rate
          needed  to  power  the observed submillimeter luminosity of Sgr
          A*. We thus argue that Sgr A* does not have a surface, i.e., it
          must  have  an  event  horizon. The argument could be made more
          restrictive  by  an  order  of  magnitude  with  microarcsecond
          resolution imaging, e.g., with submillimeter VLBI.

          Title:  Prospects  of  LIGO  for  constraining  inclination  of
          merging  compact  binaries  associated with three-dimensionally
          localized short-hard GRBs
          Authors: Naoki Seto
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          We  propose  a  new  method  to  constrain the inclination of a
          coalescing  compact binary by detecting its gravitational waves
          associated  with a three-dimensionally localized (direction and
          distance)  short-hard  gamma-ray  burst. We take advantage of a
          synergy  of  these  two  observations,  and  our  method can be
          applied  with  a  single  interferometer  or  aligned  multiple
          interferometers  as  LIGO.  For  a  nearly  face-on  binary the
          inclination   angle   $I$  can  be  constrained  in  the  range
          1-SNR_{GW}^{-1}  <  cos  I  \le  1  with  an  accurate distance
          estimation.  This  method would help us to study the properties
          of  the  short-hard  bursts,  including  potentially collimated
          jet-like structures as indicated by recent observation.

          We  present  low-resolution  (64 < R < 124) mid-infrared (8--38
          micron) Spitzer/IRS spectra of two z~1.3 ultraluminous infrared
          galaxies  (LFIR~10^13)  discovered  in a Spitzer/MIPS survey of
          the  Bootes  field  of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey (NDWFS).
          MIPS  J142824.0+352619  is  a  bright  160 micron source with a
          large  infrared-to-optical  flux  density  ratio and a possible
          lensing  amplification  of  <~10.  The 6.2, 7.7, 11.3, and 12.8
          micron  PAH  emission  bands  in  its  IRS  spectrum indicate a
          redshift of z~1.3. The large equivalent width of the 6.2 micron
          PAH  feature  indicates  that  at least 50% of the mid-infrared
          energy  is  generated in a starburst, an interpretation that is
          supported by a large [NeII]/[NeIII] ratio and a low upper limit
          on  the  X-ray  luminosity.  SST 24J142827.19+354127.71 has the
          brightest 24 micron flux (10.55 mJy) among optically faint (R >
          20)  galaxies  in  the  NDWFS.  Its mid-infrared spectrum lacks
          emission features, but the broad 9.7 micron silicate absorption
          band  places  this  source  at  z~1.3. Given this redshift, SST
          24J142827.19+354127.71  has  among  the  largest  rest-frame  5
          micron  luminosities  known. The similarity of its SED to those
          of  known  AGN-dominated  ULIRGs  and  its  lack  of either PAH
          features  or  large  amounts  of  cool  dust  indicate that the
          powerful  mid-infrared  emission  is  dominated  by  an  active
          nucleus  rather  than  a  starburst. Our results illustrate the
          power  of  the  IRS  in  identifying  massive  galaxies  in the
          ``redshift  desert''  and  in  discerning  their power sources.
          Because  they are bright, MIPS J142824.0+352619 (pending future
          observations  to  constrain  its lensing amplification) and SST
          24J142827.19+354127.71  are  useful  z>1  templates  of  a high
          luminosity starburst and AGN, respectively.

          Title:  Self-similar  pressure  oscillations  in  neutron  star
          envelopes as probes of neutron star structure
          Authors:  A.  I.  Chugunov  (1),  ((1) Ioffe Physical-Technical
          Institute, St.-Petersburg, Russia)
          Comments: 7 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We   study   eigenmodes   of   acoustic  oscillations  of  high
          multipolarity  l  ~  100  - 1000 and high frequency (~100 kHz),
          localized   in   neutron  star  envelopes.  We  show  that  the
          oscillation  problem  is  self-similar.  Once  the  oscillation
          spectrum  is  calculated for a given equation of state (EOS) in
          the  envelope  and given stellar mass M and radius R, it can be
          rescaled  to  a  star with any M and R (but the same EOS in the
          envelope). For l>300 the modes can be subdivided into the outer
          and  inner  ones.  The  outer modes are mainly localized in the
          outer  envelope.  The inner modes are mostly localized near the
          neutron  drip point, being associated with the softening of the
          EOS  after  the  neutron drip. We calculate oscillation spectra
          for  the  EOSs  of  cold-catalyzed and accreted matter and show
          that  the spectra of the inner modes are essentially different.
          A detection and identification of high-frequency pressure modes
          would  allow one to infer M and R and determine also the EOS in
          the  envelope  (accreted  or ground-state) providing thus a new
          and  simple  method to explore the main parameters and internal
          structure of neutron stars.

          Title: Condensation temperature trends among stars with planets
          Authors: Guillermo Gonzalez
          Comments: 5 pages, 7 figures, MNRAS Letter in press
          Results  from  detailed spectroscopic analyses of stars hosting
          massive  planets  are  employed  to  search  for trends between
          abundances  and  condensation  temperatures. The elements C, S,
          Na,  Mg,  Al, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Zn are included
          in  the  analysis  of  64  stars with planets and 33 comparison
          stars. No significant trends are evident in the data. This null
          result  suggests  that  accretion  of  rocky  material onto the
          photospheres   of   stars  with  planets  is  not  the  primary
          explanation   for   their   high  metallicities.  However,  the
          differences  between  the  solar  photospheric  and  meteoritic
          abundances  do  display  a  weak  but  significant  trend  with
          condensation temperature. This suggests that the metallicity of
          the  sun's  envelope has been enriched relative to its interior
          by about 0.07 dex.

          Title:   IRAS   16293-2422:   Evidence   for   Infall   onto  a
          Counter-Rotating Protostellar Accretion Disk
          Authors: Anthony J. Remijan, J. M. Hollis
          Comments:  18 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We  report  high  spatial  resolution  VLA  observations of the
          low-mass   star-forming   region  IRAS  16293-2422  using  four
          molecular   probes:   ethyl  cyanide  (CH$_3$CH$_2$CN),  methyl
          formate  (CH$_3$OCHO),  formic  acid  (HCOOH),  and  the ground
          vibrational  state  of  silicon  monoxide  (SiO). Ethyl cyanide
          emiss  ion  has  a  spatial scale of $\sim20''$ and encompasses
          binary cores A and B as determined by continuum emission peaks.
          Surrounded by formic acid emission, methyl formate emission has
          a  spatial  scale  of  $\sim6''$and  is confined to core B. SiO
          emission shows two velocity components with spatial scales less
          than 2$''$ that map $\sim2''$ northeast of the A and B symmetry
          axis.  The redshifted SiO is $\sim2''$ northwest of blueshifted
          SiO   along   a   position   angle   of  $\sim135^o$  which  is
          approximately  parallel  to  the  A  and  B  symmetry  axis. We
          interpret  the  spatial  position offset in red and blueshifted
          SiO  emission  as  due  to rotation of a protostellar accretion
          disk  and  we  derive $\sim$1.4 M$_{\odot}$ interior to the SiO
          emission.  In  the  same  vicinity,  Mundy  et  al. (1986) also
          concluded   rotation   of  a  nearly  edge-on  disk  from  OVRO
          observations of much stronger and ubiquitous $^{13}$CO emission
          but  the  direction of rotation is opposite to the SiO emission
          findings.  Taken  together,  SiO  and  $^{13}$CO  data  suggest
          evidence  for  a counter-rotating disk. Moreover, archival BIMA
          array  $^{12}$CO  data show an inverse P Cygni profile with the
          strongest  absorption  in  close proximity to the SiO emission,
          indicating    unambiguous    material    infall    toward   the
          counter-rotating  protostellar  disk  at  a new source location
          within  the  IRAS  16293-2422  complex.  The  details  of these
          observations and our interpretations are discussed.

          We report phase-referenced VLBA observations of H$_{2}$O masers
          near  the  star-forming region W3(OH) to measure their parallax
          and  absolute  proper  motions. The measured annual parallax is
          0.489  $\pm$ 0.017 milli-arcseconds (2.04 $\pm$ 0.07 kpc) where
          the   error   is   dominated   by   a   systematic  atmospheric
          contribution.  This  distance  is  consistent  with photometric
          distances  from  previous  observations  and  with the distance
          determined  from  CH$_3$OH  maser  astrometry  presented  in  a
          related  paper.  We  also  find  that  the  source  driving the
          H$_{2}$O outflow, the ``TW-object'', moves with a 3-dimensional
          velocity   of   $\approx$   10  km  s$^{-1}$  relative  to  the
          ultracompact \ion{H}{2} region W3(OH).

          Authors:  John  F.  Hawley  (1),  Julian  H.  Krolik  (2)  ((1)
          University of Virginia, (2) Johns Hopkins University)
          Comments:  43  pages  12 figures To Appear in the Astrophysical
          Journal
          We  compute  a series of three-dimensional general relativistic
          magnetohydrodynamic  simulations of accretion flows in the Kerr
          metric  to  investigate  the properties of the unbound outflows
          that  result.  The overall strength of these outflows increases
          sharply  with increasing black hole rotation rate, but a number
          of  generic  features  are  found in all cases. The mass in the
          outflow is concentrated in a hollow cone whose opening angle is
          largely  determined  by  the  effective  potential  for  matter
          orbiting  with  angular  momentum  comparable  to  that  of the
          innermost   stable   circular   orbit.   The   dominant   force
          accelerating  the matter outward comes from the pressure of the
          accretion  disk's corona. The principal element that shapes the
          outflow   is   therefore  the  centrifugal  barrier  preventing
          accreting matter from coming close to the rotation axis. Inside
          the  centrifugal  barrier, the cone contains very little matter
          and  is  dominated  by  electromagnetic fields that rotate at a
          rate  tied  closely  to  the  rotation of the black hole. These
          fields  carry  an  outward-going  Poynting flux whose immediate
          energy source is the rotating spacetime of the Kerr black hole.
          When the spin parameter a/M of the black hole exceeds ~0.9, the
          energy  carried to infinity by these outflows can be comparable
          to   the   nominal   radiative   efficiency  predicted  in  the
          Novikov-Thorne  model. Similarly, the expelled angular momentum
          can  be comparable to that accreted by the black hole. Both the
          inner  electromagnetic  part  and  the  outer  matter  part can
          contribute  in  significant  fashion  to the energy and angular
          momentum of the outflow.

          Comments: Accepted by The Astrophysical Journal, in press
          We present new K-band long baseline interferometer observations
          of  three  young stellar objects of the FU Orionis class, V1057
          Cyg,   V1515   Cyg   and   Z   CMa-SE,  obtained  at  the  Keck
          Interferometer  during  its  commissioning  science period. The
          interferometer  clearly  resolves  the  source of near-infrared
          emission  in all three objects. Using simple geometrical models
          we derive size scales (0.5-4.5 AU) for this emission. All three
          objects  appear  significantly more resolved than expected from
          simple  models  of  accretion  disks tuned to fit the broadband
          optical  and infrared spectro-photometry. We explore variations
          in  the  key  parameters  that  are able to lower the predicted
          visibility amplitudes to the measured levels, and conclude that
          accretion  disks  alone  do  not  reproduce the spectral energy
          distributions   and   K-band  visibilities  simultaneously.  We
          conclude that either disk models are inadequate to describe the
          near-infrared  emission,  or  additional  source components are
          needed. We hypothesize that large scale emission (10s of AU) in
          the  interferometer  field  of  view  is  responsible  for  the
          surprisingly  low  visibilities.  This  emission  may  arise in
          scattering  by  large  envelopes  believed  to  surround  these
          objects.

          Title:  Modeling Luminosity-Dependent Galaxy Clustering Through
          Cosmic Time
          Authors:  Charlie  Conroy, Risa H. Wechsler, Andrey V. Kravtsov
          (University of Chicago)
          Comments: 15 pages 11 figures, ApJ submitted
          We  employ  high-resolution  dissipationless simulations of the
          concordance   LambdaCDM   cosmology   to   model  the  observed
          luminosity   dependence  and  evolution  of  galaxy  clustering
          through  most  of  the age of the universe, from z~5 to z~0. We
          use  a simple, non-parametric model which monotonically relates
          galaxy  luminosities  to  the maximum circular velocity of dark
          matter   halos   (V_max)  by  preserving  the  observed  galaxy
          luminosity  function in order to match the halos in simulations
          with  observed  galaxies. The novel feature of the model is the
          use  of the maximum circular velocity at the time of accretion,
          V_max,acc,  for  subhalos,  the  halos  located  within  virial
          regions  of  larger  halos.  We  argue  that  for  subhalos  in
          dissipationless  simulations, V_max,acc reflects the luminosity
          and  stellar  mass  of  the associated galaxies better than the
          circular  velocity  at the epoch of observation, V_max,now. The
          simulations  and  our model L-V_max relation predict the shape,
          amplitude,   and   luminosity   dependence   of  the  two-point
          correlation  function  in excellent agreement with the observed
          galaxy  clustering  in  the  SDSS  data at z~0 and in the DEEP2
          samples  at  z~1  over  the  entire  probed  range of projected
          separations,   0.1<r_p/(h^-1   Mpc)<10.0.  In  particular,  the
          small-scale   upturn  of  the  correlation  function  from  the
          power-law  form  in  the  SDSS  and  DEEP2  luminosity-selected
          samples is reproduced very well. At z~3-5, our predictions also
          match the observed shape and amplitude of the angular two-point
          correlation  function  of  Lyman-break  galaxies (LBGs) on both
          large  and  small  scales,  including  the  small-scale upturn.

          Title:  Formation  of  an  early-type  galaxy from cosmological
          initial conditions?
          Authors:  Thorsten Naab, Peter H. Johansson, George Efstathiou,
          Jeremiah P. Ostriker
          Comments: submitted to ApJL
          We  describe  a high resolution Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
          (SPH)  simulation  of  a  spheroidal galaxy starting from \LCDM
          initial  conditions which is intentionally simple, and includes
          photoionization and cooling of the intergalactic medium but not
          feedback  from  AGN  or  supernovae.  The  galaxy  undergoes an
          initial  burst  of star formation at $z \approx 5$, accompanied
          by  the  formation  of  a  bubble  of  heated  gas and does not
          experience  a major merger after $z=3$. Heating from shocks and
          -PdV  work  dominates  over cooling so that for most of the gas
          the  temperature  is  an  increasing  function  of  time. By $z
          \approx  1$,  80% of the final stellar spheroid is in place and
          the  spectral  energy  distribution resembles those of observed
          extremely red objects (EROs). By the present day, the simulated
          galaxy  is  an old ($\approx 10 {\rm Gyrs}$), kinematically hot
          stellar  system  with  a  stellar  mass  of $\approx 1.2 \times
          10^{11} M_{\odot}$, surrounded by a hot gaseous halo containing
          40%  of  the  baryonic  matter.  Stars dominate the mass of the
          galaxy  up  to  $\approx 4$ effective radii ($\approx 10$ kpc).
          Projected  photometric  and  kinematic  properties  are in good
          agreement   with   observed   field   elliptical  galaxies.  In
          particular,  unlike  some recent simulations, the final stellar
          system  has  a  concentration  that  is  quite  typical of real
          elliptical  galaxies.  Our  simulation  shows  that a realistic
          intermediate  mass  giant  elliptical  galaxy  with a plausible
          formation  history  can be formed from \LCDM initial conditions
          without   requiring  recent  major  mergers  or  feedback  from
          supernovae or AGN.

          Title:  Capture  of  a  Red Giant by the Black Hole Sgr A* as a
          Possible Origin for the TeV Gamma-Rays from the Galactic Center
          Authors: Y. Lu, K.S. Cheng, Y.F. Huang
          Comments: 15 pages, 1 figure, Accepted to ApJ
          Non-thermal TeV $\gamma$-ray emission within multi-pc scale has
          been  observed  from  the center region of our galaxy. We argue
          that these $\gamma$-rays are the result of a transient activity
          of  the  massive  black  hole  Sgr  A$^*$  which resides at the
          Galactic  center.  About thousands of years ago, the black hole
          may  have  experienced an active phase by capturing a red giant
          star  and  forming an accretion disk, temporarily behaving like
          an  active  galactic  nuclear.  A  powerful jet, which contains
          plenty  of high speed protons, was launched during the process.
          These  runaway  protons interact with the dense ambient medium,
          producing     TeV    $\gamma$-ray    emission    through    the
          $\pi^\circ$-decay  process.  We  show  that  the  total  energy
          deposited   in   this  way  is  large  enough  to  account  for
          observations.   The   diffusion   length  of  protons  is  also
          consistent with the observed size of the TeV source.

          publication in the ApJL
          We  have  mapped  the  SiO  J=5-4 line at 217GHz from the HH211
          molecular  outflow with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The high
          resolution  map (1.6''x0.9'') shows that the SiO J=5-4 emission
          comes from the central narrow jet along the outflow axis with a
          width of ~0.8'' (~250 AU) FWHM. The SiO jet consists of a chain
          of  knots  separated  by  3-4''  (~1000 AU) and most of the SiO
          knots  have counterparts in shocked H_2 emission seen in a new,
          deep  VLT  near-infrared image of the outflow. A new, innermost
          pair  of  knots  are discovered at just +/-2'' from the central
          star.  The  line  ratio  between  the  SiO J=5-4 data and upper
          limits  from  the  SiO  J=1-0  data of Chandler & Richer (2001)
          suggests  that  these  knots  have  a  temperature in excess of
          300-500  K  and  a density of (0.5-1) x10^7 cm^{-3}. The radial
          velocity  measured  for  these knots is ~30 km/s, comparable to
          the   maximum  velocity  seen  in  the  entire  jet.  The  high
          temperature,  high  density, and velocity structure observed in
          this pair of SiO knots suggest that they are closely related to
          the primary jet launched close to the protostar.

          Title:  Infrared  Spectroscopy  of  Symbiotic  Stars. IV. V2116

          Authors: Kenneth H. Hinkle, Francis C. Fekel, Richard R. Joyce,
          Peter R. Wood, Verne V. Smith, Thomas Lebzelter
          Comments:  In press to The Astrophysical Journal (10 April 2006
          issue). 23 pages
          We  have  computed, based on 17 infrared radial velocities, the
          first  set of orbital elements for the M giant in the symbiotic
          binary V2116 Ophiuchi. The giant's companion is a neutron star,
          the  bright  X-ray  source GX 1+4. We find an orbital period of
          1161  days  by  far  the longest of any known X-ray binary. The
          orbit  has  a  modest  eccentricity  of  0.10  with  an orbital
          circularization  time  of  less than 10^6 years. The large mass
          function of the orbit significantly restricts the mass of the M
          giant.  Adopting a neutron-star mass of 1.35M(Sun), the maximum
          mass  of  the M giant is 1.22M(Sun), making it the less massive
          star.   Derived   abundances   indicate   a  slightly  subsolar
          metallicity.  Carbon  and  nitrogen  are  in the expected ratio
          resulting from the red-giant first dredge-up phase. The lack of
          O-17  suggests that the M-giant has a mass less than 1.3M(Sun),
          consistent  with  our  maximum  mass.  The  red giant radius is
          103R(Sun),  much  smaller than the estimated Roche lobe radius.
          Thus,  the  mass  loss  of the red giant is via a stellar wind.
          Although  the  M giant companion to the neutron star has a mass
          similar  to  the late-type star in low-mass X-ray binaries, its
          near-solar  abundances  and  apparent  runaway velocity are not
          fully consistent with the properties of this class of stars.

          secondary shows strong Li 6708 absorption suggesting youth, and
          has attracted attention in the past as a candidate post-T Tauri
          star  although  this  has  subsequently  been ruled out. It was
          previously  known  to  be  a  double-lined spectroscopic binary
          (F8+G6)  with  a  period  of  17.6  days,  and to show velocity
          residuals  indicating  a  more  distant massive third companion
          with a period of at least 8 years. Based on our radial velocity
          measurements  covering more than two cycles of the outer orbit,
          along  with  other  measurements,  we derive an accurate triple
          orbital  solution giving an outer period of 9.447 +/- 0.017 yr.
          The  third  object is more massive than either of the other two
          components of HD 27638B, but is not apparent in the spectra. We
          derive  absolute  visual  magnitudes and effective temperatures
          for  the  three  visible  stars  in HD 27638. Isochrone fitting
          based  on  those  properties gives an age of 200 +/- 50 Myr for
          the  system.  We  infer also an inclination angle of about 53.3
          degrees  for  the  inner  orbit  of  HD  27638B.  We  detect  a
          near-infrared  excess  in  HD  27638B which we attribute to the
          third  star  being  a close binary composed of late-type stars.
          This  explains  its large mass and lack of a visible signature.
          Modeling  of this excess allows us to infer not only the masses
          of  the  components  of  the  unseen  companion,  but  also the
          inclination  angle  of  the outer orbit (approximately 73 deg).
          The HD 27638 system is thus at least quintuple.

          Title:  Massive  stars  in  sub-parsec  rings  around  galactic
          centers
          Authors: Sergei Nayakshin (U of Leicester)
          Comments: submitted to MNRAS, 7 pages, 4 figures
          We consider the structure of self-gravitating marginally stable
          accretion  disks  in galactic centers in which a small fraction
          of  the  disk mass has been converted into proto-stars. We find
          that  proto-stars  accrete  gaseous  disk  matter at prodigious
          rates. Mainly due to the stellar accretion luminosity, the disk
          heats  up and geometrically thickens, shutting off further disk
          fragmentation.  The  existing  proto-stars  however continue to
          gain  mass  by  gas  accretion.  As a results, the initial mass
          function  for  disk-born  stars  at distances R ~ 0.03-3 parsec
          from  the  super-massive  black  hole  should be top-heavy. The
          effect  is most pronounced at around R ~ 0.1 parsec. We suggest
          that  this  result  explains  observations  of  rings  of young
          massive  stars  in our Galaxy and in M31, and predict that more
          of such rings will be discovered.

          We  report  the  initial  results  of  a  VLT/NACO high spatial
          resolution  imaging survey for multiple systems among 58 M-type
          members of the nearby Upper Scorpius OB association. Nine pairs
          with  separations  below  100  have  been resolved. Their small
          angular separations and the similarity in the brightness of the
          components  (DMagK  <1  for  all  of them), indicate there is a
          reasonable  likelihood several of them are true binaries rather
          than  chance  projections.  Follow-up imaging observations with
          WHT/LIRIS  of  the  two  widest  binaries  confirm  that  their
          near-infrared  colours  are  consistent  with physical very low
          mass binaries. For one of these two binaries, WHT/LIRIS spectra
          of   each  component  were  obtained.  We  find  that  the  two
          components  have similar M6-M7 spectral types and signatures of
          low-gravity, as expected for a young brown dwarf binary in this
          association.   Our  preliminary  results  indicate  a  possible
          population of very low-mass binaries with semimajor axis in the
          range  100  AU  150 AU, which has not been seen in the Pleiades
          open  cluster.  If  these  candidates  are  confirmed  (one  is
          confirmed  by this work), these results would indicate that the
          binary  properties  of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs may
          depend on the environment where they form.

          to ApJ
          We  present  the  results  of X-ray observations of four bright
          transients   sources  detected  in  the  July  2004  XMM-Newton
          observations  of  the  central bulge of M31. Two X-ray sources,
          XMMU   J004315.5+412440   and   XMMU   J004144.7+411110,   were
          discovered  for  the  first  time.  Two  other  sources, CXOM31
          J004309.9+412332  and  CXOM31 J004241.8+411635, were previously
          detected  by  Chandra.  The  properties  of the sources suggest
          their  identification with accreting binary systems in M31. The
          X-ray   spectra   and   variability   of   two   sources,  XMMU
          J004144.7+411110  and  CXOM31  J004241.8+411635, are similar to
          that  of the Galactic black hole transients, making them a good
          black  hole  candidates. The X-ray source XMMU J004315.5+412440
          demonstrates  a  dramatic  decline  of the X-ray flux on a time
          scale  of  three  days,  and a remarkable flaring behavior on a
          short  time scales. The X-ray data on XMMU J004315.5+412440 and
          CXOM31  J004309.9+412332  suggest that they can be either black
          hole   or  neutron  star  systems.  Combining  the  results  of
          2000-2004  XMM observations of M31, we estimate a total rate of
          the  bright transient outbursts in the central region of M31 to
          be 6-12 per year, in agreement with previous studies.

          Title:  Simple, Accurate, Approximate Orbits in the Logarithmic
          and a Range of Power-Law Galactic Potentials
          Authors: Curtis Struck (Iowa State)
          Comments:  38  pages,  8  figures,  1  table,  accepted for the
          Astron. J
          Curves  in a family derived from powers of the polar coordinate
          formula  for  ellipses  are found to provide good fits to bound
          orbits  in a range of power-law potentials. This range includes
          the  well-known  $1/r$  (Keplerian) and logarithmic potentials.
          These approximate orbits, called p-ellipses, retain some of the
          basic  geometric  properties  of  ellipses.  They  satisfy  and
          generalize Newton's apsidal precession formula, which is one of
          the  reasons  for  their  surprising accuracy. Because of their
          simplicity  the  p-ellipses make very useful tools for studying
          trends among power-law potentials, and especially the occurence
          of  closed  orbits.  The  occurence  of closed or nearly closed
          orbits  in  different  potentials highlights the possibility of
          period  resonances  between  precessing,  eccentric  orbits and
          circular   orbits,   or   between   the  precession  period  of
          multi-lobed  closed  orbits and satellite periods. These orbits
          and  their  resonances  promise  to help illuminate a number of
          problems in galaxy and accretion disk dynamics.

          Title:  The MHD collapsar model for GRBs: an inflow produces an
          outflow
          Authors: Daniel Proga (UNLV)
          Comments:  12  pages,  to  appear  in  "Triggering Relativistic
          Jets", an invited talk
          We  present  our recent results from numerical simulations of a
          magnetized  flow in the vicinity of a black hole in the context
          of  the  collapsar  model  for  GRBs. The simulations show that
          after  an  initial  transient,  the flow settles into a complex
          convolution of several distinct, time-dependent flow components
          including an accretion torus, its corona and outflow, an inflow
          and  an  outflow  in the polar funnel. We focus on studying the
          nature  and  connection between these components, in particular
          between   the  inflows  and  related  outflows.  We  find  that
          rotational  and MHD effects launch, accelerate, and sustain the
          outflows.  We also find that an outflow can be formed even when
          the  collapsing  envelope  has  initially  a very weak magnetic
          field and a very small angular momentum. Our main conclusion is
          that  even  for  a relatively weak initial magnetic field and a
          slow  rotation,  a gravitational collapse of a stellar envelope
          can lead to formation of a very strong and very fast jet.

          Title:  The  Youngest Stellar clusters Clusters associated with
          massive protostellar candidates
          Authors: M. S. N. Kumar, E. Keto, E. Clerkin
          Comments: 14pages, 5 figures and 1 table
          We  report on the identification of 54 embedded clusters around
          217  massive  protostellar  candidates of which 34 clusters are
          new detections. The embedded clusters are identified as stellar
          surface  density  enhancements  in  the 2 $\mu$m All Sky Survey
          (2MASS)  data.  Because  the  clusters  are all associated with
          massive   stars  in  their  earliest  evolutionary  stage,  the
          clusters  should  also  be in an early stage of evolution. Thus
          the  properties  of  these  clusters  should reflect properties
          associated  with  their  formation rather than their evolution.
          For each cluster, we estimate the mass, the morphological type,
          the  photometry  and  extinction. The clusters in our study, by
          their association with massive protostars and massive outflows,
          reinstate the notion that massive stars begin to form after the
          first  generation  of  low  mass  stars  have  completed  their
          accretion  phase.  Further, the observed high gas densities and
          accretion  rates at the centers of these clusters is consistent
          with  the  hypothesis  that  high mass stars form by continuing
          accretion onto low mass stars.

          Comments: 41 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables
          We  present  infrared echelle spectroscopy of three Herbig-Haro
          (HH)  driving  sources  (SVS  13, B5-IRS 1 and HH 34 IRS) using
          Subaru-IRCS.  The  large  diameter  of  the  telescope and wide
          spectral  coverage  of  the  spectrograph  allowed us to detect
          several  H_2  and  [Fe  II]  lines in the H- and K-bands. These
          include  H_2  lines  arising from v=1-3 and J=1-11, and [Fe II]
          lines  with upper level energies of E/k=1.1-2.7x10^4 K. For all
          objects  the  outflow is found to have two velocity components:
          (1) a high-velocity (-70 to -130 km s^-1) component (HVC), seen
          in  [Fe  II]  or  H_2 emission and associated with a collimated
          jet;  and  (2)  a  low-velocity  (-10 to -30 km s^-1) component
          (LVC), which is seen in H_2 emission only and is spatially more
          compact. Such a kinematic structure resembles optical forbidden
          emission line outflows associated with classical T Tauri stars,
          whereas   the   presence   of   H_2   emission   reflects   the
          low-excitation  nature  of  the  outflowing  gas close to these
          protostars. The observed H_2 flux ratios indicate a temperature
          of  2-3x10^3  K,  and  a  gas  density  of  10^5 cm^-3 or more,
          supporting  shocks  as the heating mechanism. B5-IRS 1 exhibits
          faint  extended  emission associated with the H_2-LVC, in which
          the  radial  velocity  slowly  increases with distance from the
          protostar  (by  ~20  km  s^-1 at ~500 AU). This is explained as
          warm molecular gas entrained by an unseen wide-angled wind. The
          [Fe  II]  flux  ratios  indicate electron densities to be ~10^4
          cm^-3 or greater, similar to forbidden line outflows associated
          with  classical  T Tauri stars. Finally the kinematic structure
          of  the [Fe II] emission associated with the base of the B5-IRS
          1 and HH 34 IRS outflows is shown to support disk-wind models.

          Title: On the Spectral Lags of the Short Gamma-Ray Bursts
          Authors: Tingfeng Yi (GXU), Enwei Liang (GXU, UNLV), Yiping Qin
          (YNAO), Ruijing Lu (GXU, YNAO)
          Comments: 6 pages in MNRAS compact format, 7 figures, submitted
          to MNRAS
          We  present a detail analysis on the spectral lags of the short
          gamma-ray  bursts (GRBs) and compare them with that of the long
          GRBs  by  using  the CGRO/BATSE GRB Catalog. Our results are as
          follows.  (1)The spectral lag distribution of the short GRBs is
          significantly  different  from that of the long GRBs. Excluding
          the statistical fluctuation effect, a proportion of ~17% of the
          short GRBs have a negative spectral lag, i.e., the hard photons
          being  lag behind the soft photons. We do not find any peculiar
          features  from  their  light curves to distinguish these bursts
          from  those  with a positive spectral lag. We argue that a more
          physical mechanism dominated the hard lag may be hid behind the
          morphological  features  of  the light curves. This should be a
          great  challenge to the current GRB models. We notice that this
          proportion  is  consistent  with  the  proportion of short GRBs
          correlated  with  nearby galaxies newly discovered by Tanvir et
          al.,  although  it  is  unclear  if these short GRBs are indeed
          associated   with  the  sources  originated  at  low  redshift.
          (2)While  the  spectral  lags  of  the  long  GRBs are strongly
          correlated with the pulse durations, they are not for the short
          GRBs.  However,  the  ratios  of  the spectral lag to the pulse
          duration  for  the  short and long GRBs normally distributed at
          0.023   and   0.046,   respectively,  with  the  sample  width,
          indicating  that  the  curvature effect alone could not explain
          the  difference  of  the spectral lags between the two types of
          GRBs.  The  hydrodynamic  timescales  of  the  outflows and the
          radiative  processes  at  work  in  GRBs  might  also  play  an
          important role as suggested by Daigne and Mochkovitch.

          Title:  On  the  Collapsar  Model  of  Long  Gamma-Ray  Bursts:
          Constraints from Cosmic Metallicity Evolution
          Authors: N. Langer, C.A. Norman
          Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures; accepted as ApJ Letter
          We   explore   the   consequences   of  new  observational  and
          theoretical  evidence  that  long  gamma-ray  bursts prefer low
          metallicity     environments.     Using     recently    derived
          mass-metallicity  correlations  and the mass function from SDSS
          studies,  and  adopting an average cosmic metallicity evolution
          from  \citet{kewley2005}  and  \citet{savaglio2005}  we  derive
          expressions for the the relative number of massive stars formed
          below  a  given  fraction  of solar metallicity, $\epsilon$, as
          function  of  redshift. We demonstrate that about 1/10th of all
          stars  form  with  $\epsilon < 0.1$. Therefore, a picture where
          the  majority  of  GRBs  form  with  $\epsilon  <  0.1$  is not
          inconsistent  with  an empirical global SN/GRB ratio of 1/1000.
          It  implies  that  (1)  GRB's  peak  at  a significantly higher
          redshift  than  supernovae;  (2)  massive star evolution at low
          metallicity  may be qualitatively different and; (3) the larger
          the  low-metallicity  bias  of  GRBs  the  less  likely  binary
          evolution channels can be significant GRB producers.

          Title:   Cluster   Formation   in  Protostellar  Outflow-Driven
          Turbulence
          Authors:  Zhi-Yun  Li  (Univ.  of  Virginia), Fumitaka Nakamura
          (Niigata Univ.)
          Comments: 11 pages (aastex format), 2 figures submitted to ApJL
          Most, perhaps all, stars go through a phase of vigorous outflow
          during  formation.  We  examine, through 3D MHD simulation, the
          effects  of protostellar outflows on cluster formation. We find
          that  the  initial  turbulence in the cluster-forming region is
          quickly   replaced   by  motions  generated  by  outflows.  The
          protostellar    outflow-driven    turbulence    (``protostellar
          turbulence''  for  short) can keep the region close to a virial
          equilibrium long after the initial turbulence has decayed away.
          We   argue   that  there  exist  two  types  of  turbulence  in
          star-forming   clouds:   a   primordial  (or  ``interstellar'')
          turbulence  and  a  protostellar  turbulence,  with  the former
          transformed into the latter mostly in embedded clusters such as
          NGC  1333.  Since  the majority of stars are thought to form in
          clusters,  an  implication  is  that  the  stellar initial mass
          function   is  determined  to  a  large  extent  by  the  stars
          themselves,  through outflows which individually limit the mass
          accretion   onto  forming  stars  and  collectively  shape  the
          environments  (density  structure  and velocity field) in which
          most   cluster   members   form.   We  speculate  that  massive
          cluster-forming  clumps  supported  by  protostellar turbulence
          gradually   evolve   towards   a   highly  centrally  condensed
          ``pivotal''  state,  culminating  in rapid formation of massive
          stars in the densest part through accretion.

          Title:  The Impact of Box Size on the Properties of Dark Matter
          Haloes in Cosmological Simulations
          Authors: Chris Power, Alexander Knebe
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS; 10 pages, 12 figures
          We investigate the impact finite simulation box size has on the
          structural  and kinematic properties of Cold Dark Matter haloes
          forming  in  cosmological  simulations.  Our  approach involves
          generating  a  single realisation of the initial power spectrum
          of  density  perturbations  and studying how truncation of this
          power   spectrum  on  scales  larger  than  L_cut  affects  the
          structure  of dark matter haloes at z=0. In particular, we have
          examined the cases of L_cut = f_cut L_box with f_cut=1 (i.e. no
          truncation), 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4. In common with previous studies,
          we  find  that the suppression of long wavelength perturbations
          reduces   the   strength   of  clustering,  as  measured  by  a
          suppression  of  the  2-point  correlation  function xi(r), and
          reduces the numbers of the most massive haloes, as reflected in
          the  depletion  of the high mass end of the mass function n(M).
          Interestingly, we find that truncation has little impact on the
          internal  properties  of haloes. The masses of high mass haloes
          decrease  in  a  systematic manner as L_cut is reduced, but the
          distribution  of  concentrations  is  unaffected.  On the other
          hand,  the  median  spin  parameter  is ~50% lower in runs with
          f_cut<1.  We argue that this is an imprint of the linear growth
          phase  of  the  halo's  angular momentum by tidal torquing, and
          that  the  absence of any measurable trend in concentration and
          the weak trend observed in halo shape reflect the importance of
          virialisation  and  complex  mass accretion histories for these
          quantities.  These  results  are  of  interest for studies that
          require   high  mass  resolution  and  statistical  samples  of
          simulated  haloes,  such  as  simulations  of the population of
          first  stars.  Our analysis shows that large-scale tidal fields
          have  relatively  little  effect  on the internal properties of
          Cold  Dark  Matter  haloes  and  hence  may  be ignored in such
          studies.

          Title:  Multi-periodic  variations  in the last 104 years light
          curve of the symbiotic star BF Cyg
          Authors:   Elia   Leibowitz,   Liliana   Formiggini  (Tel  Aviv
          University-Israel)
          Comments: 9 pages 7 figures. Accepted by MNRAS
          We analyse a light curve of the symbiotic star BF Cyg, covering
          114  years  of  its  photometric  history. The star had a major
          outburst  around  the  year  1894.  Since then the mean optical
          brightness of the system is in steady decline, reaching only in
          the  last  few years its pre-outburst value. Superposed on this
          general  decline  are  some  6  less  intense  outbursts of 1-2
          magnitude  and  duration  of 2000-5000 days. We find a cycle of
          ~6376 days, or possibly twice this period, in the occurrence of
          these  outbursts.  We  suggest  that  the  origin of the system
          outbursts  is in some magnetic cycle in the outer layers of the
          giant  star  of the system, akin to the less intense ~8000 days
          magnetic cycle of our Sun. We further find, that in addition to
          its  well  known  binary period of 757.3 days, BF Cyg possesses
          also  another  photometric  period of 798.8 days. This could be
          the  rotation period of the giant star of the system. If it is,
          the  beat period of these two periodicities, 14580 days, is the
          rotation  period of a tidal wave on the surface of the giant. A
          4th  period  of 4436 days, the beat period of the 14580 and the
          6376 cycles is possibly also present in the LC. We predict that
          BF  Cyg  will  be  at  the peak of its next outburst around the
          month  of May in the year 2007. The newly discovered 798.8 days
          period  explains the disappearance of the orbital modulation at
          some  epochs in the light curve. The 757.3 oscillations will be
          damped again around the year 2013.

          Title:  Correlated X-ray spectral and timing variability of the
          Be/X-ray binary V0332+53/BQ Cam during a type II outburst
          Authors:  P. Reig (FORTH/U. of Crete), S. Martinez-Nunez (GACE,
          U. of Valencia), V. Reglero (GACE, U. of Valencia)
          Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures, accepted by A&A
          We  have  used  INTEGRAL  & RXTE data to investigate the timing
          properties  of  the  source  in  correlation  with its spectral
          states  as  defined by different positions in the colour-colour
          diagram.   The  source  shows  two  distinct  branches  in  the
          colour-colour diagram that resemble those of the Z sources. The
          hard  branch (similar to the horizontal branch of Z sources) is
          characterised  by  a  low-amplitude  change  of the hard colour
          compared  to  the change in the soft colour. In the soft branch
          (analogue to the normal branch) the amplitude of variability of
          the  hard  colour  is about three times larger than that of the
          soft  colour.  As  the count rate decreases the source moves up
          gradually  through  the  soft to the hard branch. The aperiodic
          variability   (excluding   the   pulse   noise)   consists   of
          band-limited  noise  (represented  by  three  broad  Lorentzian
          components)  and  two QPOs at 0.05 Hz and 0.22 Hz. The strength
          of  the  lower frequency QPO increases as the source approaches
          the  hard  branch  (similar  to  HBOs in Z sources). The higher
          frequency  QPO  reaches maximum significance when the source is
          in  the middle of the branch (like NBOs). We have performed the
          first  measurements  of  phase  lags  in the band limited noise
          below  8  Hz  in  an accreting X-ray pulsar and found that soft
          lags  dominate  at  high frequencies. Above the pulse frequency
          (0.23 Hz), the amplitude of the lag increases as the X-ray flux
          increases.  The  Z  topology  appears  to be a signature of the
          neutron  star  binaries  as  it  is  present  in  all  types of
          neutron-star  binaries  (Z,  atoll  and,  as  we  show here, in
          accreting  pulsars  as  well).  However,  the motion along this
          track,  the  time  scales through the different branches of the
          diagram  and the aperiodic variability associated with portions
          of the Z track differ for each subclass of neutron-star binary.

          Title: Gas Flow Across Gaps in Protoplanetary Disks
          Authors: Steve H. Lubow, Gennaro D'Angelo
          Comments:  10  pages,  3  figures,  1  table.  To appear in The
          Astrophysical Journal
          We analyze the gas accretion flow through a planet-produced gap
          in  a  protoplanetary  disk.  We adopt the alpha disk model and
          ignore   effects   of   planetary   migration.   We  develop  a
          semi-analytic,  one-dimensional  model  that  accounts  for the
          effects  of  the  planet  as  a  mass  sink  and also carry out
          two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a planet embedded
          in  a  disk.  The predictions of the mass flow rate through the
          gap  based  on the semi-analytic model generally agree with the
          hydrodynamical  simulations  at  the  25%  level. Through these
          models, we are able to explore steady state disk structures and
          over  large  spatial  ranges.  The  presence  of  an  accreting
          Jupiter-mass  planet  significantly  lowers  the density of the
          disk  within  a  region  of  several times the planet's orbital
          radius. The mass flow rate across the gap (and onto the central
          star)  is  typically  10%  to  25%  of  the mass accretion rate
          outside the orbit of the planet, for planet-to-star mass ratios
          that range from 5e-5 to 1e-3.

          Title: Submillimeter emission from the hot molecular jet HH 211

          Comments: 3 pages, 3 figures. Accepted by Astrophysical Journal
          Letters
          We  observed  the HH 211 jet in the submillimeter continuum and
          the  CO(3-2)  and  SiO(8-7)  transitions with the Submillimeter
          Array.  The  continuum  source  detected  at  the center of the
          outflow  shows  an  elongated  morphology, perpendicular to the
          direction  of  the  outflow axis. The high-velocity emission of
          both  molecules shows a knotty and highly collimated structure.
          The  SiO(8-7) emission at the base of the outflow, close to the
          driving  source,  spans a wide range of velocities, from -20 up
          to  40  km  s^{-1}. This suggests that a wide-angle wind may be
          the  driving  mechanism  of  the  HH 211 outflow. For distances
          greater  than  5"  (1500  AU) from the driving source, emission
          from  both  transitions  follows  a  Hubble-law  behavior, with
          SiO(8-7)  reaching  higher  velocities  than CO(3-2), and being
          located  upstream of the CO(3-2) knots. This indicates that the
          SiO(8-7) emission is likely tracing entrained gas very close to
          the  primary  jet,  while  the  CO(3-2)  is  tracing less dense
          entrained  gas. From the SiO(5-4) data of Hirano et al. we find
          that  the  SiO(8-7)/SiO(5-4) brightness temperature ratio along
          the  jet  decreases for knots far from the driving source. This
          is  consistent  with the density decreasing along the jet, from
          (3-10)x10^6  cm^{-3}  at 500 AU to (0.8-4)x10^6 cm^{-3} at 5000
          AU from the driving source.

          We  study the colors, structural properties, and star formation
          histories  of  a sample of ~1600 dwarfs over look-back times of
          ~3  Gyr  (z=0.002-0.25).  The  sample  consists  of 401 distant
          dwarfs  drawn  from  the Galaxy Evolution from Morphologies and
          SEDs (GEMS) survey, which provides high resolution Hubble Space
          Telescope  (HST)  Advanced  Camera for Surveys (ACS) images and
          accurate  redshifts,  and  of 1291 dwarfs at 10-90 Mpc compiled
          from  the  Sloan  Digitized Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the
          GEMS dwarfs are bluer than the SDSS dwarfs, which is consistent
          with  star formation histories involving starbursts and periods
          of  continuous  star formation. The full range of colors cannot
          be  reproduced  by single starbursts or constant star formation
          alone.  We  derive  the star formation rates of the GEMS dwarfs
          and  estimate the mechanical luminosities needed for a complete
          removal of their gas. We find that a large fraction of luminous
          dwarfs  are  likely to retain their gas, whereas fainter dwarfs
          are  susceptible  to  a  significant  gas  loss,  if they would
          experience a starburst.

          Title:  Chandra Observations of A2670 and A2107: A Comet Galaxy
          and cDs with Large Peculiar Velocities
          Authors:  Yutaka  Fujita (Osaka U.), Craig L. Sarazin., Gregory
          R. Sivakoff (UVa)
          Comments: PASJ in press
          We  present  an  analysis of Chandra observations of the galaxy
          clusters A2670 and A2107. Their cD galaxies have large peculiar
          velocities  (>200km/s)  and  thus  the  clusters  appear  to be
          undergoing  mergers.  In  A2670, we find a comet-like structure
          around  one  of  the brightest galaxies. At the leading edge of
          the structure, there is a cold front. The mass of the X-ray gas
          in  the  comet-like structure suggests that the galaxy was in a
          small  cluster  or  group, and its intracluster medium (ICM) is
          being   stripped   by   ram-pressure.   The   regions  of  cool
          interstellar medium (ISM) of the cD galaxies in A2670 and A2107
          are  very compact. This is similar to the brightest galaxies in
          the  Coma  cluster,  which  is  also a merging cluster. In each
          galaxy,  the  short  cooling time of the ISM requires a heating
          source;  the  compact  nature of the ISM makes it unlikely that
          the heating source is a central active galactic nucleus (AGN).

          The  collapse  of non-collisional dark matter and the formation
          of   pancake   structures  in  the  Universe  are  investigated
          approximately.  Collapse  is  described by a system of ordinary
          differential  equations,  in the model of a uniformly rotating,
          three-axis, uniform density ellipsoid. Violent relaxation, mass
          and   angular   momentum   losses   are   taken   into  account
          phenomenologically.    The   formation   of   the   equilibrium
          configuration,  secular  instability  and the transition from a
          spheroid to a three-axis ellipsoid are investigated numerically
          and analytically in this dynamical model.

          Title: Modeling the Warm Absorber in AGN
          Authors: A. Rozanska, R. Goosmann, A.-M. Dumont., B. Czerny
          Comments: 15 pages, 17 figures, submitted to A&A
          We  present  a  wide  grid  of  models  for  the  structure and
          transmission  properties  of  warm absorbers in active galactic
          nuclei  (AGN).  Contrary  to  commonly  used  constant  density
          models,  our  absorbing  cloud  is assumed to be under constant
          total  (gas  plus  radiation) pressure. This assumption implies
          the  coexistence  of  material  at  different  temperatures and
          ionization  states,  which is a natural consequence of pressure
          and  thermal equilibrium. Our photoionization code allows us to
          compute  the  profiles of the density, the temperature, the gas
          pressure,  the  radiation  pressure  and  the  ionization state
          across  the  cloud,  and to calculate the radiative transfer of
          continuum  and  lines  including Compton scattering. Therefore,
          equivalent  widths  of both saturated and unsaturated lines are
          properly  modeled. For each pair of the incident spectrum slope
          and  the  ionization  parameter at the cloud surface there is a
          natural  upper limit to the total column densities of the cloud
          due   to   thermal  instabilities.  These  maximum  values  are
          comparable  to  the  observational  constraints  on  the column
          density  of  warm  absorbers which may give support to constant
          total  pressure  models.  In  all  models  we note considerable
          absorption   around   6.4  keV  which  modifies  the  intrinsic
          relativistically  broadened iron line profile originating in an
          accretion  disk  illuminated  atmosphere.  Our  models  can  be
          applied  to  fitting  the  spectroscopic  data  from  the  {\it
          XMM-Newton} and {\it Chandra} satellites.

          Title: Spectral Variability of Quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky

          Authors: B. C. Wilhite, D. E. Vanden Berk, R. J. Brunner, J. V.

          Comments: 52 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          We examine the variability of the high-ionizaton C IV line in a
          sample  of 105 quasars observed at multiple epochs by the Sloan
          Digital  Sky  Survey.  We find a strong correlation between the
          change  in the C IV line flux and the change in the line width,
          but  no  correlations between the change in flux and changes in
          line center and skewness. The relation between line flux change
          and  line  width  change  is consistent with a model in which a
          broad  line  base  varies  with greater amplitude than the line
          core.  The objects studied here are more luminous and at higher
          redshift  than  those normally studied for variability, ranging
          in  redshift from 1.65 to 4.00 and in absolute r-band magnitude
          from  roughly  -24  to  -28. Using moment analysis line-fitting
          techniques,   we  measure  line  fluxes,  centers,  widths  and
          skewnesses for the C IV line at two epochs for each object. The
          well-known  Baldwin  Effect  is  seen for these objects, with a
          slope  beta  = -0.22. The sample has a median intrinsic Baldwin
          Effect  slope  of  beta  =  -0.85;  the  C  IV  lines  in these
          high-luminosity   quasars  appear  to  be  less  responsive  to
          continuum  variations  than  those  in  lower  luminosity  AGN.
          Additionally,  we  find no evidence for variability of the well
          known   blueshift  of  the  C  IV  line  with  respect  to  the
          low-ionization   Mg  II  line  in  the  highest  flux  objects,
          indicating  that this blueshift might be useful as a measure of
          orientation.

          We  use  the  formalism  of  finite-temperature field theory to
          study  the  interactions  of  ultra-high  energy  (UHE)  cosmic
          neutrinos  with the thermal background of relic neutrinos. From
          the  imaginary  part of the neutrino self-energy, calculated in
          terms  of  the Z boson propagator near the resonance, we derive
          general   expressions   for   the   UHE  neutrino  transmission
          probability.  This  allows  us to take into account the thermal
          effects  introduced  by  the momentum distribution of the relic
          neutrinos.   We   compare  our  results  with  the  approximate
          expressions   existing   in  the  literature  and  discuss  the
          influence  of  thermal  effects  on  the absorption dips in the
          context  of realistic UHE neutrino fluxes and favoured neutrino

          We  report  a  discovery of the Zeeman resolved spectral lines,
          corresponding  to  the  extremely  large magnetic field modulus
          <Bs>=17.5  kG,  in  the  cool  Ap  star  HD  178892.  The  mean
          longitudinal  field  of  this  star  reaches  7.5  kG,  and its
          rotational  modulation  implies  the  strength  of  the dipolar
          magnetic  component  Bp>=23 kG. We have revised rotation period
          of  the  star using the All Sky Automated Survey photometry and
          determined  P=8.2478  d.  Rotation  phases  of the magnetic and
          photometric  maxima  of  the  star coincide with each other. We
          obtained  Geneva  photometric  observation  of  HD  178892  and
          estimated  Teff=7700+/-250  K using photometry and the hydrogen
          Balmer  lines. Preliminary abundance analysis reveals abundance
          pattern typical of rapidly oscillating Ap stars.

          Title: Spectroscopic companions of very young brown dwarfs
          Authors: Joergens Viki (Leiden Observatory)
          Comments: Proceeding of ESO workshop 'Multiple Stars across the
          HRD' (Garching 2005). 6 pages, 4 figures
          I   review  here  the  results  of  the  first  RV  survey  for
          spectroscopic  companions  to very young brown dwarfs (BDs) and
          (very)  low-mass stars in the ChaI star-forming cloud with UVES
          at  the  VLT.  This survey studies the binary fraction in an as
          yet  unexplored  domain  not  only  in  terms of primary masses
          (substellar  regime)  and ages (a few Myr) but also in terms of
          companion  masses  (sensitive  down  to  planetary  masses) and
          separations  (< 1 AU). The UVES spectra obtained so far hint at
          spectroscopic  companions of a few Jupiter masses around one BD
          and  around one low-mass star (M4.5) with orbital periods of at
          least   several   months.  Furthermore,  the  data  indicate  a
          multiplicity  fraction  consistent  with  field BDs and stellar
          binaries for periods < 100 days.

          Title: Laboratory tests on dark energy
          Authors: Christian Beck
          Comments:  7  pages, 1 figure. Invited talk given at the 21 COE
          symposium  'Astrophysics  as Interdisciplinary Science', Waseda
          University,  Tokyo, 1-3 September 2005. To appear in Journal of
          Physics: Conference Series
          The  physical  nature  of the currently observed dark energy in
          the   universe   is  completely  unclear,  and  many  different
          theoretical  models  co-exist.  Nevertheless, if dark energy is
          produced by vacuum fluctuations then there is a chance to probe
          some  of  its  properties  by  simple laboratory tests based on
          Josephson  junctions.  These  electronic devices can be used to
          perform   `vacuum   fluctuation   spectroscopy',   by  directly
          measuring  a noise spectrum induced by vacuum fluctuations. One
          would expect to see a cutoff near 1.7 THz in the measured power
          spectrum,  provided  the  new  physics  underlying  dark energy
          couples  to  electric  charge.  The  effect  exploited  by  the
          Josephson junction is a subtile nonlinear mixing effect and has
          nothing to do with the Casimir effect or other effects based on
          van  der  Waals forces. A Josephson experiment of the suggested
          type  will  now  be built, and we should know the result within
          the next 3 years.

          We  use  line-of-sight  velocity information on the filamentary
          emission-line  nebula of NGC 1275 to infer a dynamical model of
          the  nebula's flow through the surrounding intracluster gas. We
          detect  outflowing gas and flow patterns that match simulations
          of  buoyantly  rising bubbles from which we deduce that some of
          the nebula filaments have been drawn out of NGC 1275. We find a
          radial gradient of the ratio [NII]6584/H-alpha which may be due
          to   a   variation   in   metallicity,  interactions  with  the
          surrounding   intracluster   medium   or  a  hardening  of  the
          excitation  mechanism. We find no preferred spatial correlation
          of stellar clusters within the filaments and there is a notable
          lack  of [OIII]5007 emission, therefore it is unlikely that the
          filaments are ionized by stellar UV.

          (abridged)  We  have  investigated  136  Chandra  extragalactic
          sources  without  broad  optical  emission  lines, including 93
          galaxies  with  narrow  emission  lines (NELG) and 43 with only
          absorption  lines  (ALG).  Based  on  fx/fo, Lx, X-ray spectral
          hardness   and  optical  emission  line  diagnostics,  we  have
          conservatively classified 36 normal galaxies (20 spirals and 16
          ellipticals) and 71 AGNs. We found no statistically significant
          evolution  in  Lx/LB, within the limited z range. We have built
          log(N)-log(S),  after  correcting  for  completeness based on a
          series  of  simulations.  The best-fit slope is -1.5 for both S
          and  B energy bands, which is considerably steeper than that of
          the  AGN-dominated  cosmic  background  sources,  but  slightly
          flatter  than the previous estimate, indicating normal galaxies
          will not exceed the AGN population until fx ~ 2 x 10-18 erg s-1
          cm-2 (a factor of ~5 lower than the previous estimate). A group
          of  NELGs  appear  to  be  heavily  obscured in X-rays, i.e., a
          typical  type 2 AGN. After correcting for intrinsic absorption,
          their  X-ray  luminosities  could be Lx > 10^44 erg s-1, making
          them  type  2 quasar candidates. While most X-ray luminous ALGs
          (XBONG  -  X-ray bright, optically normal galaxy candidates) do
          not  appear  to be significantly absorbed, we found two heavily
          obscured  objects,  which could be as luminous as an unobscured
          broad-line  quasar.  Among  43  ALGs,  we  found two E+A galaxy
          candidates  with  strong  Balmer absorption lines, but no [OII]
          line.  The  X-ray  spectra of both galaxies are soft and one of
          them  has  a  nearby  close  companion  galaxy,  supporting the
          merger/interaction  scenario  rather  than  the dusty starburst
          hypothesis.

          Title: Low State, Phase-Resolved IR Spectroscopy of VV Puppis
          Authors: Steve B. Howell, Thomas E. Harrison, Ryan K. Campbell,
          France A. Cordova, Paula Szkody
          Comments: Accepted in Astronomical Journal 5 figures
          We  present  phase-resolved  low  resolution  $JHK$  and higher
          resolution  $K$-band  spectroscopy  of  the  polar  VV Pup. All
          observations  were  obtained when VV Pup was in a low accretion
          state  having  a  K  magnitude  near  15.  The  low  resolution
          observations  reveal  cyclotron emission in the $J$ band during
          some  phases, consistent with an origin near the active 30.5 MG
          pole  on the white dwarf. The secondary in VV Pup appears to be
          a  normal M7V star and we find that the $H$ and $K$ band fluxes
          are  entirely due to this star at all orbital phases during the
          low   accretion  state.  We  use  our  higher  resolution  Keck
          spectroscopy  to  produce  the  first  $K$-band radial velocity
          curve  for VV Pup. Our orbital solution yields $K_2$=414$\pm27$
          km    sec$^{-1}$    and    leads    to    mass   estimates   of
          M$_1$=0.73$\pm$0.05    M$_{\odot}$    and   M$_2$=0.10$\pm$0.02
          M$_{\odot}$.  We  find that the mass accretion rates during the
          normal  low states of the polars VV Pup, EF Eri, and EQ Cet are
          near 10$^{-13}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The fact that \.M is not
          zero  in  low  state polars indicates active secondary stars in
          these  binary  systems,  including  the  sub-stellar donor star
          present in EF Eri.

          Title: The electromagnetic model of Gamma Ray Bursts
          Authors: Maxim Lyutikov (UBC, University of Rochester)
          Comments:  solicited contribution to Focus Issue of New Journal
          of Physics, 27 pages, 4 figures
          I  describe  electromagnetic  model  of  gamma  ray  bursts and
          contrast  its main properties and predictions with hydrodynamic
          fireball  model  and  its  magnetohydrodynamical extension. The
          electromagnetic  model  assumes  that  rotational  energy  of a
          relativistic,         stellar-mass        central        source
          (black-hole--accretion  disk  system  or  fast rotating neutron
          star) is converted into magnetic energy through unipolar dynamo
          mechanism,   propagated   to  large  distances  in  a  form  of
          relativistic,  subsonic,  Poynting  flux-dominated  wind and is
          dissipated    directly    into   emitting   particles   through
          current-driven instabilities. Thus, there is no conversion back
          and  forth between internal and bulk energies as in the case of
          fireball  model.  Collimating effects of magnetic hoop stresses
          lead to strongly non-spherical expansion and formation of jets.
          Long and short GRBs may develop in a qualitatively similar way,
          except  that  in  case  of  long  bursts ejecta expansion has a
          relatively  short, non-relativistic, strongly dissipative stage
          inside  the  star. Electromagnetic and fireball models (as well
          as  strongly and weakly magnetized fireballs) lead to different
          early  afterglow dynamics, before deceleration time. Finally, I
          discuss  the models in view of latest observational data in the
          Swift era.

          The XBootes Survey is a 5-ks Chandra survey of the Bootes Field
          of  the  NOAO  Deep  Wide-Field  Survey (NDWFS). This survey is
          unique in that it is the largest (9.3 deg^2), contiguous region
          imaged  in  X-ray  with  complementary deep optical and near-IR
          observations.  We present a catalog of the optical counterparts
          to  the  3,213  X-ray  point  sources  detected  in the XBootes
          survey. Using a Bayesian identification scheme, we successfully
          identified  optical  counterparts  for  98%  of the X-ray point
          sources. The optical colors suggest that the optically detected
          galaxies  are  a combination of z<1 massive early-type galaxies
          and  bluer  star-forming galaxies whose optical AGN emission is
          faint  or  obscured,  whereas  the  majority  of  the optically
          detected point sources are likely quasars over a large redshift
          range.  Our  large  area,  X-ray  bright, optically deep survey
          enables  us  to select a large sub-sample of sources (773) with
          high  X-ray  to optical flux ratios (f_x/f_o>10). These objects
          are  likely  high  redshift  and/or  dust  obscured  AGN. These
          sources  have  generally harder X-ray spectra than sources with
          0.1<f_x/f_o<10.  Of  the  73  X-ray  sources  with  no  optical
          counterpart  in the NDWFS catalog, 47 are truly optically blank
          down to R~25.5 (the average 50% completeness limit of the NDWFS
          R-band  catalogs).  These  sources  are  also likely to be high
          redshift and/or dust obscured AGN.

          Christopher  Mihos, John J. Feldmeier, Robin Ciardullo, Cameron
          McBride
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 color figures. Submitted to ApJ Letters
          Hypervelocity  stars  have  been  recently  discovered  in  the
          outskirts  of  galaxies,  such as the unbound star in the Milky
          Way  halo, or the three anomalously fast intracluster planetary
          nebulae  (ICPNe)  in  the  Virgo  Cluster.  These may have been
          ejected by close 3-body interactions with a binary supermassive
          black  hole  (SMBBH),  where  a  star  which  passes within the
          semimajor  axis of the SMBBH can receive enough energy to eject
          it  from  the  system.  Stars  ejected  by  SMBBHs  may  form a
          significant  sub-population  with very different kinematics and
          mean  metallicity  than the bulk of the intracluster stars. The
          number,  kinematics,  and  orientation of the ejected stars may
          constrain  the mass ratio, semimajor axis, and even the orbital
          plane of the SMBBH. We investigate the evolution of the ejected
          debris  from a SMBBH within a clumpy and time-dependent cluster
          potential using a high resolution, self-consistent cosmological
          N-body  simulation  of  a  galaxy  cluster.  We  show  that the
          predicted  number  and  kinematic  signature  of the fast Virgo
          ICPNe  is  consistent  with 3-body scattering by a SMBBH with a
          mass ratio $10:1$ at the center of M87.

          Title:  Elemental  Abundance  Ratios  in  Stars  of  the  Outer
          Galactic Disk. III. Cepheids
          Authors:  David  Yong, Bruce W. Carney, Luisa de Almeida, Brian
          L. Pohl (University of North Carolina)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in AJ
          We  present  metallicities,  [Fe/H],  and  elemental  abundance
          ratios,  [X/Fe],  for  a  sample  of  24  Cepheids in the outer
          Galactic   disk.   The  sample  have  Galactocentric  distances
          covering  12  <  R_GC (kpc) < 17.2 making them the most distant
          Galactic  Cepheids  upon which detailed abundance analyses have
          been   performed.  We  find  sub-solar  ratios  of  [Fe/H]  and
          overabundances   of   [alpha/Fe],  [La/Fe],  and  [Eu/Fe].  All
          abundance   ratios   exhibit  a  dispersion  that  exceeds  the
          measurement  uncertainties.  As seen in our previous studies of
          old   open  clusters  and  field  giants,  enhanced  ratios  of
          [alpha/Fe]  and  [Eu/Fe]  reveal that recent star formation has
          taken place in the outer disk.
          The   outer   disk   Cepheids   appear  to  exhibit  a  bimodal
          distribution  for  [Fe/H]  and [alpha/Fe]. Most of the Cepheids
          continue  the  trends with Galactocentric distance exhibited by
          Andrievsky's  larger Cepheid sample and we refer to these stars
          as  the  "Galactic  Cepheids".  A minority of the Cepheids show
          considerably lower [Fe/H] and higher [alpha/Fe] and we refer to
          these stars as the "Merger Cepheids". One signature of a merger
          event  would  be composition differences between the "Galactic"
          and  "Merger"  Cepheids.  The Cepheids satisfy this requirement
          and  we  speculate  that the distinct compositions suggest that
          the  "Merger  Cepheids"  may have formed under the influence of
          significant  merger or accretion events. The short lifetimes of
          the  Cepheids reveal that the merger event may be on-going with
          the Monoceros ring and Canis Major galaxy being possible merger
          candidates. [Abridged]

          The  L1551 molecular cloud contains two small clusters of Class
          0  and I protostars, as well as a halo of more evolved Class II
          and  III YSOs, indicating a current and at least one past burst
          of  star  formation. We present here new, sensitive maps of 850
          and  450 um dust emission covering most of the L1551 cloud, new
          CO  J=2-1 data of the molecular cloud, and a new, deep, optical
          image  of  [SII] emission. No new Class 0/I YSOs were detected.
          Compact   sub-millimetre   emitters  are  concentrated  in  two
          sub-clusters:  IRS5  and  L1551NE, and the HL~Tauri group. Both
          stellar   groups   show   significant   extended  emission  and
          outflow/jet  activity.  A jet, terminating at HH 265 and with a
          very weak associated molecular outflow, may originate from LkHa
          358,  or  from  a  binary companion to another member of the HL
          Tauri  group.  Several  Herbig  Haro  objects  associated  with
          IRS5/NE  were  clearly  detected  in  the sub-mm, as were faint
          ridges  of  emission tracing outflow cavity walls. We confirm a
          large-scale  molecular  outflow originating from NE parallel to
          that  from IRS5, and suggest that the "hollow shell" morphology
          is  more likely due to two interacting outflows. We confirm the

          Title: Boundary layer emission in luminous LMXBs
          Authors: M.Gilfanov, M.Revnivtsev (MPA, IKI)
          Comments: Astronomische Nachrichten, 326, No.9, p.812 (2005)
          Journal-ref: AN, 326, No.9, p.812 (2005)
          We  show that aperiodic and quasiperiodic variability of bright
          LMXBs  -  atoll  and  Z- sources, on ~sec - msec time scales is
          caused   primarily   by   variations   of  the  boundary  layer
          luminosity.  The  accretion  disk  emission is less variable on
          these  time  scales  and  its  power  density  follows 1/f law,
          contributing  to observed flux variation at low frequencies and
          low  energies  only.  The  kHz  QPOs  have  the  same origin as
          variability at lower frequencies - independent of the nature of
          the  "clock",  the  actual luminosity modulation takes place on
          the  NS  surface.  The  boundary  layer spectrum remains nearly
          constant during luminosity variations and can be represented by
          the  Fourier  frequency  resolved  spectrum.  In  the  range of
          Mdot~(0.1-1)*Mdot_Edd  it  depends  weakly  on  the global mass
          accretion  rate and in the limit Mdot~Mdot_Edd is close to Wien
          spectrum  with  kT~2.4  keV. Its independence on the Mdot lends
          support to the suggestion by Inogamov & Sunyaev (1999) that the
          boundary layer is radiation pressure supported.
          Based  on  the  knowledge  of  the  boundary  layer spectrum we
          attempt  to  relate  the motion along the Z-track to changes of
          physically  meaningful parameters. Our results suggest that the
          contribution  of  the  boundary  layer to the observed emission
          decreases  along  the  Z-track  from  conventional  ~50% on the
          horizontal  branch  to  a  rather  small  number  on the normal
          branch.   This   decrease   can  be  caused,  for  example,  by
          obscuration   of   the  boundary  layer  by  the  geometrically
          thickened  accretion disk at Mdot~Mdot_Edd. Alternatively, this
          can  indicate  significant  change  of  the  structure  of  the
          accretion  flow  at  Mdot~Mdot_Edd  and  disappearance  of  the
          boundary  layer  as a distinct region of the significant energy
          release associated with the NS surface.

          Title:  Turbulent Origin of the Galactic-Center Magnetic Field:
          Nonthermal Radio Filaments
          Authors: Stanislav Boldyrev, Farhad Yusef-Zadeh
          Comments: 11 pages, accepted to ApJ Letters
          A great deal of study has been carried out over the last twenty
          years  on  the  origin of the magnetic activity in the Galactic
          center.  One of the most popular hypotheses assumes milli-Gauss
          magnetic  field with poloidal geometry, pervading the inner few
          hundred  parsecs  of the Galactic-center region. However, there
          is   a  growing  observational  evidence  for  the  large-scale
          distribution of a much weaker field of B \lesssim 10 micro G in
          this region. Here, we propose that the Galactic-center magnetic
          field  originates  from  turbulent activity that is known to be
          extreme  in  the  central  hundred parsecs. In this picture the
          spatial  distribution  of  the  magnetic field energy is highly
          intermittent,  and the regions of strong field have filamentary
          structures.  We  propose  that  the  observed  nonthermal radio
          filaments appear in (or, possibly, may be identified with) such
          strongly  magnetized regions. At the same time, the large-scale
          diffuse  magnetic  field is weak. Both results of our model can
          explain   the   magnetic   field   measurements   of   the  the
          Galactic-center  region.  In  addition,  we discuss the role of
          ionized  outflow  from  stellar  clusters in producing the long
          magnetized filaments perpendicular to the Galactic plane.

          Title: Stability of Self-Similar Spherical Accretion
          Authors: Jose Gaite
          Comments:  Contribution  to  Spanish  Relativity  Meeting (ERE)
          2005,  held  in  Oviedo,  AIP  Conference Proceedings, based on
          
astro-ph/0511624, 4 pages
          Spherical  accretion  flows  are  simple  enough for analytical
          study,   by   solution   of  the  corresponding  fluid  dynamic
          equations.  The  solutions of stationary spherical flow are due
          to  Bondi.  The  questions of the choice of a physical solution
          and  of  stability  have  been  widely discussed. The answer to
          these  questions  is  very dependent on the problem of boundary
          conditions,  which  vary according to whether the accretor is a
          compact  object  or  a  black  hole. We introduce a particular,
          simple  form of stationary spherical flow, namely, self-similar
          Bondi  flow, as a case with physical interest in which analytic
          solutions  for  perturbations  can  be  found. With suitable no
          matter-flux-perturbation boundary conditions, we will show that
          acoustic   modes  are  stable  in  time  and  have  no  spatial
          instability  at  r=0.  Furthermore,  their evolution eventually
          becomes  ergodic-like  and  shows no trace of instability or of
          acquiring any remarkable pattern.

          Title:  Lyman-alpha forest-CMB cross-correlation and the search
          for the ionized baryons at high redshift
          Authors:  Rupert  A.C. Croft (CMU/MPA), A.J. Banday (MPA), Lars
          Hernquist (CfA)
          Comments: 14 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          The intergalactic neutral hydrogen which is responsible for the
          Lyman  alpha  forest  of  quasar absorption is a tracer of much
          larger  amounts  of ionised hydrogen. The ionised component has
          yet  to  be  detected  directly, but is expected to scatter CMB
          photons   via   the  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich  (SZ)  effect.  We  use
          hydrodynamic simulations of a LambdaCDM universe to create mock
          quasar  spectra  and  CMB sky maps. We find that the high-z Lya
          forest  gas  causes  temperature fluctuations of the order of 1
          muK rms in the CMB on arcmin scales. The kinetic and thermal SZ
          effects  have  a  similar  magnitude  at  z=3, with the thermal
          effect  becoming relatively weaker as expected at higher z. The
          CMB  signal  associated  with  lines  of sight having HI column
          densities  >  10^18 cm^-2 is only marginally stronger than that
          for  lower  column  densities.  The  strong  dependence  of rms
          temperature  fluctuation  on  mean  Lya absorbed flux, however,
          suggests  that  the  CMB  signal  effectively  arises  in lower
          density    material.    We   investigate   the   use   of   the
          cross-correlation   of   the   Lya  forest  and  the  microwave
          background  to  detect  the  SZ  effect at redshifts 2-4. In so
          doing  we  are  able  to  set  direct  limits on the density of
          diffuse   ionised   intergalactic   baryons.  We  carry  out  a
          preliminary  comparison  at  a mean redshift z=3 of 3488 quasar
          spectra  from SDSS Data Release 3 and the WMAP first year data.
          Assuming  that  the  baryons  are  clustered  as in a LambdaCDM
          cosmology,   and   have   the   same   mean   temperature,  the
          cross-correlation  yields a weak limit on the cosmic density of
          ionised  baryons Omega_(b,I), which is Omega_(b,I) < 0.8 at 95%
          confidence.   With   data  from  upcoming  CMB  telescopes,  we
          anticipate that a direct detection of the high redshift ionised
          IGM  will  soon be possible, providing an important consistency
          check on cosmological models.

          Title:  Dynamical  flows  through  Dark  Matter  Haloes:  Inner
          perturbative dynamics, secular evolution, and applications

          We  investigate  statistically  the  dynamical  consequences of
          cosmological   fluxes   of   matter   and  related  moments  on
          progenitors  of  today's  dark matter haloes. Their dynamics is
          described  via canonical perturbation theory which accounts for
          two  types  of  perturbations: the tidal field corresponding to
          fly-bys  and  accretion of dark matter through the halo's outer
          boundary.  he dynamical equations are solved linearly, order by
          order,  projecting  on  a  biorthogonal  basis  to consistently
          satisfy the field equation. Since our solution of the Boltzmann
          Poisson   equations   is   explicit,   it   allows  statistical
          predictions   for   the  ensemble  distribution  of  the  inner
          dynamical  features  of  haloes.  The secular evolution of open
          galactic haloes is investigated: we derive the kinetic equation
          which governs the quasi-linear evolution of dark matter profile
          induced   by   infall   and   its  corresponding  gravitational
          correlations. This yields a Fokker Planck-like equation for the
          angle-averaged  underlying  distribution  function. We show how
          these  extensions  to the classical theory could be used to (i)
          observationally  constrain the statistical nature of the infall
          (ii)  predict  the  observed  distribution  and correlations of
          substructures  in  upcoming  surveys,  (iii)  predict  the past
          evolution  of  the observed distribution of clumps, and finally
          (iv)  weight  the relative importance of the intrinsic (via the
          unperturbed  distribution function) and external (tidal and/ or
          infall) influence of the environment in determining the fate of
          galaxies.

          ApJ
          We  present  new  optical  observations  of  young massive star
          clusters in Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy,
          taken  in  UBVI with the Hubble Space Telescope ACS/HRC camera.
          We  find  a  total  of  206  probable  clusters  whose  spatial
          distribution  is  centrally  concentrated toward the nucleus of
          Arp  220.  We  use model star cluster tracks to determine ages,
          luminosities,  and  masses  for  14 clusters with complete UBVI
          indices or previously published near-infrared data. We estimate
          rough  masses  for  24 additional clusters with I < 24 mag from
          BVI  indices alone. The clusters with useful ages fall into two
          distinct  groups:  a  ``young''  population  (<  10 Myr) and an
          intermediate-age population (~300 Myr). There are many clusters
          with  masses  clearly  above  10^6 Msun and possibly even above
          10^7  Msun in the most extreme instances. These masses are high
          enough  that the clusters being formed in the Arp 220 starburst
          can  be  considered  as  genuine  young  globular  clusters. In
          addition,   this   study  allows  us  to  extend  the  observed
          correlation  between  global  star  formation  rate and maximum
          cluster  luminosity  by more than an order of magnitude in star
          formation rate.

          publication in ApJ
          Multi-wavelength observations of Galactic black hole transients
          during outburst decay are instrumental for our understanding of
          the  accretion  geometry  and  the formation of outflows around
          black  hole systems. H1743-322, a black hole transient observed
          intensely  in  X-rays and also covered in the radio band during
          its  2003  decay, provides clues about the changes in accretion
          geometry   during   state  transitions  and  also  the  general
          properties  of  X-ray  emission during the intermediate and the
          low-hard  states.  In  this work, we report on the evolution of
          spectral  and temporal properties in X-rays and the flux in the
          radio  band  with the goal of understanding the nature of state
          transitions  observed  in  this  source.  We concentrate on the
          transition  from the thermal dominant state to the intermediate
          state  that  occurs on a timescale of one day. We show that the
          state  transition  is  associated  with  a  sudden  increase in
          power-law  flux.  We  determine that the ratio of the power-law
          flux  to the overall flux in the 3--25 keV band must exceed 0.6
          to   observe   strong   timing  noise.  Even  after  the  state
          transition, once this ratio was below 0.6, the system transited
          back  to the thermal dominant state for a day. We show that the
          emission  from  the  compact radio core does not turn on during
          the   transition   from  the  thermal  dominant  state  to  the
          intermediate state but does turn on when the source reaches the
          low-hard  state,  as  seen  in 4U 1543-47 and GX 339-4. We find
          that   the  photon  index  correlates  strongly  with  the  QPO
          frequency   and  anti-correlates  with  the  rms  amplitude  of
          variability.  We  also show that the variability is more likely
          to  be  associated  with  the  power-law emission than the disk
          emission.

          The  ``central  engine''  of  AGN  is  thought to be powered by
          accretion  on  a central nucleus believed to be a super-massive
          black  hole. The localization and exact mechanism of the energy
          release  in  AGN  are  still  not  well  understood. We present
          observational  evidence for the link between variability of the
          radio  emission  of the compact jet, optical and X-ray continua
          emission  and  ejections  of  new  jet  components in the radio
          galaxy  3C  390.3.  The time delays between the light curves of
          the  individual  jet  components  and  the  light  curve of the
          optical  continuum  are estimated by using minimization methods
          and   the  discret  correlation  function.  We  find  that  the
          variations  of  the optical continuum are correlated with radio
          emission from a stationary feature in the jet. This correlation
          indicates  that  the  source  of variable non-thermal continuum
          radiation  is located in the innermost part of the relativistic
          jet.  We  suggest  that the continuum emission from the jet and
          counterjet   ionizes  material  in  a  subrelativistic  outflow
          surrounding  the  jet,  which  results  in  a  formation of two
          conical  regions  with broad emission lines (in addition to the
          conventional broad line region around the central nucleus) at a
          distance  more or equal to 0.4 parsecs from the central engine.
          Implications   for  modeling  of  the  broad-line  regions  are
          discussed.

          Title:  Investigating  a  Fluctuating-accretion  Model  for the
          Spectral-timing Properties of Accreting Black Hole Systems
          Authors: P. Arevalo, P. Uttley
          Comments: 15 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          The  fluctuating  accretion  model of Lyubarskii (1997) and its
          extension  by  Kotov  et  al.  (2001),  seeks  to  explain  the
          spectral-timing   properties   of   the  X-ray  variability  of
          accreting  black  holes  in  terms  of  inward-propagating mass
          accretion  fluctuations produced at a broad range of radii. The
          fluctuations  modulate  the  X-ray emitting region as they move
          inwards   and  can  produce  temporal-frequency-dependent  lags
          between  energy  bands,  and  energy-dependent  power  spectral
          densities  (PSDs)  as  a  result  of  the  different emissivity
          profiles,  which  may  be expected at different X-ray energies.
          Here we use a simple numerical implementation to investigate in
          detail  the  X-ray  spectral-timing properties of the model and
          their  relation  to  several physically interesting parameters,
          namely  the  emissivity  profile in different energy bands, the
          geometrical  thickness and viscosity parameter of the accretion
          flow,  the  strength  of  damping  on  the fluctuations and the
          temporal coherence (measured by the `quality-factor', Q) of the
          fluctuations   introduced  at  each  radius.  We  find  that  a
          geometrically  thick  flow  with  large  viscosity parameter is
          favoured,  and confirm that the predicted lags are quite robust
          to  changes  in the emissivity profile, and physical parameters
          of the accretion flow, which may help to explain the similarity
          of  the lag spectra in the low/hard and high/soft states of Cyg
          X-1.  We  also  demonstrate  the  model  regime where the light
          curves   in   different  energy  bands  are  highly  spectrally
          coherent.  We  compare model predictions directly to X-ray data
          from  the  Narrow  Line Seyfert~1 galaxy NGC 4051 and the BHXRB
          Cyg  X-1  in  its  high/soft  state  and show that this general
          scheme   can   reproduce   simultaneously  the  time  lags  and
          energy-dependence of the PSD.

          We  report  on the discovery of a z = 3.16 Lyman-alpha emitting
          blob  in  the  GOODS South field. The blob has a total Ly-alpha
          luminosity  of  ~ 10^(43) erg s^(-1) and a diameter larger than
          60  kpc. The available multi-wavelength data in the GOODS field
          consists   of  13  bands  from  X-rays  (Chandra)  to  infrared
          (Spitzer).  Unlike  other  discovered Ly-alpha blobs, this blob
          shows   no   obvious  continuum  counter-part  in  any  of  the
          broad-bands.  In particular, no optical counter-parts are found
          in the deep HST/ACS imaging available. For previously published
          blobs,  AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) or 'superwind' models have
          been  found  to  provide  the best match with the data. We here
          argue  that  the  most probable origin of the extended Ly-alpha
          emission  from  the  blob  in  the  GOODS  South  field is cold
          accretion onto a dark matter halo.

          In  our  continuing  optical spectroscopic campaign to identify
          the  longer-wavelength  counterparts  of  newly-discovered hard
          X-ray  sources  detected  by INTEGRAL, we observed the putative
          optical  counterparts  of  seven  southern sources at the South
          African  Astronomical  Observatory and at the European Southern
          Observatory.  For  two of these objects, optical photometry was
          also acquired. These observations firmly established the nature
          of  four  of them: we found that IGR J10404-4625 (=LEDA 93974),
          4U  1344-60  and  IGR  J16482-3036  are  Active Galactic Nuclei
          (AGNs) at redshifts z = 0.0237, 0.013 and 0.0313, respectively,
          and  that  2RXP  J130159.6-635806 is a Galactic High-Mass X-ray
          Binary  (HMXB).  We  also give possible optical identifications
          for   three   further  objects,  namely  IGR  J11215-5952,  IGR
          J11305-6256  and  IGR  J16207-5129,  which  are consistent with
          being Galactic HMXBs. Physical parameters for these objects are
          also  evaluated  by  collecting  and  discussing  the available
          multiwavelength  information. The detection of four definite or
          likely  HMXBs  out  of  seven  objects  in  our  sample further
          stresses  INTEGRAL's crucial contribution in hunting this class
          of  object. Also, the determination of the extragalactic nature
          of  a  substantial  fraction  of  the  INTEGRAL  survey sources
          underlines  the  importance  of hard X-ray observations for the
          study of background AGNs located beyond the `Zone of Avoidance'
          of the Galactic Plane.

          Title: Two-dimensional models of layered protoplanetary discs -
          II. The effect of a residual viscosity in the dead zone
          Authors: R. Wunsch, A. Gawryszczak, H. Klahr, M. Rozyczka
          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  study  axisymmetric  models of layered protoplanetary discs
          taking  radiative  transfer  effects into account, and allowing
          for  a residual viscosity in the dead zone. We also explore the
          effect of different viscosity prescriptions. In addition to the
          ring  instability  reported in the first paper of the series we
          find  an  oscillatory instability of the dead zone, accompanied
          by  variations  of the accretion rate onto the central star. We
          provide  a  simplified  analytical  description  explaining the
          mechanism  of  the  oscillations.  Finally,  we  find  that the
          residual   viscosity  enables  stationary  accretion  in  large
          regions  of  layered  discs. Based on results obtained with the
          help  of  a simple 1-D hydrocode we identify these regions, and
          discuss  conditions  in  which  layered  discs can give rise to
          FU~Orionis phenomena.

          Title: The PAH Emission Deficit In Low-Metallicity Galaxies - A
          Spitzer View
          Authors: B. O'Halloran, S. Satyapal, R. P. Dudik
          Comments: 19 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          Archival observations of 18 starburst galaxies that span a wide
          range  in  metallicity  reveal for the first time a correlation
          between  the  ratio  of  emission  line  fluxes of [FeII] at 26
          microns  and  [NeII]  at  12.8  microns  and the 7.7 micron PAH
          strength,  with  the  [FeII]/[NeII]  flux ratio decreasing with
          increasing  PAH  strength.  We  also  find a strong correlation
          between  the  [FeII]/[NeII]  flux  ratio  and  the  host galaxy
          metallicity,  with  the  flux  ratio decreasing with increasing
          metallicity.
          Since  [FeII]  emission  has been linked primarily to supernova
          shocks,   we   attribute   the  high  [FeII]/[NeII]  ratios  in
          low-metallicity  galaxies  to  enhanced  supernova activity. We
          consider  this  to be a dominant mechanism for PAH destruction,
          rather   than   grain   destruction   in  photoionized  regions
          surrounding  young  massive stars. We also consider whether the
          extreme  youth  of  the low-metallicity galaxies is responsible
          for the lack of PAH emission.

          Comments: 40 pages, ApJ, in press
          We  present  the  results  of  time-resolved spectroscopy of 13
          O-type stars in the Cas OB6 stellar association. We conducted a
          survey  for  radial  velocity  variability  in search of binary
          systems,  which  are  expected  to  be  plentiful  in  young OB
          associations.   Here   we  report  the  discovery  of  two  new
          single-lined  binaries, and we present new orbital elements for
          three double-lined binaries (including one in the multiple star
          system  HD  17505).  One  of  the  double-lined  systems is the
          eclipsing  binary  system  DN Cas, and we present a preliminary
          light  curve  analysis  that  yields  the  system  inclination,
          masses,  and  radii. We compare the spectra of the single stars
          and  the  individual  components of the binary stars with model
          synthetic   spectra   to   estimate   the   stellar   effective
          temperatures,  gravities,  and projected rotational velocities.
          We  also  make  fits  of  the  spectral energy distributions to
          derive  E(B-V),  R=A_V/E(B-V), and angular diameter. A distance
          of  1.9  kpc yields radii that are consistent with evolutionary
          models.  We  find  that 7 of 14 systems with spectroscopic data
          are   probable   binaries,  consistent  with  the  high  binary
          frequency  found  for  other  massive  stars  in  clusters  and
          associations.

          Title:  Inner-shell  Absorption  Lines  of  Fe~VI--  Fe~XVI:  A
          Many-body Perturbation Theory Approach
          Authors:  Ming F. Gu (Stanford), Tomer Holczer (Technion), Ehud
          Behar (Technion), Steven M. Kahn (Stanford)
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          We   provide   improved   atomic  calculation  of  wavelengths,
          oscillator  strengths, and autoionization rates relevant to the
          $2\to  3$  inner-shell transitions of Fe~VI--XVI, the so-called
          Fe~M-shell  unresolved  transition  array (UTA). A second order
          many-body  perturbation  theory  is employed to obtain accurate
          transition  wavelengths,  which  are systematically larger than
          previous  theoretical  results  by  15--45~m{\AA}.  For  a  few
          transitions  of  Fe~XVI and Fe~XV where laboratory measurements
          exist, our new wavelengths are accurate to within a few m{\AA}.
          Using  these  new calculations, the apparent discrepancy in the
          velocities  between the Fe~M-shell UTA and other highly ionized
          absorption  lines  in  the  outflow of NGC 3783 disappears. The
          oscillator strengths in our new calculation agree well with the
          previous  theoretical  data, while the new autoionization rates
          are  significantly  larger, especially for lower charge states.
          We  attribute  this  discrepancy  to the missing autoionization
          channels   in   the   previous   calculation.   The   increased
          autoionization  rates  may  slightly  affect the column density
          analysis  of  the  Fe~M-shell  UTA for sources with high column
          density  and very low turbulent broadening. The complete set of
          atomic data is provided as an electronic table.

          Title: Accretion disc onto boson stars: a way to supplant black
          holes candidates
          Authors: F. Siddhartha Guzman
          Comments:  5  pages,  7  figures.  Accepted  for publication in
          Physical Review D
          The emission spectrum from a simple accretion disc model around
          a compact object is compared for the cases of a black hole (BH)
          and  a  boson star (BS) playing the role of the central object.
          It  was  found  in  the  past  that  such  spectrum  presents a
          hardening  at  high frequencies, however, here it is shown that
          the  self-interaction and compactness of the BS have the effect
          of  softening  the  spectrum,  the less compact the star is the
          softer  the  emission spectrum at high frequencies. Because the
          mass  of  the  boson  fixes  the  mass  of  the  star  and  the
          self-interaction  the  compactness of the star we find that for
          certain  values of the BSs parameters it is possible to produce
          similar spectra to those generated when the central object is a
          BH.  This  result presents two important implications: i) using
          this  simple accretion model a BS can supplant a BH in the role
          of   compact   object  accreting  matter  and  ii)  within  the
          assumptions  of the present accretion disc model we do not find
          a  prediction  that could help at distinguishing a BH from a BS
          with appropriate parameters of mass and self-interaction.

          Title: Effects of Gravitational Lensing and Companion Motion on
          the Binary Pulsar Timing
          Authors: Roman R. Rafikov (CITA), Dong Lai (Cornell)
          Comments: 10 pages, 1 figure, submitted to Phys. Rev. D
          The  measurement  of  the  Shapiro  time delay in binary pulsar
          systems  with highly inclined orbit can be affected both by the
          motion  of the pulsar's companion because of the finite time it
          takes  a  photon  to cross the binary, and by the gravitational
          light  bending if the orbit is sufficiently edge-on relative to
          the  line of sight. Here we calculate the effect of retardation
          due  to the companion's motion on various time delays in pulsar
          binaries,  including  the  Shaipro delay, the geometric lensing
          delay,  and  the lens-induced delays associated with the pulsar
          rotation.  Our  results  can  be  applied  to systems so highly
          inclined  that  near  conjunction  gravitational lensing of the
          pulsar  radiation  by  the  companion  becomes  important  (the
          recently   discovered   double  pulsar  system  J0737-3039  may
          exemplify  such  a system). To the leading order, the effect of
          retardation  is  to shift all the delay curves backward in time
          around  the  orbit conjunction, without affecting the shape and
          amplitude  of the curves. The time shift is of order the photon
          orbit  crossing time, and ranges from a second to a few minutes
          for  the  observed  binary pulsar systems. In the double pulsar
          system  J0737-3039, the motion of the companion may also affect
          the   interpretation  of  the  recent  correlated  interstellar
          scintillation  measurements. Finally, we show that lensing sets
          an  upper  limit  on  the  magnitude of the frame-dragging time
          delay  caused  by  the  companion's  spin, and makes this delay
          unobservable in stellar-mass binary pulsar systems.

          We  examine  the black hole mass - galaxy bulge relationship in
          high-redshift  QSOs.  Black  hole  masses  are derived from the
          broad  emission  lines,  and  the  host galaxy stellar velocity
          dispersion  sigma  is estimated from the widths of the radio CO
          emission  lines.  At  redshifts  z  > 3, the CO line widths are
          narrower than expected for the black hole mass, indicating that
          these giant black holes reside in undersized bulges by an order
          of magnitude or more. The largest black holes (above 10^9 solar
          masses)  evidently  grow  rapidly in the early universe without
          commensurate  growth  of  their  host  galaxies. CO line widths
          offer a unique opportunity to study AGN host galaxy dynamics at
          high redshift.

          demonstrate  that,  even  for  a  broad and asymmetric spectral
          line,  the  stellar  radius-to-mass  ratio  can  be inferred to
          better than 5%. We also fit our theoretical models to the burst
          oscillation  data  of  the low mass X-ray binary XTE J1814-338,
          and  find  that  the  90% confidence lower limit of the neutron

          is located at this http URL
          Conservative   numerical   schemes   for  general  relativistic
          magnetohydrodynamics  (GRMHD) require a method for transforming
          between  ``conserved''  variables  such  as momentum and energy
          density  and ``primitive'' variables such as rest-mass density,
          internal  energy,  and  components  of  the  four-velocity. The
          forward   transformation   (primitive   to   conserved)  has  a
          closed-form solution, but the inverse transformation (conserved
          to  primitive) requires the solution of a set of five nonlinear
          equations.  Here  we discuss the mathematical properties of the
          inverse  transformation  and  present six numerical methods for
          performing  the inversion. The first method solves the full set
          of  five  nonlinear  equations  directly using a Newton-Raphson
          scheme  and  a  guess  from  the  previous  timestep. The other
          methods  reduce  the  five nonlinear equations to either one or
          two   nonlinear   equations   that   are   solved  numerically.
          Comparisons  between  the  methods are made using a survey over
          phase space, a two-dimensional explosion problem, and a general
          relativistic MHD accretion disk simulation. The run-time of the
          methods  is  also  examined.  Code  implementing the schemes is
          available for download on the web.

          Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, to appear in MNRAS
          Corrections  to  the magnitudes of high redshift objects due to
          intergalactic  attenuation are computed using current estimates
          of  the  properties of the intergalactic medium. The results of
          numerical simulations are used to estimate the contributions to
          resonant  scattering  from  the higher order Lyman transitions.
          Differences  of  0.5-1  magnitude from the previous estimate of
          Madau  (1995)  are  found.  Intergalactic k_IGM-corrections and
          colours  are  provided for high redshift starburst galaxies and
          Type  I  and  Type  II  QSOs for several filter systems used in

          Title: The formation of brown dwarfs
          Authors: A. P. Whitworth (Cardiff), S. P. Goodwin (Sheffield)
          Comments:  7  pages, 1 figure. To appear in Astron.Nachrichten.
          Includes an.cls file
          We  review  four  mechanisms  for  forming  brown  dwarfs:  (i)
          turbulent  fragmentation  (producing  very  low-mass prestellar
          cores);   (ii)  gravitational  instabilities  in  discs;  (iii)
          dynamical  ejection  of  stellar  embryos  from their placental
          cores;  and  (iv)  photo-erosion  of  pre-existing cores in HII
          regions.  We  argue (a) that these are simply the mechanisms of
          low-mass  star  formation,  and  (b) that they are not mutually
          exclusive.  If,  as seems possible, all four mechanisms operate
          in   nature,   their  relative  importance  may  eventually  be
          constrained by their ability to reproduce the binary statistics

          Title:  The possible detection of high redshift Type II QSOs in
          deep fields
          Authors: Avery Meiksin (SUPA; IfA University of Edinburgh)
          Comments: 11 pages, 10 figures; to be published in MNRAS
          The  colours of high redshift Type II QSOs are synthesized from
          observations  of  moderate  redshift  systems. It is shown that
          Type  II  QSOs are comparable to starbursts in their success at
          matching  the  colours of z_850-dropouts and i_775-drops in the
          Hubble  Ultra  Deep  Field,  and more naturally account for the
          bluest objects detected. Type II QSOs may also account for some
          of  the  i_775-drops  detected in the GOODS fields. It is shown
          that  by combining imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope
          and  the  James  Webb  Space  Telescope, it will be possible to
          clearly  separate  Type II QSOs from Type I QSOs and starbursts
          based  on their colours. Similarly, it is shown that the UKIDSS
          ZYJ  filters  may be used to discriminate high redshift Type II
          QSOs  from other objects. If Type II QSOs are prevalent at high
          redshifts,   then   AGN   may  be  major  contributors  to  the
          re-ionization of the Intergalactic Medium.

          Title:  Strongly  Interacting  Neutrinos  as the Highest Energy
          Cosmic Rays: A Quantitative Analysis

          Scattering  processes  in the cosmic microwave background limit
          the  propagation  of ultra high energy charged particles in our
          Universe.  For  extragalactic proton sources resonant photopion
          production  results in the famous Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK)
          cutoff  at  about 4x10^10 GeV expected in the spectrum observed
          on  Earth.  The  faint flux of ultra high energy cosmic rays of
          less  than one event per year and cubic kilometer and the large
          systematic  uncertainties  in  the energy calibration of cosmic
          ray  showers is a challenge for cosmic ray observatories and so
          far  the  GZK  cutoff  has not been unambiguously confirmed. We
          have   investigated  the  possibility  that  the  primaries  of
          super-GZK  events  are strongly interacting neutrinos which are
          not  subject  to  the  GZK  cutoff. For the flux of protons and
          neutrinos  from  extragalactic  optically  thin  sources  and a
          flexible parameterization of the neutrino-nucleon cross section
          we  have  analyzed the cosmic ray spectra observed at AGASA and
          HiRes  taking  also into account results from horizontal events
          at  AGASA  and contained events at RICE. We find that scenarios
          of strongly interacting neutrinos are still compatible with the
          data    requiring   a   steep   increase   of   the   inelastic
          neutrino-nucleon  cross  section  by  four  order  of magnitude
          within  one  energy  decade  compared  to  the  Standard  Model
          predictions.  We  also  discuss  the  impact of the preliminary
          cosmic ray spectrum observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory.

          Title:   Origin   of   [OII]   Emission  in  Red  Sequence  and
          Post-starburst Galaxies
          Authors:  Renbin  Yan,  Jeffrey A. Newman, S.M. Faber, Nicholas
          Konidaris, David Koo, Marc Davis
          Comments: 16 pages, 11 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  investigate  the  emission-line properties of galaxies with
          red  rest-frame  colors  using  spectra from SDSS DR2. Emission
          lines  are  detected  in more than half of the red galaxies. We
          focus  on  the relationship between two emission lines commonly
          used as star formation rate indicators: Ha 6563 and [OII] 3727.
          There is a strong bimodality in [OII]/Ha ratio in the full SDSS
          sample   which   closely   corresponds  to  the  bimodality  in
          rest-frame  color. Nearly all of the line-emitting red galaxies
          have  line  ratios  typical  of  various  types  of AGN -- most
          commonly  LINERs,  a  small fraction of transition objects and,
          more  rarely,  Seyferts.  The  [OII]-Ha  EW diagram reveals the
          continuity   between  quiescent  galaxies  with  no  detectable
          emission  and  galaxies  with  LINER-like  line  ratios,  which
          altogether  form a LINER/Quiescent sequence. A straight line in
          the   [OII]-Ha   EW  plane  divides  these  galaxies  from  the
          remainder.  [OII]  equivalent  widths  in  LINER-  and AGN-like
          galaxies  can  be  as  large as in star-forming galaxies. Thus,
          unless  objects  with  AGN/LINER-like line ratios are excluded,
          [OII]  emission  cannot  be  used  directly as a proxy for star
          formation  rate.  Lack  of  [OII] emission is generally used to
          indicate  lack  of  star formation when post-starburst galaxies
          are selected at high redshift. Our results imply, however, that
          these  samples  have been cut on AGN properties as well as star
          formation,  and therefore may provide seriously incomplete sets
          of   post-starburst   galaxies.   Furthermore,   post-starburst
          galaxies  identifed  in SDSS by requiring minimal Ha equivalent
          width  generally  exhibit  weak  but nonzero line emission with
          ratios  typical  of  AGNs;  few  of  them  show  residual  star
          formation.  This  suggests  that  most  post-starbursts  harbor
          AGNs/LINERs.

          Title: The Supercritical Pile Model for GRBs
          Authors: A. Mastichiadis, D. Kazanas
          Comments: 39 pages, 12 eps figures, accepted for publication in
          the Astrophysical Journal
          We  present  the  spectral  and  temporal  radiative signatures
          expected  within  the  "Supercritical  Pile" model of Gamma Ray
          Bursts (GRB). This model is motivated by the need for a process
          that  provides  the dissipation necessary in GRB and presents a
          well  defined  scheme  for  converting the energy stored in the
          relativistic  protons  of  the  Relativistic  Blast Waves (RBW)
          associated  with  GRB into radiation; at the same time it leads
          to  spectra  which  exhibit  a  peak in the burst $\nu F_{\nu}$
          distribution  at an energy $E_p \simeq 1$ MeV in the observer's
          frame, in agreement with observation and largely independent of
          the  Lorentz  factor  $\Gamma$  of  the associated relativistic
          outflow. Futhermore, this scheme does not require (but does not
          preclude)  acceleration  of  particles  at the shock other than
          that  provided  by  the isotropization of the flow bulk kinetic
          energy  on  the  RBW  frame.  In  the present paper we model in
          detail  the  evolution of protons, electrons and photons from a
          RBW  to  produce  detailed spectra of the prompt GRB phase as a
          function  of  time  from  across  a  very  broad range spanning
          roughly  $4  log_{10}  \Gamma$  decades in frequency. The model
          spectra  are in general agreement with observations and provide
          a  means  for  the  delineating of the model parameters through
          direct comparison with trends observed in GRB properties.

          Title: Spectral Methods for Time-Dependent Studies of Accretion
          Flows. II. Two-Dimensional Hydrodynamic Disks with Self-Gravity
          Authors: Chi-kwan Chan, Dimitrios Psaltis, Feryal Ozel
          Comments:  13  pages,  9  figures.  To  appear in the ApJ. High
          resolution   plots   and  animations  of  the  simulations  are
          available at this http URL
          Spectral  methods  are  well  suited  for  solving hydrodynamic
          problems  in  which  the  self-gravity  of the flow needs to be
          considered. Because Poisson's equation is linear, the numerical
          solution  for  the  gravitational potential for each individual
          mode   of  the  density  can  be  pre-computed,  thus  reducing
          substantially  the  computational  cost  of the method. In this
          second paper, we describe two different approaches to computing
          the   gravitational   field  of  a  two-dimensional  flow  with
          pseudo-spectral  methods.  For  situations in which the density
          profile  is  independent  of  the  third  coordinate  (i.e., an
          infinite  cylinder),  we  use  a  standard  Poisson  solver  in
          spectral  space. On the other hand, for situations in which the
          density  profile is a delta function along the third coordinate
          (i.e.,  an  infinitesimally  thin  disk), or any other function
          known  a  priori,  we perform a direct integration of Poisson's
          equation using a Green's functions approach. We devise a number
          of  test  problems  to  verify the implementations of these two
          methods.  Finally,  we use our method to study the stability of
          polytropic,  self-gravitating  disks.  We  find  that, when the
          polytropic  index Gamma is <= 4/3, Toomre's criterion correctly
          describes  the stability of the disk. However, when Gamma > 4/3
          and  for  large  values  of  the  polytropic  constant  K,  the
          numerical  solutions  are  always  stable, even when the linear
          criterion  predicts  the  contrary. We show that, in the latter
          case,  the  minimum  wavelength of the unstable modes is larger
          than  the  extent  of  the  unstable region and hence the local
          linear analysis is inapplicable.

          Title: Discovery of Five Very Low Mass Close Binaries, Resolved
          in the Visible with Lucky Imaging
          Authors: N.M. Law, S.T. Hodgkin, C.D. Mackay (IOA, Cambridge)
          Comments: 9 pages, 11 figures, submitted to MNRAS
          We  survey  a sample of 32 M5-M8 stars with distance < 40pc for
          companions  with  separations between 0.1 arcsec and 1.5 arcsec
          and  with  Delta  m_i  <5.  We  find five new VLM binaries with
          separations  between  0.15  arcsec  and 1.1 arcsec, including a
          candidate brown dwarf companion. The raw binary fraction is 16%
          +8/-4%  and  the distance bias corrected fraction is 7% +7/-3%,
          for  companions  within  the  surveyed  range.  No systems with
          contrast  ratio  Delta m_i>1 were found, even though our survey
          is  sensitive  to  up  to  Delta m=5 (well into the brown dwarf
          regime).   The  distribution  of  orbital  radii  is  in  broad
          agreement  with  previous  results, with most systems at 1-5AU,
          but  one  detected binary is very wide at 46.8+/-5.0AU. We also
          serendipitously  imaged  for the first time a companion to Ross
          530,  a  metal-poor  single-lined spectroscopic binary. We used
          the  new  Lucky  Imaging  system  LuckyCam  on  the 2.5m Nordic
          Optical  Telescope to complete the 32 very low mass star i' and
          z' survey in only 5 hours of telescope time.

          Title: The Origins of the Substellar Companion to GQ Lup
          Authors: J.H. Debes, S. Sigurdsson
          Comments: 6 pages, submitted to A&A
          The recently discovered substellar companion to GQ Lup possibly
          represents a direct test of current planet formation theories.
          We  examine  the possible formation scenarios for the companion
          to  GQ  Lup  assuming  it  is  a  $\sim$2  M$_{Jup}$ object. We
          determine that GQ Lup B most likely was scattered into a large,
          eccentric  orbit  by  an interaction with another planet in the
          inner system.
          If  this  is  the case, several directly observable predictions
          can  be  made,  including  the  presence  of  a  more  massive,
          secondary  companion that could be detected through astrometry,
          radial   velocity   measurements,  or  scuplting  in  GQ  Lup's
          circumstellar  disk.  This scenario requires a highly eccentric
          orbit for the companion already detected. These predictions can
          be  tested  within the next decade or so. Additionally, we look
          at  scenarios  of  formation if the companion is a brown dwarf.
          One  possible  formation  scenario  may  involve an interaction
          between  a  brown dwarf binary and GQ Lup. We look for evidence
          of  any  brown  dwarfs  that  have been ejected from the GQ Lup
          system by searching the 2MASS all-sky survey.

          INTEGRAL  and RXTE performed three simultaneous observations of
          the  nearby radio galaxy Cen A in 2003 March, 2004 January, and
          2004  February with the goals of investigating the geometry and
          emission processes via the spectral/temporal variability of the
          X-ray/low  energy  gamma  ray flux, and intercalibration of the
          INTEGRAL  instruments  with  respect  to  those  on  RXTE. When
          combined  with earlier archival RXTE results, we find the power
          law  continuum  flux  and the line-of-sight column depth varied
          independently,   and   the   iron  line  flux  was  essentially
          unchanging.  Taking  X-ray spectral measurements from satellite
          missions  since 1970 into account, we discover a variability in
          the  column  depth between 1.0x10^23 cm^-2 and 1.5x10^23 cm^-2,
          and  suggest  that variations in the edge of a warped accretion
          disk viewed nearly edge-on might be the cause.

          Title: Dark matter from encapsulated atoms
          Authors: C.D. Froggatt, H.B. Nielsen
          Comments:  11 pages, paper based on talks by CDF and HBN at the
          8th Workshop on What comes beyond the Standard Models, Bled and
          by CDF at Coslab 2005, Smolenice
          We  propose  that  dark matter consists of collections of atoms
          encapsulated  inside  pieces of an alternative vacuum, in which
          the Higgs field vacuum expectation value is appreciably smaller
          than in the usual vacuum. The alternative vacuum is supposed to
          have  the  same  energy  density  as  our  own. Apart from this
          degeneracy  of  vacuum  phases,  we  do  not  introduce any new
          physics  beyond  the  Standard Model. The dark matter balls are
          estimated  to  have a radius of order 20 cm and a mass of order
          $10^{11}$  kg.  However  they  are  very  difficult  to observe
          directly,  but inside dense stars may expand eating up the star
          and cause huge explosions (gamma ray bursts). The ratio of dark
          matter  to  ordinary  baryonic matter is estimated to be of the
          order  of the ratio of the binding energy per nucleon in helium
          to  the  difference between the binding energies per nucleon in
          heavy  nuclei and in helium. Thus we predict approximately five
          times as much dark matter as ordinary baryonic matter!

          Title: Feedback Limits Rapid Growth of Seed Black Holes at High
          Redshift
          Authors:  J.-M.  Wang (1), Y.-M. Chen (1), C. Hu (2,1) (1 IHEP,

          in The Astrophysical Journal Letters
          Seed black holes formed in the collapse of population III stars
          have been invoked to explain the presence of supermassive black
          holes at high redshift. It has been suggested that a seed black
          hole   can  grow  up  to  $10^{5\sim  6}\sunm$  through  highly
          super-Eddington  accretion  for a period of $\sim 10^{6\sim 7}$
          yr  between  redshift $z=20\sim 24$. We studied the feedback of
          radiation pressure, Compton heating and outflow during the seed
          black  hole  growth.  It  is  found that its surrounding medium
          fueled  to  the seed hole is greatly heated by Compton heating.
          For  a super-critical accretion onto a $10^3\sunm$ seed hole, a
          Compton  sphere  (with  a  temperature $\sim 10^6$K) forms in a
          timescale  of  $1.6\times  10^3$yr  so  that  the  hole is only
          supplied  by  a  rate  of  $10^{-3}$  Eddington  limit from the
          Compton sphere. Beyond the Compton sphere, the kinetic feedback
          of  the strong outflow heats the medium at large distance, this
          leads  to  a  dramatical  decrease of the outer Bondi accretion
          onto  the  black hole and avoid the accumulation of the matter.
          The  highly  super-critical accretion will be rapidly halted by
          the strong feedback. The seed black holes hardly grow up at the
          very early universe unless the strong feedback can be avoided.

          emulateapj5.sty
          (ABRIDGED)  We  present  stellar  velocity  dispersion (sigma*)
          measurements for a significant sample of 40 broad-line (Type 1)
          active  galaxies  for  use  in  testing the well-known relation
          between  black  hole  mass and stellar velocity dispersion. The
          objects are selected to contain Ca II triplet, Mgb triplet, and
          Ca  H+K stellar absorption features in their optical spectra so
          that  we  may  use  them  to  perform  extensive  tests  of the
          systematic  biases  introduced  by  both  template mismatch and
          contamination  from  the  active galactic nucleus (AGN). We use
          the Ca II triplet as a benchmark to evaluate the utility of the
          other  spectral  regions  in the presence of AGN contamination.
          Broad   Fe   II  emission,  extending  from  ~5050-5520  A,  in
          combination  with  narrow coronal emission lines, can seriously
          bias  sigma* measurements from the Mgb region, highlighting the
          need  for extreme caution in its use. However, we argue that at
          luminosities  constituting a moderate fraction of the Eddington
          limit,  when  the Fe II lines are both weak and smooth relative
          to  the  stellar  lines,  it  is  possible to derive meaningful
          measurements  with  careful selection of the fitting region. In
          particular,  to  avoid  the  contamination of coronal lines, we
          advocate  the  use of the region 5250--5820 A, which is rich in
          Fe  absorption features. We lay the groundwork for an extensive
          comparison   between   black   hole  mass  and  bulge  velocity
          dispersion  in  active  galaxies,  as  described in a companion
          paper by Greene & Ho.

          1.5  mJy.  These millimeter fluxes imply vigorous activity with
          star-formation rates (SFRs) approx. 500-1500 Msun/yr, confirmed
          also  by detections at 24 microns with the MIPS camera on board
          of  the  Spitzer  satellite.  The two detected galaxies are the
          ones  in  the  sample  with the highest SFRs estimated from the
          rest-frame  UV,  and  their  far-IR-  and UV-derived SFRs agree
          reasonably well. This is different from local ULIRGs and high-z
          submm/mm  selected  galaxies  for  which  the UV is reported to
          underestimate  SFRs  by  factors  of 10-100, but similar to the
          average  BzK-ULIRG  galaxy at z~2. The two galaxies detected at
          1.2  mm  are brighter in K than the typical NIR-counterparts of
          MAMBO   and   SCUBA  sources,  implying  also  a  significantly
          different  K-band  to  submm/mm  flux  ratio.  This  suggests a
          scenario  in  which  z~2  galaxies,  after  their rapid (sub)mm
          brightest  phase  opaque  to  optical/UV  light,  evolve into a
          longer  lasting  phase  of  K-band  bright and massive objects.
          Targeting  the  most  UV  active  BzKs  could yield substantial
          detection rates at submm/mm wavelengths.

          Title:  Development  of twist in an emerging magnetic flux tube
          by poloidal field accretion
          Authors: P. Chatterjee, A. R. Choudhuri, K. Petrovay
          Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures. A&A, in press
          Following  an  earlier  proposal  by  Choudhuri  (2003) for the
          origin of twist in the magnetic fields of solar active regions,
          we  model  the  penetration of a wrapped up background poloidal
          field  into  a  toroidal  magnetic flux tube rising through the
          solar  convective  zone.  The rise of the straight, cylindrical
          flux  tube  is  followed  by  numerically solving the induction
          equation  in  a  comoving  Lagrangian  frame, while an external
          poloidal magnetic field is assumed to be radially advected onto
          the  tube  with a speed corresponding to the rise velocity. One
          prediction  of  our model is the existence of a ring of reverse
          current  helicity  on  the  periphery of active regions. On the
          other  hand,  the  amplitude  of  the  resulting  twist depends
          sensitively    on    the   assumed   structure   (diffuse   vs.
          concentrated/intermittent)  of the active region magnetic field
          right before its emergence, and on the assumed vertical profile
          of the poloidal field. Nevertheless, in the model with the most
          plausible  choice of assumptions a mean twist comparable to the
          observations  can result rather naturally. Our results indicate
          that  the  contribution  of  this mechanism to the twist can be
          quite  significant,  and  under favourable circumstances it can
          potentially  account  for most of the current helicity observed
          in active regions.

          Title:  Gas  Giant  Protoplanets  Formed by Disk Instability in
          Binary Star Systems
          Authors: A. P. Boss
          Comments: 52 pages, 28 figures
          Journal-ref:  Astrophysical  Journal,  vol.  641, 20 April 2006
          issue
          We present a suite of three dimensional radiative gravitational
          hydrodynamics  models suggesting that binary stars may be quite
          capable  of  forming  planetary systems similar to our own. The
          new  models  with  binary companions do not employ any explicit
          artificial  viscosity,  and  also  include the third (vertical)
          dimension   in  the  hydrodynamic  calculations,  allowing  for
          transient phases of convective cooling. The calculations of the
          evolution  of initially marginally gravitationally stable disks
          show  that the presence of a binary star companion may actually
          help to trigger the formation of dense clumps that could become
          giant  planets.  We  also  show  that  in models without binary
          companions,  which  begin  their  evolution  as gravitationally
          stable  disks, the disks evolve to form dense rings, which then
          break-up  into  self-gravitating  clumps.  These  latter models
          suggest  that  the  evolution of any self-gravitating disk with
          sufficient  mass to form gas giant planets is likely to lead to
          a  period of disk instability, even in the absence of a trigger
          such as a binary star companion.

          Title: Detection of orbital and superhump periods in Nova V2574
          Ophiuchi (2004)
          Authors: Tae W. Kang, Alon Retter, Alex Liu, Mercedes Richards
          Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures, 2 .sty files, AJ accepted
          We   present  the  results  of  37  nights  of  CCD  unfiltered
          photometry of nova V2574 Oph (2004) from 2004 and 2005. We find
          two  periods  of 0.14164 d (~3.40 h) and 0.14773 d (~3.55 h) in
          the  2005  data.  The  2004  data show variability on a similar
          timescale,  but  no  coherent periodicity was found. We suggest
          that  the  longer  periodicity  is  the  orbital  period of the
          underlying binary system and that the shorter period represents
          a  negative  superhump.  The  3.40 h period is about 4% shorter
          than   the  orbital  period  and  obeys  the  relation  between
          superhump  period  deficit  and binary period. The detection of
          superhumps  in the light curve is evidence of the presence of a
          precessing  accretion  disk in this binary system shortly after
          the nova outburst. From the maximum magnitude - rate of decline
          relation,  we  estimate  the  decay  rate  t_2 = 17+/-4 d and a
          maximum absolute visual magnitude of M_Vmax = -7.7+/-1.7 mag.

          (Springer: Dordrecht)
          Extended,  soft  X-ray  emission  from the halo of a very large
          disk   galaxy  has  been  detected  out  to  r~20-40  kpc.  The
          luminosity  and surface brightness distribution is in very good
          agreement  with  predictions  by  recent,  cosmological  galaxy
          formation  models. Predictions of Ly-alpha emission, associated
          with  ``cold''  accretion of filamentary gas onto galaxies, are
          presented.  In particular these predictions are compared to the
          properties  of  a  recently  detected  Ly-alpha ``blob'', which
          shows   no   obvious   continuum  counter-part  in  any  of  12
          broad-bands,  from  X-rays  (Chandra)  to  infrared  (Spitzer).
          Finally,  the predicted evolution of the Tully-Fisher relation,
          going  from  z=0  to  1,  is  discussed  in  relation to recent
          observations.

          Combination   of  high-precision  photometry  and  spectroscopy
          allows  the  detailed  study of the upper main sequence in open
          clusters. We are carrying out a comprehensive study of a number
          of  clusters  containing  Be  stars  in  order  to evaluate the
          likelihood  that  a significant number of Be stars form through
          mass  exchange  in  a  binary. Our first results show that most
          young  open  clusters  contain blue stragglers. In spite of the
          small  number  of  clusters  so  far  analysed, some trends are
          beginning  to emerge. In younger open clusters, such as NGC 869
          and  NGC 663, there are many blue stragglers, most of which are
          not  Be stars. In older clusters, such as IC 4725, the fraction
          of  Be  stars  among  blue stragglers is very high. Two Be blue
          stragglers  are  moderately  strong  X-ray sources, one of them
          being  a  confirmed X-ray binary. Such objects must have formed
          through  binary  evolution. We discuss the contribution of mass
          transfer  in  a  close  binary  to  the  formation of both blue
          stragglers and Be stars

          The Role of Interactions
          Authors: Andrew J. Cunningham, Adam Frank, Eric G. Blackman
          Comments: 21 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  present a series of numerical studies of the interaction of
          colliding  radiative,  hydrodynamic  young stellar outflows. We
          study  the  effect  of  the  collision  impact parameter on the
          acceleration  of  ambient  material and the degree to which the
          flow is isotropized by the collision as a mechanism for driving
          turbulence  in the parent molecular cloud. Our results indicate
          that  the  high  degrees  of  compression  of outflow material,
          achieved  through  radiative  shocks  near  the  vertex  of the
          interaction, prevents the redirected outflow from spraying over
          a  large spatial region. Furthermore, the collision reduces the
          redirected  outflow's  ability  to  entrain and impart momentum
          into  the  ambient cloud. Consideration of the probabilities of
          outflow  collisions  leads  us  to conclude that individual low
          velocity  fossil  outflows  are  the principle coupling between
          outflows and the cloud.

          affiliation: JILA, UC at Boulder
          Relativistic  neutron-loaded  outflows  in gamma-ray bursts are
          studied  at  their  early  stages,  before  deceleration  by  a
          surrounding medium. The outflow has four components: radiation,
          electrons,  protons  and neutrons. The components interact with
          each  other  and  exchange  energy  as the outflow expands. The
          presence   of   neutrons   significantly  changes  the  outflow
          evolution.  Before  neutrons  decouple  from  protons, friction
          between the two components increases their temperatures by many
          orders  of magnitude. After the decoupling, the gradual neutron
          decay  inside  the outflow has a drag effect on the protons and
          reduces their final Lorentz factor.

          We present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of the parent
          star  of  the  transiting  extrasolar  planet  TrES-1. Based on
          high-resolution   Keck/HIRES   and  HET/HRS  spectra,  we  have
          determined  abundances relative to the Sun for 16 elements (Na,
          Mg,  Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba).
          The   resulting   average   abundance   of   $<[$$X$/H$]>$   $=
          -0.02\pm0.06$  is  in  good agreement with initial estimates of
          solar  metallicity  based  on  iron.  We  compare the elemental
          abundances  of  TrES-1  with  those of the sample of stars with
          planets,  searching  for possible chemical abundance anomalies.
          TrES-1  appears not to be chemically peculiar in any measurable
          way.  We  investigate  possible signs of selective accretion of
          refractory elements in TrES-1 and other stars with planets, and
          find no statistically significant trends of metallicity [$X$/H]
          with   condensation   temperature   $T_c$.   We  use  published
          abundances   and   kinematic  information  for  the  sample  of
          planet-hosting stars (including TrES-1) and several statistical
          indicators  to  provide  an  updated classification in terms of
          their likelihood to belong to either the thin disk or the thick
          disk  of  the  Milky  Way  Galaxy. TrES-1 is found to be a very
          likely  member  of  the  thin  disk  population.  By  comparing
          $\alpha$-element abundances of planet hosts and a large control
          sample   of   field   stars,   we  also  find  that  metal-rich
          ([Fe/H]$\gtrsim   0.0$)   stars   with  planets  appear  to  be
          systematically  underabundant in [$\alpha$/Fe] by $\approx 0.1$
          dex with respect to comparison field stars. The reason for this
          signature   is  unclear,  but  systematic  differences  in  the
          analysis procedures adopted by different groups cannot be ruled
          out.

          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Using  recent  spectroscopic  observations,  we  show  that the
          triple  system AO Vel with an eclipsing BpSi primary is in fact
          a  remarkable  quadruple  system  formed  by  two  double-lined
          spectroscopic  binaries  with components close to the ZAMS. All
          available  data  have  been reanalyzed to derive proper orbital
          parameters  for  both  binary systems and to calculate absolute
          parameters  of the eclipsing system. For the first time, direct
          determination of the radius and the mass have been obtained for
          a  BpSi  star.  The  study  of  the physical parameters of this
          unique system is especially important since it can be used as a
          test   of   evolutionary   models   for  very  young  stars  of
          intermediate mass.

          Comments: 18 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables. ApJ in press
          Two   explanations  exist  for  the  short-lived  radionuclides
          present  in  the  solar system when the CAIs first formed. They
          originated  either  from the ejecta of a supernova or by the in
          situ irradiation of nebular dust by energetic particles. With a
          half-life  of  only  53  days,  Beryllium-7  is  then  the  key
          discriminant,  since  it  can  be  made only by irradiation. We
          calculate   the  yield  of  Be-7.  Within  model  uncertainties
          associated  mainly  with  nuclear  cross  sections,  we  obtain
          agreement  with  the  experimental value. Moreover, if Be-7 and
          Be-10 have the same origin, the irradiation time must be short.
          The  x-wind model provides a natural astrophysical setting that
          gives the requisite conditions. The decoupling of the Al-26 and
          Be-10  observed  in  some  rare  CAIs  receives  a quantitative
          explanation  when  rare gradual events are considered. Finally,
          we  show  that  the presence of supernova-produced Fe-60 in the
          solar  accretion  disk  does  not  necessarily  mean that other
          short-lived radionuclides have a stellar origin.

          pulsars/soft  gamma-ray  repeaters, compact center objects, and
          dim  thermal neutron stars. Though one may conventionally think
          that  these stars are normal neutron stars, it is still an open
          issue  whether  they are actually neutron stars or quark stars,
          as no convincing work, either theoretical from first principles
          or  observational,  has  confirmed Baade-Zwicky's original idea
          that   supernovae  produce  neutron  stars.  After  introducing
          briefly  the  history  of  pulsars  and quark stars, the author
          summarizes   the  recent  achievements  in  his  pulsar  group,
          including   quark  matter  phenomenology  at  low  temperature,
          starquakes  of  solid  pulsars,  low-mass  quark stars, and the
          pulsar magnetospheric activities.

          In  this  paper,  we  present  a  first comparison of different
          Adaptive  Optics  (AO)  concepts  to  reach  a given scientific
          specification  for 3D spectroscopy on Extremely Large Telescope
          (ELT). We consider that a range of 30%-50% of Ensquarred Energy
          (EE)  in  H  band  (1.65um)  and in an aperture size from 25 to
          100mas  is  representative of the scientific requirements. From
          these  preliminary  choices, different kinds of AO concepts are
          investigated   :   Ground   Layer   Adaptive   Optics   (GLAO),
          Multi-Object  AO  (MOAO)  and Laser Guide Stars AO (LGS). Using
          Fourier  based simulations we study the performance of these AO
          systems depending on the telescope diameter.

          Title: Spherical Accretion in Nearby Weakly Active Galaxies
          Authors: M.A. Moscibrodzka
          Comments: 19 pages, 11 figures, accepted to A&A
          We  consider  the  sample of weakly active galaxies situated in
          'Local  Universe'  collected  in the paper of Pellegrini (2005)
          with   inferred   accretion   efficiencies  from  $10^{-2}$  to
          $10^{-7}$.
          We apply a model of spherically symmetrical Bondi accretion for
          given parameters ($M_{BH}$,$T_{\infty}$,$\rho_{\infty}$,) taken
          from  observation.  We  calculate  spectra  emitted  by the gas
          accreting  onto  its  central  objects using Monte Carlo method
          including   synchrotron  and  bremsstrahlung  photons  as  seed
          photons.  We  compare  our  results with observed nuclear X-ray
          luminosities  $L_{X,nuc}$  (0.3-10 keV) of the sample. Model is
          also   tested   for   different   external   medium  parameters
          ($\rho_{\infty}$   and   $T_{\infty}$)   and   different   free
          parameters  of  the model. Our model is able to explain most of
          the  observed  nuclear  luminosities  $L_X$ under an assumption
          that  half  of  the compresion energy is transfered directly to
          the electrons.

          Comments:  10  pages,  8figures.  Accepted  for  publication in
          Astronomy & Astrophysics Main Journal
          We  present  the  first time resolved medium resolution optical
          spectroscopy  of  the recently identified peculiar Intermediate
          Polar  (IP)  1RXSJ154814.5-452845, which allows us to precisely
          determine  the  binary  orbital period (Porb=9.87+/-0.03hr) and
          the  white dwarf spin period Pspin=693.01+/-0.06s). This system
          is  then the third just outside the purported 6-10hr IP orbital
          period gap and the fifth of the small group of long period IPs,
          which  has  a  relatively high degree of asynchronism. From the
          presence  of  weak  red  absorption  features,  we identify the
          secondary  star  with a spectral type K2+/-2V, which appears to
          have  evolved on the nuclear timescale. From the orbital radial
          velocities  of  emission  and  the  red absorption lines a mass
          ratio  q=0.65+/-0.12 is found. The masses of the components are
          estimated  to  be  Mwd >= 0.5Msun and Msec=0.4-0.79Msun and the
          binary  inclination  25deg  <  i  <=58deg  . A distance between
          540-840pc  is  estimated.  At  this  distance,  the presence of
          peculiar   absorption  features  surrounding  Balmer  emissions
          cannot   be   due  to  the  contribution  of  the  white  dwarf
          photosphere and their spin modulation suggests an origin in the
          magnetically  confined  accretion flow. The white dwarf is also
          not  accreting  at a particularly high rate (Mdot<5x10**16g/s),
          for   its   orbital  period.  The  spin-to-orbit  period  ratio
          Pspin/Porb=0.02  and  the  low mass accretion rate suggest that
          this  system  is far from spin equilibrium. The magnetic moment
          of  the  accreting  white  dwarf  is  found  to be < 4.1x10**32
          Gcm**3, indicating a low magnetic field system.

          Title: On the binarity of Herbig Ae/Be stars

          (Leeds),   John  Porter  (Liverpool),  Monica  Pozzo  (Imperial
          College)
          Comments: MNRAS accepted, 18 pages
          We present high resolution spectro-astrometry of a sample of 28
          Herbig   Ae/Be  and  3  F-type  pre-main  sequence  stars.  The
          spectro-astrometry  is  shown from both empirical and simulated
          data  to  be  capable  of  detecting binary companions that are
          fainter  by  up  to 6 magnitudes at separations larger than 0.1
          arcsec.  The  nine  targets  that were previously known to be a
          binary  are  all detected. In addition, we report the discovery
          of  6 new binaries and present 5 further possible binaries. The
          resulting  binary  fraction  of 68+/-11 per cent is the largest
          reported  for  any  observed  sample  of  Herbig  Ae/Be  stars,
          presumably    because   of   the   exquisite   sensitivity   of
          spectro-astrometry  for detecting binary systems. The data hint
          that the binary frequency of the Herbig Be stars is larger than
          for   the   Herbig   Ae  stars.  The  appendix  presents  model
          simulations  to  assess  the capabilities of spectro-astrometry
          and  reinforces  the  empirical findings. Two objects, HD 87643
          and  Z  CMa, display evidence for asymmetric outflows. Finally,
          the  position  angles  of the binary systems have been compared
          with available orientations of the circumprimary disc and these
          appear to be co-planar. The alignment between the circumprimary
          discs  and  the  binary  systems  strongly  suggests  that  the
          formation  of  binaries with intermediate mass primaries is due
          to  fragmentation as the alternative, stellar capture, does not
          naturally  predict  aligned  discs. The aligment extends to the
          most  massive  B-type  stars  in  our  sample. This leads us to
          conclude  that  formation  mechanisms that do result in massive
          stars,  but  predict  random angles beween the binaries and the
          circumprimary disks, such as stellar collisions, are also ruled
          out for the same reason.

          We  present  3-5  micron spectroscopy of the interacting system
          NGC  6240,  showing the presence of two active galactic nuclei.
          The brightest (southern) nucleus shows up with a starburst-like
          emission,   with  a  prominent  3.3  micron  emission  feature.
          However, the presence of an AGN is revealed by the detection of
          a  broad  Br  alpha emission line, with a width of ~1,800 km/s.
          The  spectrum  of the faintest (northern) nucleus shows typical
          AGN  features,  such  as a steep continuum and broad absorption
          features  in  the M-band. We discuss the physical properties of
          the  dusty absorbers/emitters, and show that in both nuclei the
          AGN is dominant in the 3-5 micron band, but its contribution to
          the  total  luminosity is small (a few percent of the starburst
          emission).

          We  performed  a  spectroscopic  search  for binaries among hot
          Horizontal  Branch stars in globular clusters. We present final
          results  for  a  sample of 51 stars in NGC6752, and preliminary
          results  for  the  first 15 stars analyzed in M80. The observed
          stars  are  distributed  along  all the HBs in the range 8000 <
          Teff  <  32000  K,  and  have been observed during four nights.
          Radial   velocity   variations  have  been  measured  with  the
          cross-correlation   technique.   We   carefully   analyzed  the
          statistical   and   systematic   errors   associated  with  the
          measurements  in order to evaluate the statistical significance
          of  the  observed  variations.  No close binary system has been
          detected,  neither  among  cooler stars nor among the sample of
          hot  EHB  stars  (18 stars with Teff > 22000 K in NGC6752). The
          data  corrected  for  instrumental  effects  indicate  that the
          radial velocity variations are always below the 3sigma level of
          ~15  km/s. These results are in sharp contrast with those found
          for  field  hot  subdwarfs,  and  open  new questions about the
          formation  of  EHB  stars in globular clusters, and possibly of
          the field subdwarfs.

          Comments:  10  pages  and  6 figures formatted with emulateapj,
          accepted for publication in ApJ
          We   present   a  model  for  the  accretion  flow  around  the
          supermassive  black hole in the LINER nucleus of NGC 1097 which
          fits  the  optical to X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED).
          The  X-ray segment of the SED is based on observations with the
          Chandra  X-Ray  Observatory,  which  are  reported here for the
          first  time.  The  inner  part  of  the  flow  is  modeled as a
          radiatively  inefficient  accretion  flow  (RIAF) and the outer
          part  as  a  standard  thin  disk.  The value of the transition
          radius  (~225  Schwarzschild  radii) between the RIAF and outer
          thin  disk  was  obtained  from  our  previous  fitting  of the
          double-peaked Balmer emission line profile, which originates in
          the   thin   disk.  The  black  hole  mass  was  inferred  from
          measurements  of  the  stellar  velocity dispersion in the host
          galaxy.  When  these  parameters are used in the accretion flow
          model, the SED can be successfully reproduced, which shows that
          the  line  profile  model  and  the  accretion  flow  model are
          consistent  with  each  other.  A small remaining excess in the
          near-UV  is  accounted  by  the  contribution  of  an  obscured
          starburst  located within 9 pc from the nucleus, as we reported
          in  an  earlier  paper.  The  radio  flux  is  consistent  with
          synchrotron  emission of a relativistic jet modeled by means of
          the internal shock scenario. In an appendix we also analyze the
          Chandra   X-ray   observations  of  the  ~1  kpc  circumnuclear
          star-forming  ring and of an ultraluminous compact X-ray source
          located outside the ring.

          Title: On the Robustness of Cool Disc Components in Bright ULXs
          Authors:  J.  M. Miller (1), A. C. Fabian (2), M. C. Miller (3)
          ((1)  University  of Michigan, (2) University of Cambridge, (3)

          Comments: 5 pages, 1 color figure, uses mn2e.cls
          In  this  letter, we comment on the robustness of putative cool
          (kT  ~  0.2 keV) accretion disc components in the X-ray spectra
          of  the  most  luminous  (L ~ 10^40 erg/s) ultra-luminous X-ray
          sources  (ULXs)  in  nearby  normal  galaxies. When compared to
          stellar-mass black holes, the low disc temperatures observed in
          some  ULXs  may  imply  intermediate-mass black hole primaries.
          Recent work has claimed that such soft excesses are unlikely to
          be  actual disc components, based on the lack of variability in
          these  components,  and  in the overall source flux. Other work
          has  proposed  that  alternative  phenomenological  models, and
          complex Comptonisation models, rule-out cool disc components in
          ULX  spectra.  An  inspection  of  the  literature  on Galactic
          stellar-mass black holes and black hole candidates demonstrates
          that  the  flux behaviours seen in specific ULXs are consistent
          with  phenomena observed in well-known Galactic X-ray binaries.
          Applying Comptonisation models to simulated disc blackbody plus
          power-law  spectra  shows  that  at the sensitivity achieved in
          even  the  best  ULX  spectra,  Comptonisation  fits are highly
          model-dependent, and do not yield meaningful constraints on the
          accretion  flow.  In  contrast,  the  need  for a soft, thermal
          component  does  not  appear  to be model-dependent. As we have
          previously  noted,  soft  thermal components in ULX spectra may
          not represent accretion discs, but present alternatives to this
          interpretation are not robust.

          A  growing number of early Be stars discovered in X-ray surveys
          exhibit X-ray luminosities intermediate between those of normal
          stars  and those of most Be/X-ray binaries in quiescence. Their
          X-ray  spectra  are also much harder than those of shocked wind
          OB stars and can be best fitted by a thin thermal plasma with T
          ~ 10^8 K, added to a cooler and much fainter thermal component.
          An  iron  line  complex  including  a fluorescence component is
          detected  in  many  cases.  There  is  no evidence for coherent
          pulsations  in  any  of these systems but strong variability on
          time  scales  as  short  as  100  s  is usually observed. Large
          oscillations  with  quasi-periods  of  the order of one hour or
          more are detected in the X-ray light curves of several sources,
          but  have  so  far failed to prove to be strictly periodic. The
          optical  and  X-ray  properties of these new objects strikingly
          resemble  those  of  the  so  far  unique and enigmatic Be star
          Gamma-Cas  and define a new class of X-ray emitters. We discuss
          the  possible  origin of the X-ray emission in the light of the
          models  proposed  for Gamma-Cas, magnetic disc-star interaction
          or accretion onto a compact companion object -- neutron star or
          white dwarf.

          Authors: Wencong Chen, Xiangdong Li, Zhenru Wang
          Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ
          We  have  calculated  the  evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries
          that  leads  to  the formation of the binary radio pulsars like
          PSR  J1713+0747.  We show that the mass transfer is most likely
          to  be  nonconservative,  due  to  unstable  disk accretion, to
          account  for  the mass of PSR J1713+0747, which is close to its
          initial  value.  We  assume that part of the lost material from
          the  binary  may form a circumbinary disk, and find that it can
          significantly influence the mass transfer processes. We briefly
          discuss  the  implications  of  the  circumbinary  disks on the
          evolution  of  low-mass  X-ray  binaries  and  the formation of
          low-mass binary pulsars.

          Title: Two-phase X-ray burst from GX 3+1 observed by INTEGRAL

          Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics
          We  present an analysis of an anomalously long X-ray burst from
          the low-mass X-ray binary system GX~3+1 observed by INTEGRAL on
          August  31,  2004.  The  burst is characterized by two distinct
          phases:  an  initial short spike of 6 s followed by an extended
          decay  phase  lasting  more  than  2000  s. Due to its uncommon
          duration  this burst appears as intermediate between the normal
          type  I  X-ray bursts and the long superbursts. We see emission
          up  to 30 keV energy during the first 5 s of the outburst where
          the  bolometric  burst peak luminosity approaches the Eddington
          limit.  Indications  of  a  radius expansion episode during the
          peak   phase   are   thus   not   overruled.   A  time-resolved
          two-component  spectral  analysis of the total emission reveals
          similar  results  as  a  black-body  modeling  of the net burst
          emission.  From  the  burst  light  curve and the derived burst
          parameters we conclude that we observed a type I X-ray burst of
          an  unusual  character. We discuss three alternative schemes to
          explain  this  peculiar  X-ray  burst: 1) unstable burning of a
          hydrogen/helium  layer  involving  an unusually large amount of
          hydrogen,  2) pure helium ignition at an unusually large depth,
          but  this  seems  unlikely  in the present case, and 3) limited
          carbon  burning  at  an  unusually  shallow  depth triggered by
          unstable helium ignition.

          Title:  A  new  analysis  of  the nucleus of NGC 1068 with MIDI
          observations
          Authors: A. Poncelet, G. Perrin, H. Sol
          Comments: 14 pages, 16 figures
          We present a new analysis of the very first mid-infrared N-band
          long-baseline  interferometric observations of an extragalactic
          source:  the nucleus of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068, obtained
          with   MIDI  (Mid-InfrareD  Interferometer),  the  mid-infrared
          beamcombiner  at  the  European Southern Observatory (ESO) Very
          Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The resolution of 10 mas
          allows  to study the compact central core of the galaxy between
          8  and  13  microns.  Both  visibility  measurements  and  MIDI
          spectrum  are  well reproduced with a simple radiative transfer
          model  with  two  concentric  spherical components. The derived
          angular sizes and temperatures are about 35 and 83 mas, and 361
          K  and  226 K for these two components respectively. Some other
          evidences strongly support such low temperatures. This modeling
          also  provides  the variation of optical depth as a function of
          wavelength   for  the  extended  component  across  the  N-band
          pointing  towards  the  presence  of amorphous silicate grains.
          This  shows  that  MIDI  actually  carried out the first direct
          observations  of  the  distribution  of dust around the central
          engine.  Together  with other observational pieces, we are able
          to  move  a  step  forward in the reconstruction of the picture
          drawn for AGNs.

          Title:  Irradiated  atmospheres  of  accreting  magnetic  white
          dwarfs with an application to the polar AM Herculis
          Authors: M. Koenig, K. Beuermann, B.T. Gaensicke
          Comments:  Astronomy  &  Astrophysics,  in  press,  9  pages, 7
          figures
          We  present  a pilot study of atmospheres of accreting magnetic
          white  dwarfs  irradiated  by  intense fluxes at ultraviolet to
          infrared  wavelengths.  The  model  uses a standard LTE stellar
          atmosphere   code   which   is   expanded   by  introducing  an
          angle-dependent  external radiation source. The present results
          are  obtained for an external source with the spectral shape of
          a  10000K  blackbody and a freely adjustable spectral flux. The
          model   provides   an  explanation  for  the  observed  largely
          filled-up Lyman lines in the prototype polar AM Herculis during
          its  high  states.  It  also  confirms  the hypotheses (i) that
          irradiation  by cyclotron radiation and other radiation sources
          is  the  principle  cause  for  the  large  heated  polar  caps
          surrounding  the  accretion spots on white dwarfs in polars and
          (ii)  that  much  of  the  reprocessed light appears in the far
          ultraviolet  and  not  in the soft X-ray regime as suggested in
          the  original simple theories. We also briefly discuss the role
          played by hard X-rays in heating the polar cap.

          Title:  Alignment  of  Outflows  with  Magnetic Fields in Cloud
          Cores
          Authors: Tomoaki Matsumoto, Takeshi Nakazato, Kohji Tomisaka
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, Accepted by ApJ Letters
          We  estimate  the  polarized  thermal  dust  emission  from MHD
          simulations  of  protostellar collapse and outflow formation in
          order  to  investigate  alignment  of  outflows  with  magnetic
          fields.  The  polarization  maps  indicate that alignment of an
          outflow  with  the magnetic field depends on the field strength
          inside  the cloud core; the direction of the outflow, projected
          on  the  plane  of  the sky, is aligned preferentially with the
          mean polarization vector for a cloud core with a magnetic field
          strength of 80 microgauss, while it does not tend to be aligned
          for  50  microgauss as long as the 1000 AU scale is considered.
          The  direction  of  the  magnetic  field at the cloud center is
          probed  by  the  direction  of  the  outflow.  In addition, the
          magnetic field at the cloud center can be revealed by ALMA even
          when  the  source  is  embedded  deeply  in  the  envelope. The
          Chandrasekhar-Fermi  formula is examined using the polarization
          maps,  indicating  that  the  field  strength  predicted by the
          formula  should  be  corrected  by a factor of 0.24 - 0.44. The
          correction  factor  has a tendency to be lower for a cloud core
          with a weaker magnetic field.

          Comments: 12 pages, 3 figures, accepted by ApJ Letters
          We  present  Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the z=2.38
          lya-emitter   over-density   associated   with  galaxy  cluster
          J2143-4423, the largest known structure (110 Mpc) above z=2. We
          imaged 22 of the 37 known lya-emitters within the filament-like
          structure,  using  the  MIPS  24um  band.  We detected 6 of the
          lya-emitters, including 3 of the 4 clouds of extended (>50 kpc)
          lyman  alpha emission, also known as Lya Blobs. Conversion from
          rest-wavelength  7um  to  total  far-infrared  luminosity using
          locally  derived correlations suggests all the detected sources
          are  in  the  class  of  ULIRGs,  with some reaching Hyper-LIRG
          energies.  Lya  blobs frequently show evidence for interaction,
          either  in  HST  imaging,  or  the  proximity  of multiple MIPS
          sources  within  the  Lya  cloud. This connection suggests that
          interaction or even mergers may be related to the production of
          Lya  blobs.  A  connection  to  mergers does not in itself help
          explain  the  origin of the Lya blobs, as most of the suggested
          mechanisms  for  creating  Lya  blobs (starbursts, AGN, cooling
          flows) could also be associated with galaxy interactions.

          Title:   Local  virial  relation  and  velocity  anisotropy  in
          self-gravitating system
          Authors: Y. Sota, O. Iguchi, M. Morikawa, A. Nakamichi
          Comments:   Proceedings   of   The   Third  21COE  Symposium  :
          Astrophysics as Interdisciplinary Science
          We  investigate  the merging process in N-body self-gravitating
          system  from  the viewpoints of the local virial relation which
          is  the relation between the local kinetic energy and the local
          potential.  We  compare  both the density profile and the phase
          space  density  profile  in  cosmological  simulations with the
          critical solutions of collisionless static state satisfying the
          local  virial  (LV)  relation.  We  got  the  results  that the
          critical   solution  can  explain  the  characteristic  density
          profile  with  the  appropriate  value  of anisotropy parameter
          $\beta  \sim  0.5$.  It  can  also explain the power law of the
          phase space density profile in the outer part of a bound state.
          However,  it  fails  in  explaining the central low temperature
          part  which  is  connected  to  the scale invariant phase space
          density.  It  can  be well fitted to the critical solution with
          the  higher  value  of$\beta \sim 0.75$. These results indicate
          that the LV relation is not compatible with the scale invariant
          phase space density in cosmological simulation.

          Title:  3D  spectroscopy as a tool for investigation of the BLR
          of lensed QSOs
          Authors: L. C. Popovic (AOB)
          Comments:  ESO  Astrophysics Symposia "Science Perspectives for
          3D  Spectroscopy"  (eds,  M.  Kissler-Patig, M.M. Roth and J.R.

          Selective  amplification  of  the  line and continuum source by
          microlensing  in  a  lensed  quasar  can  lead  to  changes  of
          continuum spectral slopes and line shapes in the spectra of the
          quasar   components.   Comparing   the   spectra  of  different
          components  of  the  lensed  quasar and the spectra of an image
          observed  in  different  epochs  one  can infer the presence of
          millilensing,    microlensing    and   intrinsic   variability.
          Especially,  microlensing  can be used for investigation of the
          unresolved  broad  line  (BLR)  and  continuum  emitting region
          structure  in  active  galactic  nuclei  (AGN).  Therefore  the
          spectroscopic  monitoring  of  selected  lensed quasars with 3D
          spectroscopy  open new possibility for investigation of the BLR
          structure  in  AGN.  Here we discuss observational effects that
          may  be  present  during the BLR microlensing in the spectra of
          lensed QSOs.

          Title: A Precessing Ring Model for Low-Frequency Quasi-periodic
          Oscillations
          Authors: Jeremy D. Schnittman (U Maryland), Jeroen Homan (MIT),
          Jon M. Miller (U Michigan)
          Comments: Accepted to ApJ, 22 pages, 7 figures
          We  develop a simple physical model to describe the most common
          type  of  low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen
          in  a  number  of  accreting black hole systems, as well as the
          shape  of  the  relativistically  broadened iron emission lines
          that  often appear simultaneously in such sources. The model is
          based on an inclined ring of hot gas that orbits the black hole
          along  geodesic  trajectories.  For  spinning black holes, this
          ring will precess around the spin axis of the black hole at the
          Lense-Thirring    (``frame-dragging'')   frequency.   Using   a
          relativistic  ray-tracing code, we calculate X-ray light curves
          and  observed  energy  spectra  as a function of the radius and
          tilt angle of the ring, the spin magnitude, and the inclination
          of the black hole. The model predicts higher-amplitude QPOs for
          systems  with high inclinations, as seen in a growing number of
          black  hole binary systems. We find that the Rossi X-ray Timing
          Explorer observations of low-frequency QPOs in GRS 1915+105 are
          consistent  with a ring of radius R ~ 10M orbiting a black hole
          with  spin  a/M  ~0.5  and  inclination  angle  of  i ~ 70 deg.
          Finally,  we  describe how future X-ray missions may be able to
          use  simultaneous  timing  and  spectroscopic  observations  to
          measure the black hole spin and probe the inner-most regions of
          the accretion disk.

          We  present  spectral  results,  from  Chandra  and  XMM-Newton
          observations,  of  a  sample of 22 low-redshift (z < 0.1) radio
          galaxies,  and  consider  whether  the core emission originates
          from  the  base  of  a  relativistic jet, an accretion flow, or
          contains  contributions from both. We find correlations between
          the   unabsorbed   X-ray,   radio,   and   optical  fluxes  and
          luminosities  of FRI-type radio-galaxy cores, implying a common
          origin  in  the  form of a jet. On the other hand, we find that
          the  X-ray spectra of FRII-type radio-galaxy cores is dominated
          by   absorbed  emission,  with  $N_{\rm  H}  >  10^{23}$  atoms
          cm$^{-2}$, that is likely to originate in an accretion flow. We
          discuss  several  models  which  may  account for the different
          nuclear  properties  of  FRI-  and  FRII-type  cores,  and also
          demonstrate  that both heavily obscured, accretion-related, and
          unobscured,  jet-related  components  may  be  present  in  all
          radio-galaxy    nuclei.    Any   absorbed,   accretion-related,
          components    in   FRI-type   galaxies   have   low   radiative
          efficiencies.

          Title:  Monte  Carlo  simulations  of  star  clusters -- III. A
          million body star cluster
          Authors: Mirek Giersz
          Comments: 12 pages, 11 figures
          A  revision  of  Stodolkiewicz's  Monte  Carlo  code is used to
          simulate  the  evolution of million body star clusters. The new
          method  treats  each superstar as a single star and follows the
          evolution  and  motion  of  all  individual  stellar objects. A
          survey  of  the  evolution  of N-body systems influenced by the
          tidal  field  of  a  parent  galaxy and by stellar evolution is
          presented.  The  process  of  energy  generation is realized by
          means  of  appropriately  modified  versions  of  Spitzer's and
          Mikkola's  formulae  for  the interaction cross section between
          binaries  and  field stars and binaries themselves. The results
          presented  are  in good agreement with theoretical expectations
          and  the  results  of  other methods. During the evolution, the
          initial  mass  function  (IMF) changes significantly. The local
          mass  function  (LMF)  around  the  half--mass  radius  closely
          resembles  the  actual  global mass function (GMF). At the late
          stages  of  evolution  the mass of the evolved stars inside the
          core  can  be  as high as 97% of the total mass in this region.
          For  the  whole system, the evolved stars can compose up to 67%
          of the total mass. The evolution of cluster anisotropy strongly
          depends  on initial cluster concentration, IMF and the strength
          of the tidal field. The results presented are the first step in
          the  direction  of  simulating  the  evolution of real globular
          clusters by means of the Monte Carlo method.

          Title:  Estimate  black  hole  masses of AGNs using ultraviolet
          emission line properties
          Authors: Min-Zhi Kong, Xue-Bing Wu, Ran Wang, Jin-Lin Han
          Comments: 19 pages, 10 figures
          Based  on  the  measured  sizes  of  broad  line  region of the
          reverberation-mapping  AGN  sample, two new empirical relations
          are  introduced  to  estimate  the central black hole masses of
          radio-loud  high-redshift  ($z  >  0.5$) AGNs. First, using the
          archival  $IUE/HST$  spectroscopy  data  at  UV  band  for  the
          reverberation-mapping  objects,  we  obtained two new empirical
          relations  between  the  BLR  size  and  \Mg/\C  emission  line
          luminosity.  Secondly,  using  the  newly determined black hole
          masses of the reverberation-mapping sample for calibration, two
          new relationships for determination of black hole mass with the
          full  width  of  half maximum and the luminosity of \Mg/\C line
          are  also  found.  We  then apply the relations to estimate the
          black  hole masses of AGNs in Large Bright Quasar Surveyq and a
          sample  of  radio-loud  quasars.  For  the  objects  with small
          radio-loudness, the black hole mass estimated using the $R_{\rm
          BLR}  - L_{\eMg/\eC}$ relation is consistent with that from the
          $R_{BLR}  -  L_{3000\AA/1350 \AA}$ relation. But for radio-loud
          AGNs,  the  mass  estimated  from  the $R_{BLR} - L_{\eMg/\eC}$
          relation  is  systematically lower than that from the continuum
          luminosity   $L_{3000\AA/1350\AA}$.  Because  jets  could  have
          significant   contributions   to   the   UV/optical   continuum
          luminosity  of  radio-loud  AGNs,  we emphasized again that for
          radio-loud  AGNs,  the emission line luminosity may be a better
          tracer   of   the   ionizing   luminosity  than  the  continuum
          luminosity,  so  that the relations between the BLR size and UV
          emission  line  luminosity should be used to estimate the black
          hole masses of high redshift radio-loud AGNs.

          [Fe/H] = -1.3 to -0.9, with the most metal poor halos resulting
          from  accretion  histories  that  lack destructive mergers with
          massive (metal rich) satellites. Our stellar halo metallicities
          increase   with   stellar   halo   mass.   The   slope  of  the
          [Fe/H]-stellar mass trend mimics that of the satellite galaxies
          that  were  destroyed  to  build  the  halos, implying that the
          relation propagates hierarchically. All simulated halos contain
          a significant fraction of old stellar populations accreted more
          than  10  Gyr  ago  and  in  a few cases, some intermediate age
          populations  exist. In contrast with the Milky Way, many of our
          simulated  stellar  halos contain old stellar populations which
          are  metal  rich, originating in the early accretion of massive
          satellites.  We  suggest  that the (metal rich) stellar halo of
          M31 falls into this category, while the more metal poor halo of
          the  Milky  Way  is  lacking in early massive accretion events.
          Interestingly,  our  hierarchically-formed  stellar halos often
          have  non-negligible  metallicity  gradients in both [Fe/H] and
          [alpha/Fe].  These  gradients extend a few tens of kpc, and can
          be  as  large  as  0.5 dex in [Fe/H] and 0.2 dex in [alpha/Fe].
          Finally,  we  find  that chemical abundances can act as a rough
          substitute  for  time  of  accretion  of satellite galaxies. We
          propose  a criterion for identifying tidal streams spatially by
          selecting stars with [alpha/Fe] ratios below solar.

          Title:  Monte  Carlo  simulations  of  star  clusters -- III. A
          million body star cluster
          Authors: Mirek Giersz
          Comments: 12 pages, 11 figures
          A  revision  of  Stodolkiewicz's  Monte  Carlo  code is used to
          simulate  the  evolution of million body star clusters. The new
          method  treats  each superstar as a single star and follows the
          evolution  and  motion  of  all  individual  stellar objects. A
          survey  of  the  evolution  of N-body systems influenced by the
          tidal  field  of  a  parent  galaxy and by stellar evolution is
          presented.  The  process  of  energy  generation is realized by
          means  of  appropriately  modified  versions  of  Spitzer's and
          Mikkola's  formulae  for  the interaction cross section between
          binaries  and  field stars and binaries themselves. The results
          presented  are  in good agreement with theoretical expectations
          and  the  results  of  other methods. During the evolution, the
          initial  mass  function  (IMF) changes significantly. The local
          mass  function  (LMF)  around  the  half--mass  radius  closely
          resembles  the  actual  global mass function (GMF). At the late
          stages  of  evolution  the mass of the evolved stars inside the
          core  can  be  as high as 97% of the total mass in this region.
          For  the  whole system, the evolved stars can compose up to 67%
          of the total mass. The evolution of cluster anisotropy strongly
          depends  on initial cluster concentration, IMF and the strength
          of the tidal field. The results presented are the first step in
          the  direction  of  simulating  the  evolution of real globular
          clusters by means of the Monte Carlo method.

          Title:  Estimate  black  hole  masses of AGNs using ultraviolet
          emission line properties
          Authors: Min-Zhi Kong, Xue-Bing Wu, Ran Wang, Jin-Lin Han
          Comments: 19 pages, 10 figures
          Based  on  the  measured  sizes  of  broad  line  region of the
          reverberation-mapping  AGN  sample, two new empirical relations
          are  introduced  to  estimate  the central black hole masses of
          radio-loud  high-redshift  ($z  >  0.5$) AGNs. First, using the
          archival  $IUE/HST$  spectroscopy  data  at  UV  band  for  the
          reverberation-mapping  objects,  we  obtained two new empirical
          relations  between  the  BLR  size  and  \Mg/\C  emission  line
          luminosity.  Secondly,  using  the  newly determined black hole
          masses of the reverberation-mapping sample for calibration, two
          new relationships for determination of black hole mass with the
          full  width  of  half maximum and the luminosity of \Mg/\C line
          are  also  found.  We  then apply the relations to estimate the
          black  hole masses of AGNs in Large Bright Quasar Surveyq and a
          sample  of  radio-loud  quasars.  For  the  objects  with small
          radio-loudness, the black hole mass estimated using the $R_{\rm
          BLR}  - L_{\eMg/\eC}$ relation is consistent with that from the
          $R_{BLR}  -  L_{3000\AA/1350 \AA}$ relation. But for radio-loud
          AGNs,  the  mass  estimated  from  the $R_{BLR} - L_{\eMg/\eC}$
          relation  is  systematically lower than that from the continuum
          luminosity   $L_{3000\AA/1350\AA}$.  Because  jets  could  have
          significant   contributions   to   the   UV/optical   continuum
          luminosity  of  radio-loud  AGNs,  we emphasized again that for
          radio-loud  AGNs,  the emission line luminosity may be a better
          tracer   of   the   ionizing   luminosity  than  the  continuum
          luminosity,  so  that the relations between the BLR size and UV
          emission  line  luminosity should be used to estimate the black
          hole masses of high redshift radio-loud AGNs.

          [Abridged]  Motivated  by  upcoming  data  from astrometric and

          Title:  A Deep Radio Survey of Abell 2125 III: The Cluster Core
          - Merging and Stripping

          We  use  radio,  near-IR,  optical,  and  X-ray observations to
          examine  dynamic processes in the central region of Abell 2125.
          In  addition  to  the central triple, including members of both
          major  dynamical  subsystems identified from a redshift survey,
          this  region  features  a  galaxy  showing  strong evidence for
          ongoing  gas  stripping  during a high-velocity passage through
          the  gas  in  the cluster core. The disk galaxy C153 exhibits a
          plume  stretching toward the cluster center seen in soft X-rays
          by Chandra, parts of which are also seen in [O II] emission and
          near-UV  continuum  light.  HST imaging shows a distorted disk,
          with  star-forming knots asymmetrically distributed and remnant
          spiral  structure possibly defined by dust lanes. The stars and
          ionized   gas   in   its   disk  are  kinematically  decoupled,
          demonstrating  that  pressure  stripping must be important, and
          that  tidal  disruption  is  not  the  only  mechanism at work.
          Comparison  of the gas properties seen in the X-ray and optical
          data on the plume highlight significant features of the history
          of stripped gas in the intracluster medium. The nucleus of C153
          also  hosts  an  AGN,  shown by the weak and distorted extended
          radio  emission  and a radio compact core. The unusual strength
          of  the stripping signatures in this instance is likely related
          to the high relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to the
          intracluster  medium,  during a cluster/cluster merger, and its
          passage  very  near  the  core  of the cluster. Another sign of
          recent  dynamical  events  is  diffuse starlight asymmetrically
          placed about the central triple in a cD envelope. Transient and
          extreme dynamical events as seen in Abell 2125 may be important
          drivers of galaxy evolution in the cores of rich clusters.

          Title:  CCS  and  NH3  emission  associated with low-mass young
          stellar objects
          Authors: I. de Gregorio-Monsalvo, J.F. Gomez, O. Suarez, T.B.H.

          Comments:  28  pages, 1 figure, 3 tables, to appear in the 2006
          May 1 issue of the Astrophysical Journal
          In  this work we present a sensitive and systematic single-dish
          survey of CCS emission (complemented with ammonia observations)
          at  1  cm,  toward a sample of low- and intermediate-mass young
          star forming regions known to harbor water maser emission, made
          with NASA's 70 m antenna at Robledo de Chavela, Spain.
          Out   of   the   40   star  forming  regions  surveyed  in  the
          CCS(2_{1}-1_{0})   line,  only  6  low-mass  sources  show  CCS
          emission:  one  transitional  object  between  pre-stellar  and
          protostellar  Class  0  phase (GF9-2), three Class 0 protostars
          (L1448-IRS3,  L1448C,  and  B1-IRS), a Class I source (L1251A),
          and  a  young  T  Tauri  star  (NGC2071-North).  Since  CCS  is
          considered  an  ``early-time'' (<10E+5 yr) molecule, we explain
          these   results   by   either   proposing  a  revision  of  the
          classification  of  the  age  of  NGC2071-North  and L1251A, or
          suggesting   the   possibility  that  the  particular  physical
          conditions   and   processes   of   each   source   affect  the
          destruction/production of the CCS. No statistically significant
          relationship   was  found  between  the  presence  of  CCS  and
          parameters of the molecular outflows and their driving sources.
          Nevertheless,  we  found a significant relationship between the
          detectability  of CCS and the ammonia peak intensity (higher in
          regions  with CCS), but not with its integrated intensity. This
          tendency  found  may  suggest  that  the  narrower ammonia line
          widths  in  the  less  turbulent medium associated with younger
          cores  may  compensate  for  the  differences  in  ammonia peak
          intensity,   rendering   differences  in  integrated  intensity
          negligible. From the CCS detection rate we derive a lifetime of
          this  molecule  of ~(0.7-3) x 10E+4 yr in low-mass star forming
          regions.

          HH  110  and  HH  262  are  two  Herbig-Haro  jets  with rather
          peculiar,  chaotic  morphology.  In  the  two  cases, no source
          suitable  to power the jet has been detected along the outflow,
          at  optical  or  radio  wavelengths.  Both,  previous  data and
          theoretical  models,  suggest that these objects are tracing an
          early  stage  of  an HH jet/dense cloud interaction. We present
          the   first   results   of   the  integral  field  spectroscopy
          observations  made  with  the  PMAS spectrophotometer (with the
          PPAK  configuration)  of  these two turbulent jets. New data of
          the  kinematics in several characteristic HH emission lines are

          Comments: ApJ, in press; 40 pages, 12 figures
          Mid-infrared  observations  of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are
          important  for  understanding of the physical conditions around
          the  central  accretion  engines.  Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray
          observations  of  a  300  arcmin^2 region in the Extended Groth
          Strip  are  used  to  select  a  sample of~150 AGN. The Spitzer
          instruments IRAC and MIPS detect 68-80% of these sources, which
          show  a wide range of mid-infrared properties. About 40% of the
          sources  have red power-law spectral energy distributions (f_nu
          ~  nu^alpha,  alpha<0)  in  the  3.6-8  um IRAC bands. In these
          sources the central engine dominates the emission at both X-ray
          and IR wavelengths. Another 40% of the sources have blue mid-IR
          spectral  energy  distributions  (alpha>0)  with their infrared
          emission  dominated  by  the host galaxy; the remaining 20% are
          not  well-fit by a power law. Published IRAC color criteria for
          AGN  select  most of the red sources, but only some of the blue
          sources.  As  with  all other known methods, selecting AGN with
          mid-IR  colors will not produce a sample that is simultaneously
          complete  and  reliable.  The  IRAC  SED type does not directly
          correspond  to  X-ray  spectral  type  (hard/soft).  The mid-IR
          properties of X-ray-detected Lyman-break, radio, submillimeter,
          and optically-faint sources vary widely and, for the most part,
          are  not  distinct  from  those  of  the general X-ray/infrared
          source  population.  X-ray sources emit 6-11% of the integrated
          mid--IR  light,  making  them  significant  contributors to the
          cosmic infrared background.

          Title: Assisted stellar suicide in V617 Sgr

          Telescope), D. Cieslinski (INPE), T. V. Ricci (IAG-USP)
          Comments: 4 pages, accepted for publication in A&A Letters
          V617  Sgr is a V Sagittae star - a group of binaries thought to
          be  the  galactic  counterparts of the Compact Binary Supersoft
          X-ray Sources - CBSS. To check this hypothesis, we measured the
          time  derivative  of  its  orbital  period. Observed timings of
          eclipse   minima   spanning  over  30,000  orbital  cycles  are
          presented.  We  found  that  the  orbital  period evolves quite
          rapidly:  P/Pdot  = 1.1 x 10^{6} years. This is consistent with
          the  idea  that  V617  Sgr is a wind driven accretion supersoft
          source. As the binary system evolves with a time-scale of about
          one  million  years,  which  is  extremely short for a low mass
          evolved  binary,  it  is  likely  that the system will soon end
          either  by having its secondary completely evaporated or by the
          primary exploding as a supernova of type Ia.

          We  report  the detection of hard X-ray emission from the field
          of  the star-forming region NGC 6334 with the the International
          Gamma-Ray  Astrophysics  Laboratory INTEGRAL. The JEM-X monitor
          and  ISGRI  imager aboard INTEGRAL and Chandra ACIS imager were
          used  to construct 3-80 keV images and spectra of NGC 6334. The
          3-10  keV  and  10-35 keV images made with JEM-X show a complex
          structure  of extended emission from NGC 6334. The ISGRI source
          detected in the energy ranges 20-40 keV and 40-80 keV coincides
          with  the NGC 6334 ridge. The 20-60 keV flux from the source is
          (1.8+-0.37)*10(-11)  erg cm(-2) s(-1). Spectral analysis of the
          source  revealed a hard power-law component with a photon index
          about  1.  The  observed  X-ray  fluxes  are  in agreement with
          extrapolations  of  X-ray  imaging  observations of NGC 6334 by
          Chandra  ACIS  and ASCA GIS. The X-ray data are consistent with
          two  very  different  physical  models.  A probable scenario is
          emission  from  a  heavily  absorbed,  compact and hard Chandra
          source  that  is associated with the AGN candidate radio source
          NGC  6334B.  Another  possible  model  is  the extended Chandra
          source  of  nonthermal  emission  from  NGC  6334 that can also
          account  for  the hard X-ray emission observed by INTEGRAL. The
          origin  of  the  emission  in  this scenario is due to electron
          acceleration  in  energetic  outflows  from  massive early type
          stars.  The  possibility  of  emission  from  a young supernova
          remnant,  as  suggested by earlier infrared observations of NGC
          6334, is constrained by the non-detection of 44Ti lines.

          Title:  A Deep Radio Survey of Abell 2125 III: The Cluster Core
          - Merging and Stripping

          We  use  radio,  near-IR,  optical,  and  X-ray observations to
          examine  dynamic processes in the central region of Abell 2125.
          In  addition  to  the central triple, including members of both
          major  dynamical  subsystems identified from a redshift survey,
          this  region  features  a  galaxy  showing  strong evidence for
          ongoing  gas  stripping  during a high-velocity passage through
          the  gas  in  the cluster core. The disk galaxy C153 exhibits a
          plume  stretching toward the cluster center seen in soft X-rays
          by Chandra, parts of which are also seen in [O II] emission and
          near-UV  continuum  light.  HST imaging shows a distorted disk,
          with  star-forming knots asymmetrically distributed and remnant
          spiral  structure possibly defined by dust lanes. The stars and
          ionized   gas   in   its   disk  are  kinematically  decoupled,
          demonstrating  that  pressure  stripping must be important, and
          that  tidal  disruption  is  not  the  only  mechanism at work.
          Comparison  of the gas properties seen in the X-ray and optical
          data on the plume highlight significant features of the history
          of stripped gas in the intracluster medium. The nucleus of C153
          also  hosts  an  AGN,  shown by the weak and distorted extended
          radio  emission  and a radio compact core. The unusual strength
          of  the stripping signatures in this instance is likely related
          to the high relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to the
          intracluster  medium,  during a cluster/cluster merger, and its
          passage  very  near  the  core  of the cluster. Another sign of
          recent  dynamical  events  is  diffuse starlight asymmetrically
          placed about the central triple in a cD envelope. Transient and
          extreme dynamical events as seen in Abell 2125 may be important
          drivers of galaxy evolution in the cores of rich clusters.

          Title:  CCS  and  NH3  emission  associated with low-mass young
          stellar objects
          Authors: I. de Gregorio-Monsalvo, J.F. Gomez, O. Suarez, T.B.H.

          Comments:  28  pages, 1 figure, 3 tables, to appear in the 2006
          May 1 issue of the Astrophysical Journal
          In  this work we present a sensitive and systematic single-dish
          survey of CCS emission (complemented with ammonia observations)
          at  1  cm,  toward a sample of low- and intermediate-mass young
          star forming regions known to harbor water maser emission, made
          with NASA's 70 m antenna at Robledo de Chavela, Spain.
          Out   of   the   40   star  forming  regions  surveyed  in  the
          CCS(2_{1}-1_{0})   line,  only  6  low-mass  sources  show  CCS
          emission:  one  transitional  object  between  pre-stellar  and
          protostellar  Class  0  phase (GF9-2), three Class 0 protostars
          (L1448-IRS3,  L1448C,  and  B1-IRS), a Class I source (L1251A),
          and  a  young  T  Tauri  star  (NGC2071-North).  Since  CCS  is
          considered  an  ``early-time'' (<10E+5 yr) molecule, we explain
          these   results   by   either   proposing  a  revision  of  the
          classification  of  the  age  of  NGC2071-North  and L1251A, or
          suggesting   the   possibility  that  the  particular  physical
          conditions   and   processes   of   each   source   affect  the
          destruction/production of the CCS. No statistically significant
          relationship   was  found  between  the  presence  of  CCS  and
          parameters of the molecular outflows and their driving sources.
          Nevertheless,  we  found a significant relationship between the
          detectability  of CCS and the ammonia peak intensity (higher in
          regions  with CCS), but not with its integrated intensity. This
          tendency  found  may  suggest  that  the  narrower ammonia line
          widths  in  the  less  turbulent medium associated with younger
          cores  may  compensate  for  the  differences  in  ammonia peak
          intensity,   rendering   differences  in  integrated  intensity
          negligible. From the CCS detection rate we derive a lifetime of
          this  molecule  of ~(0.7-3) x 10E+4 yr in low-mass star forming
          regions.

          HH  110  and  HH  262  are  two  Herbig-Haro  jets  with rather
          peculiar,  chaotic  morphology.  In  the  two  cases, no source
          suitable  to power the jet has been detected along the outflow,
          at  optical  or  radio  wavelengths.  Both,  previous  data and
          theoretical  models,  suggest that these objects are tracing an
          early  stage  of  an HH jet/dense cloud interaction. We present
          the   first   results   of   the  integral  field  spectroscopy
          observations  made  with  the  PMAS spectrophotometer (with the
          PPAK  configuration)  of  these two turbulent jets. New data of
          the  kinematics in several characteristic HH emission lines are
          shown. In addition, line-ratio maps have been made, suitable to
          explore  the  spatial  excitation  an density conditions of the
          jets as a function of their kinematics.

          Comments: ApJ, in press; 40 pages, 12 figures
          Mid-infrared  observations  of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are
          important  for  understanding of the physical conditions around
          the  central  accretion  engines.  Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray
          observations  of  a  300  arcmin^2 region in the Extended Groth
          Strip  are  used  to  select  a  sample of~150 AGN. The Spitzer
          instruments IRAC and MIPS detect 68-80% of these sources, which
          show  a wide range of mid-infrared properties. About 40% of the
          sources  have red power-law spectral energy distributions (f_nu
          ~  nu^alpha,  alpha<0)  in  the  3.6-8  um IRAC bands. In these
          sources the central engine dominates the emission at both X-ray
          and IR wavelengths. Another 40% of the sources have blue mid-IR
          spectral  energy  distributions  (alpha>0)  with their infrared
          emission  dominated  by  the host galaxy; the remaining 20% are
          not  well-fit by a power law. Published IRAC color criteria for
          AGN  select  most of the red sources, but only some of the blue
          sources.  As  with  all other known methods, selecting AGN with
          mid-IR  colors will not produce a sample that is simultaneously
          complete  and  reliable.  The  IRAC  SED type does not directly
          correspond  to  X-ray  spectral  type  (hard/soft).  The mid-IR
          properties of X-ray-detected Lyman-break, radio, submillimeter,
          and optically-faint sources vary widely and, for the most part,
          are  not  distinct  from  those  of  the general X-ray/infrared
          source  population.  X-ray sources emit 6-11% of the integrated
          mid--IR  light,  making  them  significant  contributors to the
          cosmic infrared background.

          Title: Assisted stellar suicide in V617 Sgr

          Telescope), D. Cieslinski (INPE), T. V. Ricci (IAG-USP)
          Comments: 4 pages, accepted for publication in A&A Letters
          V617  Sgr is a V Sagittae star - a group of binaries thought to
          be  the  galactic  counterparts of the Compact Binary Supersoft
          X-ray Sources - CBSS. To check this hypothesis, we measured the
          time  derivative  of  its  orbital  period. Observed timings of
          eclipse   minima   spanning  over  30,000  orbital  cycles  are
          presented.  We  found  that  the  orbital  period evolves quite
          rapidly:  P/Pdot  = 1.1 x 10^{6} years. This is consistent with
          the  idea  that  V617  Sgr is a wind driven accretion supersoft
          source. As the binary system evolves with a time-scale of about
          one  million  years,  which  is  extremely short for a low mass
          evolved  binary,  it  is  likely  that the system will soon end
          either  by having its secondary completely evaporated or by the
          primary exploding as a supernova of type Ia.

          We  report  the detection of hard X-ray emission from the field
          of  the star-forming region NGC 6334 with the the International
          Gamma-Ray  Astrophysics  Laboratory INTEGRAL. The JEM-X monitor
          and  ISGRI  imager aboard INTEGRAL and Chandra ACIS imager were
          used  to construct 3-80 keV images and spectra of NGC 6334. The
          3-10  keV  and  10-35 keV images made with JEM-X show a complex
          structure  of extended emission from NGC 6334. The ISGRI source
          detected in the energy ranges 20-40 keV and 40-80 keV coincides
          with  the NGC 6334 ridge. The 20-60 keV flux from the source is
          (1.8+-0.37)*10(-11)  erg cm(-2) s(-1). Spectral analysis of the
          source  revealed a hard power-law component with a photon index
          about  1.  The  observed  X-ray  fluxes  are  in agreement with
          extrapolations  of  X-ray  imaging  observations of NGC 6334 by
          Chandra  ACIS  and ASCA GIS. The X-ray data are consistent with
          two  very  different  physical  models.  A probable scenario is
          emission  from  a  heavily  absorbed,  compact and hard Chandra
          source  that  is associated with the AGN candidate radio source
          NGC  6334B.  Another  possible  model  is  the extended Chandra
          source  of  nonthermal  emission  from  NGC  6334 that can also
          account  for  the hard X-ray emission observed by INTEGRAL. The
          origin  of  the  emission  in  this scenario is due to electron
          acceleration  in  energetic  outflows  from  massive early type
          stars.  The  possibility  of  emission  from  a young supernova
          remnant,  as  suggested by earlier infrared observations of NGC
          6334, is constrained by the non-detection of 44Ti lines.

          Title: Massive Black Hole Binaries from Collisional Runaways
          Authors:  M.  Atakan Grkan, John M. Fregeau, Frederic A. Rasio
          (Northwestern University)
          Comments: 4 pages with emulateapj. Submitted to ApJ Letters
          Recent  theoretical  work  has  solidified the viability of the
          collisional  runaway  scenario in young dense star clusters for
          the  formation  of  very  massive  stars  (VMSs),  which may be
          precursors to intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We present
          first results from a numerical study of the collisional runaway
          process  in dense star clusters containing primordial binaries.
          Stellar collisions during binary scattering encounters offer an
          alternate  channel  for runaway growth, somewhat independent of
          direct  collisions  between single stars. We find that clusters
          with  binary  fractions  >~10%  yield  two VMSs via collisional
          runaways,   presenting   the   exotic  possibility  of  forming
          IMBH--IMBH   binaries   in   star   clusters.  We  discuss  the
          implications  for  gravitational  wave  observations,  and  the
          impact on cluster structure.

          Comments: 16 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables, MNRAS submitted
          We  use the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) to study the soft X-ray
          properties  of  a homogeneous sample of 46,420 quasars selected
          from  the  third  data  release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
          (SDSS).   Optical  luminosities,  both  at  rest-frame  2500\AA
          ($L_{2500}$)  and  in [OIII] ($L_{[\rm{OIII}]}$) span more than
          three   orders   of   magnitude,  while  redshifts  range  over
          $0.1<z<5.4$.  We  detect  3366 quasars directly in the observed
          0.1--2.4  keV  band.  Sub-samples of radio-loud and radio-quiet
          objects (RLQs and RQQs) are obtained by cross-matching with the
          FIRST  catalogue. We study the distribution of X-ray luminosity
          as  a  function of optical luminosity, redshift and radio power
          using both individual detections and stacks of complete sets of
          similar quasars. At every optical luminosity and redshift $\log
          L_{2\kev}$  is,  to  a good approximation, normally distributed
          with dispersion $\sim 0.40$, at least brightwards of the median
          X-ray  luminosity. This median X-ray luminosity of quasars is a
          power  law  of  optical  luminosity  with index $\sim 0.53$ for
          $L_{2500}$  and  $\sim  0.30$  for  $L_{[\rm{OIII}]}$. RLQs are
          systematically  brighter  than  RQQs  by about a factor of 2 at
          given  optical  luminosity.  The zero-points of these relations
          increase  systematically  with  redshift, possibly in different
          ways for RLQs and RQQs. Evolution is particularly strong at low
          redshift  and  if  the  optical  luminosity is characterised by
          $L_{[\rm{OIII}]}$.    At    low    redshift    and   at   given
          $L_{[\rm{OIII}]}$  the  soft X-ray emission from type II AGN is
          more than 100 times weaker than that from type I AGN.

          Title:  Magnetized  Supramassive  Neutron  Star Collapse: A New
          Model For X-Ray Flares In Early GRB Afterglows
          Authors: W. H. Gao
          Comments: 6 pages
          Energetic  X-ray  flares  have  been  well  detected  in a good
          fraction  of  {\em Swift} Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) afterglows tens
          to  hundreds  of  seconds  after  the  trigger  of  the  prompt
          $\gamma-$ray   emission   phase.   These   flares  are  usually
          attributed  to the late time activity of the central engine. We
          suggest  a  new central engine model to account for these X-ray
          flares.  In  this  model,  the GRB central engine is a rotating
          magnetized  supramassive neutron star (SMNS). When the SMNS has
          lost  its significant part of angular momentum, it collapses to
          a  black  hole  and  produces a Poynting-flux dominated outflow
          which give rise to the observed X-ray flares.

          Nature Physics (Feb. 2006)
          The  first  locations  of  short  gamma-ray  bursts  (GRBs)  in
          elliptical galaxies suggest they are produced by the mergers of
          double  neutron star (DNS) binaries in old stellar populations.
          Globular  clusters,  where  the  extreme  densities of very old
          stars  in  cluster  cores  create and exchange compact binaries
          efficiently,  are a natural environment to produce merging NSs.
          They  also  allow  some short GRBs to be offset from their host
          galaxies,  as opposed to DNS systems formed from massive binary
          stars which appear to remain in galactic disks. Starting with a
          simple  scaling  from  the  first  DNS  observed  in a galactic
          globular,  which will produce a short GRB in ~300My, we present
          numerical simulations which show that ~10-30% of short GRBs may
          be produced in globular clusters vs. the much more numerous DNS
          mergers   and   short   GRBs   predicted  for  galactic  disks.
          Reconciling  the  rates  suggests  the disk short GRBs are more
          beamed,  perhaps  by both the increased merger angular momentum
          from  the  DNS spin-orbit alignment (random for the DNS systems
          in globulars) and a larger magnetic field on the secondary NS.

          updated  since  the  conference, I summarize recent and ongoing
          analysis  of  the  millisecond  pulsars,  the  compact binaries
          containing   white   dwarfs   and   neutron   stars,   and  the
          chromospherically  active  binaries  in both globular clusters.
          Spectral  variability analysis enables new insights into source
          properties  and evolutionary history. These binary populations,
          now   so  ``easily''  visible,  are  large  enough  that  their
          properties  and  spatial  distributions  reveal  new  hints  of
          compact  object  formation  and  binary interactions with their
          parent  cluster. Neutron stars appear overabundant, relative to
          white  dwarfs,  in  47Tuc  vs.  NGC  6397.  The IXBs containing
          neutron  stars (i.e., MSPs and qLMXBs), as the most massive and
          ancient  compact binary sample, may trace the protocluster disk
          in  47Tuc,  whereas  compact  binaries  may  have  been ejected
          preferentially  along  the  cluster rotation equator during the
          recent core collapse in NGC 6397.

          The  Energetic  X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) is under
          study  for  the  proposed  Black  Hole Finder Probe, one of the
          three   Einstein  Probe  missions  in  NASA's  proposed  Beyond
          Einstein  Program.  EXIST  would  have  unique capabilities: it
          would  survey  the  full sky at 5-600 keV each 95min orbit with
          0.9-5  arcmin, 10microsec - 45min, and ~0.5-5 keV resolution to
          locate  sources  to  10arcsec  and  enable  black  holes  to be
          surveyed   and  studied  on  all  scales.  With  5sigma  survey
          sensitivity   (0.5-1y)  Fx(40-80  keV)  ~5  x  10^-13  cgs,  or
          comparable  to the ROSAT soft X-ray (0.3-2.5 keV) sky survey, a
          large  sample  (~2-4 x 10^4) of obscured AGN will be identified
          and  a  complete  sample  of  accreting stellar mass BHs in the
          Galaxy  will be found. The all-sky/all-time coverage will allow
          rare events to be measured, such as possible stellar disruption
          flares  from  dormant  AGN  out  to  ~200  Mpc.  A large sample
          (~2-3/day)   of   GRBs   will   be   located   (<~10arcsec)  at
          sensitivities  and  bandwidths much greater than previously and
          likely yield the highest redshift events and constraints on Pop
          III  BHs.  An  outline  of  the mission design from the ongoing
          concept study is presented.

          Title: QPOs during magnetar flares are not driven by mechanical
          normal modes of the crust
          Authors: Yuri Levin (Leiden Observatory and Lorentz Institute)
          Comments: 3 pages, submitted to MNRAS letters
          Quasi-Periodic  Oscillations  (QPOs)  have been observed during
          three powerful magnetar flares, from SGR0526-66, SGR1806-20 and
          SGR1900+14.  These QPOs have been commonly interpreted as being
          driven  by  the  mechanical modes of the magnetar's solid crust
          which  are  excited  during  the  flare. Here we show that this
          interpretation  is in sharp contradiction with the conventional
          magnetar  model.  Firstly, we show that a magnetar crustal mode
          decays on the timescale of at most a second due to the emission
          of  Alfven  waves  into  the  neutron-star interior. A possible
          modification  is  then  to  assume that the QPOs are associated
          with the magnetars' global modes. However, we argue that at the
          frequencies  of  the  observed  QPOs,  the neutron-star core is
          likely  to  support  a  continuum of Magneto-Hydrodynamic (MHD)
          normal  modes. We demonstrate this on a completely solvable toy
          model  which  captures  the essential physics of the system. We
          then  show  that  the frequency of the global mode of the whole
          star  must  have  a  significant  imaginary  component, and its
          amplitude  must  decay  on  a  short  timescale.  This  is  not
          observed.  Thus  we  conclude that either (i) the origin of the
          QPO  is  in  the magnetar's magnetosphere, or (ii) the magnetic
          field  must  be  expelled from the magnetar's core prior to the
          flares.

          Title:  Understanding  the Nuclear Gas Dispersion in Early-Type
          Galaxies in the Context of Black Hole Demographics
          Authors:  Gijs  Verdoes  Kleijn,  Roeland  van der Marel, Jacob
          Noel-Storr
          Comments: accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal
          (abridged)  We  analyze  and  model HST /STIS observations of a
          sample  of  27  galaxies;  16  Fanaroff  &  Riley  Type I radio
          galaxies  and  11  (more)  normal early-type galaxies. We focus
          here   on  what  can  be  learned  from  the  nuclear  velocity
          dispersion  (line width) of the gas as a complement to the many
          studies  dealing with gas rotation velocities. We find that the
          dispersion in a STIS aperture of ~0.1''-0.2'' generally exceeds
          the large-scale stellar velocity dispersion of the galaxy. This
          is  qualitatively  consistent with the presence of central BHs,
          but raises the question whether the excess gas dispersion is of
          gravitational  or  non-gravitational  origin  and  whether  the
          implied BH masses are consistent with our current understanding
          of  BH  demography(as predicted by the M-sigma relation between
          BH  mass  and  stellar velocity dispersion). To address this we
          construct  dynamical  models for the gas, both thin disk models
          and   models   with  more  general  axis  ratios  and  velocity
          anisotropies.   For   the   normal  galaxies  the  nuclear  gas
          dispersions are adequately reproduced assuming disks around BHs
          with  masses that follow the M-sigma relation. In contrast, the
          gas  dispersions  observed  for  the  radio  galaxies generally
          exceed  those predicted by any of the models. We attribute this
          to  the  presence  of non-gravitational motions in the gas that
          are  similar  to  or larger than the gravitational motions. The
          non-  gravitational motions are presumably driven by the active
          galactic  nucleus  (AGN), but we do not find a relation between
          the  radiative  output  of  the  AGN  and the non-gravitational
          dispersion.  It  is  not  possible to uniquely determine the BH
          mass  for each galaxy from its nuclear gas dispersion. However,
          for  the  sample  as  a  whole  the observed dispersions do not
          provide  evidence  for  significant deviations from the M-sigma
          relation.

          Title: Eclipsing binaries in ASAS catalog
          Authors: B. Paczynski, D. Szczygiel, B. Pilecki, G. Pojmanski
          Comments: 8 pages, 12 figures, latex, submitted to MNRAS
          ASAS  is  a  long term project to monitor bright variable stars
          over the whole sky. It has discovered 50,122 variables brighter
          than  V  <  14  mag south of declination +28 degrees, and among
          them  11,099  eclipsing  binaries.  We  present  a  preliminary
          analysis  of  5,384  contact,  2,957  semi-detached,  and 2,758
          detached systems. The statistics of the distribution provides a
          qualitative  confirmation  of  decades old idea of Flannery and
          Lucy  that  W  UMa  type  binaries  evolve  through a series of
          relaxation   oscillations:  ASAS  finds  comparable  number  of
          contact and semidetached systems. The most surprising result is
          a very small number of detached eclipsing binaries with periods
          P  < 1 day, the systems believed to be the progenitors of W UMa
          stars.  As many (perhaps all) contact binaries have companions,
          there  is a possibility that some were formed in a Kozai cycle,
          as suggested by Eggleton and his associates.

          figures)
          On  2004  August 15, we observed a fast (shorter than 10 hours)
          state  transition  in  the bright black-hole transient GX 339-4
          simultaneously  with RossiXTE and INTEGRAL. This transition was
          evident  both  in timing and spectral properties. Combining the
          data  from  PCA,  HEXTE  and  IBIS,  we  obtained  good quality
          broad-band  (3-200  keV)  energy  spectra  before and after the
          transition.  These  spectra  indicate  that  the hard component
          steepened. Also, the high-energy cutoff that was present at ~70
          keV   before   the   transition  was  not  detected  after  the
          transition.   This   is   the   first  time  that  an  accurate
          determination   of   the  broad-band  spectrum  across  such  a
          transition  has  been  measured on a short time scale. It shows
          that,  although some spectral parameters do not change abruptly
          through     the     transition,    the    high-energy    cutoff
          increases/disappears  rather  fast.  These results constitute a
          benchmark   on   which  to  test  theoretical  models  for  the
          production of the hard component in these systems.

          We  study  the  bending  of  jets  in binary stellar systems. A
          compact  companion  accretes  mass  from  the  slow wind of the
          mass-losing  primary  star,  forms an accretion disk, and blows
          two  opposite  jets. These fast jets are bent by the slow wind.
          Disregarding  the orbital motion, we find the dependence of the
          bending  angle on the properties of the slow wind and the jets.
          Bending  of  jets  is  observed  in planetary nebulae which are
          thought  to be the descendants of interacting binary stars. For
          example,  in  some  of  these planetary nebulae the two bubbles
          (lobes)  which  are  inflated  by  the  two  opposite jets, are
          displaced  to the same side of the symmetry axis of the nebula.
          Similar  displacements  are  observed  in  bubble  pairs in the
          center  of some clusters and groups of galaxies. We compare the
          bending of jets in binary stellar systems with that in clusters
          of galaxies.

          Propagation   of   light   in   the   gravitational   field  of
          self-gravitating   spinning   bodies   moving   with  arbitrary
          velocities  is discussed. The gravitational field is assumed to
          be  "weak"  everywhere.  Equations of motion of a light ray are
          solved  in  the  first  post-Minkowskian  approximation that is
          linear  with  respect  to  the universal gravitational constant
          $G$.  We  do  not  restrict ourselves with the approximation of
          gravitational  lens  so that the solution of light geodesics is
          applicable  for  arbitrary  locations  of  source  of light and
          observer. This formalism is applied for studying corrections to
          the Shapiro time delay in binary pulsars caused by the rotation
          of  pulsar  and its companion. We also derive the correction to
          the  light  deflection  angle caused by rotation of gravitating
          bodies  in  the  solar system (Sun, planets) or a gravitational
          lens.  The gravitational shift of frequency due to the combined
          translational  and  rotational  motions of light-ray-deflecting
          bodies is analyzed as well. We give a general derivation of the
          formula  describing  the  relativistic rotation of the plane of
          polarization  of electromagnetic waves (Skrotskii effect). This
          formula  is  valid  for  arbitrary translational and rotational
          motion of gravitating bodies and greatly extends the results of
          previous  researchers. Finally, we discuss the Skrotskii effect
          for  gravitational waves emitted by localized sources such as a
          binary  system.  The  theoretical  results of this paper can be
          applied   for   studying   various   relativistic   effects  in
          microarcsecond  space  astrometry  and developing corresponding
          algorithms  for  data  processing in space astrometric missions
          such as FAME, SIM, and GAIA.

          We   use   GALEX  (Galaxy  Evolution  Explorer)  near-UV  (NUV)
          photometry  of  a sample of earlytype galaxies selected in SDSS
          (Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey)  to  study the UV color-magnitude
          relation  (CMR).  NUV-r  color  is  an excellent tracer of even
          small  amounts  (>  1%  mass  fraction) of recent (<1 Gyr) star
          formation and so the NUV-r CMR allows us to study the effect of
          environment  on the recent star formation history. We analyze a
          volume-limited  sample  of  839  visually-inspected  early-type
          galaxies in the redshift range 0.05 < z < 0.10 brighter than Mr
          of  -21.5 with any possible emission-line or radio-selected AGN
          removed  to  avoid contamination. We find that contamination by
          AGN  candidates and late-type interlopers highly bias any study
          of recent star formation in early-type galaxies and that, after
          removing  those,  our  lower  limit  to the fraction of massive
          early-type  galaxies  showing signs of recent star formation is
          roughly 23 +/- 2% This suggests that residual star formation is
          common   even   amongst   the  present  day  early-type  galaxy
          population.  We  find that the fraction of UV-bright early-type
          galaxies  is  50%  higher in low-density environments. However,
          the density effect is clear only in the lowest density bin. The
          blue  galaxy  fraction  for  the  subsample  of  the  brightest
          early-type   galaxies  however  shows  a  very  strong  density
          dependence, in the sense that the blue galaxy fraction is lower
          in a higher density region.

          We  present  the  identification of the optical counterparts to
          the  low-mass  X-ray  binaries  1A  1246-588 and 4U 1812-12. We
          determine  the  X-ray  position  of 1A 1246-588 from ROSAT/PSPC
          observations  and find within the error circle a blue star with
          V=19.45,  B-V=0.22  and  R-I=0.22  which  we  identify  as  the
          counterpart.  Within  the Chandra error circle of 4U 1812-12, a
          single  star  is present which appears blue with respect to the
          stars  in  the  vicinity.  It  has  R=22.15, R-I=1.53. Distance
          estimates   for   both   systems   indicate  that  the  optical
          counterparts  are intrinsically faint, suggesting that they are
          ultra-compact   X-ray  binaries.  These  identifications  would
          increase  the  number of candidate ultra-compact X-ray binaries
          from  2  to  4, whereas orbital periods are measured for only 7
          systems in the Galactic disk.

          of  X-ray  lightcurves  of  several  black-hole  candidates. We
          further explore the idea that a non-linear resonance mechanism,
          operating  in  strong-gravity  regime, is responsible for these
          quasi-periodic    oscillations   (QPOs).   By   extending   the
          multiple-scales    analysis    of    Rebusco,    we   construct
          two-dimensional   phase-space  sections,  which  enable  us  to
          identify  different  topologies  governing  the  system  and to
          follow  evolutionary  tracks  of  the twin peaks. This suggests
          that     the     original     (Abramowicz     and     Kluzniak)
          parametric-resonance  scheme  can  be  viewed  as  an ingenuous
          account  of  the QPOs model with an internal resonance. We show
          an  example  of  internal  resonance in a system with up to two
          critical  points,  and  we  describe  a  general technique that
          permits  to  treat  other  cases  in  a  systematical manner. A
          separatrix  divides  the  phase-space  sections into regions of
          different   topology:   inside   the   libration   region   the
          evolutionary tracks bring the observed twin-peak frequencies to
          an  exact rational ratio, whereas in the circulation region the
          observed  frequencies remain off resonance. Our scheme predicts
          the  power  should  cyclically  be  exchanged  between  the two
          oscillations.  Likewise the high-frequency QPOs in neutron-star
          binaries,  also in black-hole sources one expects, as a general
          property  of  the non-linear model, that slight detuning pushes
          the twin-peak frequencies out of sharp resonance.

          Title:  Implications  of the Early X-Ray Afterglow Light Curves
          of Swift GRBs
          Authors: Jonathan Granot, Arieh Konigl, Tsvi Piran
          Comments: 31 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables; submitted to MNRAS
          According  to  current  models,  gamma-ray  bursts  (GRBs)  are
          produced  when  the energy carried by a relativistic outflow is
          dissipated and converted into radiation. The efficiency of this
          process,  $\epsilon_\gamma$,  is one of the critical factors in
          any  GRB  model. The X-ray afterglow light curves of Swift GRBs
          show an early stage of flat decay. This has been interpreted as
          reflecting   energy  injection.  When  combined  with  previous
          estimates,  which have concluded that the kinetic energy of the
          late  ($\gtrsim  10$  hr) afterglow is comparable to the energy
          emitted  in  gamma-rays,  this interpretation implies very high
          values of $\epsilon_\gamma \gtrsim 0.9$. Such a high efficiency
          is  hard to reconcile with most models, including in particular
          the popular internal-shocks model. We re-analyze the derivation
          of  the  kinetic  energy  from  the  afterglow  X-ray  flux and
          re-examine  the  resulting  estimates  of  the  efficiency.  We
          confirm  that,  if the flatt decay arises from energy injection
          and  the  pre-Swift  broad-band estimates of the kinetic energy
          are  correct, then $\epsilon_\gamma \gtrsim 0.9$. We point out,
          however,  that another interpretation of the flattish decay - a
          variable  X-ray  afterglow  efficiency  (e.g.,  due  to  a time
          dependence  of  afterglow  shock microphysical parameters) - is
          possible.  We  also  show  that direct estimates of the kinetic
          energy  from the late X-ray afterglow flux are sensitive to the
          assumed  values  of  the  shock  microphysical  parameters  and
          suggest    that    broad-band   afterglow   fits   might   have
          underestimated  the kinetic energy (e.g., by overestimating the
          fraction  of  electrons  that  are  accelerated to relativistic
          energies).  Either  one  of these possibilities implies a lower
          gamma-ray  efficiency, and their joint effect could conceivably
          reduce  the  estimate of the typical $\epsilon_\gamma$ to $\sim
          0.1-0.5$.

          We   present   the   first   MIR   spectrum   of  the  z=2.2856
          ultraluminous,  infrared  galaxy  FSC 10214+4724, obtained with
          the  Infrared Spectrograph onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope.
          The spectrum spans a rest wavelength range of 2.3-11.5 microns,
          covering  a  number  of  key diagnostic emission and absorption
          features. The most prominent feature in the IRS spectrum is the
          silicate  emission  at rest-frame 10 microns. We also detect an
          unresolved  emission  line at a rest wavelength of 7.65 microns
          which  we identify with [NeVI], and a slightly resolved feature
          at  5.6  microns  identified as a blend of [Mg VII] and [Mg V].
          There are no strong PAH emission features in the FSC 10214+4724
          spectrum.  We  place  a  limit  of 0.1 micron on the equivalent
          width  of  6.2  micron  PAH  emission  but see no evidence of a
          corresponding  7.7  micron  feature. Semi-empirical fits to the
          spectral   energy   distribution   suggest  about  45%  of  the
          bolometric  luminosity  arises from cold 50 K dust, half arises
          from  warm (190 K) dust, and the remainder, 5%, originates from
          hot  (640 K) dust. The hot dust is required to fit the blue end
          of  the steep MIR spectrum. The combination of a red continuum,
          strong  silicate  emission,  little  or no PAH emission, and no
          silicate  absorption,  makes  FSC  10214+4724 unlike most other
          ULIRGs  or  AGN  observed  thus  far with IRS. These apparently
          contradictory  properties  may  be explained by an AGN which is
          highly  magnified  by  the lens, masking a (dominant) overlying
          starburst with unusually weak PAH emission.

          We  discuss  the preliminary results of a survey of young (<300
          Myr),  close  (<50 pc) stars with the Simultaneous Differential
          Extrasolar  Planet  Imager (SDI) implemented at the VLT and the
          MMT.  SDI  uses  a  double Wollaston prism and a quad filter to
          take   4  identical  images  simultaneously  at  3  wavelengths
          surrounding  the 1.62 um methane bandhead found in the spectrum
          of cool brown dwarfs and gas giants. By performing a difference
          of  images in these filters, speckle noise from the primary can
          be  significantly attenuated, resulting in photon noise limited
          data.  In  our survey data, we achieved H band contrasts >25000
          (5  sigma Delta F1(1.575 um) > 10 mag, Delta H > 11.5 mag for a
          T6  spectral  type)  at  a  separation of 0.5" from the primary
          star.  With  this  degree  of attenuation, we should be able to
          image  (5  sigma  detection)  a 2-4 Jupiter mass planet at 5 AU
          around  a 30 Myr star at 10 pc. We are currently completing our
          survey  of  young,  nearby  stars.  We  have  obtained complete
          datasets  for 35 stars in the southern sky (VLT) and 7 stars in
          the  northern sky (MMT). We believe that our SDI images are the
          highest  contrast  astronomical images ever made from ground or
          space for methane rich companions.

          Sanders, to be published in the special issue of Pub. of PMO
          We  present  results  from two mid-infrared imaging programs of
          ultraluminous  infrared  galaxies  (ULIRGs)  and fine-structure
          elliptical  galaxies.  The  former  are  known to nearly all be
          recent  mergers between two gas-rich spiral galaxies, while the
          latter  are also believed to be even more aged merger remnants.
          An  examination  of  these  two  classes  of objects, which may
          represent   different   stages  of  the  same  putative  merger
          sequence,  should  reveal  similarities  in the distribution of
          their stellar populations and dust content consistent with that
          expected  for time-evolution of the merger. The data reveal for
          the  first  time  extended  dust  emission  in the ULIRG galaxy
          bodies  and  along  their  tidal features. However, contrary to
          expectation,   we   find   that   the   vast  majority  of  the
          fine-structure   elliptical   galaxies   lack  such  structured
          emission. This likely results from the optical selection of the
          elliptical  sample, resulting in a population that reflects the
          IR-activity (or lack thereof) of optically selected interacting
          galaxies. Alternately, this may reflect an evolutionary process
          in the distribution of the dust content of the galaxy bodies.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We  report  on  two  ASCA  observations  of the high-mass X-ray
          binary   pulsar   OAO   1657-415.   A  short  observation  near
          mid-eclipse  caught the source in a low-intensity state, with a
          weak  continuum  and  iron  emission  dominated  by the 6.4-keV
          fluorescent  line. A later, longer observation found the source
          in  a  high-intensity  state and covered the uneclipsed through
          mid-eclipse   phases.   In   the   high-intensity   state,  the
          non-eclipse spectrum has an absorbed continuum component due to
          scattering  by  material near the pulsar and 80 per cent of the
          fluorescent  iron  emission comes from less than 19 lt-sec away
          from  the  pulsar.  We  find  a dust-scattered X-ray halo whose
          intensity  decays  through  the  eclipse.  We  use this halo to
          estimate the distance to the source as 7.1 +/- 1.3 kpc.

          In   order   to   determine   the   incidence   of  black  hole
          accretion-driven   nuclear  activity  in  nearby  galaxies,  as
          manifested  by  their  radio  emission,  we  have carried out a
          high-resolution   Multi-Element   Radio-Linked   Interferometer
          Network (MERLIN) survey of LINERs and composite LINER/H{\sc ii}
          galaxies  from  a  complete  magnitude-limited sample of bright
          nearby  galaxies  (Palomar sample) with unknown arcsecond-scale
          radio  properties. There are fifteen radio detections, of which
          three  are  new  subarcsecond-scale  radio core detections, all
          being  candidate  AGN.  The  detected  galaxies  supplement the
          already  known  low-luminosity  AGN -- low-luminosity Seyferts,
          LINERs and composite LINER/H{\sc ii} galaxies -- in the Palomar
          sample.  Combining  all  radio-detected  Seyferts,  LINERs  and
          composite  LINER/H{\sc ii} galaxies (LTS sources), we obtain an
          overall  radio  detection rate of 54% (22% of all bright nearby
          galaxies) and we estimate that at least $\sim$50% ($\sim$20% of
          all  bright  nearby galaxies) are true AGN. The radio powers of
          the  LTS  galaxies  allow  the  construction  of  a local radio
          luminosity  function. By comparing the luminosity function with
          those  of  selected  moderate-redshift  AGN,  selected from the
          2dF/NVSS  survey, we find that LTS sources naturally extend the
          RLF  of  powerful  AGN down to powers of about 10 times that of
          Sgr A*.

          Pulsars   steadily   dissipate   their  rotational  energy  via
          relativistic  winds.  Confinement  of  these outflows generates
          luminous  pulsar  wind nebulae, seen across the electromagnetic
          spectrum  in  synchrotron  and inverse Compton emission, and in
          optical  emission lines when they shock the surrounding medium.
          These  sources  act as important probes of relativistic shocks,
          particle  acceleration  and  of interstellar gas. We review the
          many  recent advances in the study of pulsar wind nebulae, with
          particular focus on the evolutionary stages through which these
          objects progress as they expand into their surroundings, and on
          morphological  structures  within  these nebulae which directly
          trace  the  physical  processes  of  particle  acceleration and
          outflow. We conclude by considering some exciting new probes of
          pulsar  wind  nebulae,  including  the  study  of TeV gamma-ray
          emission  from  these sources, and observations of pulsar winds
          in close binary systems.

          star  formation of 2 different populations? We first review the

          quantify   the   difference  and  overlaps  between  these  two
          populations  of  star  forming  galaxies.  We then present some

          and  UV  selected galaxies at z=0.6, in an attempt to constrain
          the  evolution  of  the dust attenuation and of stellar mass of

          Title: Heating Rate Profiles in Galaxy Clusters
          Authors:  Edward  C.D.  Pope,  Georgi  Pavlovski,  Christian R.
          Kaiser, Hans Fangohr
          Comments:  13  pages,  3  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          In  recent  years  evidence has accumulated suggesting that the
          gas   in   galaxy   clusters  is  heated  by  non-gravitational
          processes.  Here  we  calculate  the  heating rates required to
          maintain  a  physically  motived mass flow rate, in a sample of
          seven   galaxy  clusters.  We  employ  the  spectroscopic  mass
          deposition   rates   as   an  observational  input  along  with
          temperature  and  density  data  for each cluster. On energetic
          grounds  we  find  that  thermal  conduction  could provide the
          necessary  heating for A2199, Perseus, A1795 and A478. However,
          the  suppression  factor,  of  the clasical Spitzer value, is a
          different  function  of  radius  for each cluster. Based on the
          observations  of  plasma  bubbles  we  also  calculate the duty
          cycles  for  each  AGN,  in  the absence of thermal conduction,
          which can provide the required energy input. With the exception
          of Hydra-A it appears that each of the other AGNs in our sample
          require  duty  cycles of roughly $10^{6}-10^{7}$ yrs to provide
          their  steady-state  heating requirements. If these duty cycles
          are  unrealistic, this may imply that many galaxy clusters must
          be  heated  by  very  powerful Hydra-A type events interspersed
          between  more frequent smaller-scale outbursts. The suppression
          factors  for  the  thermal  conductivity  required for combined
          heating by AGN and thermal conduction are generally acceptable.
          However,  these suppression factors still require `fine-tuning`
          of  the  thermal  conductivity  as  a  function of radius. As a
          consequence  of  this  work  we present the AGN duty cycle as a
          cooling flow diagnostic.

          We find the primary component of this binary, FO 15, to have an
          approximate spectral type O5.5Vz, i.e. a Zero-Age-Main-Sequence
          star.  The  secondary  appears to be of spectral type O9.5V. We
          have  performed  a  numerical  model  fit  to  the  public ASAS
          photometry, which shows that FO 15 is also an eclipsing binary.
          We find an orbital inclination of ~ 80 deg. From a simultaneous
          light-curve and radial velocity solution we find the masses and
          radii  of  the two components to be 30 +/- 1 and 16 +/- 1 solar
          masses  and  7.5  +/-  0.5  and  5.3 +/- 0.5 solar radii. These
          radii,  and hence also the luminosities, are smaller than those
          of  normal  O-type  stars,  but  similar  to recently born ZAMS
          O-type stars. The absolute magnitudes derived from our analysis
          locate  FO 15 at the same distance as Eta Carinae. From Chandra
          and  XMM  X-ray  images  we  also find that there are two close
          X-ray  sources,  one  coincident  with  FO  15  and another one
          without  optical  counterpart. This latter seems to be a highly
          variable  source, presumably due to a pre-main-sequence stellar
          neighbour of FO 15.

          Title:  The flat synchrotron spectra of partially self-absorbed
          jets revisited
          Authors: Christian R. Kaiser (University of Southampton)
          Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          Flat  radio  spectra  with large brightness temperatures at the
          core  of  AGN and X-ray binaries are usually interpreted as the
          partially self-absorbed bases of jet flows emitting synchrotron
          radiation.  Here  we extend previous models of jets propagating
          at  large  angles  to  our  line  of sight to self-consistently
          include  the  effects  of  energy  losses  of  the relativistic
          electrons  due  to  the  synchrotron  process  itself  and  the
          adiabatic  expansion of the jet flow. We also take into account
          energy  gains  through  self-absorption.  Two model classes are
          presented.  The  ballistic  jet  flows,  with  the jet material
          travelling  along  straight  trajectories,  and adiabatic jets.
          Despite  the  energy  losses, both scenarios can result in flat
          emission   spectra,  however,  the  adiabatic  jets  require  a
          specific  geometry. No re-acceleration process along the jet is
          needed  for the electrons. We apply the models to observational
          data  of  the  X-ray binary Cygnus X-1. Both models can be made
          consistent  with  the observations. The resulting ballistic jet
          is  extremely  narrow  with a jet opening angle of only 5". Its
          energy  transport  rate  is small compared to the time-averaged
          jet  power and therefore suggests the presence of non-radiating
          protons  in  the  jet flow. The adiabatic jets require a strong
          departure  from energy equipartition between the magnetic field
          and  the  relativistic electrons. These models also imply a jet
          power  two  orders  of  magnitude  higher  than  the  Eddington
          limiting  luminosity  of a 10 solar mass black hole. The models
          put  strong  constraints  on the physical conditions in the jet
          flows on scales well below achievable resolution limits.

          Title: XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the ultra-compact
          binary RX J1914+24
          Authors:  Gavin Ramsay (1), Mark Cropper (1), Pasi Hakala (2,3)
          ((1) MSSL/UCL, (2) Univ Helsinki, (3) Tuorla Observatory)
          Comments: Accepted MNRAS Letters
          The nature of the X-ray source RX J1914+24 has been the subject
          of  much  debate.  It  shows  a  prominent period of 569 sec in
          X-rays  and the optical/infra-red: in most models this has been
          interpreted  as  the  binary  orbital  period.  We  present our
          analysis  of  new XMM-Newton and Chandra data. We find a longer
          term  trend in the XMM-Newton data and power at 556 and 585 sec
          in  5  sets  of data. It is not clear if they are produced as a
          result  of a beat between a longer intrinsic period and the 569
          sec  modulation  or  if  they are due to secular variations. We
          obtain  a  good  fit  to  the  XMM-Newton  spectrum  with a low
          temperature  thermal plasma model with an edge at 0.83keV. This
          model  implies  an  unabsorbed  bolometric  X-ray luminosity of
          1x10^{33} ergs/s (for a distance of 1kpc) - this is 2 orders of
          magnitude  lower  than  our  previous estimate (derived using a
          different  model).  If  the  distance  is  much  less,  as  the
          absorption derived from the X-ray fits suggest, then it is even
          lower at \~3x10^{31} ergs/s.

          Title:  From Canonical to Enhanced Extra Mixing in Low-Mass Red
          Giants: Tidally Locked Binaries
          Authors: Pavel Denissenkov (1, 2 and 3), Brian Chaboyer (1), Ke
          Li  (1)  ((1) Dartmouth College, (2) The Ohio State University,
          (3) St. Petersburg State University)
          Comments: 47 pages, 19 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ
          Stellar  models  which  incorporate  simple  diffusion or shear
          induced  mixing  are used to describe canonical extra mixing in
          low  mass red giants of low and solar metallicity. These models
          are  able  to  simultaneously  explain  the  observed Li and CN
          abundance  changes  along upper red giant branch (RGB) in field
          low-metallicity stars and match photometry, rotation and carbon
          isotopic  ratios  for  stars  in  the old open cluster M67. The
          shear mixing model requires that main sequence (MS) progenitors
          of  upper  RGB stars possessed rapidly rotating radiative cores
          and  that  specific  angular  momentum was conserved in each of
          their  mass  shells  during  their  evolution.  We surmise that
          solar-type  stars will not experience canonical extra mixing on
          the  RGB  because their more efficient MS spin-down resulted in
          solid-body rotation, as revealed by helioseismological data for
          the  Sun.  Thus, RGB stars in the old, high metallicity cluster
          NGC  6791  should  show  no evidence for mixing in their carbon
          isotopic ratios.
          We  develop  the  idea  that  canonical extra mixing in a giant
          component  of  a  binary system may be switched to its enhanced
          mode with much faster and somewhat deeper mixing as a result of
          the   giant's   tidal   spin-up.   This  scenario  can  explain
          photometric  and  composition peculiarities of RS CVn binaries.
          The  tidally enforced enhanced extra mixing might contribute to
          the  star-to-star  abundance  variations  of  O,  Na  and Al in
          globular clusters. This idea may be tested with observations of
          carbon isotopic ratios and CN abundances in RS CVn binaries.

          Title:  Explosive  Nucleosynthesis  in  GRB Jets Accompanied by
          Hypernovae
          Authors: Shigehiro Nagataki, Akira Mizuta, Katsuhiko Sato
          Comments: 28 pages with 14 figures. Submitted to ApJ
          Two-dimensional   hydrodynamic  simulations  are  performed  to
          investigate  explosive nucleosynthesis in a collapsar using the
          model of MacFadyen and Woosley (1999). It is shown that 56Ni is
          not  produced  in  the  jet  of  the  collapsar sufficiently to
          explain the observed amount of a hypernova when the duration of
          the  explosion  is  \sim  10 sec, which is considered to be the
          typical  timescale  of  explosion  in the collapsar model. Even
          though  considerable  amount  of  56Ni  is  synthesized  if all
          explosion  energy is deposited initially, the opening angles of
          the  jets  become  too  wide  to  realize  highly  relativistic
          outflows  and  gamma-ray  bursts  in  such  a  case. From these
          results,  it is concluded that the origin of 56Ni in hypernovae
          associated  with  GRBs  is not the explosive nucleosynthesis in
          the  jet.  We  consider  that  the  idea that the origin is the
          explosive   nucleosynthesis  in  the  accretion  disk  is  more
          promising.  We  also  show  that the explosion becomes bi-polar
          naturally  due  to  the effect of the deformed progenitor. This
          fact  suggests  that the 56Ni synthesized in the accretion disk
          and  conveyed as outflows are blown along to the rotation axis,
          which  will  explain  the line features of SN 1998bw and double
          peaked  line  features  of  SN  2003jd.  Some  fraction  of the
          gamma-ray lines from 56Ni decays in the jet will appear without
          losing  their  energies  because the jet becomes optically thin
          before considerable amount of 56Ni decays as long as the jet is
          a  relativistic flow, which may be observed as relativistically
          Lorentz  boosted  line  profiles  in  the  future. We show that
          abundance  of  nuclei  whose  mass number \sim 40 in the ejecta
          depends  sensitively  on the energy deposition rate, which is a
          result  of  active  incomplete  silicon  burning and alpha-rich
          freezeout.

          Title: Speed of Sound in the Mass Varying Neutrinos Scenario
          Authors: Ryo Takahashi, Morimitsu Tanimoto
          Comments: 17 pages, no figure
          We discuss about the speed of sound squared in the Mass Varying
          Neutrinos  scenario  (MaVaNs). Recently, it was argued that the
          MaVaNs has a catastrophic instability which is the emergence of
          an  imaginary  speed  of sound at the non-relativistic limit of
          neutrinos.   As   the   result   of   this   instability,   the
          neutrino-acceleron   fluid  cannot  act  as  the  dark  energy.
          However,  it  is  found  that the speed of sound squared in the
          neutrino-acceleron  fluid  could  be  positive in our model. We
          examine  the  speed  of  sound  in  two  cases  of  the  scalar
          potential.  One is the small fractional power-law potential and
          another  is  the logarithmic one. The power-law potential model
          with the right-handed neutrinos gives a stable one.

          warped accretion discs
          Authors: Stephen B. Foulkes, Carole A. Haswell, James R. Murray
          Comments:  12 pages, 12 figures, paper accepted for publication
          by MNRAS
          We  present  three  dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics
          (SPH)  calculations  of  warped accretion discs in X-ray binary
          systems.  Geometrically  thin,  optically thick accretion discs
          are   illuminated   by   a   central   radiation  source.  This
          illumination  exerts  a  non-axisymmetric radiation pressure on
          the  surface of the disc resulting in a torque that acts on the
          disc  to  induce  a  twist  or warp. Initially planar discs are
          unstable  to  warping  driven  by  the  radiation torque and in
          general  the  warps  also  precess  in  a  retrograde direction
          relative  to  the  orbital  flow. We simulate a number of X-ray
          binary  systems which have different mass ratios using a number
          of  different  luminosities  for each. Radiation-driven warping
          occurs  for  all  systems  simulated. For mass ratios q ~ 0.1 a
          moderate  warp  occurs  in  the inner disc while the outer disc
          remains  in  the  orbital  plane  (c.f.  X  1916-053). For less
          extreme  mass  ratios  the entire disc tilts out of the orbital
          plane  (c.f.  Her  X-1).  For  discs that are tilted out of the
          orbital  plane  in which the outer edge material of the disc is
          precessing  in a prograde direction we obtain both positive and
          negative  superhumps  simultaneously  in  the dissipation light
          curve (c.f. V603 Aql).

          Title: Eclipsing binaries in extrasolar planet transit surveys:
          the case of SuperWASP
          Authors: B. Willems, U. Kolb, S. Justham
          Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Using  a  comprehensive  binary population synthesis scheme, we
          investigate the statistical properties of a sample of eclipsing
          binaries  that  is detectable by an idealised extrasolar planet
          transit  survey with specifications broadly similar to those of
          the  SuperWASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets) project. In this
          idealised survey the total number of detectable single stars in
          the  Galactic  disc  is of the order of 10^6-10^7, while, for a
          flat  initial  mass  ratio  distribution,  the  total number of
          detectable eclipsing binaries is of the order of 10^4-10^5. The
          majority  of  the population of detectable single stars is made
          up of main-sequence stars (60%), horizontal-branch stars (20%),
          and  giant-branch stars (10%). The largest contributions to the
          population  of detectable eclipsing binaries stem from detached
          double main-sequence star binaries (60%), detached giant-branch
          main-sequence     star    binaries    (20%),    and    detached
          horizontal-branch  main-sequence star binaries (10%). The ratio
          of  the  number  of  eclipsing binaries to the number of single
          stars  detectable  by  the idealised SuperWASP survey varies by
          less  than  a  factor of 2.5 across the sky, and decreases with
          increasing  Galactic latitude. It is found to be largest in the
          direction  of the Galactic longitude l=-7.5deg and the Galactic
          latitude b=-22.5deg. We also show that the fractions of systems
          in  different  subgroups of eclipsing binaries are sensitive to
          the  adopted  initial  mass ratio distribution, which is one of
          the  poorest constrained input parameters in present-day binary
          population  synthesis  calculations.  This  suggests  that once
          statistically  meaningful  results  from  transit  surveys  are
          available,  they  will  be  able  to  significantly improve the
          predictive power of population synthesis studies of interacting
          binaries and related objects. (abridged)

          Title: SZE Signals in Cluster Models
          Authors: Beth A. Reid, David N. Spergel
          Comments: 34 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ
          The  upcoming  generation  of SZE surveys will shed fresh light
          onto  the  study  of clusters. What will this new observational
          window  reveal about cluster properties? What can we learn from
          combining   X-ray,   SZE,  and  optical  observations?  How  do
          variations   in   the   gas   entropy   profile,   dark  matter
          concentration,  accretion  pressure,  and bound baryon fraction
          affect  SZE  observables? We investigate the signature of these
          important  cluster  parameters  with  an  analytic model of the
          intracluster  medium  (ICM). Given the current uncertainties in
          ICM  physics,  our  approach  is to span the range of plausible
          models   motivated   by   observations   and  a  small  set  of
          assumptions.  We  find  a  tight  relation  between the central
          Compton  parameter and the X-ray luminosity outside the cluster
          core,   suggesting   that  these  observables  carry  the  same
          information   about  the  ICM.  The  total  SZE  luminosity  is
          proportional  to  the  thermal  energy  of  the  gas,  and is a
          surprisingly  robust indicator of cluster mass: $L_{SZ} \propto
          f_{b}  M^{5/3}$. We show that a combination of $L_{SZ}$ and the
          half-luminosity  radius  $r_{SZ}$  provides  a  measure  of the
          potential energy of the cluster gas, and thus we can deduce the
          total  energy  content  of  the  bound ICM. We caution that any
          systematic  variation  of  the baryon fraction will distort the
          expected  $L_{SZ}  -  M$  calibration  to  be used to study the
          evolution of cluster number density.

          We present XMM-Newton observations of a complete sample of five
          archetypal  young  radio-loud  AGN, also known Gigahertz Peaked
          Spectrum  (GPS)  sources. They are among the brightest and best
          studied  GPS/CSO  sources  in the sky, with radio powers in the
          range  L_{5GHz}=10^{43-44}  erg/s  and  with  4  sources having
          measured  kinematic  ages  of  570 to 3000 yrs. All sources are
          detected,   and   have   2-10  keV  luminosities  from  0.5  to
          4.8x10^{44} erg/s. In comparison with the general population of
          radio galaxies, we find that: 1) GPS galaxies show a a range in
          absorption column densities similar to other radio galaxies. We
          therefore   find  no  evidence  that  GPS  galaxies  reside  in
          significantly  more  dense circumnuclear environment, such that
          they  could  be  hampered  in  their expansion. 2) The ratio of
          radio  to  X-ray  luminosity  is  significantly higher than for
          classical  radio  sources. This is consistent with an evolution
          scenario  in which young radio sources are more efficient radio
          emitters  than  large  extended objects at a constant accretion
          power.  3)  Taking  the  X-ray luminosity of radio sources as a
          measure  of  ionisation  power,  we  find that GPS galaxies are
          significantly  underluminous  in  their [OIII]_{5007 Angstrom},
          including  a  weak  trend with age. This is consistent with the
          fact  that  the  Stroemgren sphere should still be expanding in
          these   young  objects.  This  would  mean  that  here  we  are
          witnessing  the  birth  of the narrow line region of radio-loud
          AGN.

          Journal
          The  accretion  of ~ 0.1 -- 1 M_o of material by a neutron star
          through  Roche  lobe  overflow  of  its  companion  or  through
          white-dwarf/neutron-star  coalescence  in  a  low  mass  binary
          system could be enough to exceed the critical mass of a neutron
          star  and  trigger its collapse to a black hole, leading to the
          production  of  a  short gamma-ray burst (SGRB). In this model,
          SGRBs  would  often  be  found  in  early-type  galaxies  or in
          globular cluster environments, though they could also be formed
          through  stellar-wind  accretion in high-mass binary systems of
          star-forming galaxies. Although the collapse event is likely to
          be  of  short  (<< 1 s) duration, afterglow complexity could be
          produced  by  neutron decoupling in the fireball and subsequent
          accretion  of the companion remnant, for example, the disrupted
          white-dwarf core.

          Title: Radiative Flow in a Luminous Disk II
          Authors: Jun Fukue
          Comments:  6 pages, 4 figures; to be appeared in PASJ 58 (2006)
          No 1
          Radiatively-driven  transfer  flow  perpendicular to a luminous
          disk  is  examined  in the subrelativistic regime of $(v/c)^1$,
          taking into account the gravity of the central object. The flow
          is  assumed  to  be  vertical, and the gas pressure is ignored,
          while internal heating is assumed to be proportional to the gas
          density.  The  basic  equations  were  numerically  solved as a
          function  of  the  optical  depth,  and  the flow velocity, the
          height,  the  radiative  flux,  and the radiation pressure were
          obtained  for  a  given  radius,  an initial optical depth, and
          initial  conditions at the flow base (disk ``inside''), whereas
          the  mass-loss  rate  was  determined  as  an eigenvalue of the
          boundary  condition  at  the  flow  top (disk ``surface''). For
          sufficiently  luminous  cases,  the  flow  resembles  the  case
          without  gravity.  For  less-luminous  cases, however, the flow
          velocity decreases, and the flow would be impossible due to the
          existence  of  gravity  in  the case that the radiative flux is
          sufficiently  small.  Application  to a supercritical accretion
          disk with mass loss is briefly discussed.

          Title: Quantifying the Luminosity Evolution in Gamma-ray Bursts
          Authors: Daniel Kocevski, Edison Liang
          We  estimate  the  luminosity  evolution and formation rate for
          over  900 GRBs by using redshift and luminosity data calculated
          by  Band,  Norris,  $&$  Bonnell  (2004) via the lag-luminosity
          correlation.  By applying maximum likelihood techniques, we are
          able   to  infer  the  true  distribution  of  the  parent  GRB
          population's luminosity function and density distributions in a
          way  that accounts for detector selection effects. We find that
          after  accounting  for  data  truncation,  there still exists a
          significant  correlation  between  the  average  luminosity and
          redshift,  indicating  that  distant  GRBs  are on average more
          luminous  than  nearby  counterparts.  This  is consistent with
          previous  studies  showing  strong  source  evolution  and also
          recent  observations  of under luminous nearby GRBs. We find no
          evidence  for  beaming angle evolution in the current sample of
          GRBs  with  known  redshift,  suggesting  that this increase in
          luminosity can not be due to an evolution of the collimation of
          gamma-ray  emission.  The resulting luminosity function is well
          fit  with  a  single  power  law of index $L'^{-1.5}$, which is
          intermediate  between the values predicted by the power-law and
          Gaussian  structured  jet  models.  We  also  find that the GRB
          comoving  rate  density rises steeply with a broad peak between
          $1<z<2$  followed  by  a steady decline above $z> 3$. This rate
          density  qualitatively  matches  the  current  estimates of the
          cosmic star formation rate, favoring a short lived massive star
          progenitor  model, or a binary model with a short delay between
          the formation of the compact object and the eventual merger.

          Title:  Inflation  and accelerated expansion TeVeS cosmological
          solutions
          Authors: Luz Maria Diaz-Rivera, Lado Samushia, Bharat Ratra
          We find exact exponentially expanding and contracting de Sitter
          solutions  of  the  spatially  homogeneous  TeVeS  cosmological
          equations  of motion, in both the vacuum TeVeS model and in the
          presence  of  an  additional ideal fluid with equation of state
          parameter $\omega < -1$. A preliminary stability analysis shows
          that  the  expanding  vacuum  solution  is stable, while in the
          ideal  fluid  case stability depends on model parameter values.
          These   solutions  might  provide  a  basis  for  incorporating
          early-time  inflation  or  late-time  accelerated  expansion in
          TeVeS cosmology.

          Title:  Neutrino-cooled  Accretion  Disks around Spinning Black
          Holes
          Authors:   Wen-xin   Chen,   Andrei  M.  Beloborodov  (Columbia

          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures; to be published in AIP Conference
          Proceedings "Gamma Ray Bursts in the Swift Era," Nov. 29 - Dec.
          2, 2005, Washington, DC
          We  calculate the structure of accretion disk around a spinning
          black  hole for accretion rates 0.01 - 10 M_sun/s. The model is
          fully  relativistic and treats accurately the disk microphysics
          including  neutrino  emissivity,  opacity, electron degeneracy,
          and nuclear composition. We find that the accretion flow always
          regulates   itself  to  a  mildly  degenerate  state  with  the
          proton-to-nucleon   ratio   Y_e   ~   0.1   and   becomes  very
          neutron-rich.  The  disk  has  a well defined "ignition" radius
          where   neutrino  flux  raises  dramatically,  cooling  becomes
          efficient,  and  Y_e  suddenly  drops.  We also calculate other
          characteristic radii of the disk, including the neutrino-opaque
          and  neutrino-trapping  radii, and show their dependence on the
          accretion  rate.  Accretion  disks  around  fast-rotating black
          holes  produce intense neutrino fluxes which may deposit enough
          energy above the disk to generate a GRB jet.

          We  present results from the analysis of the optical spectra of
          47 radio-selected narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). These
          objects  are  a subset of the First Bright Quasar Survey (FBQS)
          and  were  initially  detected  at 20 cm (flux density limit ~1
          mJy)  in the VLA FIRST Survey. We run Spearman rank correlation
          tests  on  several sets of parameters and conclude that, except
          for their radio properties, radio-selected NLS1 galaxies do not
          exhibit significant differences from traditional NLS1 galaxies.
          Our  results  are  also  in  agreement  with  previous  studies
          suggesting that NLS1 galaxies have small black hole masses that
          are  accreting  very close to the Eddington rate. We have found
          16  new radio-loud NLS1 galaxies, which increases the number of
          known radio-loud NLS1 galaxies by a factor of ~5.

          We  present  the  first  mid-IR  long  baseline interferometric
          observations of the circumstellar matter around binary post-AGB
          stars.  Two  objects,  SX Cen and HD 52961, were observed using
          the  VLTI/MIDI  instrument  during  Science Demonstration Time.
          Both objects are known binaries for which a stable circumbinary
          disc  is  proposed  to explain the SED characteristics. This is
          corroborated  by  our  N-band  spectrum showing a crystallinity
          fraction  of  more  than  50  % for both objects, pointing to a
          stable   environment   where   dust   processing   can   occur.
          Surprisingly,  the  dust  surrounding SX Cen is not resolved in
          the interferometric observations providing an upper limit of 11
          mas  (or  18 AU at the distance of this object) on the diameter
          of  the dust emission. This confirms the very compact nature of
          its  circumstellar  environment.  The  dust  emission around HD
          52961  originates  from  a  very  small  but  resolved  region,
          estimated to be ~ 35 mas at 8 micron and ~ 55 mas at 13 micron.
          These  results  confirm  the  disc interpretation of the SED of
          both  stars.  In  HD  52961, the dust is not homogeneous in its
          chemical composition: the crystallinity is clearly concentrated
          in  the  hotter  inner  region. Whether this is a result of the
          formation  process  of the disc, or due to annealing during the
          long storage time in the disc is not clear.

          jets

          Institute for Astrophysics)
          Comments: 13 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          The  role  of  kink  instability in magnetically driven jets is
          explored  through numerical one-dimensional steady relativistic
          MHD  calculations. The instability is shown to have enough time
          to  grow  and influence the dynamics of Poynting-flux dominated
          jets.  In  the  case of AGN jets, the flow becomes kinetic flux
          dominated  at  distances  larger  than ~1000 r_g because of the
          rapid  dissipation  of  Poynting  flux.  When  applied  to  GRB
          outflows,  the model predicts more gradual Poynting dissipation
          and  moderately  magnetized  flow  at  distances of ~10^{16} cm
          where  the  deceleration  of  the ejecta due to its interaction
          with  the  external  medium is expected. The energy released by
          the  instability can power the compact ``blazar zone'' emission
          and  the  prompt  emission  of GRB outflows with high radiative
          efficiencies.

          Comments: Accepted in A&A
          We  present  results  from  Chandra  observations of the 3C/FRI
          sample   of   low  luminosity  radio-galaxies.  We  detected  a
          power-law  nuclear  component  in 12 objects out of the 18 with
          available  data.  In  4  galaxies  we  detected  nuclear  X-ray
          absorption  at  a  level  of  about N_H= (0.2-6)e22 cm-2. X-ray
          absorbed  sources  are  associated  with the presence of highly
          inclined  dusty  disks  (or  dust  filaments projected onto the
          nuclei)  seen in the HST images. This suggests the existence of
          a  flattened  X-ray  absorber,  but of much lower optical depth
          than in classical obscuring tori. We thus have an un-obstructed
          view  toward  most  FR~I  nuclei  while absorption plays only a
          marginal  role  in  the  remaining  objects.  Three  pieces  of
          evidence  support  an  interpretation  for a jet origin for the
          X-ray cores: i) the presence of strong correlations between the
          nuclear  luminosities  in  the  radio, optical and X-ray bands,
          extending  over  4  orders of magnitude and with a much smaller
          dispersion  (about  0.3  dex)  when  compared to similar trends
          found  for  other  classes of AGNs, pointing to a common origin
          for  the  emission in the three bands; ii) the close similarity
          of the broad-band spectral indices with the sub-class of BL Lac
          objects sharing the same range of extended radio-luminosity, in
          accord with the FRI/BL Lacs unified model; iii) the presence of
          a  common  luminosity evolution of spectral indices in both FRI
          and  BL  Lacs.  The  low  luminosities  of  the  X-ray  nuclei,
          regardless  of  their origin, strengthens the interpretation of
          low efficiency accretion in low luminosity radio-galaxies.

          As  part of our radial velocity survey of low Galactic latitude
          structures  that  surround  the  Galactic  disc,  we report the
          detection  of the so called Monoceros Ring in the foreground of
          the Carina dwarf galaxy at Galactic coordinates (l,b)=(260,-22)
          based  on  VLT/FLAMES observations of the dwarf galaxy. At this
          location,   20  degrees  in  longitude  greater  than  previous
          detections, the Ring has a mean radial velocity of 145+/-5 km/s
          and  a  velocity  dispersion  of  only  17+/-5  km/s.  Based on
          Keck/DEIMOS observations, we also determine that the Ring has a
          mean  radial  velocity of -75+/-4 km/s in the foreground of the
          Andromeda  galaxy  at (l,b)\sim(122,-22), along with a velocity
          dispersion  of  26+/-3 km/s. These two kinematic detections are
          both  highly  compatible  with  known  characteristics  of  the
          structure  and,  along  with previous detections provide radial
          velocity  values  of  the  Ring  over the 120<l<260 range. This
          should  add  strong  constraints  on  numerical  models  of the
          accretion  of  the  dwarf  galaxy  that  is  believed to be the
          progenitor of the Ring.

          Comments: 30 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in AJ
          We  have used a proper combination of multiband high-resolution
          {\it  HST-WFPC2}  and  wide-field  ground based observations to
          image  the  galactic  globular  cluster  NGC  6266  (M62).  The
          extensive  photometric  data  set  allows  us  to determine the
          center  of  gravity  and  to construct the most extended radial
          profile  ever  published  for  this  cluster including, for the
          first  time, detailed star counts in the very inner region. The
          star  density  profile  is  well  reproduced by a standard King
          model with an extended core ($\sim 19''$) and a modest value of
          the  concentration  parameter  ($c=1.5$),  indicating  that the
          cluster has not-yet experienced core collapse.
          The  millisecond  pulsar  population  (whose members are all in
          binary systems) and the X-ray emitting population (more than 50
          sources  within  the cluster half mass radius) suggest that NGC
          6266  is in a dynamical phase particularly active in generating
          binaries  through  dynamical encounters. UV observations of the
          central  region  have been used to probe the population of blue
          straggler  stars,  whose  origin  might  be  also  affected  by
          dynamical  interactions.  The  comparison  with  other globular
          clusters  observed  with a similar strategy shows that the blue
          straggler  content  in  NGC  6266 is relatively low, suggesting
          that the formation channel that produces binary systems hosting
          neutron stars or white dwarfs is not effective in significantly
          increasing   the   blue   straggler  population.  Moreover,  an
          anticorrelation  between  millisecond  pulsar  content and blue
          straggler specific frequency in globular cluster seems emerging
          with increasing evidence.

          waveforms  of  the  dominant l=2,3 modes. The power spectrum of
          these  modes  yields  insight on how the mass ratio in a binary
          impacts  the  degree of complexity of the emitted waveforms. In
          addition,  we  provide  approximate  estimates  of  energy  and
          angular  momentum  radiated  as  well  as  kick velocities from

          MNRAS
          We present XMM-Newton observations of a complete sample of five
          archetypal  young  radio-loud  AGN, also known Gigahertz Peaked
          Spectrum  (GPS)  sources. They are among the brightest and best
          studied  GPS/CSO  sources  in the sky, with radio powers in the
          range  L_{5GHz}=10^{43-44}  erg/s  and  with  4  sources having
          measured  kinematic  ages  of  570 to 3000 yrs. All sources are
          detected,   and   have   2-10  keV  luminosities  from  0.5  to
          4.8x10^{44} erg/s. In comparison with the general population of
          radio galaxies, we find that: 1) GPS galaxies show a a range in
          absorption column densities similar to other radio galaxies. We
          therefore   find  no  evidence  that  GPS  galaxies  reside  in
          significantly  more  dense circumnuclear environment, such that
          they  could  be  hampered  in  their expansion. 2) The ratio of
          radio  to  X-ray  luminosity  is  significantly higher than for
          classical  radio  sources. This is consistent with an evolution
          scenario  in which young radio sources are more efficient radio
          emitters  than  large  extended objects at a constant accretion
          power.  3)  Taking  the  X-ray luminosity of radio sources as a
          measure  of  ionisation  power,  we  find that GPS galaxies are
          significantly  underluminous  in  their [OIII]_{5007 Angstrom},
          including  a  weak  trend with age. This is consistent with the
          fact  that  the  Stroemgren sphere should still be expanding in
          these   young  objects.  This  would  mean  that  here  we  are
          witnessing  the  birth  of the narrow line region of radio-loud
          AGN.

          Title:  Collapse  of  Neutron  Stars  to  Black Holes in Binary
          Systems: A Model for Short Gamma Ray Bursts
          Authors:  Charles D. Dermer (1), Armen Atoyan (2) ((1) NRL, (2)

          Comments:  9  pages, submitted as a letter to the Astrophysical
          Journal
          The  accretion  of ~ 0.1 -- 1 M_o of material by a neutron star
          through  Roche  lobe  overflow  of  its  companion  or  through
          white-dwarf/neutron-star  coalescence  in  a  low  mass  binary
          system could be enough to exceed the critical mass of a neutron
          star  and  trigger its collapse to a black hole, leading to the
          production  of  a  short gamma-ray burst (SGRB). In this model,
          SGRBs  would  often  be  found  in  early-type  galaxies  or in
          globular cluster environments, though they could also be formed
          through  stellar-wind  accretion in high-mass binary systems of
          star-forming galaxies. Although the collapse event is likely to
          be  of  short  (<< 1 s) duration, afterglow complexity could be
          produced  by  neutron decoupling in the fireball and subsequent
          accretion  of the companion remnant, for example, the disrupted
          white-dwarf core.

          Title: Radiative Flow in a Luminous Disk II
          Authors: Jun Fukue
          Comments:  6 pages, 4 figures; to be appeared in PASJ 58 (2006)
          No 1
          Radiatively-driven  transfer  flow  perpendicular to a luminous
          disk  is  examined  in the subrelativistic regime of $(v/c)^1$,
          taking into account the gravity of the central object. The flow
          is  assumed  to  be  vertical, and the gas pressure is ignored,
          while internal heating is assumed to be proportional to the gas
          density.  The  basic  equations  were  numerically  solved as a
          function  of  the  optical  depth,  and  the flow velocity, the
          height,  the  radiative  flux,  and the radiation pressure were
          obtained  for  a  given  radius,  an initial optical depth, and
          initial  conditions at the flow base (disk ``inside''), whereas
          the  mass-loss  rate  was  determined  as  an eigenvalue of the
          boundary  condition  at  the  flow  top (disk ``surface''). For
          sufficiently  luminous  cases,  the  flow  resembles  the  case
          without  gravity.  For  less-luminous  cases, however, the flow
          velocity decreases, and the flow would be impossible due to the
          existence  of  gravity  in  the case that the radiative flux is
          sufficiently  small.  Application  to a supercritical accretion
          disk with mass loss is briefly discussed.

          Title: Quantifying the Luminosity Evolution in Gamma-ray Bursts
          Authors: Daniel Kocevski, Edison Liang
          We  estimate  the  luminosity  evolution and formation rate for
          over  900 GRBs by using redshift and luminosity data calculated
          by  Band,  Norris,  $&$  Bonnell  (2004) via the lag-luminosity
          correlation.  By applying maximum likelihood techniques, we are
          able   to  infer  the  true  distribution  of  the  parent  GRB
          population's luminosity function and density distributions in a
          way  that accounts for detector selection effects. We find that
          after  accounting  for  data  truncation,  there still exists a
          significant  correlation  between  the  average  luminosity and
          redshift,  indicating  that  distant  GRBs  are on average more
          luminous  than  nearby  counterparts.  This  is consistent with
          previous  studies  showing  strong  source  evolution  and also
          recent  observations  of under luminous nearby GRBs. We find no
          evidence  for  beaming angle evolution in the current sample of
          GRBs  with  known  redshift,  suggesting  that this increase in
          luminosity can not be due to an evolution of the collimation of
          gamma-ray  emission.  The resulting luminosity function is well
          fit  with  a  single  power  law of index $L'^{-1.5}$, which is
          intermediate  between the values predicted by the power-law and
          Gaussian  structured  jet  models.  We  also  find that the GRB
          comoving  rate  density rises steeply with a broad peak between
          $1<z<2$  followed  by  a steady decline above $z> 3$. This rate
          density  qualitatively  matches  the  current  estimates of the
          cosmic star formation rate, favoring a short lived massive star
          progenitor  model, or a binary model with a short delay between
          the formation of the compact object and the eventual merger.

          Title:  Inflation  and accelerated expansion TeVeS cosmological
          solutions
          Authors: Luz Maria Diaz-Rivera, Lado Samushia, Bharat Ratra
          We find exact exponentially expanding and contracting de Sitter
          solutions  of  the  spatially  homogeneous  TeVeS  cosmological
          equations  of motion, in both the vacuum TeVeS model and in the
          presence  of  an  additional ideal fluid with equation of state
          parameter $\omega < -1$. A preliminary stability analysis shows
          that  the  expanding  vacuum  solution  is stable, while in the
          ideal  fluid  case stability depends on model parameter values.
          These   solutions  might  provide  a  basis  for  incorporating
          early-time  inflation  or  late-time  accelerated  expansion in
          TeVeS cosmology.

          Holes

          Proceedings "Gamma Ray Bursts in the Swift Era," Nov. 29 - Dec.
          2, 2005, Washington, DC
          We  calculate the structure of accretion disk around a spinning
          black  hole for accretion rates 0.01 - 10 M_sun/s. The model is
          fully  relativistic and treats accurately the disk microphysics
          including  neutrino  emissivity,  opacity, electron degeneracy,
          and nuclear composition. We find that the accretion flow always
          regulates   itself  to  a  mildly  degenerate  state  with  the
          proton-to-nucleon   ratio   Y_e   ~   0.1   and   becomes  very
          neutron-rich.  The  disk  has  a well defined "ignition" radius
          where   neutrino  flux  raises  dramatically,  cooling  becomes
          efficient,  and  Y_e  suddenly  drops.  We also calculate other
          characteristic radii of the disk, including the neutrino-opaque
          and  neutrino-trapping  radii, and show their dependence on the
          accretion  rate.  Accretion  disks  around  fast-rotating black
          holes  produce intense neutrino fluxes which may deposit enough
          energy above the disk to generate a GRB jet.

          We  present results from the analysis of the optical spectra of
          47 radio-selected narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). These
          objects  are  a subset of the First Bright Quasar Survey (FBQS)
          and  were  initially  detected  at 20 cm (flux density limit ~1
          mJy)  in the VLA FIRST Survey. We run Spearman rank correlation
          tests  on  several sets of parameters and conclude that, except
          for their radio properties, radio-selected NLS1 galaxies do not
          exhibit significant differences from traditional NLS1 galaxies.
          Our  results  are  also  in  agreement  with  previous  studies
          suggesting that NLS1 galaxies have small black hole masses that
          are  accreting  very close to the Eddington rate. We have found
          16  new radio-loud NLS1 galaxies, which increases the number of
          known radio-loud NLS1 galaxies by a factor of ~5.

          We  present  the  first  mid-IR  long  baseline interferometric
          observations of the circumstellar matter around binary post-AGB
          stars.  Two  objects,  SX Cen and HD 52961, were observed using
          the  VLTI/MIDI  instrument  during  Science Demonstration Time.
          Both objects are known binaries for which a stable circumbinary
          disc  is  proposed  to explain the SED characteristics. This is
          corroborated  by  our  N-band  spectrum showing a crystallinity
          fraction  of  more  than  50  % for both objects, pointing to a
          stable   environment   where   dust   processing   can   occur.
          Surprisingly,  the  dust  surrounding SX Cen is not resolved in
          the interferometric observations providing an upper limit of 11
          mas  (or  18 AU at the distance of this object) on the diameter
          of  the dust emission. This confirms the very compact nature of
          its  circumstellar  environment.  The  dust  emission around HD
          52961  originates  from  a  very  small  but  resolved  region,
          estimated to be ~ 35 mas at 8 micron and ~ 55 mas at 13 micron.
          These  results  confirm  the  disc interpretation of the SED of
          both  stars.  In  HD  52961, the dust is not homogeneous in its
          chemical composition: the crystallinity is clearly concentrated
          in  the  hotter  inner  region. Whether this is a result of the
          formation  process  of the disc, or due to annealing during the
          long storage time in the disc is not clear.

          Institute for Astrophysics)
          Comments: 13 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          The  role  of  kink  instability in magnetically driven jets is
          explored  through numerical one-dimensional steady relativistic
          MHD  calculations. The instability is shown to have enough time
          to  grow  and influence the dynamics of Poynting-flux dominated
          jets.  In  the  case of AGN jets, the flow becomes kinetic flux
          dominated  at  distances  larger  than ~1000 r_g because of the
          rapid  dissipation  of  Poynting  flux.  When  applied  to  GRB
          outflows,  the model predicts more gradual Poynting dissipation
          and  moderately  magnetized  flow  at  distances of ~10^{16} cm
          where  the  deceleration  of  the ejecta due to its interaction
          with  the  external  medium is expected. The energy released by
          the  instability can power the compact ``blazar zone'' emission
          and  the  prompt  emission  of GRB outflows with high radiative
          efficiencies.

          Comments: Accepted in A&A
          We  present  results  from  Chandra  observations of the 3C/FRI
          sample   of   low  luminosity  radio-galaxies.  We  detected  a
          power-law  nuclear  component  in 12 objects out of the 18 with
          available  data.  In  4  galaxies  we  detected  nuclear  X-ray
          absorption  at  a  level  of  about N_H= (0.2-6)e22 cm-2. X-ray
          absorbed  sources  are  associated  with the presence of highly
          inclined  dusty  disks  (or  dust  filaments projected onto the
          nuclei)  seen in the HST images. This suggests the existence of
          a  flattened  X-ray  absorber,  but of much lower optical depth
          than in classical obscuring tori. We thus have an un-obstructed
          view  toward  most  FR~I  nuclei  while absorption plays only a
          marginal  role  in  the  remaining  objects.  Three  pieces  of
          evidence  support  an  interpretation  for a jet origin for the
          X-ray cores: i) the presence of strong correlations between the
          nuclear  luminosities  in  the  radio, optical and X-ray bands,
          extending  over  4  orders of magnitude and with a much smaller
          dispersion  (about  0.3  dex)  when  compared to similar trends
          found  for  other  classes of AGNs, pointing to a common origin
          for  the  emission in the three bands; ii) the close similarity
          of the broad-band spectral indices with the sub-class of BL Lac
          objects sharing the same range of extended radio-luminosity, in
          accord with the FRI/BL Lacs unified model; iii) the presence of
          a  common  luminosity evolution of spectral indices in both FRI
          and  BL  Lacs.  The  low  luminosities  of  the  X-ray  nuclei,
          regardless  of  their origin, strengthens the interpretation of
          low efficiency accretion in low luminosity radio-galaxies.

          As  part of our radial velocity survey of low Galactic latitude
          structures  that  surround  the  Galactic  disc,  we report the
          detection  of the so called Monoceros Ring in the foreground of
          the Carina dwarf galaxy at Galactic coordinates (l,b)=(260,-22)
          based  on  VLT/FLAMES observations of the dwarf galaxy. At this
          location,   20  degrees  in  longitude  greater  than  previous
          detections, the Ring has a mean radial velocity of 145+/-5 km/s
          and  a  velocity  dispersion  of  only  17+/-5  km/s.  Based on
          Keck/DEIMOS observations, we also determine that the Ring has a
          mean  radial  velocity of -75+/-4 km/s in the foreground of the
          Andromeda  galaxy  at (l,b)\sim(122,-22), along with a velocity
          dispersion  of  26+/-3 km/s. These two kinematic detections are
          both  highly  compatible  with  known  characteristics  of  the
          structure  and,  along  with previous detections provide radial
          velocity  values  of  the  Ring  over the 120<l<260 range. This
          should  add  strong  constraints  on  numerical  models  of the
          accretion  of  the  dwarf  galaxy  that  is  believed to be the
          progenitor of the Ring.

          Comments: 30 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in AJ
          We  have used a proper combination of multiband high-resolution
          {\it  HST-WFPC2}  and  wide-field  ground based observations to
          image  the  galactic  globular  cluster  NGC  6266  (M62).  The
          extensive  photometric  data  set  allows  us  to determine the
          center  of  gravity  and  to construct the most extended radial
          profile  ever  published  for  this  cluster including, for the
          first  time, detailed star counts in the very inner region. The
          star  density  profile  is  well  reproduced by a standard King
          model with an extended core ($\sim 19''$) and a modest value of
          the  concentration  parameter  ($c=1.5$),  indicating  that the
          cluster has not-yet experienced core collapse.
          The  millisecond  pulsar  population  (whose members are all in
          binary systems) and the X-ray emitting population (more than 50
          sources  within  the cluster half mass radius) suggest that NGC
          6266  is in a dynamical phase particularly active in generating
          binaries  through  dynamical encounters. UV observations of the
          central  region  have been used to probe the population of blue
          straggler  stars,  whose  origin  might  be  also  affected  by
          dynamical  interactions.  The  comparison  with  other globular
          clusters  observed  with a similar strategy shows that the blue
          straggler  content  in  NGC  6266 is relatively low, suggesting
          that the formation channel that produces binary systems hosting
          neutron stars or white dwarfs is not effective in significantly
          increasing   the   blue   straggler  population.  Moreover,  an
          anticorrelation  between  millisecond  pulsar  content and blue
          straggler specific frequency in globular cluster seems emerging
          with increasing evidence.

          We   present   results  from  fully  nonlinear  simulations  of
          inspiralling, unequal mass binary black holes, concentrating on
          four  cases  with mass ratios q = M_2/M_1 = (1,0.96,0.85,0.54),
          or   equivalently   with   reduced   mass   parameters   eta  =
          M_1M_2/(M_1+M_2)^2  =  (0.25,  0.249,  0.248,  0.227).  We show
          waveforms  of  the  dominant l=2,3 modes. The power spectrum of
          these  modes  yields  insight on how the mass ratio in a binary
          impacts  the  degree of complexity of the emitted waveforms. In
          addition,  we  provide  approximate  estimates  of  energy  and
          angular  momentum  radiated  as  well  as  kick velocities from
          gravitational radiation recoil.

          We  present  HST/ACS  griz  and  VLT K observations towards the
          radio galaxy TN J1338-1942 and 12 Lya emitters (LAEs) at z=4.1.
          The LAEs are young (a few 10^7 yr), dust-free galaxies based on
          small  sizes,  steep  UV slopes and blue UV-optical colors with
          SFRs  of  <14  M/yr.  When stacking the K-band fluxes, the LAEs
          seem  to  be less massive (masses of a few 10^8 Msun) than LBGs
          while  having  comparable  UV  SFRs.  The  LAE  AGN fraction is
          minimal. We selected 66 z~4.1 g-dropouts with z<27. Their SFRs,
          sizes, morphological parameters, and UV/optical color-magnitude
          relations  are  all  similar  to  those  found  for LBGs in the
          `field'.  We quantify the number density and cosmic variance of
          g-dropouts  using  the GOODS survey, and show that our field is
          significantly  richer  than  random  fields.  About half of the
          objects are clustered in a filamentary region that includes the
          radio galaxy and the brightest LBGs. The generally fainter LAEs
          appear  to  favour  regions that are devoid of LBGs, while LBGs
          detected  in  K tend to lie in the richest region, suggesting a
          forming  age-  or mass-density relation. We compare the angular
          correlation  function to that of mock samples with built-in z~4
          LBG  clustering.  We  find  an  excess signal at separations of
          <10",  corresponding  to  the  typical size of DM halos hosting
          bright  LBGs.  This  may be the first time that the non-linear,
          one-halo  clustering recently shown to be statistically present
          in  field  samples,  has  been measured within a single massive
          structure  at such high redshift. The large galaxy overdensity,
          its  corresponding  mass  overdensity and the sub-clustering at
          the approximate redshift of TN J1338-1942 suggest the formation
          of a >10^14 Msun structure, possibly a `protocluster'.

          Title:  Dense  Stellar  Systems as Laboratories for Fundamental
          Physics
          Authors: Piet Hut (Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton)
          Comments:   review  paper,  presented  at  A  Life  With  Stars
          (Conference  in Honor of Ed van den Heuvel), Amsterdam, August,
          2005
          Galactic  nuclei  and  globular clusters act as laboratories in
          which  nature  experiments with normal stars, neutron stars and
          black  holes,  through  collisions and through the formation of
          bound states, in the form of binaries. The main difference with
          the  usual  Earth-based  laboratories is that we cannot control
          the  experiments.  Instead,  we  have  no  choice but to create
          virtual  laboratories  on  Earth,  in order to simulate all the
          relevant physics in large-scale computational experiments. This
          implies  a  realistic  treatment  of  stellar dynamics, stellar
          evolution, and stellar hydrodynamics.
          Each of these three fields has its own legacy codes, workhorses
          that  are  routinely used to simulate star clusters, stars, and
          stellar collisions, respectively. I outline the main steps that
          need  to  be taken in order to embed and where needed transform
          these  legacy  codes in order to produce a far more modular and
          robust environment for modeling dense stellar systems.
          The  time  is right to do so: within a few years computers will
          reach  the  required speed, in the Petaflops range, to follow a
          star  cluster with a million stars for ten billion years, while
          resolving  the  internal  binary  and multiple star motions. By
          that  time  simulation  software will be the main bottleneck in
          our  ability  to  analyze  dense  stellar systems. Only through
          full-scale  simulations  will we be able to critically test our
          understanding  of  the `microphysics' of stellar collisions and
          their aftermath, in a direct comparison with observations.

          Title: XMM-Newton X-ray spectroscopy of classical T Tauri stars
          Authors:  J.  Robrade,  J.H.M.M. Schmitt (Hamburger Sternwarte,
          Universitaet Hamburg)
          Comments: 11 pages, 12 figures, accepted by A&A
          We  present  results  from  a  comparative  study of XMM-Newton
          observations  of four classical T Tauri stars (CTTS), namely BP
          Tau,  CR Cha, SU Aur and TW Hya. In these objects coronal, i.e.
          magnetic, activity and as recently shown, magnetically funneled
          accretion  are  the  processes likely to be responsible for the
          generation  of  X-ray  emission.  Variable  X-ray emission with
          luminosities  in  the  order of $10^{30}$ erg/s is observed for
          all  targets. We investigate light curves as well as medium and
          high-resolution   X-ray   spectra   to   determine  the  plasma
          properties  of the sample CTTS and to study the origin of their
          X-ray  emission  and  its  variability.  The  emission  measure
          distributions  and  observed  temperatures differ significantly
          and  the  targets  are  dominated  either  by  plasma  at  high
          densities  as  produced by accretion shocks or by predominantly
          hotter  plasma  of  coronal origin. Likewise the variability of
          the   X-ray  luminosity  is  found  to  be  generated  by  both
          mechanisms. Cool plasma at high densities is found in all stars
          with detected \ion{O}{vii} triplet emission, prevented only for
          SU~Aur  due to strong absorption. A general trend is present in
          the  abundance  pattern,  with  neon  being  at  solar value or
          enhanced while oxygen, iron and most other metals are depleted,
          pointing  to  the  presence of the inverse FIP effect in active
          coronae  and possibly grain formation in evolved disks. We find
          that  both  accretion shocks and coronal activity contribute to
          the  observed  X-ray  emission  of  the  targets. While coronal
          activity  is  the  dominant  source  of  X-ray  activity in the
          majority  of  the  CTTS,  the fraction for each process differs
          significantly between the individual objects.

          This  work  presents the main ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared
          (FIR)  properties  of  two  samples of nearby galaxies selected
          from  the  GALEX  ($\lambda = 2315$\AA, hereafter NUV) and IRAS
          ($\lambda  =  60\mu$m)  surveys respectively. They are built in
          order  to  get  detection  at  both wavelengths for most of the
          galaxies.  Star formation rate (SFR) estimators based on the UV
          and  FIR  emissions  are  compared.  Systematic differences are
          found  between the SFR estimators for individual galaxies based
          on  the  NUV  fluxes  corrected for dust attenuation and on the
          total  IR  luminosity. A combined estimator based on NUV and IR
          luminosities seems to be the best proxy over the whole range of
          values  of  SFR.  Although both samples present similar average
          values     of     the     birthrate    parameter    b,    their
          star-formation-related  properties are substantially different:
          NUV-selected  galaxies  tend  to  show larger values of $b$ for
          lower  masses,  SFRs and dust attenuations, supporting previous
          scenarios  for  the  star  formation history (SFH). Conversely,
          about 20% of the FIR-selected galaxies show high values of $b$,
          SFR  and  NUV  attenuation.  These galaxies, most of them being
          LIRGs  and  ULIRGs,  break  down the downsizing picture for the
          SFH,  however  their  relative  contribution per unit volume is
          small in the local Universe. Finally, the cosmic SFR density of
          the  local  Universe  is estimated in a consistent way from the
          NUV and IR luminosities.

          Title:  XMM-Newton  observations  of PSr B1259-63 near the 2004
          periastron passage
          Authors: M.Chernyakova, A. Neronov, A. Lutovinov, J. Rodriguez,

          Comments: 9 pages, accepted to MNRAS
          PSR  B1259-63 is in a highly eccentric 3.4 year orbit with a Be
          star  and  crosses the Be star disc twice per orbit, just prior
          to  and  just  after  periastron.  Unpulsed  radio,  X-ray  and
          gamma-ray  emission  observed from the binary system is thought
          to  be  due to the collision of pulsar wind with the wind of Be
          star.   We   present   here   the  results  of  new  XMM-Newton
          observations of the PSR B1259-63 system during the beginning of
          2004  as  the  pulsar approached the disc of Be star.We combine
          these results with earlier unpublished X-ray data from BeppoSAX
          and  XMM-Newton  as  well as with ASCA data. The detailed X-ray
          lightcurve  of  the  system shows that the pulsar passes (twice
          per  orbit)  through  a well-defined gaussian-profile disk with
          the  half-opening  angle  (projected on the pulsar orbit plane)
          ~18.5  deg.  The intersection of the disk middle plane with the
          pulsar  orbital  plane is inclined at ~70 deg to the major axis
          of  the pulsar orbit. Comparing the X-ray lightcurve to the TeV
          lightcurve  of  the system we find that the increase of the TeV
          flux   some  10--100  days  after  the  periastron  passage  is
          unambiguously  related  to  the  disk passage. At the moment of
          entrance to the disk the X-ray photon index hardens from 1.8 up
          to  1.2  before  returning  to  the  steeper  value  1.5.  Such
          behaviour is not easily accounted for by the model in which the
          X-ray  emission is synchrotron emission from the shocked pulsar
          wind.  We  argue  that  the  observed  hardening  of  the X-ray
          spectrum  is  due  to  the  inverse  Compton  or bremsstrahlung
          emission  from  10-100  MeV electrons responsible for the radio
          synchrotron emission.

          We  present  Chandra  and XMM observations of 12 bright (f(2-10
          keV)
          >  10^-13 cgs) sources from the ASCA SHEEP (Search for the High
          Energy
          Extragalactic  Population)  survey.  Most  of  these  have been
          either  not  observed or not detected previously with the ROSAT
          mission  and  therefore they constitute a sample biased towards
          hard   sources.  The  Chandra  observations  are  important  in
          locating  with  accuracy  the  optical counterpart of the X-ray
          sources.  Optical  spectroscopic  observations  show  that  our
          sample  is associated with both narrow-line (NL) (six objects),
          and
          Broad-Line  (BL)  AGN  (five objects) with one source remaining
          unidentified.
          Our  sources  cover  the  redshift  range 0.04 to 1.29 spanning
          luminosities from 10^42 to 10^45 cgs (2-10 keV). The NL sources
          have  preferentially  lower  redshift (and luminosity) compared
          with  the BL ones. This can be most easily explained in a model
          where  the  NL  AGN are intrinsically less luminous than the BL
          ones in line with the results of Steffen et al.
          The  X-ray  spectral  fittings  show  a roughly equal number of
          obscured   (N_H>10^22   cgs)  and  unobscured  (N_H<10^22  cgs)
          sources.
          There is a clear tendency for obscured sources to be associated
          with
          NL AGN and unobscured sources with BL ones. However, there is a
          marked  exception with the highest obscuring column observed at
          a BL AGN at a redshift of z=0.5.

          topology
          Authors: M.C. Bento, O. Bertolami, M.J. Rebouas, P.T. Silva
          Comments: Revtex 4, 8 pages, 10 figures, 1 table
          Physicists  describe  the  Universe  as  a  manifold,  which is
          characterized  by  its  geometry  and  its  topology. Thus, two
          fundamental  questions  regarding  the  nature  of the Universe
          concern  the geometry and topology of the 3--dimensional space.
          Geometry   is  a  local  feature  related  with  the  intrinsic
          curvature  of  the  3--space, which be tested by studies of the
          cosmic  microwave  background  radiation  (CMBR)  such  as  the
          Wilkinson  Microwave  Anisotropy  Probe  (WMAP).  Topology is a
          global property that characterizes its shape and size. Geometry
          constrains  but  does  not  fix  the  topology  of  the spatial
          sections.  In  a  locally  spatially  homogeneous and isotropic
          universe  the  topology  of  its  spatial  section dictates its
          geometry.  In  this  work we show that, besides determining the
          spatial  geometry, the knowledge of the spatial topology places
          a   constraint  on  the  $A_s$  parameter  of  the  generalized
          Chaplygin  gas  (GCG)  model for unification of dark energy and
          dark  matter.  By  using both the Poincar\'e dodecahedral space
          and   binary   octahedral   space  as  the  observable  spatial
          topologies, we reanalyze the current type Ia supenovae (SNe Ia)
          constraints  on  the GCG parameters. We show that the knowledge
          of  spatial topologies does provide some additional constraints
          on  the  GCG  $A_s$  parameter even though it does not lift the
          degeneracy of the $\alpha$ parameter.

          We  report  on  IRAC-4.5mic,  IRAC-8.0mic  and  MIPS-24mic deep
          observations   of  16  Gamma-Ray  Burst  (GRBs)  host  galaxies
          performed  with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and we investigate
          in  the  thermal  infrared  the  presence  of  evolved  stellar
          populations    and    dust-enshrouded   star-forming   activity
          associated  with these objects. Our sample is derived from GRBs
          that  were identified with sub-arcsec localization between 1997
          and 2001, and only a very small fraction (~20%) of the targeted
          sources  is  detected  down to f_4.5mic ~3.5microJy and f_24mic
          ~85microJy  (3sigma).  This  likely argues against a population
          dominated  by  massive  and  strongly-starbursting (i.e., SFR >
          ~100  Msol/yr)  galaxies as it has been recently suggested from
          submillimeter/radio  and  optical studies of similarly-selected
          GRB  hosts.  Furthermore we find evidence that some GRBs do not
          occur  in  the most infrared-luminous regions -- hence the most
          actively  star-forming  environments -- of their host galaxies.
          Should  the  GRB  hosts  be  representative of all star-forming
          galaxies  at high redshift, models of infrared galaxy evolution
          indicate  that  >  ~50%  of  GRB  hosts  should  have f_24mic >
          ~100microJy.  Unless  the  identification of GRBs prior to 2001
          was  prone  to  strong  selection  effects  biasing  our sample
          against  dusty galaxies, we infer in this context that the GRBs
          identified with the current techniques can not be directly used
          as  unbiased probes of the global and integrated star formation
          history of the Universe.

          We report on the first mid-infrared observations of 16 GRB host

          investigate  the  presence  of  evolved stellar populations and
          dust-enshrouded  star-forming  activity  associated  with GRBs.
          Only  a  very  small  fraction  of  our  sample  is detected by
          Spitzer,  which  is not consistent with recent works suggesting
          the  presence of a GRB host population dominated by massive and
          strongly-starbursting galaxies (SFR > ~100 Msol/yr). Should the
          GRB  hosts  be  representative of star-forming galaxies at high
          redshift, models of galaxy evolution indicate that >~50% of GRB
          hosts would be easily detected at the depth of our mid-infrared
          observations.   Unless   our   sample  suffers  from  a  strong
          observational  bias which remains to be understood, we infer in
          this   context  that  the  GRBs  identified  with  the  current

          years  that a large fraction of these objects were carbon-rich,
          analogous  to  the  more  metal-rich  CH-stars.  The  abundance
          peculiarities   of   CH-stars   are   commonly   explained   by
          mass-transfer  from  a  more evolved companion. In an effort to
          better  understand  the  origin  and  importance  for  Galactic
          evolution  of  Fe-poor,  C-rich  stars,  we  present abundances
          determined   from   high-resolution  and  high  signal-to-noise
          spectra  obtained  with  the  UVES  instrument  attached to the
          ESO/VLT.  Our analysis of carbon-enhanced objects includes both
          CH  stars  and more metal-poor objects, and we explore the link
          between the two classes. We also present preliminary results of
          our ongoing radial velocity monitoring.

          Title:   Stacking  weak  lensing  signals  of  SZ  clusters  to
          constrain cluster physics
          Authors:  Carolyn  Sealfon  (UPenn),  Licia Verde (UPenn), Raul
          Jimenez (UPenn)
          Comments: Submitted to ApJ
          We show how to place constraints on cluster physics by stacking
          the  weak  lensing signals from multiple clusters found through
          the  Sunyaev-Zeldovich  (SZ)  effect.  For a survey that covers
          about  200  sq.  deg. both in SZ and weak lensing observations,
          the  slope and amplitude of the mass vs. SZ luminosity relation
          can  be  measured with few percent error for clusters at z~0.5.
          This  can  be  used  to  constrain cluster physics, such as the
          nature   of   feedback.  For  example,  we  can  distinguish  a
          pre-heated  model  from a model with a decreased accretion rate
          at  more than 5sigma. The power to discriminate among different
          non-gravitational processes in the ICM becomes even stronger if
          we use the central Compton parameter y_0, which could allow one
          to distinguish between models with pre-heating, SN feedback and
          AGN  feedback, for example, at more than 5sigma. Measurement of
          these  scaling  relations  as  a  function of redshift makes it
          possible to directly observe e.g., the evolution of the hot gas
          in  clusters.  With this approach the mass-L_SZ relation can be
          calibrated  and its uncertainties can be quantified, leading to
          a  more  robust  determination  of cosmological parameters from
          clusters surveys. The mass-L_SZ relation calibrated in this way
          from a small area of the sky can be used to determine masses of
          SZ  clusters  from  very  large  SZ-only  surveys and is nicely
          complementary to other techniques proposed in the literature.

          Title: Quasars and their host galaxies
          Authors: Mark Lacy (Spitzer Science Center)
          Comments: Review article, to appear in Astrophysics Update 2
          This  review attempts to describe developments in the fields of
          quasar  and quasar host galaxies in the past five. In this time
          period,  the  Sloan  and  2dF quasar surveys have added several
          tens of thousands of quasars, with Sloan quasars being found to
          z>6.  Obscured,  or partially obscured quasars have begun to be
          found  in  significant  numbers.  Black hole mass estimates for
          quasars,   and   our   confidence   in   them,   have  improved
          significantly,  allowing  a start on relating quasar properties
          such as radio jet power to fundamental parameters of the quasar
          such  as black hole mass and accretion rate. Quasar host galaxy
          studies  have  allowed  us  to  find  and characterize the host
          galaxies  of  quasars  to z>2. Despite these developments, many
          questions  remain  unresolved,  in particular the origin of the
          close  relationship  between  black  hole mass and galaxy bulge
          mass/velocity dispersion seen in local galaxies.

          Methanol  masers  which  are  traditionally  divided  into  two
          classes  provide  possibility  to  study important parts of the
          star  forming  regions: Class~II masers trace vicinities of the
          massive  YSOs  while  class~I  masers  are likely to trace more
          distant parts of the outflows where newer stars can form. There
          are  many  methanol  transitions which produce observed masers.
          This  allows  to  use  pumping  analysis  for estimation of the
          physical  parameters  in  the  maser  formation regions and its
          environment,  for  the  study  of  their  evolution.  Extensive
          surveys  in  different  masing transitions allow to conclude on
          the  values  of  the  temperatures, densities, dust properties,
          etc.  in  the  bulk  of  masing  regions.  Variability  of  the
          brightest  masers  is  monitored  during several years. In some
          cases  it  is  probably  caused  by  the  changes  of  the dust
          temperature  which  follow  variations in the brightness of the
          central  YSO reflecting the character of the accretion process.
          A  unified catalogue of the class II methanol masers consisting
          of  more  than  500  objects  is compiled. Analysis of the data
          shows  that:  physical conditions within the usual maser source
          vary considerably; maser brightness is determined by parameters
          of  some  distinguished  part  of  the object - maser formation
          region;  class  II  methanol  masers  are formed not within the
          outflows  but  in the regions affected by their propagation. It
          is  shown that the "near" solutions for the kinematic distances
          to  the  sources  can  be  used  for  statistical analysis. The
          luminosity   function   of  the  6.7  GHz  methanol  masers  is
          constructed. It is shown that improvement of the sensitivity of
          surveys   can   increase   number  of  detected  maser  sources
          considerably.

          Title: The distribution of ejected brown dwarfs in clusters

          We examine the spatial distribution of brown dwarfs produced by
          the  decay  of  small-N  stellar  systems  as expected from the
          embryo ejection scenario. We model a cluster of several hundred
          stars  grouped  into 'cores' of a few stars/brown dwarfs. These
          cores decay, preferentially ejecting their lowest-mass members.
          Brown  dwarfs  are  found  to have a wider spatial distribution
          than  stars,  however  once the effects of limited survey areas
          and  unresolved  binaries  are  taken  into  account  it can be
          difficult  to  distinguish  between  clusters  with  many or no
          ejections.   A   large  difference  between  the  distributions
          probably   indicates  that  ejections  have  occurred,  however
          similar distributions sometimes arise even with ejections. Thus
          the  spatial  distribution of brown dwarfs is not necessarily a
          good discriminator between ejection and non-ejection scenarios.

          Title: [O III] emission line in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies
          Authors: Bian Weihao, Yuan Qirong, Zhao Yongheng
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figurs, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Three sets of two-component profiles are used to simultaneously
          model  the [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 and H$\beta$ lines
          for  the  Fe II-subtracted spectra of 149 narrow line Seyfert 1
          galaxies  (NLSls)  from  the  Sloan  Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
          Using   the  linewidth  of  the  narrow/core  component  of  [O
          III]$\lambda$5007  to  trace  the  stellar  velocity dispersion
          instead  of  using the total linewidth of [O III]$\lambda$5007,
          we  found  that  the  SDSS  NLSls  are  still deviated from the
          $M_{bh}-\sigma$ relation found in the nearby inactive galaxies,
          suggesting  that  the  linewidth  of  the  [O  III] narrow/core
          component  is  likely  not  a  good  tracer  of  bulge velocity
          dispersion  in  NLSls,  since  some other studies indicate that
          NLS1s,  like  other  AGN,  should  follow  the  $M_{bh}-\sigma$
          relation.  If  we assume that the [O III]5007/H$\beta_{n}$ line
          ratio  emitted in narrow line region ranges from one to ten, 63
          objects  are  found  to satisfied with this criterion and their
          H$\beta$  broad  components  should  be used to calculate their
          virial  black  hole  masses.  These  63  objects are statically
          consistent  with  the  $M_{bh}-\sigma_{[O III]}$ relation. With
          the  Chandra  observation of some SDSS NLSls, for one object in
          these  63  objects, J143030.22-001115.1, we found that it can't
          be  classified  as  a  genuine  NLS1.  Its  narrow component of
          H$\beta$  is  coming  from  narrow line regions (NLRs). This is
          consistent  with  its  very  flat  hard X-ray spectrum found by
          williams et al. (2004).

          Comments:  35  pages,  14  figures,  submitted to the ApJ. Most
          figures converted to low resolution
          We  report  the  definite spectroscopic identification of 41 OB
          supergiants,  giants  and  main  sequence  stars in the central
          parsec  of the Galaxy. Detection of their absorption lines have
          become  possible  with the high spatial and spectral resolution
          and   sensitivity   of   the  adaptive  optics  integral  field
          spectrometer SPIFFI/SINFONI on the ESO VLT. Several of these OB
          stars  appear to be helium and nitrogen rich. Almost all of the
          ~80  massive  stars  now  known  in the central parsec (central
          arcsecond  excluded)  reside  in  one  of  two  somewhat  thick
          (<|h|/R>~0.14)  rotating disks. These stellar disks have fairly
          sharp  inner  edges  (R~1")  and  surface density profiles that
          scale  as  R^{-2}.  We  do  not detect any OB stars outside the
          central  0.5  pc.  The  majority  of the stars in the clockwise
          system  appear to be on almost circular orbits, whereas most of
          those in the `counter-clockwise' disk appear to be on eccentric
          orbits.  Based  on its stellar surface density distribution and
          dynamics  we propose that IRS 13E is an extremely dense cluster
          (core  density  > 3x10^8 sunmass/pc^3), which has formed in the
          counter-clockwise  disk.  The  stellar contents of both systems
          are  remarkably similar, indicating a common age of ~6+/-2 Myr.
          The  K-band luminosity function of the massive stars suggests a
          top-heavy  mass  function  and  limits  the  total stellar mass
          contained in both disks to ~1.5x10^4 sunmass. Our data strongly
          favor in situ star formation from dense gas accretion disks for
          the  two  stellar  disks. This conclusion is very clear for the
          clockwise  disk  and highly plausible for the counter-clockwise
          system.

          Title:  The  late  time  evolution  of Gamma-Ray Bursts: ending
          hyperaccretion and producing flares
          Authors: Daniel Proga (UNLV), Bing Zhang (UNLV)
          Comments: submitted to ApJ Letters on Dec. 15, 2005
          We  consider  the  properties  of  a  hyperaccretion  model for
          gamma-ray  bursts  (GRBs) at the late time when the mass supply
          rate  is  expected to decrease with time. We point out that the
          region  in the vicinity of the accretor and the accretor itself
          can  play  an  important  role in determining the rate and time
          behavior  of  the  accretion  and ultimately the energy output.
          Motivated  by numerical simulations and theoretical results, we
          conjecture  that  the  energy release can be repeatedly stopped
          and  then restarted by the magnetic flux accumulated around the
          accretor.  We  propose  that  the  episode or episodes when the
          accretion   resumes   correspond  to  X-ray  flares  discovered
          recently in a number of GRBs.

          particle  species  with different densities. The surface energy
          is  obtained  by  the integration of the free energy density in
          the  interface  between  the two phases. We show that the mixed
          phase  remains  as  the  favored  ground state over the gapless
          phase, even upon the consideration of the surface energy.

          Comments: To appear in ApJ [16 pages, 13 figures]
          The  unusual  flux  variations  of the pre-main-sequence binary
          star   KH  15D  have  been  attributed  to  occultations  by  a
          circumbinary  disk.  We  test  whether  or  not  this theory is
          compatible  with  newly available data, including recent radial
          velocity measurements, CCD photometry over the past decade, and
          photographic  photometry  over  the  past 50 years. We find the
          model to be successful, after two refinements: a more realistic
          motion  of  the  occulting feature, and a halo around each star
          that  probably represents scattering by the disk. The occulting
          feature  is  exceptionally sharp-edged, raising the possibility
          that  the  dust  in the disk has settled into a thin layer, and
          providing  a  tool  for  fine-scale  mapping  of  the immediate
          environment   of  a  T  Tauri  star.  However,  the  window  of
          opportunity  is  closing,  as the currently visible star may be
          hidden at all orbital phases by as early as 2008.

          Supermassive  black  holes  inhabit  galactic nuclei, and their
          presence  influences  in  crucial  ways  the  evolution  of the
          stellar  distribution. The low-density cores observed in bright
          galaxies  are  probably  a  result  of black hole infall, while
          steep  density  cusps  like  those at the Galactic center are a
          result   of   energy  exchange  between  stars  moving  in  the
          gravitational   field  of  the  single  black  hole.  Loss-cone
          dynamics are substantially more complex in galactic nuclei than
          in  globular clusters due to the longer relaxation times, which
          permit  a  wider variety of geometries and orbital populations.
          The  rate  of  star-black  hole  interactions  has  begun to be
          constrained through observations of energetic events associated
          with stellar tidal disruptions.

          The  optical  counterpart  of  the transient, millisecond X-ray
          pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 was observed in four colours (BVRI) for
          five  weeks  during  the  2005  June-July outburst. The optical
          fluxes  declined  by ~2 magnitudes during the first 16 days and
          then   commenced   quasi-periodic   secondary  outbursts,  with
          time-scales  of several days, similar to those seen in 2000 and
          2002.  The  broadband  spectra  derived from these measurements
          were  generally  consistent  with emission from an X-ray heated
          accretion  disc.  During the first 16 days decline in intensity
          the  spectrum  became  redder.  We  suggest  that  the  primary
          outburst was initiated by a viscosity change driven instability
          in  the inner disc and note the contrast with another accreting
          millisecond  pulsar,  XTE  J0929-314,  for  which  the spectrum
          becomes   bluer  during  outburst.  Several  significant  short
          duration  changes  in  V-I were detected. One occurred at about
          HJD  2453546 in the early phase of the first secondary outburst
          and  may be due to a mass transfer instability. On the night of
          2005  June 5 (HJD 2453527) the I band flux was ~0.45 magnitudes
          brighter  than on the preceding or following nights whereas the
          BVR  bands  showed no obvious enhancement. A Type I X-ray burst
          was  detected  by  the  RXTE  spacecraft  during  this  I  band
          integration.  It seems unlikely that reprocessed radiation from
          the  burst  was sufficient to explain the observed increase. We
          suggest  that  a  major  part  of  the I band excess was due to
          synchrotron emission triggered by the X-ray burst.

          Title:  Influences of magnetic coupling process on the spectrum
          of a disk covered by the corona
          Authors: R.Y. Ma, D.X. Wang, X.Q. Zuo
          Comments: 15 pages, 5 figures, accepted by A&A
          Recently, much attention has been paid to the magnetic coupling
          (MC)  process,  which  is  supported  by  very  high emissivity
          indexes  observed  in Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG-6-30-15 and GBHC XTE
          J1650-500.  But  the rotational energy transferred from a black
          hole is simply assumed to be radiated away from the surrounding
          accretion  disk  in black-body spectrum, which is obviously not
          consistent  with  the observed hard power-law X-ray spectra. We
          intend  to  introduce  corona into the MC model to make it more
          compatible with the observations. We describe the model and the
          procedure  of  a simplified Monte Carlo simulation, compare the
          output  spectra  in  the cases with and without the MC effects,
          and  discuss the influences of three parameters involved in the
          MC  process  on  the  output  spectra.  It is shown that the MC
          process  augments radiation fluxes in the UV or X-ray band. The
          emergent spectrum is affected by the BH spin and magnetic field
          strength  at  the  BH horizon, while it is almost unaffected by
          the   radial  profile  of  the  magnetic  field  at  the  disk.
          Introducing  corona  into the MC model will improve the fitting
          of the output spectra from AGNs and GBHCs.

          Title:  General  Relativistic,  Neutrino-Assisted  MHD  winds -
          Theory and Application to GRBs. I. Schwarzschild Geometry
          Authors: Amir Levinson
          Comments: 25 pages, 7 figures, ApJ submitted
          (short  version)  -  A  model  for  GRMHD  disk  outflows  with
          neutrino-driven  mass  ejection  is  developed,and  employed to
          calculate   the  structure  of  the  outflow  in  the  sub-slow
          magnetosonic  region and the mass loading of the outflow, under
          conditions  anticipated  in  the  central  engines of gamma-ray
          bursts.  The  dependence  of the mass flux on the conditions in
          the  disk,  on magnetic field geometry, and on other factors is
          carefully   examined  for  a  range  of  neutrino  luminosities
          expected   in  hyperaccreting  black  holes.  The  fraction  of
          neutrino  luminosity  that is being converted to kinetic energy
          flux  is  shown  to  be  a  sensitive function of the effective
          neutrino temperature at the flow injection point, and the shape
          of  magnetic  field  lines  in  the  sub-slow  region,  but  is
          practically   independent  of  the  strength  of  poloidal  and
          toroidal  magnetic  fields. We conclude that magnetic launching
          of  ultra-relativistic  polar outflows from the innermost parts
          of  the  disk  is  in  principle possible provided the neutrino
          luminosity   is   sufficiently  low,  $L_\nu\simlt10^{52}$  erg
          s$^{-1}$  or  so.  The  conditions  found to be optimal for the
          launching  of an ultra-relativistic jet are also the conditions
          favorable for large neutron-to-proton ratio in the disk.

          Title:  A 2 mm spectral line survey of the starburst galaxy NGC
          253
          Authors:  S.Martn, R.Mauersberger, J.Martn-Pintado, C.Henkel,
          S.Garca-Burillo
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJS
          We  present the first unbiased molecular line survey towards an
          extragalactic   source,   namely  the  nuclear  region  of  the
          starburst  galaxy  NGC  253. The scan covers the frequency band
          from  129.1  to  175.2  GHz,  i.e.  most of the 2mm atmospheric
          window.  We  identify 111 spectral features as transitions from
          25   different   molecular   species.  Eight  of  which  (three
          tentatively)   are   detected   for   the  first  time  in  the
          extragalactic  interstellar  medium. Among these newly detected
          species,  we  detected  the  rare  isotopomers 34SO and HC18O+.
          Tentative  detections  of two deuterated species, DNC and N2D+,
          are  reported  for  the  first  time  from  a target beyond the
          Magellanic  Clouds.  Additionally, three hydrogen recombination
          lines  are  identified,  while no organic molecules larger than
          methanol   are   detected.   Column   densities   and  rotation
          temperatures  are  calculated for all the species, including an
          upper  limit  to  the  ethanol  abundance.  A comparison of the
          chemical composition of the nuclear environment of NGC 253 with
          those  of  selected  nearby  galaxies demonstrates the chemical
          resemblance  of  IC 342 and NGC 4945 to that of NGC 253. On the
          other hand, the chemistries characterizing NGC 253 and M 82 are
          clearly different. We also present a comparison of the chemical
          composition   of  NGC  253  with  those  observed  in  Galactic
          prototypical sources. The chemistry of NGC 253 shows a striking
          similarity  with  the  chemistry  observed  toward the Galactic
          center  molecular  clouds, which are thought to be dominated by
          low-velocity  shocks.  This  resemblance strongly suggests that
          the  heating in the nuclear environment of NGC 253 is dominated
          by  the  same  mechanism  as  that in the central region of the
          Milky Way.

          Title:  Modeling  the  QSO luminosity and spatial clustering at
          low redshifts
          Authors:  F.  Marulli, D. Crociani, M. Volonteri, E. Branchini,
          L. Moscardini
          Comments: 13 pages, 9 figures. Accepted by MNRAS
          We  investigate  the  ability  of  hierarchical  models  of QSO
          formation  and  evolution  to  match  the  observed luminosity,
          number  counts  and  spatial  clustering of quasars at redshift
          z<2.  These models assume that the QSO emission is triggered by
          galaxy  mergers,  that  the  mass  of  the  central  black hole
          correlates with halo properties and that quasars shine at their
          Eddington  luminosity  except,  perhaps,  during the very early
          stages  of  evolution.  We  find  that  models  based on simple
          analytic  approximations  successfully  reproduce  the observed
          B-band  QSO luminosity function at all redshifts, provided that
          some  mechanisms  is  advocated to quench mass accretion within
          haloes  larger  than  about 1e13 Msun that host bright quasars.
          These models also match the observed strength of QSO clustering
          at  z~0.8.  At larger redshifts, however, they underpredict the
          QSO   biasing   which,  instead,  is  correctly  reproduced  by
          semi-analytic  models  in  which  the  halo  merger history and
          associated  BHs are followed by Monte Carlo realizations of the
          merger  hierarchy.  We  show  that the disagreement between the
          luminosity  function  predicted  by  semi-analytic  models  and
          observations  can  be ascribed to the use of B-band data, which
          are   a   biased  tracer  of  the  quasar  population,  due  to
          obscuration.

          Title: Formation of Supermassive Black Holes by Direct Collapse
          in Pregalactic Halos
          Authors: Mitchell C. Begelman, Marta Volonteri, Martin J. Rees
          Comments:  10 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Monthly Notices of
          the Royal Astronomical Society
          We  describe  a mechanism by which supermassive black holes can
          form  directly in the nuclei of protogalaxies, without the need
          for  seed  black  holes  left  over  from early star formation.
          Self-gravitating  gas  in  dark  matter  halos can lose angular
          momentum  rapidly  via runaway, global dynamical instabilities,
          the  so-called  "bars within bars" mechanism. This leads to the
          rapid  buildup  of  a dense, self-gravitating core supported by
          gas  pressure  -  surrounded  by a radiation pressure-dominated
          envelope  - which gradually contracts and is compressed further
          by  subsequent  infall.  These  conditions  lead  to  such high
          temperatures   in   the  central  region  that  the  gas  cools
          catastrophically  by  thermal neutrino emission, leading to the
          formation and rapid growth of a central black hole.
          We  estimate the initial mass and growth rate of the black hole
          for typical conditions in metal-free halos with T_vir ~ 10^4 K,
          which  are  the  first to be susceptible to runaway infall. The
          initial  black  hole  should have a mass of <~ 20 solar masses,
          but  in principle could grow at a super-Eddington rate until it
          reaches  ~  10^4-10^6 solar masses. Rapid growth may be limited
          by feedback from the accretion process and/or disruption of the
          mass  supply  by  star  formation  or  halo  mergers.  Even  if
          super-Eddington  growth  stops at ~10^3-10^4 solar masses, this
          process would give black holes ample time to attain quasar-size
          masses by a redshift of 6, and could also provide the seeds for
          all supermassive black holes seen in the present universe.

          The   ultraluminous  X-ray  sources  (ULXs)  were  isolated  in
          external   galaxies   for   the   last  5  years.  Their  X-ray
          luminosities  exceed  100-10000  times those of brightest Milky
          Way  black hole binaries and they are extremely variable. There
          are two models for the ULXs, the best black hole candidates. 1.
          They  are  supercritical  accretion disks around a stellar mass
          black hole like that in SS433, observed close to the disk axes.
          2.  They  are Intermediate Mass Black Holes (of 100-10000 solar
          masses).  Critical  observations which may throw light upon the
          ULXs  nature come from observations of nebulae around the ULXs.
          We present results of 3D-spectroscopy of nebulae around several
          ULXs  located  in  galaxies at 3-6 Mpc distances. We found that
          the  nebulae  to  be  powered by their central black holes. The
          nebulae are shocked and dynamically perturbed probably by jets.
          The nebulae are compared with SS433 nebula (W50).

          Title:  Clumpy  winds  and  the  obscuration of Active Galactic
          Nuclei
          Authors:  Sergei Nayakshin (U of Leicester), Jorge Cuadra (MPA,
          Garching)
          Comments: 5 pages, 5 colour figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          The  role  of star-formation driven outflows in the obscuration
          of  the  central  source in the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is
          discussed.  The  outflow from a sub-parsec scale accretion disc
          is  numerically  modelled  for  parameters  appropriate  to the
          Galactic  Centre.  The  resulting  obscuration  pattern is very
          patchy,  with  some  lines of sight becoming optically thick to
          Thomson  scattering.  A  fixed  observer would see column depth
          changing by factors of many over time scales of order months to
          hundreds  of  years,  depending  on  the  physical  size of the
          outflow  region.  Such winds may be relevant for obscuration of
          some  AGN and especially "changing look AGN". However, averaged
          over  the  sky as seen from the central source, these winds are
          always   optically   thin   unless   wind   outflow  rates  are
          super-Eddington.  A  simple scaling argument shows that this is
          true  not  only for stellar-driven winds but for any AGN winds.
          We  therefore conclude that AGN winds are unable to account for
          the   vast   majority   of  optically  thick  obscured  AGN  (a
          significant  fraction  of  all  AGN).  We suggest that the most
          likely source of optically thick obscuration in AGN is a warped
          parsec scale accretion disc.

          Authors:  Anthony Whitworth, Matthew R. Bate, Aake Nordlund, Bo
          Reipurth, Hans Zinnecker
          Comments: 18 pages,3 figures, chapter in Protostars and Planets
          V
          We  review  five  mechanisms  for  forming  brown  dwarfs:  (i)
          turbulent  fragmentation  of  molecular  clouds, producing very
          low-mass  prestellar  cores by shock compression; (ii) collapse
          and  fragmentation of more massive prestellar cores; (iii) disc
          fragmentation;  (iv) premature ejection of protostellar embryos
          from  their  natal cores; and (v) photo-erosion of pre-existing
          cores overrun by HII regions. These mechanisms are not mutually
          exclusive.   Their  relative  importance  probably  depends  on
          environment, and should be judged by their ability to reproduce
          the  brown-dwarf  IMF, the distribution and kinematics of newly
          formed brown dwarfs, the binary statistics of brown dwarfs, the
          ability  of  brown  dwarfs  to  retain  discs,  and hence their
          ability  to  sustain  accretion and outflows. This will require
          more   sophisticated  numerical  modelling  than  is  presently
          possible,  in  particular more realistic initial conditions and
          more  realistic  treatments  of  radiation  transport,  angular
          momentum  transport and magnetic fields. We discuss the minimum
          mass   for  brown  dwarfs,  and  how  brown  dwarfs  should  be
          distinguished from planets.

          We   have  used  deprojected  radial  density  and  temperature
          profiles  of  a  sample  of 16 nearby CF clusters observed with
          XMM-Newton  to  test  whether  the  effervescent  heating model
          (Ruszkowski   &   Begelman  (2002))  can  give  a  satisfactory
          explanation to the dynamics of CF clusters. For each cluster we
          have  derived,  for  various  values  of the unknown parameters
          $\dot   M$   (mass   deposition  rate)  and  $f_c$  (conduction
          efficiency),  the  required  extra  heating  as  a  function of
          cluster-centric  distance.  We  have  fitted  the extra heating
          curve  using  the AGN effervescent heating function and derived
          the  AGN parameters L (time-averaged luminosity) and $r_0$ (the
          scale  radius  where  the  bubbles start rising in the ICM). We
          show  that the effervescent heating model fails in providing an
          appropriate   description  of  the  observed  structure  of  CF
          clusters  for  half  of  the  objects  in  our  sample. For the
          remaining  objects we find that, when a comparison is possible,
          the  derived  AGN  scale  radius $r_0$ and the observed AGN jet
          extension  are of the same order of magnitude. We show that the
          AGN  luminosities  required  to  balance  radiative  losses are
          substantially  lowered if the fact that the AGN deposits energy
          within  a  finite  volume  is taken into account. For the Virgo
          cluster,   we   find  that  the  AGN  power  derived  from  the
          effervescent  heating  model  is  in  good  agreement  with the
          observed jets power.

          We   present  partial-correlation  analyses  that  examine  the
          strengths of the relationships between L_UV, L_X, Alpha_OX, and
          redshift  for  optically-selected  AGNs.  We extend the work of
          Strateva  et  al. (2005), that analyzed optically-selected AGNs
          from  the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS), by including 52
          moderate-luminosity,  optically-selected AGNs from the COMBO-17
          survey  with  corresponding  deep  (~250  ks  to  1  Ms)  X-ray
          observations  from  the  Extended Chandra Deep Field-South. The
          COMBO-17  survey extends ~3 magnitudes deeper than the SDSS and
          probes  the  moderate-luminosity AGNs that numerically dominate
          the  AGN  population  in the Universe. We also include recently
          published  observations of 19 high-redshift, optically-selected
          AGNs, and 46 luminous, low-redshift AGNs from the Bright Quasar
          Survey.  The  full  sample used in our analysis consists of 333
          AGNs,  extending  out  to  z~6,  with  293  (88%)  having X-ray
          detections.  The sample spans five decades in UV luminosity and
          four  decades  in X-ray luminosity. We confirm that Alpha_OX is
          strongly  anti-correlated  with  L_UV (13.6 sigma), the highest
          significance found for this relation to date, and find evidence
          suggesting  that the slope of this relation may be dependent on
          L_UV.  We  find  that no significant correlation exists between
          Alpha_OX  and  redshift  (1.3 sigma), and constrain the maximum
          evolution of AGN UV-to-X-ray flux ratios to be less than 30% (1
          sigma)  out  to  z=5.  Using  our sample's high X-ray detection
          fraction,  we  also  find  a  significant anti-correlation (3.0
          sigma)  between  Alpha_OX  and  L_X  .  We  make comparisons to
          earlier  studies  on  this  topic  and discuss implications for
          X-ray vs. optical luminosity functions.

          In  order  to  interpret  the results of complex realistic star
          cluster   simulations,   which   rely   on   many   simplifying
          approximations  and  assumptions,  it is essential to study the
          behavior of even more idealized models, which can highlight the
          essential  physical  effects  and  are  amenable  to more exact
          methods.  With  this  aim,  we  present  the  results of N-body
          calculations  of  the  evolution of equal-mass models, starting
          with primordial binary fractions of 0 - 100 %, with values of N
          ranging  from  256  to 16384. This allows us to extrapolate the
          main  features  of  the  evolution  to  systems  comparable  in
          particle  number with globular clusters. In this range, we find
          that    the   steady-state   `deuterium   main   sequence'   is
          characterized by a ratio of the core radius to half-mass radius
          that follows qualitatively the analytical estimate by Vesperini
          &  Chernoff  (1994),  although the N dependence is steeper than
          expected.  Interestingly,  for  an  initial  binary  fraction f
          greater  than  10%,  the  binary heating in the core during the
          post   collapse   phase   almost   saturates  (becoming  nearly
          independent  of  f),  and so little variation in the structural
          properties   is   observed.   Thus,   although   we  observe  a
          significantly  lower  binary abundance in the core with respect
          to  the Fokker-Planck simulations by Gao et al. (1991), this is
          of  little dynamical consequence. At variance with the study of
          Gao  et al. (1991), we see no sign of gravothermal oscillations
          before  150 halfmass relaxation times. At later times, however,
          oscillations  become prominent. We demonstrate the gravothermal
          nature of these oscillations.

          Title:  Star  Clusters  with Primordial Binaries: II. Dynamical
          Evolution of Models in a Tidal Field
          Authors: M. Trenti, D.C. Heggie, P. Hut
          Comments: 13 pages, 17 figures, MNRAS submitted
          [abridged] We extend our analysis of the dynamical evolution of
          simple  star  cluster  models,  in  order to provide comparison
          standards  that  will  aid  in interpreting the results of more
          complex   realistic   simulations.   We  augment  our  previous
          primordial-binary simulations by introducing a tidal field, and
          starting  with King models of different central concentrations.
          We  present the results of N-body calculations of the evolution
          of equal-mass models, starting with primordial binary fractions
          of  0  - 100 %, and N values from 512 to 16384. We also attempt
          to  extrapolate  some  of  our  results to the larger number of
          particles  that  are  necessary  to model globular clusters. We
          characterize  the  steady-state `deuterium main sequence' phase
          in  which  primordial  binaries are depleted in the core in the
          process  of  `gravitationally  burning'.  In this phase we find
          that  the  ratio  of  the core to half-mass radius, r_c/r_h, is
          similar  to  that measured for isolated systems. In addition to
          the  generation of energy due to hardening and depletion of the
          primordial binary population, the overall evolution of the star
          clusters is driven by a competing process: the tidal disruption
          of  the  system.  We  find  that  the  depletion  of primordial
          binaries  before  tidal  dissolution  of the system is possible
          only  if  the  initial number is below 0.05 N, in the case of a
          King  model  with W_0=7 and N=4096 (which is one of our longest
          living  models).  We compare our findings, obtained by means of
          direct N-body simulations but scaled, where possible, to larger
          N,  with  similar  studies  carried out by means of Monte Carlo
          methods.

          resolution figures available at this http URL
          We  have obtained high resolution images of the central regions
          of  14  reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (AGN) using
          the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  Advanced Camera for Surveys High
          Resolution   Camera   to   account  for  host-galaxy  starlight
          contamination  of  measured  AGN  luminosities.  We measure the
          host-galaxy  starlight contribution to the continuum luminosity
          at  5100  A  through the typical ground-based slit position and
          geometry  used  in the reverberation-mapping campaigns. We find
          that   removing   the   starlight  contribution  results  in  a
          significant  correction to the luminosity of each AGN, both for
          lower  luminosity sources, as expected, but also for the higher
          luminosity sources such as the PG quasars. After accounting for
          the host galaxy starlight, we revisit the well-known broad-line
          region  radius--luminosity relationship for nearby AGN. We find
          the  power-law slope of the relationship for the H beta line to
          be  0.518  +/-  0.039,  shallower  than previously reported and
          consistent  with  the  slope  of  0.5  expected  from the naive
          theoretical  assumption that all AGN have, on average, the same
          ionizing  spectrum  and  the  same ionization parameter and gas
          density in the H beta line-emitting region.

          Title: Stellar Explosions by Magnetic Towers
          Authors: Dmitri A. Uzdensky, Andrew I. MacFadyen
          Comments: 18 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We propose a magnetic mechanism for the collimated explosion of
          a   massive   star  relevant  for  GRBs,  XRFs  and  asymmetric
          supernovae.  We  apply Lynden-Bell's magnetic tower scenario to
          the  interior  of  a  massive  rotating star after the core has
          collapsed  to  form  a  black  hole with an accretion disk or a
          millisecond  magnetar  acting as a central engine. We solve the
          force-free  Grad-Shafranov  equation  to calculate the magnetic
          structure   and  growth  of  a  tower  embedded  in  a  stellar
          environment.  The  pressure  of  the  toroidal  magnetic field,
          continuously  generated by differential rotation of the central
          engine,  drives  a  rapid  expansion  which  becomes vertically
          collimated after lateral force balance with the surrounding gas
          pressure  is  reached. The collimation naturally occurs because
          hoop  stress  concentrates  magnetic  field toward the rotation
          axis  and  inhibits lateral expansion. This leads to the growth
          of a self-collimated magnetic tower. When embedded in a massive
          star, the supersonic expansion of the tower drives a strong bow
          shock  behind  which an over-pressured cocoon forms. The cocoon
          confines  the  tower  by  supplying  collimating  pressure  and
          provides   stabilization   against   disruption   due   to  MHD
          instabilities. Because the tower consists of closed field lines
          starting  and  ending  on the central engine, mixing of baryons
          from  the  cocoon  into  the  tower  is suppressed. The channel
          cleared  by the growing tower is thus plausibly free of baryons
          and  allows  the  escape  of  magnetic  energy from the central
          engine  through  the  star.  While propagating down the stellar
          density   gradient,   the   tower   accelerates   and   becomes
          relativistic.   During   the   expansion,   fast  collisionless
          reconnection  becomes  possible  resulting  in  dissipation  of
          magnetic  energy  which  may  be  responsible  for  GRB  prompt
          emission.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJL
          We  present  the  results  of  an  intermediate  resolution (~2
          angstrom)  spectroscopy of a sample of 37 candidate Lyman alpha
          blobs   and   emitters  at  redshift  z=3.1  using  the  DEIMOS
          spectrograph on the 10 m Keck telescope. The emission lines are
          detected  for all the 37 objects and have variety in their line
          profiles.  The  Lyman  alpha  velocity  widths (FWHM) of the 28
          objects  with  higher  quality  spectra,  measured by fitting a
          single  Gaussian  profile,  are in the range of 150 - 1700 km/s
          and  correlate with the Lyman alpha spatial extents. All the 12
          Lyman  alpha blobs (>16 arcsec^2) have large velocity widths of
          >   500   km/s.  While  there  are  several  possible  physical
          interpretations  of  the Lyman alpha velocity widths (motion of
          gravitationally-bound  gas  clouds, inflows, merging of clumps,
          or  outflows from superwinds), the large velocity widths of the
          Lyman  alpha  blobs  suggest that they are the sites of massive
          galaxy   formation.  If  we  assume  gravitationally-bound  gas
          clouds,  the  dynamical  masses  of  the  Lyman alpha blobs are
          estimated  to  be  ~10^12  -  10^13  Msun. Even for the case of
          outflows,  the  outflow  velocities  are  likely to be the same
          order   of   the  rotation  velocities  as  inferred  from  the
          observational evidence for local starburst galaxies.

          3--2,  4--3,  6--5, HCN J=1--0, 3--2, 4--3, and CI J=1--0 lines
          of  a sample of 30 Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) are
          presented.  These  reveal a tandalizing picture of the physical
          conditions of the molecular gas in these extraordinary galaxies
          ($\rm   L_{FIR}>10^{12}   L_{\odot}$),  with  a  diffuse  phase
          dominating  the  low-J  CO  lines  and a much denser and warmer
          phase  dominating the CO 4-3 and 6-5 and all the HCN lines. The
          CI  J=1--0  emission  was  found to be a robust tracer of their
          total  molecular  gas  mass  under  a  large  range of physical
          conditions,  a  potent  alternative to the much weaker emission
          from  the  $ ^{13}$CO isotopologue, and especially promising as
          an H$_2$ tracer for similar objects at high redshifts.

          The understanding of acceleration mechanisms in active galactic
          nuclei    (AGN)    jets    and    the    measurement   of   the
          extragalactic-background-light (EBL) density are closely linked
          and require the detection of a large sample of very-high-energy
          (VHE)  emitting  extragalactic objects at varying redshifts. We
          report  here  on  the  discovery with the H.E.S.S. (High Energy
          Stereoscopic  System)  atmospheric-Cherenkov  telescopes of the
          VHE  Gamma-ray  emission  from  H2356  - 309, an extreme BL Lac
          object located at a redshift of 0.165. The observations of this
          object,  which was previously proposed as a southern-hemisphere
          VHE  candidate source, were performed between June and December
          2004.  The  total  exposure is 38.9 hours live time, after data
          quality  selection,  which  yields the detection of a signal at
          the level of 9.0$\sigma$ (standard deviations) .

          Velocities   close   to   the  speed  of  light  are  a  robust
          observational property of the jets observed in microquasars and
          AGNs,  and  are expected to be behind much of the phenomenology
          of  GRBs. Yet, the mechanism boosting relativistic jets to such
          large Lorentz factors is still essentially unknown. Building on
          recent  general-relativistic,  multidimensional  simulations of
          progenitors   of  short  GRBs,  we  discuss  a  new  effect  in
          relativistic  hydrodynamics  which  can  act  as  an  efficient
          booster  in  jets.  This  effect  is  purely hydrodynamical and
          occurs  when large velocities tangential to a discontinuity are
          present  in  the  flow,  yielding  Lorentz factors $\Gamma \sim
          10^2-10^3$  or  larger  in  flows with moderate initial Lorentz
          factors.  Although without a Newtonian counterpart, this effect
          can   be   explained   easily   through   the  most  elementary
          hydrodynamical flow: i.e., a relativistic Riemann problem.

          constant

          Comments:  4  pages;  this is a preprint of an article accepted
          for publication in Physical Review D
          Some  tests  of  gravity  theories - periastron shift, geodetic
          precession,  change in mean motion and gravitational redshift -
          are  applied  in  solar  and  stellar  systems to constrain the
          cosmological  constant.  We  thus consider a length scale range
          from 10^8 to 10^{15} km. Best bounds from the solar system come
          from  perihelion advance and change in mean motion of Earth and
          Mars,  Lambda < 10^{-36} km^{-2}. Such a limit falls very short
          to estimates from observational cosmology analyses but a future
          experiment  performing  radio  ranging  observations  of  outer
          planets  could  improve  it by four orders of magnitude. Beyond
          the   solar   system,  together  with  future  measurements  of
          periastron   advance  in  wide  binary  pulsars,  gravitational
          redshift  of  white  dwarfs can provide bounds competitive with
          Mars data.

          Jet  models  for  the  high-energy  emission  of Galactic X-ray
          binary sources have regained significant interest with detailed
          spectral   and  timing  studies  of  the  X-ray  emission  from
          microquasars, the recent detection by the HESS collaboration of
          very-high-energy  gamma-rays  from the microquasar LS~5039, and
          the  earlier  suggestion  of jet models for ultraluminous X-ray
          sources  observed  in  many  nearby galaxies. Here we study the
          synchrotron  and  Compton signatures of time-dependent electron
          injection  and  acceleration,  adiabatic and radiative cooling,
          and   different   jet   geometries  in  the  jets  of  Galactic
          microquasars.    Synchrotron,   synchrotron-self-Compton,   and
          external-Compton radiation processes with soft photons provided
          by  the  companion  star and the accretion disk are treated. An
          analytical  solution  is  presented  to  the  electron  kinetic
          equation  for  general  power-law  geometries  of  the jets for
          Compton  scattering  in  the  Thomson regime. We pay particular
          attention to predictions concerning the rapid flux and spectral
          variability  signatures  expected  in  a  variety of scenarios,
          making   specific   predictions  concerning  possible  spectral
          hysteresis,  similar  to  what has been observed in several TeV
          blazars.  Such  predictions  should  be testable with dedicated
          monitoring    observations   of   Galactic   microquasars   and
          ultraluminous X-ray sources using Chandra and/or XMM-Newton.

          We   present  partial-correlation  analyses  that  examine  the
          strengths of the relationships between L_UV, L_X, Alpha_OX, and
          redshift  for  optically-selected  AGNs.  We extend the work of
          Strateva  et  al. (2005), that analyzed optically-selected AGNs
          from  the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS), by including 52
          moderate-luminosity,  optically-selected AGNs from the COMBO-17
          survey  with  corresponding  deep  (~250  ks  to  1  Ms)  X-ray
          observations  from  the  Extended Chandra Deep Field-South. The
          COMBO-17  survey extends ~3 magnitudes deeper than the SDSS and
          probes  the  moderate-luminosity AGNs that numerically dominate
          the  AGN  population  in the Universe. We also include recently
          published  observations of 19 high-redshift, optically-selected
          AGNs, and 46 luminous, low-redshift AGNs from the Bright Quasar
          Survey.  The  full  sample used in our analysis consists of 333
          AGNs,  extending  out  to  z~6,  with  293  (88%)  having X-ray
          detections.  The sample spans five decades in UV luminosity and
          four  decades  in X-ray luminosity. We confirm that Alpha_OX is
          strongly  anti-correlated  with  L_UV (13.6 sigma), the highest
          significance found for this relation to date, and find evidence
          suggesting  that the slope of this relation may be dependent on
          L_UV.  We  find  that no significant correlation exists between
          Alpha_OX  and  redshift  (1.3 sigma), and constrain the maximum
          evolution of AGN UV-to-X-ray flux ratios to be less than 30% (1
          sigma)  out  to  z=5.  Using  our sample's high X-ray detection
          fraction,  we  also  find  a  significant anti-correlation (3.0
          sigma)  between  Alpha_OX  and  L_X  .  We  make comparisons to
          earlier  studies  on  this  topic  and discuss implications for
          X-ray vs. optical luminosity functions.

          Title:  Star  Clusters  with  Primordial Binaries: I. Dynamical
          Evolution of Isolated Models
          Authors: D.C. Heggie, M. Trenti, P. Hut
          Comments: 14 pages, 22 figures, MNRAS accepted
          In  order  to  interpret  the results of complex realistic star
          cluster   simulations,   which   rely   on   many   simplifying
          approximations  and  assumptions,  it is essential to study the
          behavior of even more idealized models, which can highlight the
          essential  physical  effects  and  are  amenable  to more exact
          methods.  With  this  aim,  we  present  the  results of N-body
          calculations  of  the  evolution of equal-mass models, starting
          with primordial binary fractions of 0 - 100 %, with values of N
          ranging  from  256  to 16384. This allows us to extrapolate the
          main  features  of  the  evolution  to  systems  comparable  in
          particle  number with globular clusters. In this range, we find
          that    the   steady-state   `deuterium   main   sequence'   is
          characterized by a ratio of the core radius to half-mass radius
          that follows qualitatively the analytical estimate by Vesperini
          &  Chernoff  (1994),  although the N dependence is steeper than
          expected.  Interestingly,  for  an  initial  binary  fraction f
          greater  than  10%,  the  binary heating in the core during the
          post   collapse   phase   almost   saturates  (becoming  nearly
          independent  of  f),  and so little variation in the structural
          properties   is   observed.   Thus,   although   we  observe  a
          significantly  lower  binary abundance in the core with respect
          to  the Fokker-Planck simulations by Gao et al. (1991), this is
          of  little dynamical consequence. At variance with the study of
          Gao  et al. (1991), we see no sign of gravothermal oscillations
          before  150 halfmass relaxation times. At later times, however,
          oscillations  become prominent. We demonstrate the gravothermal
          nature of these oscillations.

          Title:  Star  Clusters  with Primordial Binaries: II. Dynamical
          Evolution of Models in a Tidal Field
          Authors: M. Trenti, D.C. Heggie, P. Hut
          Comments: 13 pages, 17 figures, MNRAS submitted
          [abridged] We extend our analysis of the dynamical evolution of
          simple  star  cluster  models,  in  order to provide comparison
          standards  that  will  aid  in interpreting the results of more
          complex   realistic   simulations.   We  augment  our  previous
          primordial-binary simulations by introducing a tidal field, and
          starting  with King models of different central concentrations.
          We  present the results of N-body calculations of the evolution
          of equal-mass models, starting with primordial binary fractions
          of  0  - 100 %, and N values from 512 to 16384. We also attempt
          to  extrapolate  some  of  our  results to the larger number of
          particles  that  are  necessary  to model globular clusters. We
          characterize  the  steady-state `deuterium main sequence' phase
          in  which  primordial  binaries are depleted in the core in the
          process  of  `gravitationally  burning'.  In this phase we find
          that  the  ratio  of  the core to half-mass radius, r_c/r_h, is
          similar  to  that measured for isolated systems. In addition to
          the  generation of energy due to hardening and depletion of the
          primordial binary population, the overall evolution of the star
          clusters is driven by a competing process: the tidal disruption
          of  the  system.  We  find  that  the  depletion  of primordial
          binaries  before  tidal  dissolution  of the system is possible
          only  if  the  initial number is below 0.05 N, in the case of a
          King  model  with W_0=7 and N=4096 (which is one of our longest
          living  models).  We compare our findings, obtained by means of
          direct N-body simulations but scaled, where possible, to larger
          N,  with  similar  studies  carried out by means of Monte Carlo
          methods.

          We  have obtained high resolution images of the central regions
          of  14  reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (AGN) using
          the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  Advanced Camera for Surveys High
          Resolution   Camera   to   account  for  host-galaxy  starlight
          contamination  of  measured  AGN  luminosities.  We measure the
          host-galaxy  starlight contribution to the continuum luminosity
          at  5100  A  through the typical ground-based slit position and
          geometry  used  in the reverberation-mapping campaigns. We find
          that   removing   the   starlight  contribution  results  in  a
          significant  correction to the luminosity of each AGN, both for
          lower  luminosity sources, as expected, but also for the higher
          luminosity sources such as the PG quasars. After accounting for
          the host galaxy starlight, we revisit the well-known broad-line
          region  radius--luminosity relationship for nearby AGN. We find
          the  power-law slope of the relationship for the H beta line to
          be  0.518  +/-  0.039,  shallower  than previously reported and
          consistent  with  the  slope  of  0.5  expected  from the naive
          theoretical  assumption that all AGN have, on average, the same
          ionizing  spectrum  and  the  same ionization parameter and gas
          density in the H beta line-emitting region.

          Title: Stellar Explosions by Magnetic Towers
          Authors: Dmitri A. Uzdensky, Andrew I. MacFadyen
          Comments: 18 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We propose a magnetic mechanism for the collimated explosion of
          a   massive   star  relevant  for  GRBs,  XRFs  and  asymmetric
          supernovae.  We  apply Lynden-Bell's magnetic tower scenario to
          the  interior  of  a  massive  rotating star after the core has
          collapsed  to  form  a  black  hole with an accretion disk or a
          millisecond  magnetar  acting as a central engine. We solve the
          force-free  Grad-Shafranov  equation  to calculate the magnetic
          structure   and  growth  of  a  tower  embedded  in  a  stellar
          environment.  The  pressure  of  the  toroidal  magnetic field,
          continuously  generated by differential rotation of the central
          engine,  drives  a  rapid  expansion  which  becomes vertically
          collimated after lateral force balance with the surrounding gas
          pressure  is  reached. The collimation naturally occurs because
          hoop  stress  concentrates  magnetic  field toward the rotation
          axis  and  inhibits lateral expansion. This leads to the growth
          of a self-collimated magnetic tower. When embedded in a massive
          star, the supersonic expansion of the tower drives a strong bow
          shock  behind  which an over-pressured cocoon forms. The cocoon
          confines  the  tower  by  supplying  collimating  pressure  and
          provides   stabilization   against   disruption   due   to  MHD
          instabilities. Because the tower consists of closed field lines
          starting  and  ending  on the central engine, mixing of baryons
          from  the  cocoon  into  the  tower  is suppressed. The channel
          cleared  by the growing tower is thus plausibly free of baryons
          and  allows  the  escape  of  magnetic  energy from the central
          engine  through  the  star.  While propagating down the stellar
          density   gradient,   the   tower   accelerates   and   becomes
          relativistic.   During   the   expansion,   fast  collisionless
          reconnection  becomes  possible  resulting  in  dissipation  of
          magnetic  energy  which  may  be  responsible  for  GRB  prompt
          emission.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJL
          We  present  the  results  of  an  intermediate  resolution (~2
          angstrom)  spectroscopy of a sample of 37 candidate Lyman alpha
          blobs   and   emitters  at  redshift  z=3.1  using  the  DEIMOS
          spectrograph on the 10 m Keck telescope. The emission lines are
          detected  for all the 37 objects and have variety in their line
          profiles.  The  Lyman  alpha  velocity  widths (FWHM) of the 28
          objects  with  higher  quality  spectra,  measured by fitting a
          single  Gaussian  profile,  are in the range of 150 - 1700 km/s
          and  correlate with the Lyman alpha spatial extents. All the 12
          Lyman  alpha blobs (>16 arcsec^2) have large velocity widths of
          >   500   km/s.  While  there  are  several  possible  physical
          interpretations  of  the Lyman alpha velocity widths (motion of
          gravitationally-bound  gas  clouds, inflows, merging of clumps,
          or  outflows from superwinds), the large velocity widths of the
          Lyman  alpha  blobs  suggest that they are the sites of massive
          galaxy   formation.  If  we  assume  gravitationally-bound  gas
          clouds,  the  dynamical  masses  of  the  Lyman alpha blobs are
          estimated  to  be  ~10^12  -  10^13  Msun. Even for the case of
          outflows,  the  outflow  velocities  are  likely to be the same
          order   of   the  rotation  velocities  as  inferred  from  the
          observational evidence for local starburst galaxies.

          3--2,  4--3,  6--5, HCN J=1--0, 3--2, 4--3, and CI J=1--0 lines
          of  a sample of 30 Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) are
          presented.  These  reveal a tandalizing picture of the physical
          conditions of the molecular gas in these extraordinary galaxies
          ($\rm   L_{FIR}>10^{12}   L_{\odot}$),  with  a  diffuse  phase
          dominating  the  low-J  CO  lines  and a much denser and warmer
          phase  dominating the CO 4-3 and 6-5 and all the HCN lines. The
          CI  J=1--0  emission  was  found to be a robust tracer of their
          total  molecular  gas  mass  under  a  large  range of physical
          conditions,  a  potent  alternative to the much weaker emission
          from  the  $ ^{13}$CO isotopologue, and especially promising as
          an H$_2$ tracer for similar objects at high redshifts.

          The understanding of acceleration mechanisms in active galactic
          nuclei    (AGN)    jets    and    the    measurement   of   the
          extragalactic-background-light (EBL) density are closely linked

          (VHE)  emitting  extragalactic objects at varying redshifts. We
          report  here  on  the  discovery with the H.E.S.S. (High Energy
          Stereoscopic  System)  atmospheric-Cherenkov  telescopes of the
          VHE  Gamma-ray  emission  from  H2356  - 309, an extreme BL Lac

          object,  which was previously proposed as a southern-hemisphere
          VHE  candidate source, were performed between June and December
          2004.  The  total  exposure is 38.9 hours live time, after data
          quality  selection,  which  yields the detection of a signal at
          the level of 9.0$\sigma$ (standard deviations) .

          Velocities   close   to   the  speed  of  light  are  a  robust
          observational property of the jets observed in microquasars and
          AGNs,  and  are expected to be behind much of the phenomenology
          of  GRBs. Yet, the mechanism boosting relativistic jets to such
          large Lorentz factors is still essentially unknown. Building on
          recent  general-relativistic,  multidimensional  simulations of
          progenitors   of  short  GRBs,  we  discuss  a  new  effect  in
          relativistic  hydrodynamics  which  can  act  as  an  efficient
          booster  in  jets.  This  effect  is  purely hydrodynamical and
          occurs  when large velocities tangential to a discontinuity are
          present  in  the  flow,  yielding  Lorentz factors $\Gamma \sim
          10^2-10^3$  or  larger  in  flows with moderate initial Lorentz
          factors.  Although without a Newtonian counterpart, this effect
          can   be   explained   easily   through   the  most  elementary
          hydrodynamical flow: i.e., a relativistic Riemann problem.

          Comments:  4  pages;  this is a preprint of an article accepted
          for publication in Physical Review D
          Some  tests  of  gravity  theories - periastron shift, geodetic
          precession,  change in mean motion and gravitational redshift -
          are  applied  in  solar  and  stellar  systems to constrain the
          cosmological  constant.  We  thus consider a length scale range
          from 10^8 to 10^{15} km. Best bounds from the solar system come
          from  perihelion advance and change in mean motion of Earth and
          Mars,  Lambda < 10^{-36} km^{-2}. Such a limit falls very short
          to estimates from observational cosmology analyses but a future
          experiment  performing  radio  ranging  observations  of  outer
          planets  could  improve  it by four orders of magnitude. Beyond
          the   solar   system,  together  with  future  measurements  of
          periastron   advance  in  wide  binary  pulsars,  gravitational
          redshift  of  white  dwarfs can provide bounds competitive with
          Mars data.

          Jet  models  for  the  high-energy  emission  of Galactic X-ray
          binary sources have regained significant interest with detailed
          spectral   and  timing  studies  of  the  X-ray  emission  from
          microquasars, the recent detection by the HESS collaboration of
          very-high-energy  gamma-rays  from the microquasar LS~5039, and
          the  earlier  suggestion  of jet models for ultraluminous X-ray
          sources  observed  in  many  nearby galaxies. Here we study the
          synchrotron  and  Compton signatures of time-dependent electron
          injection  and  acceleration,  adiabatic and radiative cooling,
          and   different   jet   geometries  in  the  jets  of  Galactic
          microquasars.    Synchrotron,   synchrotron-self-Compton,   and
          external-Compton radiation processes with soft photons provided
          by  the  companion  star and the accretion disk are treated. An
          analytical  solution  is  presented  to  the  electron  kinetic
          equation  for  general  power-law  geometries  of  the jets for
          Compton  scattering  in  the  Thomson regime. We pay particular
          attention to predictions concerning the rapid flux and spectral
          variability  signatures  expected  in  a  variety of scenarios,
          making   specific   predictions  concerning  possible  spectral
          hysteresis,  similar  to  what has been observed in several TeV
          blazars.  Such  predictions  should  be testable with dedicated
          monitoring    observations   of   Galactic   microquasars   and
          ultraluminous X-ray sources using Chandra and/or XMM-Newton.

          We  present  the results of a high-resolution imaging survey of
          22 brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the nearby (~145 pc)
          young (~1-2 Myr) low-density star-forming region Taurus-Auriga.

          and  F850LP (z') filters. This survey confirmed the binarity of

          V410-Xray3,  resulting  in  a  binary  fraction  of  9+/-5%  at
          separations  >4  AU. Both binary systems are tight (<10 AU) and
          they  possess  mass  ratios of 0.75 and 0.46, respectively. The
          binary  frequency  and separations are consistent with low-mass
          binary   properties  in  the  field,  but  the  mass  ratio  of
          V410-Xray3  is  among the lowest known. We find that the binary
          frequency is higher for very low mass stars and high-mass brown
          dwarfs  than  for  lower-mass  brown  dwarfs, implying either a
          decline  in frequency or a shift to smaller separations for the
          lowest mass binaries. Combining these results with multiplicity
          statistics  for  higher-mass  Taurus members suggests a gradual
          decline  in  binary frequency and separation toward low masses.
          The  implication is that the distinct binary properties of very
          low-mass   systems  are  set  during  formation  and  that  the
          formation  process  is  similar  to  the  process which creates
          higher-mass stellar binaries, but occurs on a smaller scale. We
          show  that  there  are no planets or very low-mass brown dwarfs
          with mass >3 M_J at projected separation >40 AU orbiting any of
          the  Taurus members in our sample. We identify several BDs with
          significant (>1 mag) V-band excesses. The excesses appear to be
          correlated  with  signatures of accretion, and if attributed to
          accretion  luminosity,  may  imply mass accretion rates several
          orders  of  magnitude  above  those  inferred from line-profile
          analyses. (abridged)

          Title: ZZ Ceti Stars: Fractal Analogues of Excited Helium Ions?
          Authors: R. L. Oldershaw
          Comments: 17 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables, comments welcome
          Multi-periodic  pulsation  phenomena  of ZZ Ceti variable stars
          are  analyzed  within  the  context  of  a fractal cosmological
          paradigm  that emphasizes discrete self-similarity in nature. A
          quantitative test comparing relevant stellar and atomic periods
          provides  preliminary  support  for  the  analysis.  This paper
          completes  a  3-part  series  that  explores the possibility of
          discrete  cosmological  self-similarity  in variable stars; the
          first  and  second  papers  discussed  RR Lyrae and delta Scuti
          stars, respectively.

          The  spectral,  timing, and jet formation properties of neutron
          stars  in  low  mass x-ray binary systems are influenced by the
          presence of central magnetic moments. Similar features shown by
          the galactic black hole candidates (GBHC) strongly suggest that
          their compact cores might be intrinsically magnetic as well. We
          show  that  the  existence  of  intrinsically  magnetic GBHC is
          consistent  with a new class of solutions of the Einstein field
          equations of General Relativity. These solutions are based on a
          strict  adherence to the Strong Principle of Equivalence (SPOE)
          requirement that the world lines of physical matter must remain
          timelike  in all regions of spacetime. The new solutions emerge
          when  the  structure  and  radiation transfer properties of the
          energy  momentum  tensor on the right hand side of the Einstein
          field equations are appropriately chosen to dynamically enforce
          this  SPOE  requirement of timelike world line completeness. In
          this  context,  we find that the Einstein field equations allow
          the  existence of highly red shifted, Magnetospheric, Eternally
          Collapsing  Objects  (MECO). MECO necessarily possess intrinsic
          magnetic  moments  and  they  do not have trapped surfaces that
          lead  to event horizons and curvature singularities. Their most
          striking  features  are  equipartition  magnetic  fields,  pair
          plasma  atmospheres  and extreme gravitational redshifts. Since
          MECO  lifetimes  are  orders of magnitude greater than a Hubble
          time,  they  provide  an  elegant  and  unified  framework  for
          understanding  a broad range of observations of GBHC and active
          galactic  nuclei.  We  examine  their  spectral, timing and jet
          formation  properties  and  discuss  characteristics that might
          lead to their confirmation.

          Title:  Re-Identification  of the `Enigmatic' X-ray Source 1RXS
          J114003.0+124112
          Authors: J. Wu, T. Movsessian, Y. Chen, X. He, X. Zhou, J. Ma
          Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures, to be published in ChJAA
          The  ROSAT X-ray source 1RXS J114003.0+124112 was identified as
          a  starburst  galaxy  at  redshift  0.177  by He et al. (2001).
          Meanwhile, the authors also noted that the source is almost two
          orders  of magnitude brighter in X-ray than the X-ray-brightest
          starburst galaxy and it seems to be in a merging system, making
          this  source an enigmatic system for further observations. This
          paper  reports  the  re-identification of 1RXS J114003.0+124112
          with  the  observations  on  the  2.6  m  telescope at Byurakan
          Astrophysical  Observatory, Armenia and with the SDSS data. The
          results indicate that the starburst activity is associated with
          the  brighter object in the system, while the fainter object is
          a  typical  Seyfert  1 galaxy at redshift 0.282. Therefore, the
          two  objects  are  not  in  a merging system, and the Seyfert 1
          galaxy  naturally  accounts for the high X-ray flux. Three more
          objects  reside  in the vicinity, but they are all too faint to
          be responsible for the high X-ray flux.

          Star Collapsing to A Black Hole

          Comments:   42   pages,   accepted   for   publication  in  the
          Astrophysical  Journal.  A paper with higher-resolution figures
          available at this http URL
          We  perform  two-dimensional, axisymmetric, magnetohydrodynamic
          simulations  of  the collapse of a rotating star of 40 Msun and
          in  the  light  of  the  collapsar  model  of  gamma-ray burst.
          Considering  two  distributions of angular momentum, up to \sim
          10^{17}  cm^2/s,  and  the  uniform vertical magnetic field, we
          investigate  the  formation of an accretion disk around a black
          hole  and  the  jet  production  near  the hole. After material
          reaches  to  the black hole with the high angular momentum, the
          disk is formed inside a surface of weak shock. The disk becomes
          in  a quasi-steady state for stars whose magnetic field is less
          than 10^{10} G before the collapse. We find that the jet can be
          driven by the magnetic fields even if the central core does not
          rotate as rapidly as previously assumed and outer layers of the
          star  has  sufficiently  high  angular  momentum.  The magnetic
          fields  are  chiefly  amplified  inside  the  disk  due  to the
          compression  and  the  wrapping of the field. The fields inside
          the disk propagate to the polar region along the inner boundary
          near the black hole through the Alfv{\'e}n wave, and eventually
          drive    the   jet.   The   quasi-steady   disk   is   not   an
          advection-dominated  disk but a neutrino cooling-dominated one.
          Mass  accretion  rates  in  the  disks  are  greater  than 0.01
          Msun/sec  with  large fluctuations. The disk is transparent for
          neutrinos.  The  dense part of the disk, which locates near the
          hole,  emits  neutrino  efficiently  at  a constant rate of < 8
          \times  10^{51}  erg/s. The neutrino luminosity is much smaller
          than those from supernovae after the neutrino burst.

          Title:  Evolutionary  Paths for Galaxies and AGNs: New Insights
          by the Spitzer Space Telescope
          Authors: A. Franceschini, G. Rodighiero, S. Berta, P. Cassata
          Comments:  invited  review  at  the Workshop on "AGN and galaxy
          evolution",  Specola  Vaticana,  Castel  Gandolfo,  Italy,  3-6
          October 2005
          We compare the history of the galaxy mass build-up, as inferred
          from  near-IR  observations,  and  the  Star  Formation Rate of
          massive  stars  in the comoving volume traced by deep extensive
          far-IR  surveys,  both  possible  now  with  the  Spitzer Space
          Telescope.  These  two independent and complementary approaches
          to the history of galaxy formation consistently indicate that a
          wide  interval  of  cosmic epochs between z~0.7 to z~2 brackets
          the main evolutionary phases. The rate of the integrated galaxy
          mass  growth  indicated  by  the  IR-based comoving SFR appears
          consistent  with  the  observed  decrease  of  the stellar mass
          densities  with  redshift.  There are also indications that the
          evolution  with  z  of  the  total population depends on galaxy
          mass, being stronger for moderate-mass, but almost absent up to
          z=1.4 for high-mass galaxies, thus confirming previous evidence
          for a "downsizing" effect in galaxy formation. The most massive
          galaxies  appear  already  mostly  in  place by z~1. Although a
          precise  matching  of  this  galaxy build-up with the growth of
          nuclear  super-massive  black-holes  is  not  possible with the
          present data (due to difficulties for an accurate census of the
          obscured AGN phenomenon), some preliminary indications reveal a
          similar mass/luminosity dependence for AGN evolution as for the
          hosting galaxies.

          Title:  The  Structure of the Homunculus: I. Shape and Latitude
          Dependence from H2 and [Fe II] Velocity Maps of Eta Carinae
          Authors: Nathan Smith
          Comments: 25 pages, figs 2 and 3 in color. Accepted by ApJ
          High  resolution  long-slit  spectra  obtained with the Phoenix
          spectrograph on Gemini South provide our most accurate probe of
          the  three  dimensional  structure of the Homunculus around eta
          Car.  The  new  near-infrared  spectra dramatically confirm the
          double-shell  structure  inferred  previously from thermal dust
          emission,  resolving  the  nebula  into a very thin outer shell
          seen in H2 21218, and a warmer, thicker inner layer seen in [Fe
          II]  16435. The thin H2 skin hints that the most important mass
          loss during the 19th century eruption had a very short duration
          of  less than 5 yr. H2 emission traces the majority of the mass
          in the nebula, and has an average density of order 10^6.5 cm-3.
          This  emission, in turn, yields our first definitive picture of
          the  exact  shape of the nebula, plus a distance of 2350pm50 pc
          and  an  inclination  angle  of 41deg (the polar axis is tilted
          49deg  from  the  plane of the sky). The distribution of the H2
          emission  provides the first measure of the latitude dependence
          of the speed, mass loss, and kinetic energy associated with eta
          Car's  19th  century  explosion. Almost 75 percent of the total
          mass  and  more  than  90  percent of the kinetic energy in the
          ejecta  were released at high latitudes. This rules out a model
          for  the bipolar shape wherein an otherwise spherical explosion
          was  pinched  at  the waist by a circumstellar torus. Also, the
          ejecta  could not have been deflected toward polar trajectories
          by  a  companion  star,  since  the kinetic energy of the polar
          ejecta  is  greater  than  the  binding  energy of the putative
          binary  system.  Instead, most of the mass appears to have been
          directed poleward by the explosion itself. [abridged]

          Title: Understanding the Stellar Initial Mass Function
          Authors: Richard B. Larson
          Comments:  5  pages,  text  only. Invited talk presented at the
          11th   Latin  American  Regional  IAU  Meeting,  Pucon,  Chile,
          December   2005.   To  be  published  by  Revista  Mexicana  de
          Astronomia y Astrofisica
          The  essential  features  of stellar Initial Mass Function are,
          rather generally, (1) a peak at mass of a few tenths of a solar
          mass,  and  (2)  a  power-law tail toward higher masses that is
          similar to the original Salpeter function. Recent work suggests
          that  the  IMF peak reflects a preferred scale of fragmentation
          associated with the transition from a cooling phase of collapse
          at  low  densities  to  a  nearly  isothermal  phase  at higher
          densities, where the gas becomes thermally coupled to the dust.
          The Salpeter power law is plausibly produced, at least in part,
          by  scale-free  accretion processes that build up massive stars
          in  dense  environments. The young stars at the Galactic Center
          appear  to  have  unusually  high masses, possibly because of a
          high  minimum mass resulting from the high opacity of the dense
          star-forming gas.

          The  observability of gravitational waves from supermassive and
          intermediate-mass   black   holes   by   the  forecoming  Laser
          Interferometer  Space  Antenna  (LISA),  and the physics we can
          learn  from the observations, will depend on two basic factors:
          the event rates for massive black hole mergers occurring in the
          LISA  best sensitivity window, and our theoretical knowledge of
          the  gravitational waveforms. We first provide a concise review
          of  the  literature  on LISA event rates for massive black hole
          mergers, as predicted by different formation scenarios. Then we
          discuss  what  (in  our  view)  are  the  most urgent issues to
          address  in terms of waveform modelling. For massive black hole
          binary  inspiral  these  include spin precession, eccentricity,
          the  effect of high-order Post-Newtonian terms in the amplitude
          and  phase,  and  an accurate prediction of the transition from
          inspiral   to   plunge.  For  black  hole  ringdown,  numerical
          relativity   will  ultimately  be  required  to  determine  the
          relative   quasinormal  mode  excitation,  and  to  reduce  the
          dimensionality of the template space in matched filtering.

          publication in ApJ
          We  use  a  sample  of  87  rest-frame UV-selected star-forming
          galaxies  with  mean spectroscopic redshift z=2.26 to study the
          correlation  between  metallicity  and  stellar  mass  at  high
          redshift.  Using  stellar masses determined from SED fitting to
          0.3-8  micron photometry, we divide the sample into six bins in
          stellar mass, and construct six composite H-alpha+[NII] spectra
          from  all  of  the  objects  in  each bin. We estimate the mean
          oxygen  abundance in each bin from the [NII]/H-alpha ratio, and
          find  a  monotonic  increase  in  metallicity  with  increasing
          stellar mass, from 12+log(O/H) < 8.2 for galaxies with <M_star>
          =  2.7e9 Msun to 12+log(O/H) = 8.6 for galaxies with <M_star> =
          1e11 Msun. We use the empirical relation between star formation
          rate  density  and gas density to estimate the gas fractions of
          the   galaxies,  finding  an  increase  in  gas  fraction  with
          decreasing  stellar mass. These gas fractions combined with the
          observed  metallicities  allow  the estimation of the effective
          yield  y_eff  as  a  function  of stellar mass; in constrast to
          observations  in  the  local  universe which show a decrease in
          y_eff with decreasing baryonic mass, we find a slight increase.
          Such  a  variation of metallicity with gas fraction is best fit
          by  a  model with supersolar yield and an outflow rate ~4 times
          higher  than  the  star  formation  rate.  We conclude that the
          mass-metallicity  relation  at  high  redshift is driven by the
          increase  in  metallicity as the gas fraction decreases through
          star  formation,  and  is  likely  modulated by metal loss from
          strong outflows in galaxies of all masses. There is no evidence
          for  preferential  loss of metals from low mass galaxies as has
          been suggested in the local universe. [Abridged]

          We  solve  for  the  time-dependent  dynamics  of axisymmetric,
          general  relativistic  magnetohydrodynamic  winds from rotating
          neutron stars. The mass loss rate is obtained self-consistently
          as a solution to the MHD equations, subject to a finite thermal
          pressure  at the stellar surface. We consider both monopole and
          dipole  magnetic  field geometries and we explore the parameter
          regime  extending  from low magnetization (low-sigma_o), almost
          thermally-driven  winds  to  high magnetization (high-sigma_o),
          relativistic  Poynting-flux  dominated outflows. We compute the
          angular momentum and rotational energy loss rates as a function
          of  sigma_o  and  compare  with  analytic expectations from the
          classical  theory  of  pulsars and magnetized stellar winds. In
          the   case  of  the  monopole,  our  high-sigma_o  calculations
          asymptotically  approach  the  analytic force-free limit. If we
          define the spindown rate in terms of the open magnetic flux, we
          similarly  reproduce  the  spindown rate from recent force-free
          calculations  of  the aligned dipole. However, even for sigma_o
          as  high  as ~20, we find that the location of the Y-type point
          (r_Y), which specifies the radius of the last closed field line
          in  the  equatorial  plane,  is  not  the  radius  of the light
          cylinder  R_L  =  c/omega  (R  =  cylindrical  radius),  as has
          previously  been  assumed  in  most  estimates  and  force-free
          calculations.   Instead,   although   the   Alfven   radius  at
          intermediate   latitudes  quickly  approaches  R_L  as  sigma_o
          exceeds unity, r_Y remains significantly less than R_L. Because
          r_Y  <  R_L,  our  calculated  spindown  rates  thus exceed the
          classic  ``vacuum  dipole'' rate. We discussthe implications of

          Title:  A  New Search Paradigm for Correlated Neutrino Emission
          from  Discrete GRBs using Antarctic Cherenkov Telescopes in the

          Proceedings  of  The  16th  Annual  Astrophysics  Conference in

          We  describe  the  theoretical modeling and analysis techniques
          associated  with  a  preliminary search for correlated neutrino
          emission   from  GRB980703a,  which  triggered  the  Burst  and
          Transient  Source  Experiment  (BATSE  GRB trigger 6891), using
          archived  data  from  the  Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector
          Array (AMANDA-B10). Under the assumption of associated hadronic
          acceleration,  the  expected  observed  neutrino energy flux is
          directly   derived,   based   upon   confronting  the  fireball
          phenomenology with the discrete set of observed electromagnetic
          parameters   of   GRB980703a,  gleaned  from  ground-based  and
          satellite   observations,   for   four  models,  corrected  for
          oscillations.  Models  1  and  2,  based upon spectral analysis
          featuring  a  prompt  photon  energy  fit to the Band function,
          utilize  an  observed spectroscopic redshift, for isotropic and
          anisotropic  emission  geometry, respectively. Model 3 is based
          upon  averaged  burst  parameters, assuming isotropic emission.
          Model  4, based upon a Band fit, features an estimated redshift
          from  the  lag-luminosity  relation  with  isotropic  emission.
          Consistent  with  our  AMANDA-II  analysis  of GRB030329, which
          resulted  in  a flux upper limit of ~0.150 GeV/cm^2/s for model
          1,  we  find  differences in excess of an order of magnitude in
          the  response  of  AMANDA-B10,  among  the  various  models for
          GRB980703a.  Implications  for  future  searches  in the era of
          Swift and IceCube are discussed.

          Title:  Strongly  induced collapse in the Class 0 protostar NGC
          1333 IRAS 4A
          Authors: A. Belloche, P. Hennebelle, P. Andre
          Comments: Accepted by A&A. 12 pages, 10 figures
          The  onset  of gravitational collapse in cluster-forming clouds
          is still poorly known. Our goal is to use the Class 0 protostar
          IRAS  4A,  which is undergoing collapse in the active molecular
          cloud  NGC  1333,  to  set  constraints  on  this  process.  In
          particular  we  want  to  measure  the  mass  infall  rate  and
          investigate whether the collapse could have been triggered by a
          strong  external  perturbation.  We  analyze existing continuum
          observations  to  derive the density structure of the envelope,
          and  use our new molecular line observations done with the IRAM
          30m  telescope  to  probe  its velocity structure. We perform a
          detailed  comparison of this set of data with a numerical model
          of  collapse triggered by a fast external compression. Both the
          density  and  velocity  structures  of the envelope can be well
          fitted  by  this  model  of collapse induced by a fast external
          compression  for  a  time elapsed since point mass formation of
          1-2  x  10**4 yr. We deduce a large mass infall rate of 0.7-2 x
          10**-4  Msun/yr.  The momentum required for the perturbation to
          produce this large mass infall rate is of the same order as the
          momenta  measured  for  the  NGC  1333  numerous  outflows. Our
          analysis  shows  also that the turbulence is highly non uniform
          in  the  envelope,  dropping from supersonic to subsonic values
          toward the center. The inner subsonic turbulence is most likely
          a  relic  of the conditions prevailing in the dense core before
          the  onset of collapse. The vigorous collapse undergone by IRAS
          4A  was  triggered  by  a  fast  external compression, probably
          related  to  the expansion of a nearby cavity, which could have
          triggered  the collapse of the nearby Class 0 protostar IRAS 4B
          simultaneously.  This  cavity  could  have been generated by an
          outflow  but  we  have  not found a good protostellar candidate
          yet.

          Title:  The  dynamics of eccentric accretion discs in superhump
          systems
          Authors:  Simon  Goodchild  (1), Gordon Ogilvie (1,2) ((1) IoA,
          Cambridge, (2) DAMTP, Cambridge)
          Comments:  10  pages,  11  figures. Accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We   have   applied  an  eccentric  accretion  disc  theory  in
          simplified  form  to  the case of an accretion disc in a binary
          system,  where  the  disc  contains the 3:1 Lindblad resonance.
          This  is relevant to the case of superhumps in SU Ursae Majoris
          cataclysmic  variables  and  other systems, where it is thought
          that  this  resonance  leads  to  growth  of eccentricity and a
          modulation  in  the  light  curve  due  to the interaction of a
          precessing   eccentric  disc  with  tidal  stresses.  A  single
          differential   equation   is  formulated  which  describes  the
          propagation,   resonant   excitation  and  viscous  damping  of
          eccentricity. The theory is first worked out in the simple case
          of  a  narrow  ring  and  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  the
          eccentricity distribution is locally suppressed by the presence
          of  the  resonance,  creating  a dip in the eccentricity at the
          resonant  radius.  Application  of this theory to the superhump
          case  confirms  this  conclusion  and  produces a more accurate
          expression  for  the  precession rate of the disc than has been
          previously accomplished with simple dynamical estimates.

          With  the  discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Ibata
          et  al.  1994),  a galaxy caught in the process of merging with
          the  Milky  Way,  the  hunt for other such accretion events has
          become  a  very  active  field  of  astrophysical research. The
          identification  of  a stellar ring-like structure in Monoceros,
          spanning  more  than 100 degrees (Newberg et al. 2002), and the
          detection  of  an  overdensity of stars in the direction of the
          constellation  of  Canis  Major  (CMa,  Martin  et  al.  2004),
          apparently  associated  to  the ring, has led to the widespread
          belief that a second galaxy being cannibalised by the Milky Way
          had  been found. In this scenario, the overdensity would be the
          remaining  core  of  the disrupted galaxy and the ring would be
          the  tidal  debris left behind. However, unlike the Sagittarius
          dwarf,  which is well below the Galactic plane and whose orbit,
          and  thus  tidal  tail, is nearly perpendicular to the plane of
          the  Milky  Way,  the  putative  CMa galaxy and ring are nearly
          co-planar with the Galactic disk. This severely complicates the
          interpretation  of  observations.  In this letter, we show that
          our  new  description  of  the  Milky Way leads to a completely
          different  picture.  We  argue that the Norma-Cygnus spiral arm
          defines  a  distant  stellar  ring  crossing  Monoceros and the
          overdensity  is simply a projection effect of looking along the
          nearby  local  arm.  Our  perspective sheds new light on a very
          poorly  known  region, the third Galactic quadrant (3GQ), where
          CMa is located.

          Title:  Radiative Transfer Modeling of Three-Dimensional Clumpy
          AGN Tori and its Application to NGC 1068
          Authors: S. F. Hoenig, T. Beckert, K. Ohnaka, G. Weigelt
          Comments:  16  pages, 16 figures, 6 tables (figures reduced due
          to 
astro-ph limitations); accepted by A&A
          Recent  observations of NGC 1068 and other AGN support the idea
          of  a  geometrically and optically thick dust torus surrounding
          the  central supermassive black hole and accretion disk of AGN.
          In  type  2  AGN, the torus is seen roughly edge-on, leading to
          obscuration  of  the  central  radiation  source and a silicate
          absorption  feature  near  10 micron. While most of the current
          torus  models  distribute  the  dust smoothly, there is growing
          evidence  that the dust must be arranged in clouds. We describe
          a  new  method  for modeling near- and mid-infrared emission of
          3-dimensional  clumpy  tori  using  Monte Carlo simulations. We
          calculate  the radiation fields of individual clouds at various
          distances  from  the AGN and distribute these clouds within the
          torus region. The properties of the individual clouds and their
          distribution within the torus are determined from a theoretical
          approach of self-gravitating clouds close to the shear limit in
          a  gravitational  potential.  We demonstrate that clumpiness in
          AGN  tori  can overcome the problem of over-pronounced silicate
          features.  Finally,  we  present  model  calculations  for  the
          prototypical  Seyfert  2  galaxy  NGC  1068 and compare them to
          recent  high-resolution  measurements.  Our  model  is  able to
          reproduce  both the SED and the interferometric observations of
          NGC 1068 in the near- and mid-infrared.

          Cosmological   hydrodynamic   simulations   have  significantly
          improved over the past several years, and we have already shown
          that  the observed properties of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at
          z=3  can  be  explained  well  by  the  massive galaxies in the
          simulations.  Here  we extend our study to z=6 and show that we
          obtain  good  agreement  for  the LBGs at the bright-end of the
          luminosity function (LF). Our simulations also suggest that the
          cosmic  star  formation  rate density has a peak at z= 5-6, and
          that  the  current LBG surveys at z=6 are missing a significant
          number  of  faint  galaxies  that  are  dimmer than the current
          magnitude   limit.  Together,  our  results  suggest  that  the
          universe  could  be  reionized  at  z=6  by the Pop II stars in
          ordinary  galaxies.  We  also  estimate  the  LF of Lyman-alpha
          emitters  (LAEs)  at z=6 by relating the star formation rate in
          the  simulation  to  the  Ly-alpha luminosity. We find that the
          simulated  LAE  LFs  agree with the observed data provided that
          the  net  escape fraction of Ly-alpha photon is f_{Ly-alpha} <=
          0.1. We investigate two possible scenarios for this effect: (1)
          all  sources in the simulation are uniformly dimmer by a factor
          of 10 through attenuation, and (2) one out of ten LAEs randomly
          lights  up  at  a  given  moment.  We show that the correlation
          strength   of   the   LAE  spatial  distribution  can  possibly
          distinguish the two scenarios.

          Title: X-Ray Flares from Postmerger Millisecond Pulsars

          Journal-ref: Science, 311 (2006) 1127-1129
          Recent  observations support the suggestion that short-duration
          gamma-ray  bursts  are  produced  by  compact star mergers. The
          X-ray flares discovered in two short gamma-ray bursts last much
          longer  than  the previously proposed postmerger energy release
          time  scales.  Here  we  show  that  they  can  be  produced by
          differentially  rotating, millisecond pulsars after the mergers
          of  binary  neutron  stars.  The differential rotation leads to
          windup  of  interior poloidal magnetic fields and the resulting
          toroidal fields are strong enough to float up and break through
          the  stellar  surface.  Magnetic reconnection--driven explosive
          events  then  occur,  leading  to multiple X-ray flares minutes
          after the original gamma-ray burst.

          In  order  to probe the activity of the inner disk flow and its
          effect  on  the  neutron star surface emissions, we carried out
          the  timing  analysis of the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
          observations  of  the  millisecond X-ray pulsar XTE J1807--294,
          focusing  on  its  correlated  behaviors  in X-ray intensities,
          hardness  ratios, pulse profiles and power density spectra. The
          source  was observed to have a serial of broad "puny" flares on
          a  timescale of hours to days on the top of a decaying outburst
          in  March 2003. In the flares, the spectra are softened and the
          pulse   profiles  become  more  sinusoidal.  The  frequency  of
          kilohertz  quasi-periodic  oscillation (kHz QPO) is found to be
          positively related to the X-ray count rate in the flares. These
          features  observed  in the flares could be due to the accreting
          flow  inhomogeneities.  It is noticed that the fractional pulse
          amplitude  increases  with  the flare intensities in a range of
          $\sim   2%-14%$,   comparable   to   those   observed   in  the
          thermonuclear  bursts  of  the  millisecond  X-ray  pulsar  XTE
          J1814--338,  whereas  it  remains  at  about 6.5% in the normal
          state. Such a significant variation of the pulse profile in the
          "puny" flares may reflect the changes of physical parameters in
          the  inner  disk  accretion  region. Furthermore, we noticed an
          overall  positive correlation between the kHz QPO frequency and
          the  fractional  pulse  amplitude,  which  could  be  the first
          evidence  representing  that  the neutron-star surface emission
          properties are very sensitive to the disk flow inhomogeneities.
          This  effect  should  be  cautiously  considered  in  the burst
          oscillation studies.

          density  in  the  Universe  with  the  mass  and accretion rate
          density  evolution  of supermassive black holes, estimated from
          the  hard  X-ray  selected  luminosity  function of quasars and
          active galactic nuclei. We find that on average black hole mass
          must  have  been  higher  at higher redshift for given spheroid
          stellar  mass. Moreover, we find negative redshift evolution of
          the disk/irregulars to spheroid mass ratio. The total accretion
          efficiency   is  constrained  to  be  between  0.06  and  0.12,
          depending  on  the  exact value of the local SMBH mass density,
          and  on  the  critical  accretion  rate below which radiatively
          inefficient accretion may take place.

          We  analyze  the  properties  of VIRGO detector with the aim of
          studying  its  ability  to  search  for  coalescing  black hole
          binaries. We focus on the remnants of the Population III stars,
          which  currently  should be massive black holes ($\sim 100-1000
          M_\odot$),   some   of   them  bound  in  binary  systems.  The
          coalescence  of  such binaries due to emission of gravitational
          waves  may  be currently observable. We use a binary population
          synthesis to model the evolution of Population III binaries. We
          calculate  the  signal  to  noise ratios of gravitational waves
          emitted  by  the  system  in  each  of  the  coalescence phase:
          inspiral,  merger and ringdown, and provide simple formulae for
          the  signal  to  noise  ratio  as  a  function of masses of the
          binaries.  We  estimate  the  detection  rates  for  the  VIRGO
          interferometer and also compare them with the estimates for the
          current LIGO. We show that these expected rates are similar to,
          or   larger  than  the  expected  rates  from  coalescences  of
          Population I and II compact object binaries.

          CONTEXT.    Observational    follow-up   programmes   for   the

          the  construction of clean samples of such sources in which the

          candidates  in  the Colbert & Ptak (2002) catalogue and compare

          identifications.
          METHODS.  We  use  statistics based on known densities of X-ray
          sources  and  AGN/QSOs selected in the optical. The analysis is
          done   individually   for  each  parent  galaxy.  The  existing
          identifications  of  the optical counterparts are compiled from
          the literature.
          RESULTS.  More  than  a  half  of  the  ULXs,  within twice the
          distance  of  the  major axis of the 25 mag/arcsec$^2$ isophote
          from RC3 nearby galaxies and with X-ray luminosities $L_X$[2-10
          keV]  $\ge  10^{39}$  erg/s,  are  expected to be high redshift
          background  QSOs. A list of 25 objects (clean sample) confirmed
          to  be  real  ULXs  or  to  have  a  low  probability  of being
          contaminant foreground/background objects is provided.

          Title: Pluto's moon system: survey of the phase space I
          Authors: I. Nagy, A. Suli, B. Erdi
          Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures
          The  stability  of  the  space  around Pluto--Charon system was
          studied.  This  system  has  the  largest mass parameter in our
          solarsystem.  In  the  year 2005 two small satellite were found
          around  Pluto, which move so-called P-type orbit. In this paper
          the  stability  of the P-type orbits are investigated including
          the  two  new satellites, S/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2. We point out
          that   the  likelihood  of  the  two  satellite  were  captured
          gravitationally  is  very  small.  Additionally, the large mass
          parameter allow the satellites regard a model of a new class of
          exoplanets, which orbit around binary stellar.

          Title:  The  relation  between  accretion rate and jet power in
          X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies

          (IoA, Cambridge), G.B. Taylor (UNM), C.S. Reynolds (UMD)
          Comments:  Submitted  for  publication  in MNRAS (Jan 2006). 10
          pages, 5 figures
          Using  Chandra  X-ray  observations of 9 nearby, X-ray luminous
          ellipticals with good optical velocity dispersion measurements,
          we  show  that  a  tight  correlation  exists between the Bondi
          accretion  rates  calculated  from the X-ray data and estimated
          black hole masses, and the power emerging from these systems in
          relativistic  jets.  The jet powers, inferred from the energies
          and timescales required to inflate the cavities observed in the
          surrounding X-ray emitting gas, can be related to the accretion
          rates   by   a   power   law   model.  A  significant  fraction
          (2.4^{+1.0}_{-0.7}  per  cent,  for P_jet=10^{43} erg/s) of the
          energy  associated  with the rest mass of material entering the
          accretion   radius  emerges  in  the  jets.  Our  results  have
          significant   implications   for   studies  of  accretion,  jet
          formation  and  galaxy formation. The tight correlation between
          P_Bondi  and  P_jet  suggests that the Bondi formulae provide a
          reasonable  description  of  the accretion process, despite the
          likely  presence  of  magnetic pressure and angular momentum in
          the   accreting   gas,   and   that  the  accretion  flows  are
          approximately  stable  over  timescales of a few million years.
          Our  results  show that the black hole engines at the hearts of
          large  elliptical  galaxies  and  groups  feed  back sufficient
          energy to stem cooling and star formation, leading naturally to
          the  observed  exponential  cut  off  at  the bright end of the
          galaxy luminosity function.

          accepted
          We  present  4-7 ks Chandra observations of 35 Broad Absorption
          Line  (BAL)  quasars  from  the Large Bright Quasar Survey, the
          largest  sample of sensitive, 0.5-8.0 keV X-ray observations of
          this  class  of  quasars  to  date.  The limited ranges in both
          redshift  (z=1.42-2.90)  and UV luminosity (a factor of ~12) of
          the  sample  also make it relatively uniform. Of 35 targets, 27
          are  detected  for  a detection fraction of 77%, and we confirm
          previous  studies  that  find BAL quasars to be generally X-ray
          weak. Five of the eight non-detections are known low-ionization
          BAL  quasars,  confirming  reports of extreme X-ray weakness in
          this subset (~10% of optically selected BAL quasars). Those BAL
          quasars  with  the  hardest  X-ray  spectra  are also the X-ray
          weakest,  consistent  with  the  interpretation  that intrinsic
          absorption is the primary cause of X-ray weakness in this class
          of  quasars  as a whole. Furthermore, the observed trend is not
          consistent  with simple neutral absorption, supporting findings
          from  spectroscopic observations of individual targets that BAL
          quasars  typically  exhibit  complex  X-ray  absorption  (e.g.,
          partially    covering    or   ionized   absorbers).   In   sum,
          high-ionization BAL quasars are typically neither intrinsically
          X-ray   weak  nor  suffer  from  Compton-thick  absorption.  In
          general,  we  find  no  evidence for correlations between X-ray
          weakness  and UV absorption-line properties, with the exception
          of a likely correlation between the maximum outflow velocity of
          CIV  absorption and the magnitude of X-ray weakness. We discuss
          the  implications  of  our  results for disk-wind models of BAL
          outflows in quasars. (abridged)

          Pulsar 4U~0114+65 with ASCA
          Authors: U. Mukherjee, B. Paul
          Comments: 14 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables. Accepted in Journal
          of Astrophysics and Astronomy
          Here we report the spectral characteristics of the high and low
          states  of  the pulsar 4U~0114+65 and examine the change in the
          parameters   of   the   spectral  model.  A  power  law  and  a
          photoelectric  absorption  by  material along the line of sight
          together  with  a  high  energy cut-off suffice to describe the
          continuum spectrum in both the states. A fluorescence iron line
          at  $\sim$6.4  keV is present in the high as well as in the low
          state,  though  it  is  less  intense in the latter. The photon
          index,  cut-off  energy and e-folding energy values hardly show
          any  discernible  change  over  the  states.  We  compare these
          spectral  characteristics  as  observed  with ASCA to that with
          other  satellites. We also compare the spectral characteristics
          of  4U~0114+650  with  other X-ray sources which show intensity
          variation at different time scales.

          We  have  investigated  the  Quasi  Periodic  Oscillation (QPO)
          properties   of   the  transient  accreting  X-ray  pulsar  XTE
          J1858+034   during  the  second  outburst  of  this  source  in
          April-May  2004.  We  have  used  observations  made  with  the
          Proportional  Counter  Array  (PCA)  of  the Rossi X-ray Timing
          Explorer  (RXTE)  during May 14-18 2004, in the declining phase
          of the outburst. We detected the presence of low frequency QPOs
          in  the  frequency  range  of  140--185 mHz in all the RXTE-PCA
          observations.  We  report  evolution of the QPO parameters with
          the  time,  X-ray  flux,  and  X-ray  photon  energy.  Though a
          correlation   between   the  QPO  centroid  frequency  and  the
          instantaneous  X-ray  flux  is not very clear from the data, we
          point out that the QPO frequency and the one day averaged X-ray
          flux  decreased  with  time  during these observations. We have
          obtained  a clear energy dependence of the RMS variation in the
          QPOs,  increasing  from  about 3% at 3 keV to 6% at 25 keV. The
          X-ray  pulse  profile is a single peaked sinusoidal, with pulse
          fraction  increasing  from  20%  at  3 keV to 45% at 30 keV. We
          found  that,  similar  to  the  previous  outburst,  the energy
          spectrum  is  well  fitted with a model consisting of a cut-off
          power law along with an iron emission line.

          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          We  present  surface  spot  maps of the K2V primary star in the
          pre-cataclysmic variable binary system, V471 Tau. The spot maps
          show  the  presence of large high latitude spots located at the
          sub-white  dwarf  longitude  region.  By  tracking the relative
          movement  of  spot groups over the course of four nights (eight
          rotation  cycles), we measure the surface differential rotation
          rate of the system.Our results reveal that the star is rotating
          rigidly  with  a surface shear rate, dOmega = 1.6 +/- 6 mrad/d.
          The  single  active  star  AB  Dor has a similar spectral type,
          rotation  period,  and activity level as the K star in V471 Tau
          but  displays  much  stronger  surface  shear (46 < dOmega < 58
          mrad/d).  Our  results  suggest  that tidal locking may inhibit
          differential  rotation;  this  reduced shear, however, does not
          affect the overall magnetic activity levels in active K dwarfs.

          Title:  Suppressing  cluster  cooling  flows  by  multiple  AGN
          activity
          Authors: Adi Nusser, Joseph Silk, Arif Babul
          We apply a spherically symmetric one-dimensional hydrodynamical
          code  to study the heating of the inter-cluster medium (ICM) by
          AGN  activity  in cluster galaxies. The AGNs drive bubbles into
          the   ICM   and   the   resulting  heating  is  assumed  to  be
          self-regulating. Bubbles affect the ICM in three distinct ways.
          Firstly,  immediately  after  injection, bubbles expand in situ
          until they reach pressure equilibrium with the ICM. During this
          expansion, they heat the ICM by means of weak shocks. Secondly,
          buoyancy  is  resisted  by  viscous or turbulent drag which can
          also heat the ICM. Thirdly and less importantly, as the bubbles
          rise  by  buoyancy,  they  expand  and  do adiabatic work which
          shortens  the  cooling  time in the ICM. The resulting feedback
          adds  considerably  to  previous estimates of mechanical energy
          input  based  only  on  the  observed thermal energy content of
          x-ray cavities, and suffices to suppress cluster cooling flows.
          Our  self-regulating  scenario  predicts  that  there should be
          enhanced  AGN  activity  of  galaxies  inside  cooling  regions
          compared  to  galaxies  in the outer parts of the cluster. This
          prediction remains to be confirmed or refuted by observations.

          Magnetosphere

          Comments: 35 pages, 18 b/w figures, submitted to ApJ, Corrected
          in v2: Incorrect Greek letters in figure labels fixed
          We  study  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) standing shocks in ingoing
          plasmas   in   a   black  hole  (BH)  magnetosphere.  Fast  and
          intermediate  shock  formation is explored in Kerr geometry. We
          find  that  low  or  high latitude standing MHD shocks are both
          possible,  creating  a  very  hot  plasma region near the event
          horizon. Shocked downstream plasmas become substantially hot or
          magnetized  depending  on model parameters. We also investigate
          the  effects  of the poloidal magnetic field and the BH spin on
          the  properties  of  shocks  and  show  that  both  effects can
          significantly  affect  the  characteristics  of  MHD  shocks. A
          speculation  for  a  possible  connection between the global BH
          magnetosphere  and  the  resulting  shocks  is presented in the
          framework  of  a  simple disk-corona model. MHD shock formation
          can  be  a  plausible mechanism for high energy radiation which
          illuminates  the  underlying  accretion  disk, relevant for the
          cause  of  the  observed iron fluorescence in accretion-powered
          active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

          In   this  paper  we  present  the  first  results  of  a  deep
          spectroscopic  survey of faint quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky
          Survey  (SDSS)  Southern  Survey,  a deep survey carried out by
          repeatedly  imaging  a  270  deg^2 area. Quasar candidates were
          selected  from the deep data with good completeness over 0<z<5,
          and  2  to  3  magnitudes  fainter  than  the SDSS main survey.
          Spectroscopic  follow-up  was  carried out on the 6.5m MMT with
          Hectospec.  The  preliminary  sample  of this SDSS faint quasar
          survey  (hereafter  SFQS)  covers  ~  3.9  deg^2,  contains 414
          quasars,  and  reaches g=22.5. The overall selection efficiency
          is  ~  66%  (~  80%  at  g<21.5);  the  efficiency  in the most
          difficult redshift range (2<z<3) is better than 40%. We use the
          1/V_{a}  method  to  derive  a  binned  estimate  of the quasar
          luminosity  function  (QLF)  and  model  the  QLF using maximum
          likelihood  analysis.  The  best  model  fits  confirm previous
          results showing that the QLF has steep slopes at the bright end
          and  much flatter slopes (-1.25 at z<2.0 and -1.55 at z>2.0) at
          the  faint  end,  indicating  a break in the QLF slope. Using a
          luminosity-dependent  density evolution model, we find that the
          quasar  density  at M_{g}<-22.5 peaks at z~2, which is later in
          cosmic  time  than the peak of z~2.5 found from surveys of more
          luminous  objects.  The SFQS QLF is consistent with the results
          of  the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey, the SDSS, and the 2dF-SDSS LRG
          and  QSO  Survey, but probes fainter quasars. We plan to obtain
          more  quasars from future observations and establish a complete
          faint quasar sample with more than 1000 objects over 10 deg^2.

          We   cross-correlated   the   Chandra  XASSIST  and  XMM-Newton
          Serendipitous  Source Catalogues with the 2 degree Field Galaxy
          Redshift  Survey (2dfGRS) database. Our aim was to identify the
          most X-ray luminous (L_X > 10^42 erg s^-1) examples of galaxies
          in  the  local  Universe  whose  X-ray emission is dominated by
          stellar  processes rather than AGN activity ('normal' galaxies)
          as  well  as  to test the empirical criterion log(f_X/f_O) < -2
          for  separating  AGN  from  NGs.  With  XMM-Newton (Chandra) we
          covered  an  area  of  ~8.2 (~5.8)deg^2 down to a flux limit of
          ~10^-15 (~1.6 x 10^-15) erg cm^-2 s^-1 and found 18 (20) 2dfGRS
          galaxies. Using emission-line intensity ratios, we classified 6
          2dfGRS  spectra  as star-forming, H II nuclei, and 2 spectra as
          possible   H   II   nuclei.   The   rest  of  the  objects  are
          absorption-line  galaxies and AGN, including 3 possible LINERs.
          No  luminous  'normal'  galaxies  have been found but out of 19
          'normal'  galaxies  in this sample 5 H II and 3 absorption-line
          galaxies  have log(f_X/f_O) > -2. We performed a similar search
          in  two  nearby-galaxy  samples  from  the  literature.  All 44
          galaxies  in the Zezas (2001) sample have log(f_X/f_O) < -2 and
          L_X < 10^42 erg s^-1. In the Fabbiano et al. (1992) sample, out
          of  a total of 170 'normal' galaxies, we found 16 galaxies with
          log(f_X/f_O)   >-2,   the   majority   of   which  are  massive
          ellipticals. Three of these have L_X > 10^42 erg s^-1 .

          Authors: L J Hadfield, P A Crowther (Sheffield)
          Comments: 12 pages, 8 figures, accepted for MNRAS
          We  reinvestigate the massive stellar content of NGC3125 (Tol3)
          using   VLT/FORS1   imaging   &   spectroscopy,  plus  archival
          VLT/ISAAC,  HST/FOC  and HST/STIS datasets. Narrow-band imaging
          confirms  that  A  and  B  knots represent the primary sites of
          Wolf-Rayet  (WR)  stars,  whilst  HST imaging reveals that both
          regions  host multiple clusters. Clusters A1 + A2 within region
          A  host  WR  stars.  altough  is not clear which cluster within
          region  B  hosts WR stars. Nebular properties infer an LMC-like
          metallicity.  LMC  template  WN5-6 & WC4 spectra are matched to
          the  observed  optical  WR  bumps  of  A1 and B, permitting the
          contribution  of WC stars to the blue bump to be quantified. We
          obtain N(WN5-6:WC4)=105:20, 55:0, 40:20 for clusters A1, A2 and
          B1+B2, a factor of 3 lower than optical studies, as a result of
          a  lower  E(B-V).  Using  Starburst99 models to estimate O star
          populations for individual clusters, we find N(WR)/N(O)=0.2 for
          A1  and  0.1  for A2 and B1+B2. From Halpha imaging, the O star
          content  of  the  Giant  HII  regions  A and B is found to be a
          factor of 5-10 times higher than that derived spectroscopically
          for  the  UV/optically bright clusters, suggesting that NGC3125
          hosts   optically  obscured  young  massive  clusters,  further
          supported  by  VLT/ISAAC  K  band imaging. Archival HST/STIS UV
          spectroscopy  confirms  the low E(B-V) towards A1, for which we
          have  determined an SMC extinction law, in preference to an LMC
          or  starburst  law.  We  obtain N(WN5-6)=110 from the slit-loss
          corrected  HeII  1640  line  flux,  in excellent agreement with
          optical  result.  However,  this  is a factor of 35 times lower
          than  that inferred from the same dataset by Chandar et al. due
          to  their  use of a starburst extinction law. Highly discrepant
          stellar  populations  may  result  in  spatially  resolved star
          forming  regions  from  UV  and  optical studies through use of
          different extinction laws.

          Title: Where are the ``Missing'' Galactic Baryons?
          Authors:  Jesper  Sommer-Larsen  (Dark  Cosmology  Centre, NBI,
          Univ. of Copenhagen)
          Comments:  4  Pages,  4 Figures, Submitted to ApJL, Printing in
          colour recommended
          Based   on   19   high-resolution  N-body/gas-dynamical  galaxy
          formation  simulations  in the LCDM cosmology it is shown, that
          for  a  galaxy  like the Milky Way, in addition to the baryonic
          mass of the galaxy itself, about 70% extra baryonic mass should
          reside around the galaxy (inside of the virial radius), chiefly
          in  the form of hot gas. Averaging over the entire field galaxy
          population,  this  ``external''  component amounts to 64-85% of
          the  baryonic  mass of the population itself. These results are
          supported  by the recent detection of very extended, soft X-ray
          emission  from  the  halo of the quiescent, massive disk galaxy
          NGC 5746.
          Some of the hot gas may, by thermal instability, have condensed
          into  mainly  pressure  supported,  warm clouds, similar to the
          Galactic  High  Velocity  Clouds (HVCs). Based on an ultra-high
          resolution  cosmological  test  simulation  of a Milky Way like
          galaxy  (with  a gas particle mass and gravity softening length
          of  only  7600  h^-1  Msun  and 83 h^-1 pc,respectively), it is
          argued,  that  the  hot  gas  phase dominates over the warm gas
          phase, in the halo. Finally, an origin of HVCs as ``leftovers''
          from  filamentary,  ``cold'' accretion events, mainly occurring
          early in the history of galaxies, is proposed.

          Although  the  environments  of  star  and planet formation are
          thermodynamically  cold, substantial X-ray emission from 10-100
          MK  plasmas  is  present.  In low mass pre-main sequence stars,
          X-rays are produced by violent magnetic reconnection flares. In
          high  mass  O  stars,  they are produced by wind shocks on both
          stellar  and  parsec scales. The recent Chandra Orion Ultradeep
          Project,  XMM-Newton  Extended  Survey  of  Taurus, and Chandra
          studies of more distant high-mass star forming regions reveal a
          wealth  of  X-ray  phenomenology and astrophysics. X-ray flares
          mostly  resemble  solar-like  magnetic activity from multipolar
          surface  fields,  although  extreme  flares  may arise in field
          lines  extending  to the protoplanetary disk. Accretion plays a
          secondary  role.  Fluorescent iron line emission and absorption
          in  inclined  disks  demonstrate  that  X-rays  can efficiently
          illuminate disk material. The consequent ionization of disk gas
          and irradiation of disk solids addresses a variety of important
          astrophysical  issues  of  disk dynamics, planet formation, and
          meteoritics.   New   observations   of   massive  star  forming
          environments  such  as  M  17, the Carina Nebula and 30 Doradus
          show   remarkably  complex  X-ray  morphologies  including  the
          low-mass  stellar  population, diffuse X-ray flows from blister
          HII regions, and inhomogeneous superbubbles. X-ray astronomy is
          thus  providing qualitatively new insights into star and planet
          formation.

          outskirts of M31

          Comments: 8 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  present  evidence for a metal-poor, [Fe/H] ~ -1.4pm0.2 dex,
          stellar component detectable at radii from 10 kpc to 70 kpc, in
          our  nearest  giant spiral neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. This
          metal-poor  sample  underlies  the recently-discovered extended
          rotating  component,  and has no detected metallicity gradient.
          This discovery uses a large sample of 9776 radial velocities of
          Red   Giant  Branch  (RGB)  stars  obtained  with  the  Keck-II
          telescope  and  DEIMOS  spectrograph,  with  827 stars isolated
          kinematically to lie in the spheroid component by windowing out
          the extended rotating component which dominates the photometric
          profile  of  Andromeda out to >50 kpc (de-projected). The stars
          lie  in  54 spectroscopic fields spread over an 8 square degree
          region,  and  are  expected  to  fairly sample the stellar halo
          region  to  a  radius  of >70 kpc. The spheroid sample shows no
          significant  evidence  for  rotation. Fitting a simple model in
          which  the  velocity dispersion of the component decreases with
          radius,  we  find  a  central  velocity  dispersion  of 152 kms
          decreasing    by    -0.90    km/s    kpc.    By    fitting    a
          cosmologically-motivated  NFW  halo model to the spheroid stars
          we  constrain  the  virial  mass  of M31 to be greater than 9.0
          x10^11 solar masses with 99% confidence. The properties of this
          halo component are very similar to that found in our Milky Way,
          revealing  that  these roughly equal mass galaxies may have led
          similar accretion and evolutionary paths in the early Universe.

          The  emission from individual X-ray sources in the Chandra Deep
          Fields  and  XMM-Newton  Lockman Hole shows that almost half of
          the hard X-ray background above 6 keV is unresolved and implies
          the  existence  of  a  missing  population  of heavily obscured
          active  galactic  nuclei  (AGN).  We have stacked the 0.5-8 keV
          X-ray  emission from optical sources in the Great Observatories
          Origins  Deep  Survey  (GOODS;  which  covers  the Chandra Deep
          Fields)   to   determine  whether  these  galaxies,  which  are
          individually undetected in X-rays, are hosting the hypothesised
          missing  AGN.  In the 0.5-6 keV energy range the stacked-source
          emission  corresponds  to  the  remaining 10-20 per cent of the
          total  background -- the fraction that has not been resolved by
          Chandra.  The  spectrum  of  the stacked emission is consistent
          with  starburst  activity  or weak AGN emission. In the 6-8 keV
          band,  we find that upper limits to the stacked X-ray intensity
          from the GOODS galaxies are consistent with the ~40 per cent of
          the  total  background  that  remains  unresolved,  but further
          selection  refinement is required to identify the X-ray sources
          and confirm their contribution.

          Title:  Spectrum  of  Cosmic  Microwave  Fluctuations  and  the
          Formation of Galaxies in a Modified Gravity Theory
          Authors: J. W. Moffat
          Comments: 23 pages, 1 figure, latex file
          A  modified  gravity  (MOG)  possesses  a light, neutral vector
          particle  called  a  ``phion''  associated  with a vector field
          $\phi^\mu$,   which   forms   a  cold  fluid  of  Bose-Einstein
          condensates  before  recombination  with zero pressure and zero
          shear  viscosity.  The  energy  density  associated  with  this
          Bose-Einstein  condensate  fluid  dominates  the energy density
          before   recombination   and   produces  a  density  parameter,
          $\Omega_\phi\sim 0.3$, that together with the fractional baryon
          density   $\Omega_b\sim  0.04$,  and  a  cosmological  constant
          parameter $\Omega_\Lambda\sim 0.7$ yields an approximate fit to
          the  data  for  the  acoustical  oscillations  in the CMB power
          spectrum.  The  quantum phion condensate fluid is abundant well
          before  recombination  and  can  clump  and form the primordial
          structure   for  galaxies.  At  late  times  in  the  expanding
          universe,  in  local  bound  systems  such as galaxies ordinary
          baryonic  matter  dominates  the  matter  density. For galactic
          systems   in   the   present   epoch,  the  modified  Newtonian
          acceleration  law  determined  by  MOG  describes  well  galaxy
          rotation curve data and X-ray cluster mass profile data.

          Title:  Pulsar  Wind Nebulae and the Non-thermal X-Ray Emission
          of Millisecond Pulsars
          Authors: K. S. Cheng, Ronald E. Taam, W. Wang
          Comments: To be appeared in ApJ April 2006
          The   non-thermal,   non-pulsed   X-ray  emission  of  MSPs  is
          investigated.  As  in  young  pulsars, MSPs emit a relativistic
          wind,  which  interacting with the interstellar medium and/or a
          binary companion can significantly contribute to the non-pulsed
          emission  of  these  pulsars. An application and extension of a
          simple  model developed for young pulsars is applied to the old
          recycled  MSP  B1957+20.  It is found that the pulsar wind can,
          indeed,  contribute  to  both the resolved and unresolved X-ray
          emission.  For  other  MSP  in  the  Galactic  field  where the
          spectral  index  of  the non-pulsed component has been measured
          (i.e., PSR B1937+21, J0218+4232) the contribution of the pulsar
          wind  to  the non-pulsed X-ray luminosity is estimated. For the
          MSPs  in the core regions of globular clusters, the pulsar wind
          nebula  is  likely  affected  by its interaction with the dense
          stellar   environment,   possibly   leading   to  a  diminished
          contribution  to  the  total  X-ray emission. In this case, the
          existence  of  non-thermal  non-pulsed  X-ray  emission is more
          likely  for  binary rather than isolated MSPs with the emission
          arising  from  the  interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind
          with   a   binary   companion.  Our  study  suggests  that  the
          magnetization  parameter  in the pulsar wind nebulae of MSPs is
          significantly  larger  than  that of the Crab nebula by about a
          factor  of 10. The emission from MSPs moving at high velocities
          may  appear  spatially  extended  with  a tail-like morphology,
          which  may  contribute  to  the  faint filamentary X-ray source
          subpopulation in the Galaxy.

          in Astrophysical Journal Letters
          We  analyze  26  Luminous  Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) in the
          HST/ACS  Ultra  Deep  Field  (UDF) at z ~ 0.2-1.3, to determine
          whether  these  are  truly  small  galaxies,  or  rather bright
          central  starbursts  within  existing  or  forming  large  disk
          galaxies.  Surface  brightness  profiles  from UDF images reach
          fainter  than  rest-frame  26.5 B mag/arcsec^2 even for compact
          objects  at  z~1. Most LCBGs show a smaller, brighter component
          that   is   likely   star-forming,  and  an  extended,  roughly
          exponential  component  with  colors suggesting stellar ages >~
          100  Myr  to  few Gyr. Scale lengths of the extended components
          are  mostly >~ 2 kpc, >1.5-2 times smaller than those of nearby
          large  disk  galaxies  like  the  Milky  Way.  Larger, very low
          surface   brightness  disks  can  be  excluded  down  to  faint
          rest-frame   surface   brightnesses  (>~  26  B  mag/arcsec^2).
          However, 1 or 2 of the LCBGs are large, disk-like galaxies that
          meet  LCBG  selection criteria due to a bright central nucleus,
          possibly a forming bulge. These results indicate that >~ 90% of
          high-z  LCBGs  are  small  galaxies that will evolve into small
          disk galaxies, and low mass spheroidal or irregular galaxies in
          the   local   Universe,   assuming  passive  evolution  and  no
          significant  disk  growth. The data do not reveal signs of disk
          formation  around  small,  HII-galaxy-like  LCBGs,  and  do not
          suggest  a  simple  inside-out growth scenario for larger LCBGs
          with a disk-like morphology. Irregular blue emission in distant
          LCBGs  is relatively extended, suggesting that nebular emission
          lines  from  star-forming regions sample a major fraction of an
          LCBG's velocity field.

          We  present  the  properties of Ly Alpha emitters (LAEs) at z =
          5.7  in  the  Subaru Deep Field. A photometric sample of 89 LAE
          candidates is constructed from narrow-band (NB816) data down to
          NB816 = 26.0 (AB) in a continuous 725 arcmin^2 area. Spectra of
          39  objects  satisfying  the photometric selection criteria for
          LAEs  were  obtained  with Subaru and Keck II Telescopes, among
          which  28  were  confirmed  LAEs,  one was a nearby galaxy, and
          eight were unclassified. We also obtained spectra of another 24
          NB816-excess  objects  in the field, identifying six additional
          LAEs.  We  find  that  the Ly Alpha luminosity function derived
          from  the  photometric sample is reproduced well by a Schechter
          function  with  L*  =  (7.9+3.0-2.2)  x  10^42 erg/s and phi* =
          (6.3+3.0-2.0)  x 10^-4 Mpc^-3 for alpha = -1.5 (fixed) over the
          whole luminosity range of L ~= 3x10^42 - 3x10^43 erg/s. We then
          measure  rest-frame  Ly  Alpha  equivalent widths (EWs) for the
          confirmed  LAEs,  to  find that the median among the 28 objects
          satisfying the photometric selection criteria is W_0^i = 233 A.
          We  infer that 30% - 40% of LAEs at z=5.7 exceed W_0^i = 240 A.
          These  large-EW  objects  probably  cannot  be accounted for by
          ordinary  star-forming populations with a Salpeter IMF. We also
          find  that  LAEs  with  fainter far-UV luminosities have larger
          EWs.  Finally, we derive the far-UV luminosity function of LAEs
          down to M_UV ~= -19.6 using the photometric sample, and compare
          it  with  that  of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). We find that as
          high  as  about  80%  of  LBGs at z ~ 6 have W_0^i >= 100 A, in
          sharp contrast to lower-z counterparts.

          Comments: A&A in press, 16 pages including tables, 5 figures
          The  aim  of this paper is to provide a measurement of the mass
          accretion  rate  in  a large, complete sample of objects in the
          core  of  the  star forming region Rho-Oph. The sample includes
          most  of  the  objects  (104  out  of  111)  with evidence of a
          circumstellar  disk  from  mid-infrared photometry; it covers a
          stellar mass range from about 0.03 to 3 Msun and it is complete
          to  a limiting mass of ~0.05 Msun. We used J and K-band spectra
          to  derive  the  mass  accretion  rate  of each object from the
          intensity  of the hydrogen recombination lines, Pab or Brg. For
          comparison,  we  also  obtained  similar spectra of 35 diskless
          objects.  The results show that emission in these lines is only
          seen  in  stars  with disks, and can be used as an indicator of
          accretion. However, the converse does not hold, as about 50% of
          our  disk  objects  do  not  have detectable line emission. The
          measured  accretion  rates  show  a strong correlation with the
          mass  of the central object (Macc ~ Mstar^1.8+-0.2) and a large
          spread,  of  two orders of magnitude at least, for any interval
          of Mstar. A comparison with existing data for Taurus shows that
          the objects in the two regions have similar behaviour, at least
          for  objects  more  massive  than ~0.1Msun. The implications of
          these results are briefly discussed.

          Title:  Models of the Structure and Evolution of Protoplanetary
          Disks
          Authors: C.P. Dullemond, D. Hollenbach, I. Kamp, P. D'Alessio
          Comments: Review chapter in "Protostars and Planets V"
          We  review  advances  in  the modeling of protoplanetary disks.
          This  review  will  focus on the regions of the disk beyond the
          dust  sublimation  radius, i.e. beyond 0.1 - 1 AU, depending on
          the stellar luminosity. We will be mostly concerned with models
          that aim to fit spectra of the dust continuum or gas lines, and
          derive physical parameters from these fits. For optically thick
          disks,  these parameters include the accretion rate through the
          disk  onto  the  star,  the  geometry  of  the  disk,  the dust
          properties,  the  surface  chemistry and the thermal balance of
          the  gas. For the latter we are mostly concerned with the upper
          layers of the disk, where the gas and dust temperature decouple
          and  a  photoevaporative  flow  may  originate. We also briefly
          discuss  optically  thin disks, focusing mainly on the gas, not
          the  dust.  The  evolution  of  these  disks  is  dominated  by
          accretion,   viscous   spreading,  photoevaporation,  and  dust
          settling and coagulation. The density and temperature structure
          arising  from  the surface layer models provide input to models
          of photoevaporation, which occurs largely in the outer disk. We
          discuss  the consequences of photoevaporation on disk evolution
          and planet formation.

          high resolution images, contact mauron at graal.univ-montp2.fr
          We  report  the  results of an exploratory program to image the
          extended  circumstellar  envelopes  of  asymptotic giant branch
          (AGB)  stars  in  dust-scattered galactic light. The goal is to
          characterize  the morphology of the envelopes as a probe of the
          mass-loss  process. The observations consist of short exposures
          with  the  VLT  and  longer  exposures  with  1-2m  telescopes,
          augmented with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope.
          We  observed  12  AGB  stars  and  detected  the  circumstellar
          envelopes  in  7.  The  detected envelopes have mass loss rates
          more  than  about  5 10E-6 solar mass per year, and they can be
          seen  out to distances of about 1 kpc. The observations provide
          information on the mass loss history on time scales up to about
          10,000   years.  For  the  five  AGB  envelopes  in  which  the
          circumstellar  geometry  is  well determined by scattered light
          observations,  all  except  one  (OH348.2-19.7) show deviations
          from  spherical  symmetry.  Two  (IRC+10216 and IRC+10011) show
          roughly  spherical  envelopes  at  large radii but asymmetry or
          bipolarity  close  to  the  star;  one  (AFGL  2514)  shows  an
          extended,  elliptical  envelope,  and  one  (AFGL 3068) shows a
          spiral pattern. The non-spherical structures are all consistent
          with  the  effects of binary interactions. Our observations are
          in  accord  with  a  scenario in which binary companions play a
          role   in   shaping   planetary  nebulae,  and  show  that  the
          circumstellar  gas  is already partly shaped on the AGB, before
          evolution to the proto-planetary nebula phase.

          Comments:  10  pages,  5  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          In  this Paper we report on our analysis of a ~25 ksec. Chandra
          X-ray  observation  of  the  neutron  star soft X-ray transient
          (SXT)  1H1905+000  in  quiescence.  Furthermore, we discuss our
          findings  of  the  analysis of optical photometric observations
          which  we obtained using the Magellan telescope and photometric
          and spectroscopic observations which we obtained using the Very
          Large Telescope at Paranal. The X-ray counterpart of 1H1905+000
          was  not  detected  in  our  Chandra  data,  with a 95 per cent
          confidence  limit  to the source count rate of 1.2x10^-4 counts
          s^-1.  For different spectral models this yields an upper limit
          on  the luminosity of 1.8x10^31 erg s^-1 (for an upper limit on
          the distance of 10 kpc.) This luminosity limit makes 1H1905+000
          the  faintest  neutron star SXT in quiescence observed to date.
          The neutron star luminosity is so low that it is similar to the
          lowest  luminosities derived for black hole SXTs in quiescence.
          This  low  luminosity  for  a  neutron  star SXT challanges the
          hypothesis  presented in the literature that black hole SXTs in
          quiescence  have lower luminosities than neutron star SXTs as a
          result   of  the  presence  of  a  black  hole  event  horizon.
          Furthermore,  the limit on the neutron star luminosity obtained
          less  than  20  years after the outburst has ceased, constrains
          the  thermal  conductivity  of the neutron star crust. Finally,
          the  neutron  star  core  must  be so cold that unless the time
          averaged  mass  accretion  rate  is  lower  than 2x10^-12 M_sun
          yr^-1,  core  cooling  has  to  proceed  via  enhanced neutrino
          emission  processes.  We  derive a limit on the absolute I-band
          magnitude  of the quiescent counterpart of M_I>7.8 assuming the
          source  is  at 10 kpc. This is in line with 1H1905+000 being an
          ultra-compact  X-ray  binary, as has been proposed based on the
          low outburst V-band absolute magnitude.

          Title: Evolution of supermassive black holes
          Authors: Marta Volonteri
          Comments:  Extended  version  of the invited paper to appear in
          the  Proceedings  of  the Conference "Relativistic Astrophysics
          and Cosmology - Einstein's Legacy"
          Supermassive  black  holes  (SMBHs)  are  nowadays  believed to
          reside  in  most local galaxies, and the available data show an
          empirical  correlation  between  bulge  luminosity - or stellar
          velocity  dispersion - and black hole mass, suggesting a single
          mechanism  for  assembling black holes and forming spheroids in
          galaxy  halos.  The  evidence  is  therefore  in  favour  of  a
          co-evolution between galaxies, black holes and quasars. In cold
          dark  matter  cosmogonies,  small-mass subgalactic systems form
          first to merge later into larger and larger structures. In this
          paradigm  galaxy halos experience multiple mergers during their
          lifetime.  If  every  galaxy  with  a bulge hosts a SMBH in its
          center,  and  a  local  galaxy  has  been  made  up by multiple
          mergers,  then  a  black  hole binary is a natural evolutionary
          stage.  The evolution of the supermassive black hole population
          clearly  has  to  be  investigated taking into account both the
          cosmological framework and the dynamical evolution of SMBHs and
          their  hosts.  The  seeds of SMBHs have to be looked for in the
          early  Universe,  as  very  luminous quasars are detected up to
          redshift  higher  than  z=6. These black holes evolve then in a
          hierarchical  fashion,  following the merger hierarchy of their
          host  halos. Accretion of gas, traced by quasar activity, plays
          a fundamental role in determining the two parameters defining a
          black  hole:  mass and spin. A particularly intriguing epoch is
          the  initial  phase  of  SMBH growth. It is very challenging to
          meet the observational constraints at z=6 if BHs are not fed at
          very high rates in their infancy.

          We  present  the  first results of coordinated multi-wavelength
          observations of the Galactic black hole GX 339-4 in a canonical
          low-hard  state,  obtained during its 2004 outburst. XMM-Newton
          observed  the  source  for  2 revolutions, or approximately 280
          ksec; RXTE monitored the source throughout this long stare. The
          resulting  data  offer  the best view yet obtained of the inner
          accretion flow geometry in the low-hard state, which is thought
          to  be  analogous  to  the  geometry  in  low-luminosity active
          galactic  nuclei.  The  XMM-Newton  spectra  clearly reveal the
          presence of a cool accretion disk component, and a relativistic
          Fe K emission line. The results of fits made to both components
          strongly  suggest  that a standard thin disk remains at or near
          to  the  innermost  stable  circular  orbit, at least in bright
          phases of the low-hard state. These findings indicate that both
          potential  links between the inner disk radius and the onset of
          a  steady  compact jet, and the paradigm of a radially-recessed
          disk  in  the  low-hard  state,  do  not  hold universally. The
          results of our observations can best be explained if a standard
          thin accretion disk fuels a corona which is closely related to,
          or  consistent  with,  the  base  of  a compact jet. In a brief
          examination  of archival data, we show that Cygnus X-1 supports
          this  picture  of  the  low-hard  state. We discuss our results
          within  the  context  of  disk-jet  connections  and prevailing
          models for accretion onto black holes.

          Although  the  environments  of  star  and planet formation are
          thermodynamically  cold, substantial X-ray emission from 10-100
          MK  plasmas  is  present.  In low mass pre-main sequence stars,
          X-rays are produced by violent magnetic reconnection flares. In
          high  mass  O  stars,  they are produced by wind shocks on both
          stellar  and  parsec scales. The recent Chandra Orion Ultradeep
          Project,  XMM-Newton  Extended  Survey  of  Taurus, and Chandra
          studies of more distant high-mass star forming regions reveal a
          wealth  of  X-ray  phenomenology and astrophysics. X-ray flares
          mostly  resemble  solar-like  magnetic activity from multipolar
          surface  fields,  although  extreme  flares  may arise in field
          lines  extending  to the protoplanetary disk. Accretion plays a
          secondary  role.  Fluorescent iron line emission and absorption
          in  inclined  disks  demonstrate  that  X-rays  can efficiently
          illuminate disk material. The consequent ionization of disk gas
          and irradiation of disk solids addresses a variety of important
          astrophysical  issues  of  disk dynamics, planet formation, and
          meteoritics.   New   observations   of   massive  star  forming
          environments  such  as  M  17, the Carina Nebula and 30 Doradus
          show   remarkably  complex  X-ray  morphologies  including  the
          low-mass  stellar  population, diffuse X-ray flows from blister
          HII regions, and inhomogeneous superbubbles. X-ray astronomy is
          thus  providing qualitatively new insights into star and planet
          formation.

          Comments: 8 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  present  evidence for a metal-poor, [Fe/H] ~ -1.4pm0.2 dex,
          stellar component detectable at radii from 10 kpc to 70 kpc, in
          our  nearest  giant spiral neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. This
          metal-poor  sample  underlies  the recently-discovered extended
          rotating  component,  and has no detected metallicity gradient.
          This discovery uses a large sample of 9776 radial velocities of
          Red   Giant  Branch  (RGB)  stars  obtained  with  the  Keck-II
          telescope  and  DEIMOS  spectrograph,  with  827 stars isolated
          kinematically to lie in the spheroid component by windowing out
          the extended rotating component which dominates the photometric
          profile  of  Andromeda out to >50 kpc (de-projected). The stars
          lie  in  54 spectroscopic fields spread over an 8 square degree
          region,  and  are  expected  to  fairly sample the stellar halo
          region  to  a  radius  of >70 kpc. The spheroid sample shows no
          significant  evidence  for  rotation. Fitting a simple model in
          which  the  velocity dispersion of the component decreases with
          radius,  we  find  a  central  velocity  dispersion  of 152 kms
          decreasing    by    -0.90    km/s    kpc.    By    fitting    a
          cosmologically-motivated  NFW  halo model to the spheroid stars
          we  constrain  the  virial  mass  of M31 to be greater than 9.0
          x10^11 solar masses with 99% confidence. The properties of this
          halo component are very similar to that found in our Milky Way,
          revealing  that  these roughly equal mass galaxies may have led
          similar accretion and evolutionary paths in the early Universe.

          The  emission from individual X-ray sources in the Chandra Deep
          Fields  and  XMM-Newton  Lockman Hole shows that almost half of
          the hard X-ray background above 6 keV is unresolved and implies
          the  existence  of  a  missing  population  of heavily obscured
          active  galactic  nuclei  (AGN).  We have stacked the 0.5-8 keV
          X-ray  emission from optical sources in the Great Observatories
          Origins  Deep  Survey  (GOODS;  which  covers  the Chandra Deep
          Fields)   to   determine  whether  these  galaxies,  which  are
          individually undetected in X-rays, are hosting the hypothesised
          missing  AGN.  In the 0.5-6 keV energy range the stacked-source
          emission  corresponds  to  the  remaining 10-20 per cent of the
          total  background -- the fraction that has not been resolved by
          Chandra.  The  spectrum  of  the stacked emission is consistent
          with  starburst  activity  or weak AGN emission. In the 6-8 keV
          band,  we find that upper limits to the stacked X-ray intensity
          from the GOODS galaxies are consistent with the ~40 per cent of
          the  total  background  that  remains  unresolved,  but further
          selection  refinement is required to identify the X-ray sources
          and confirm their contribution.

          Authors: J. W. Moffat
          Comments: 23 pages, 1 figure, latex file
          A  modified  gravity  (MOG)  possesses  a light, neutral vector
          particle  called  a  ``phion''  associated  with a vector field
          $\phi^\mu$,   which   forms   a  cold  fluid  of  Bose-Einstein
          condensates  before  recombination  with zero pressure and zero
          shear  viscosity.  The  energy  density  associated  with  this
          Bose-Einstein  condensate  fluid  dominates  the energy density
          before   recombination   and   produces  a  density  parameter,
          $\Omega_\phi\sim 0.3$, that together with the fractional baryon
          density   $\Omega_b\sim  0.04$,  and  a  cosmological  constant
          parameter $\Omega_\Lambda\sim 0.7$ yields an approximate fit to
          the  data  for  the  acoustical  oscillations  in the CMB power
          spectrum.  The  quantum phion condensate fluid is abundant well
          before  recombination  and  can  clump  and form the primordial
          structure   for  galaxies.  At  late  times  in  the  expanding
          universe,  in  local  bound  systems  such as galaxies ordinary
          baryonic  matter  dominates  the  matter  density. For galactic
          systems   in   the   present   epoch,  the  modified  Newtonian
          acceleration  law  determined  by  MOG  describes  well  galaxy
          rotation curve data and X-ray cluster mass profile data.

          Title:  Pulsar  Wind Nebulae and the Non-thermal X-Ray Emission
          of Millisecond Pulsars
          Authors: K. S. Cheng, Ronald E. Taam, W. Wang
          Comments: To be appeared in ApJ April 2006
          The   non-thermal,   non-pulsed   X-ray  emission  of  MSPs  is
          investigated.  As  in  young  pulsars, MSPs emit a relativistic
          wind,  which  interacting with the interstellar medium and/or a
          binary companion can significantly contribute to the non-pulsed
          emission  of  these  pulsars. An application and extension of a
          simple  model developed for young pulsars is applied to the old
          recycled  MSP  B1957+20.  It is found that the pulsar wind can,
          indeed,  contribute  to  both the resolved and unresolved X-ray
          emission.  For  other  MSP  in  the  Galactic  field  where the
          spectral  index  of  the non-pulsed component has been measured
          (i.e., PSR B1937+21, J0218+4232) the contribution of the pulsar
          wind  to  the non-pulsed X-ray luminosity is estimated. For the
          MSPs  in the core regions of globular clusters, the pulsar wind
          nebula  is  likely  affected  by its interaction with the dense
          stellar   environment,   possibly   leading   to  a  diminished
          contribution  to  the  total  X-ray emission. In this case, the
          existence  of  non-thermal  non-pulsed  X-ray  emission is more
          likely  for  binary rather than isolated MSPs with the emission
          arising  from  the  interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind
          with   a   binary   companion.  Our  study  suggests  that  the
          magnetization  parameter  in the pulsar wind nebulae of MSPs is
          significantly  larger  than  that of the Crab nebula by about a
          factor  of 10. The emission from MSPs moving at high velocities
          may  appear  spatially  extended  with  a tail-like morphology,
          which  may  contribute  to  the  faint filamentary X-ray source
          subpopulation in the Galaxy.

          We  analyze  26  Luminous  Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) in the
          HST/ACS  Ultra  Deep  Field  (UDF) at z ~ 0.2-1.3, to determine
          whether  these  are  truly  small  galaxies,  or  rather bright
          central  starbursts  within  existing  or  forming  large  disk
          galaxies.  Surface  brightness  profiles  from UDF images reach
          fainter  than  rest-frame  26.5 B mag/arcsec^2 even for compact
          objects  at  z~1. Most LCBGs show a smaller, brighter component
          that   is   likely   star-forming,  and  an  extended,  roughly
          exponential  component  with  colors suggesting stellar ages >~
          100  Myr  to  few Gyr. Scale lengths of the extended components
          are  mostly >~ 2 kpc, >1.5-2 times smaller than those of nearby
          large  disk  galaxies  like  the  Milky  Way.  Larger, very low
          surface   brightness  disks  can  be  excluded  down  to  faint
          rest-frame   surface   brightnesses  (>~  26  B  mag/arcsec^2).
          However, 1 or 2 of the LCBGs are large, disk-like galaxies that
          meet  LCBG  selection criteria due to a bright central nucleus,
          possibly a forming bulge. These results indicate that >~ 90% of
          high-z  LCBGs  are  small  galaxies that will evolve into small
          disk galaxies, and low mass spheroidal or irregular galaxies in
          the   local   Universe,   assuming  passive  evolution  and  no
          significant  disk  growth. The data do not reveal signs of disk
          formation  around  small,  HII-galaxy-like  LCBGs,  and  do not
          suggest  a  simple  inside-out growth scenario for larger LCBGs
          with a disk-like morphology. Irregular blue emission in distant
          LCBGs  is relatively extended, suggesting that nebular emission
          lines  from  star-forming regions sample a major fraction of an
          LCBG's velocity field.

          We  present  the  properties of Ly Alpha emitters (LAEs) at z =
          5.7  in  the  Subaru Deep Field. A photometric sample of 89 LAE
          candidates is constructed from narrow-band (NB816) data down to
          NB816 = 26.0 (AB) in a continuous 725 arcmin^2 area. Spectra of
          39  objects  satisfying  the photometric selection criteria for
          LAEs  were  obtained  with Subaru and Keck II Telescopes, among
          which  28  were  confirmed  LAEs,  one was a nearby galaxy, and
          eight were unclassified. We also obtained spectra of another 24
          NB816-excess  objects  in the field, identifying six additional
          LAEs.  We  find  that  the Ly Alpha luminosity function derived
          from  the  photometric sample is reproduced well by a Schechter
          function  with  L*  =  (7.9+3.0-2.2)  x  10^42 erg/s and phi* =
          (6.3+3.0-2.0)  x 10^-4 Mpc^-3 for alpha = -1.5 (fixed) over the
          whole luminosity range of L ~= 3x10^42 - 3x10^43 erg/s. We then
          measure  rest-frame  Ly  Alpha  equivalent widths (EWs) for the
          confirmed  LAEs,  to  find that the median among the 28 objects
          satisfying the photometric selection criteria is W_0^i = 233 A.
          We  infer that 30% - 40% of LAEs at z=5.7 exceed W_0^i = 240 A.
          These  large-EW  objects  probably  cannot  be accounted for by
          ordinary  star-forming populations with a Salpeter IMF. We also
          find  that  LAEs  with  fainter far-UV luminosities have larger
          EWs.  Finally, we derive the far-UV luminosity function of LAEs
          down to M_UV ~= -19.6 using the photometric sample, and compare
          it  with  that  of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). We find that as
          high  as  about  80%  of  LBGs at z ~ 6 have W_0^i >= 100 A, in
          sharp contrast to lower-z counterparts.

          Title: Accretion in the Rho-Oph pre-main sequence stars
          Authors: A. Natta, L. Testi, S. Randich (Arcetri)
          Comments: A&A in press, 16 pages including tables, 5 figures
          The  aim  of this paper is to provide a measurement of the mass
          accretion  rate  in  a large, complete sample of objects in the
          core  of  the  star forming region Rho-Oph. The sample includes
          most  of  the  objects  (104  out  of  111)  with evidence of a
          circumstellar  disk  from  mid-infrared photometry; it covers a
          stellar mass range from about 0.03 to 3 Msun and it is complete
          to  a limiting mass of ~0.05 Msun. We used J and K-band spectra
          to  derive  the  mass  accretion  rate  of each object from the
          intensity  of the hydrogen recombination lines, Pab or Brg. For
          comparison,  we  also  obtained  similar spectra of 35 diskless
          objects.  The results show that emission in these lines is only
          seen  in  stars  with disks, and can be used as an indicator of
          accretion. However, the converse does not hold, as about 50% of
          our  disk  objects  do  not  have detectable line emission. The
          measured  accretion  rates  show  a strong correlation with the
          mass  of the central object (Macc ~ Mstar^1.8+-0.2) and a large
          spread,  of  two orders of magnitude at least, for any interval
          of Mstar. A comparison with existing data for Taurus shows that
          the objects in the two regions have similar behaviour, at least
          for  objects  more  massive  than ~0.1Msun. The implications of
          these results are briefly discussed.

          Title:  Models of the Structure and Evolution of Protoplanetary
          Disks
          Authors: C.P. Dullemond, D. Hollenbach, I. Kamp, P. D'Alessio
          Comments: Review chapter in "Protostars and Planets V"
          We  review  advances  in  the modeling of protoplanetary disks.
          This  review  will  focus on the regions of the disk beyond the
          dust  sublimation  radius, i.e. beyond 0.1 - 1 AU, depending on
          the stellar luminosity. We will be mostly concerned with models
          that aim to fit spectra of the dust continuum or gas lines, and
          derive physical parameters from these fits. For optically thick
          disks,  these parameters include the accretion rate through the
          disk  onto  the  star,  the  geometry  of  the  disk,  the dust
          properties,  the  surface  chemistry and the thermal balance of
          the  gas. For the latter we are mostly concerned with the upper
          layers of the disk, where the gas and dust temperature decouple
          and  a  photoevaporative  flow  may  originate. We also briefly
          discuss  optically  thin disks, focusing mainly on the gas, not
          the  dust.  The  evolution  of  these  disks  is  dominated  by
          accretion,   viscous   spreading,  photoevaporation,  and  dust
          settling and coagulation. The density and temperature structure
          arising  from  the surface layer models provide input to models
          of photoevaporation, which occurs largely in the outer disk. We
          discuss  the consequences of photoevaporation on disk evolution
          and planet formation.

          high resolution images, contact mauron at graal.univ-montp2.fr
          We  report  the  results of an exploratory program to image the
          extended  circumstellar  envelopes  of  asymptotic giant branch
          (AGB)  stars  in  dust-scattered galactic light. The goal is to
          characterize  the morphology of the envelopes as a probe of the
          mass-loss  process. The observations consist of short exposures
          with  the  VLT  and  longer  exposures  with  1-2m  telescopes,
          augmented with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope.
          We  observed  12  AGB  stars  and  detected  the  circumstellar
          envelopes  in  7.  The  detected envelopes have mass loss rates
          more  than  about  5 10E-6 solar mass per year, and they can be
          seen  out to distances of about 1 kpc. The observations provide
          information on the mass loss history on time scales up to about
          10,000   years.  For  the  five  AGB  envelopes  in  which  the
          circumstellar  geometry  is  well determined by scattered light
          observations,  all  except  one  (OH348.2-19.7) show deviations
          from  spherical  symmetry.  Two  (IRC+10216 and IRC+10011) show
          roughly  spherical  envelopes  at  large radii but asymmetry or
          bipolarity  close  to  the  star;  one  (AFGL  2514)  shows  an
          extended,  elliptical  envelope,  and  one  (AFGL 3068) shows a
          spiral pattern. The non-spherical structures are all consistent
          with  the  effects of binary interactions. Our observations are
          in  accord  with  a  scenario in which binary companions play a
          role   in   shaping   planetary  nebulae,  and  show  that  the
          circumstellar  gas  is already partly shaped on the AGB, before
          evolution to the proto-planetary nebula phase.

          Title:  The  neutron  star  soft  X-ray transient 1H1905+000 in
          quiescence

          Comments:  10  pages,  5  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          In  this Paper we report on our analysis of a ~25 ksec. Chandra
          X-ray  observation  of  the  neutron  star soft X-ray transient
          (SXT)  1H1905+000  in  quiescence.  Furthermore, we discuss our
          findings  of  the  analysis of optical photometric observations
          which  we obtained using the Magellan telescope and photometric
          and spectroscopic observations which we obtained using the Very
          Large Telescope at Paranal. The X-ray counterpart of 1H1905+000
          was  not  detected  in  our  Chandra  data,  with a 95 per cent
          confidence  limit  to the source count rate of 1.2x10^-4 counts
          s^-1.  For different spectral models this yields an upper limit
          on  the luminosity of 1.8x10^31 erg s^-1 (for an upper limit on
          the distance of 10 kpc.) This luminosity limit makes 1H1905+000
          the  faintest  neutron star SXT in quiescence observed to date.
          The neutron star luminosity is so low that it is similar to the
          lowest  luminosities derived for black hole SXTs in quiescence.
          This  low  luminosity  for  a  neutron  star SXT challanges the
          hypothesis  presented in the literature that black hole SXTs in
          quiescence  have lower luminosities than neutron star SXTs as a
          result   of  the  presence  of  a  black  hole  event  horizon.
          Furthermore,  the limit on the neutron star luminosity obtained
          less  than  20  years after the outburst has ceased, constrains
          the  thermal  conductivity  of the neutron star crust. Finally,
          the  neutron  star  core  must  be so cold that unless the time
          averaged  mass  accretion  rate  is  lower  than 2x10^-12 M_sun
          yr^-1,  core  cooling  has  to  proceed  via  enhanced neutrino
          emission  processes.  We  derive a limit on the absolute I-band
          magnitude  of the quiescent cou
