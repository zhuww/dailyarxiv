          Title:  Low  Mass  X-ray  Binaries  in  6  Elliptical Galaxies:
          Connection to Globular Clusters
          Authors: Eunhyeuk Kim, Dong-Woo Kim, Giuseppina Fabbiano, Myung

          Comments: 52 pages
          We  present  a  systematic  study  of the low mass X-ray binary
          (LMXB) populations of 6 elliptical galaxies. We utilize Chandra
          archival  data  to  identify  665  X-ray  point sources and HST
          archival  data  supplemented by ground observations to identify
          6173 GCs. We associate 209 LMXBs with red GC (RGC) and 76 LMXBs
          with  blue  GCs  (BGC), while we find no optical GC counterpart
          for  258  LMXBs.  This is the largest GC-LMXB sample studied so
          far.  We  confirm previous reports suggesting that the fraction
          of  GCs associated with LMXBs is 3 times larger in RGCs than in
          BGCs,  indicating  that  metallicity is a primary factor in the
          GC-LMXB  formation.  While  as already known, the brighter (and
          bigger)  GCs  have  a higher probability to host LMXBs, we find
          that  this  optical luminosity (or mass) dependency is stronger
          in  RGCs  than  in BGCs. We also find that GCs located near the
          galaxy  center  have  a  higher  probability  to  harbor  LMXBs
          compared to those in the outskirts. The radial distributions of
          GC-LMXBs  (for  both RGC and BGC) are steeper than those of the
          whole  optical  GC  sample,  but  consistent  with those of the
          optical  halo  light,  suggesting  that  there  must be another
          parameter (in addition to metallicity) governing LMXB formation
          in   GCs.   This   second   parameter   must   depend   on  the
          galacto-centric  distance. We find no statistically significant
          difference  in  the X-ray properties among RGC-LMXBs, BGC-LMXBs
          and  field-LMXBs.  The  similarity  of  the  X-ray  spectra  of
          BGC-LMXBs    and    RGC-LMXBs    is   inconsistent   with   the
          irradiation-induced   stellar   wind   model   prediction.  The
          similarity of the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of GC-LMXBs
          and   field-LMXBs   indicates  that  there  is  no  significant
          difference  in the fraction of BH binaries present in these two
          populations,  in  contrast  to Galactic LMXBs where BH binaries
          are not found in GCs.

          Title: CPD-41deg7742: an unusual wind interaction
          Authors:  H.  Sana, E. Gosset, G. Rauw, E. Antokhina, P. Royer,
          J. Manfroid, J.-M. Vreux
          Comments:  4pages,  5  figures,  to appear in "Distant Worlds",
          proceedings of the JENAM2005
          We   summarize  the  results  of  a  multiwavelength  observing
          campaign on the massive eclipsing binary CPD-41deg7742, another
          remarkable  object  in  the  young  open  cluster NGC 6231. Our
          campaign   relies  on  high  resolution  echelle  spectroscopy,
          narrow-band    optical   photometry,   and   XMM-Newton   X-ray
          observations.  Combined  with  the  spectroscopic analysis, the
          light  curve  analysis  provides  a  direct  measurement of the
          masses  and  sizes  of the system components. However, the most
          outstanding  results come from the XMM-Newton observations. Our
          180  ks  campaign towards NGC 6231, and CPD-41deg7742, provides
          an  unprecedented  phase  coverage  of  such a close early-type
          binary.  The  EPIC-MOS  light curves almost fully cover the 2.4
          day  period  of  the system and the brightness of the object is
          sufficient  to  yield  a  time resolution as tight as 1 ks. The
          X-ray  flux  presents clear variations along the orbit, that we
          interpret  as  the signature of an unusual wind interaction. We
          indeed  expect  that,  in this O+B system, the dominant primary
          wind   crashes   into  the  secondary  surface,  leading  to  a
          wind-photosphere  interaction.  As  a  strong  support  to  our
          interpretation,  we provide a geometrical model that associates
          an  extra X-ray emission to the secondary inner surface. Though
          quite  simple,  the  present model matches the main features of
          the X-ray light curve.

          Title:  A  Model for Twin Kilohertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations
          in Neutron Star Low-Mass X-Ray Binaries
          Authors: X.-D. Li, C.-M. Zhang
          Comments:   12   pages   including   3  figures,  accepted  for
          publication in ApJL
          We  suggest  a  plausible interpretation for the twin kiloHertz
          quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) in neutron star low-mass
          X-ray binaries. We identify the upper kHz QPO frequencies to be
          the  rotational  frequency  and the lower kHz QPOs the standing
          kink  modes  of  loop  oscillations  at  the  inner edge of the
          accretion   disk,   respectively.   Taking   into  account  the
          interaction  between  the  neutron  star magnetic field and the
          disk,  this  model  naturally  relates the twin QPO frequencies
          with  the star's spin frequencies. We have applied the model to
          four  X-ray  sources  with kHz QPOs detected simultaneously and
          known spin frequencies.

          Title:  An empirical model for the polarization of pulsar radio
          emission
          Authors: D. Melrose, A. Miller, A. Karastergiou, Q. Luo
          Comments:  10  pages,  7  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We  present  an  empirical  model  for  single  pulses of radio
          emission   from   pulsars   based   on   gaussian   probability
          distributions  for  relevant  variables.  The  radiation  at  a
          specific  pulse  phase  is  represented as the superposition of
          radiation  in  two (approximately) orthogonally polarized modes
          (OPMs)  from  one  or more subsources in the emission region of
          the  pulsar.  For  each  subsource, the polarization states are
          drawn  randomly  from  statistical distributions, with the mean
          and  the  variance on the Poincar\'e sphere as free parameters.
          The   intensity   of  one  OPM  is  chosen  from  a  log-normal
          distribution,  and the intensity of the other OPM is assumed to
          be  partially  correlated,  with the degree of correlation also
          chosen  from  a  gaussian  distribution.  The  model is used to
          construct  simulated  data described in the same format as real
          data:  distributions  of  the  polarization  of  pulses  on the
          Poincar\'e  sphere  and  histograms  of the intensity and other
          parameters.  We  concentrate  on the interpretation of data for
          specific  phases  of  PSR  B0329+54  for which the OPMs are not
          orthogonal,  with  one  well  defined  and the other spread out
          around  an annulus on the Poincar\'e sphere at some phases. The
          results  support  the  assumption that the radiation emerges in
          two  OPMs  with  closely  correlated intensities, and that in a
          statistical fraction of pulses one OPM is invisible.

          Title:  The  circles-in-the-sky  signature  for three spherical
          universes
          Authors: R. Aurich, S. Lustig, F. Steiner
          The  mysteriously  low  CMB  power  on the largest scales might
          point  to a Universe which consists of a multi-connected space.
          In   addition   to   a  suppression  of  large-scale  power,  a
          multi-connected space can be revealed by its circles-in-the-sky
          signature.  In this paper, a detailed search for this signature
          is  carried  out  for  those  three homogeneous multi-connected
          spherical  space  forms  that  lead to the smallest large-scale
          power.  A  simultaneous search for all occurring paired circles
          is  made using filtered CMB sky maps which enhance the ordinary
          Sachs-Wolfe  contribution.  A  marginal  hint  is found for the
          right-handed Poincare dodecahedron at Omega_tot = 1.015 and for
          the right-handed binary tetrahedral space at Omega_tot = 1.068.
          However,  due to the complicated noise and foreground structure
          of  the  available  microwave  sky  maps,  we  cannot draw firm
          conclusions from our findings.

          Title:  Are  Neutron-Rich  Elements Produced in the Collapse of
          Strange Dwarfs ?
          Authors: G. F. Marranghello, J. A. de Freitas Pacheco
          Comments: Accepted for publication in IJMPD
          The  structure  of strange dwarfs and that of hybrid stars with
          same  baryonic  number  is  compared.  There is a critical mass
          (M~0.24M_sun)   in   the  strange  dwarf  branch,  below  which
          configurations with the same baryonic number in the hybrid star
          branch  are  more  stable.  If a transition occurs between both
          branches, the collapse releases an energy of about of 3x10^{50}
          erg,  mostly  under  the  form  of neutrinos resulting from the
          conversion of hadronic matter onto strange quark matter. Only a
          fraction  (~4%)  is  required  to  expel the outer neutron-rich
          layers.  These  events  may  contribute  significantly  to  the
          chemical  yield  of  nuclides with A>80 in the Galaxy, if their
          frequency is of about one per 1500 years.

          We  present  a  systematic  study  of the low mass X-ray binary

          in   GCs.   This   second   parameter   must   depend   on  the

          similarity of the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of GC-LMXBs
          and   field-LMXBs   indicates  that  there  is  no  significant
          difference  in the fraction of BH binaries present in these two
          populations,  in  contrast  to Galactic LMXBs where BH binaries
          are not found in GCs.

          We   summarize  the  results  of  a  multiwavelength  observing

          We  suggest  a  plausible interpretation for the twin kiloHertz
          quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) in neutron star low-mass
          X-ray binaries. We identify the upper kHz QPO frequencies to be
          the  rotational  frequency  and the lower kHz QPOs the standing
          kink  modes  of  loop  oscillations  at  the  inner edge of the

          interaction  between  the  neutron  star magnetic field and the
          disk,  this  model  naturally  relates the twin QPO frequencies
          with  the star's spin frequencies. We have applied the model to
          four  X-ray  sources  with kHz QPOs detected simultaneously and
          known spin frequencies.

          Authors: D. Melrose, A. Miller, A. Karastergiou, Q. Luo
          Comments:  10  pages,  7  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We  present  an  empirical  model  for  single  pulses of radio
          emission   from   pulsars   based   on   gaussian   probability
          distributions  for  relevant  variables.  The  radiation  at  a
          specific  pulse  phase  is  represented as the superposition of
          radiation  in  two (approximately) orthogonally polarized modes
          (OPMs)  from  one  or more subsources in the emission region of
          the  pulsar.  For  each  subsource, the polarization states are
          drawn  randomly  from  statistical distributions, with the mean
          and  the  variance on the Poincar\'e sphere as free parameters.
          The   intensity   of  one  OPM  is  chosen  from  a  log-normal
          distribution,  and the intensity of the other OPM is assumed to
          be  partially  correlated,  with the degree of correlation also
          chosen  from  a  gaussian  distribution.  The  model is used to
          construct  simulated  data described in the same format as real
          data:  distributions  of  the  polarization  of  pulses  on the
          Poincar\'e  sphere  and  histograms  of the intensity and other
          parameters.  We  concentrate  on the interpretation of data for
          specific  phases  of  PSR  B0329+54  for which the OPMs are not
          orthogonal,  with  one  well  defined  and the other spread out
          around  an annulus on the Poincar\'e sphere at some phases. The
          results  support  the  assumption that the radiation emerges in
          two  OPMs  with  closely  correlated intensities, and that in a
          statistical fraction of pulses one OPM is invisible.

          The  mysteriously  low  CMB  power  on the largest scales might

          In   addition   to   a  suppression  of  large-scale  power,  a

          is  carried  out  for  those  three homogeneous multi-connected
          spherical  space  forms  that  lead to the smallest large-scale
          power.  A  simultaneous search for all occurring paired circles
          is  made using filtered CMB sky maps which enhance the ordinary
          Sachs-Wolfe  contribution.  A  marginal  hint  is found for the
          right-handed Poincare dodecahedron at Omega_tot = 1.015 and for
          the right-handed binary tetrahedral space at Omega_tot = 1.068.
          However,  due to the complicated noise and foreground structure
          of  the  available  microwave  sky  maps,  we  cannot draw firm
          conclusions from our findings.

          Title:  Are  Neutron-Rich  Elements Produced in the Collapse of
          Strange Dwarfs ?
          Authors: G. F. Marranghello, J. A. de Freitas Pacheco
          Comments: Accepted for publication in IJMPD
          The  structure  of strange dwarfs and that of hybrid stars with
          same  baryonic  number  is  compared.  There is a critical mass
          (M~0.24M_sun)   in   the  strange  dwarf  branch,  below  which
          configurations with the same baryonic number in the hybrid star
          branch  are  more  stable.  If a transition occurs between both
          branches, the collapse releases an energy of about of 3x10^{50}
          erg,  mostly  under  the  form  of neutrinos resulting from the
          conversion of hadronic matter onto strange quark matter. Only a
          fraction  (~4%)  is  required  to  expel the outer neutron-rich
          layers.  These  events  may  contribute  significantly  to  the
          chemical  yield  of  nuclides with A>80 in the Galaxy, if their
          frequency is of about one per 1500 years.

          XMM-Newton  EPIC  observations  reveal  the population of X-ray
          sources  of  the  bright  Local  Group  spiral  galaxy  M 31, a
          low-star-formation-rate  galaxy  like  the Milky Way, down to a
          0.2-4.5  keV luminosity of 4.4E34 erg/s. With the help of X-ray
          hardness  ratios  and  optical  and radio information different
          source  classes  can  be distinguished. The survey detected 856
          sources  in an area of 1.24 square degrees. Sources within M 31
          are  44  supernova remnants (SNR) and candidates, 18 super-soft
          sources (SSS), 16 X-ray binaries (XRBs) and candidates, as well
          as  37 globular cluster sources (GlC) and candidates, i.e. most
          likely  low  mass  XRBs  within  the  GlC. 567 hard sources may
          either  be XRBs or Crab-like SNRs in M 31 or background AGN. 22
          sources are new SNR candidates in M 31 based on X-ray selection
          criteria.  Time  variability information can be used to improve
          the  source  classification.  Two GlC sources show type I X-ray
          bursts  as known from Galactic neutron star low mass XRBs. Many
          of  the  M  31 SSS detected with XMM-Newton, Chandra and ROSAT,
          could be identified with optical novae. Soft X-ray light curves
          can be determined in M 31 center observations for several novae
          at a time opening a new area of nova research.

          QuantEYE   is   designed  to  be  the  highest  time-resolution
          instrument  on  ESO:s  planned  Overwhelmingly Large Telescope,
          devised to explore astrophysical variability on microsecond and
          nanosecond  scales, down to the quantum-optical limit. Expected
          phenomena   include  instabilities  of  photon-gas  bubbles  in
          accretion  flows,  p-mode  oscillations  in  neutron stars, and
          quantum-optical photon bunching in time. Precise timescales are
          both variable and unknown, and studies must be of photon-stream
          statistics, e.g., their power spectra or autocorrelations. Such
          functions  increase  with the square of the intensity, implying
          an  enormously increased sensitivity at the largest telescopes.
          QuantEYE  covers  the optical, and its design involves an array
          of  photon-counting avalanche-diode detectors, each viewing one
          segment  of  the OWL entrance pupil. QuantEYE will work already
          with  a  partially  filled  OWL  main  mirror, and also without
          [full] adaptive optics.

          Letters
          We  present  the  first  detailed spectroscopic and photometric
          analysis  of an eclipsing binary in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31).
          This  is  a  19.3-mag  semi-detached  system with components of
          late-O  and  early-B  spectral types. From the light and radial
          velocity  curves  we have carried out an accurate determination
          of  the  masses  and  radii  of the components. Their effective
          temperatures  have  been  estimated  from  the  modeling of the
          absorption  line  spectra.  The  analysis yields an essentially
          complete  picture of the properties of the system, and hence an
          accurate   distance   determination   to  M31.  The  result  is
          d=772+/-44   kpc   ((m-M)_0=24.44+/-0.12  mag).  The  study  of
          additional  systems,  currently  in progress, should reduce the
          uncertainty in the M31 distance to better than 5%.

          The  low  mass  X-ray  binary  (LMXB)  associated  with the M31
          globular cluster Bo 158 is known to exhibit intensity dips on a
          ~2.78 hr period. This is due to obscuration of the X-ray source
          on  the  orbital  period  by  material on the outer edge of the
          accretion  disc. However, the depth of dipping varied from <10%
          to  \~83%  in three archival XMM-Newton observations of Bo 158.
          Previous  work  suggested that the dip depth was anticorrelated
          with  the  X-ray  luminosity.  However, we present results from
          three   new  XMM-Newton  observations  that  suggest  that  the
          evolution  of  dipping  is  instead  due  to  precession of the
          accretion  disc.  Such  precession  is expected in neutron star
          LMXBs  with mass ratios <0.3 (i.e. with orbital periods <4 hr),
          such as the Galactic dipping LMXB 4U 1916-053. We simulated the
          accretion  disc  of  Bo  158  using  cutting-edge  3D  smoothed
          particle   hydrodynamics   (SPH),   and   using   the  observed
          parameters.   Our   results   show   disc  variability  on  two
          time-scales.  The  disc  precesses in a prograde direction on a
          period  of  81+/-3  hr. Also, a radiatively-driven disc warp is
          present in the inner disc, which undergoes retrograde precesson
          on a \~31 hr period. From the system geometry, we conclude that
          the  dipping  evolution is driven by the disc precession. Hence
          we  predict  that  the  dipping  behaviour  repeats on a ~81 hr
          cycle.

          Title: Gravitational Radiation from Newborn Magnetars
          Authors: Luigi Stella, Simone Dall'Oss, GianLuca Israel (INAF -
          OA Roma), Alberto Vecchio (Univ. Birmingham)
          Comments: Accepted for publication on ApJ Letters
          There  is  growing  evidence  that  two  classes of high-energy
          sources,  the  Soft  Gamma  Repeaters  and  the Anomalous X-ray
          Pulsars  contain  slowly  spinning  ``magnetars'', i.e. neutron
          stars  whose  emission is powered by the release of energy from
          their  extremely strong magnetic fields (>10^15 G. We show here
          that  the  enormous  energy  liberated  in the 2004 December 27
          giant  flare  from SGR1806-20 (~5 10^46 erg), together with the
          likely  recurrence  time  of  such events, requires an internal
          field  strength  of > 10^16 G. Toroidal magnetic fields of this
          strength are within an order of magnitude of the maximum fields
          that  can  be  generated in the core of differentially-rotating
          neutron  stars  immediately  after  their  formation,  if their
          initial  spin  period  is  of a few milliseconds. A substantial
          deformation  of  the  neutron star is induced by these magnetic
          fields  and,  provided  the deformation axis is offset from the
          spin axis, a newborn fast-spinning magnetar would radiate for a
          few  weeks  a strong gravitational wave signal the frequency of
          which  (0.5-2  kHz  range) decreases in time. The signal from a
          newborn  magnetar  with  internal  field  >  10^16.5 G could be
          detected  with Advanced LIGO-class detectors up to the distance
          of  the  Virgo  cluster  (characteristic  amplitude  h_c  about
          10^-21).  Magnetars  are  expected  to  form in Virgo at a rate
          approx.  1/yr.  If  a  fraction of these have sufficiently high
          internal  magnetic  field,  then newborn magnetars constitute a
          promising new class of gravitational wave emitters.

          spectrum  with  a blackbody plus a Comptonized component. Large
          residuals  at  6-10 keV can be fitted by a broad (FWHM ~ 2 keV)
          Gaussian  emission  line  or,  alternatively, by two absorption
          edges  associated  with  lowly  ionized iron and Fe XXV/XXVI at
          ~7.1  keV  and ~9 keV, respectively. In this interpretation, we
          find  no evidence of broad, or narrow, emission lines between 6
          and  7  keV.  We  test  our alternative modelling of the iron K
          shell  region by reanalysing a previous BeppoSAX observation of
          MXB  1728-34, finding a general agreement with our new spectral

          Title:  A  Coherent  Timing  Solution  for  the Nearby Isolated
          Neutron Star RX J1308.6+2127/RBS 1223
          Authors: D. L. Kaplan, M. H. van Kerkwijk
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures. ApJL in press
          We  present  a  phase-connected  timing solution for the nearby
          isolated   neutron   star  RX  J1308.6+2127  (RBS  1223).  From
          dedicated  Chandra observations as well as archival Chandra and
          XMM-Newton data spanning a period of five years, we demonstrate
          that  the  10.31-sec  pulsations are slowing down steadily at a
          rate  of  Pdot=1.120(3)e-13 s/s. Under the assumption that this
          is  due  to  magnetic dipole torques, we infer a characteristic
          age  of  1.5  Myr and a magnetic field strength of 3.4e13 G. As
          with  RX  J0720.4-3125,  the  only  other radio-quiet thermally
          emitting  isolated neutron star for which a timing solution has
          been  derived,  the  field strength is consistent with what was
          inferred  earlier  from  the  presence  of  a strong absorption
          feature  in its X-ray spectrum. Furthermore, both sources share
          that  the  characteristic  age  is in excess of the cooling age
          inferred  from  standard  cooling  models.  The sources differ,
          however,  in  their  timing noise: while RX J0720.4-3125 showed
          considerable  timing  noise, RX J1308.6+2127 appears relatively
          stable.

          Title:  Discovery  and  modelling of disc precession in the M31
          X-ray binary Bo 158?
          Authors:  R. Barnard, S.B. Foulkes, C.A. Haswell, U. Kolb, J.P.
          Osborne, J. R. Murray
          Comments:  6  pages,  4  figures, to appear in proceedings "The
          X-ray  Universe  2005",  San  Lorenzo  de El Escoriale (Madrid,
          Spain), 26-30 September 2005
          The  low  mass  X-ray  binary  (LMXB)  associated  with the M31
          globular cluster Bo 158 is known to exhibit intensity dips on a
          ~2.78 hr period. This is due to obscuration of the X-ray source
          on  the  orbital  period  by  material on the outer edge of the
          accretion  disc. However, the depth of dipping varied from <10%
          to  \~83%  in three archival XMM-Newton observations of Bo 158.
          Previous  work  suggested that the dip depth was anticorrelated
          with  the  X-ray  luminosity.  However, we present results from
          three   new  XMM-Newton  observations  that  suggest  that  the
          evolution  of  dipping  is  instead  due  to  precession of the
          accretion  disc.  Such  precession  is expected in neutron star
          LMXBs  with mass ratios <0.3 (i.e. with orbital periods <4 hr),
          such as the Galactic dipping LMXB 4U 1916-053. We simulated the
          accretion  disc  of  Bo  158  using  cutting-edge  3D  smoothed
          particle   hydrodynamics   (SPH),   and   using   the  observed
          parameters.   Our   results   show   disc  variability  on  two
          time-scales.  The  disc  precesses in a prograde direction on a
          period  of  81+/-3  hr. Also, a radiatively-driven disc warp is
          present in the inner disc, which undergoes retrograde precesson
          on a \~31 hr period. From the system geometry, we conclude that
          the  dipping  evolution is driven by the disc precession. Hence
          we  predict  that  the  dipping  behaviour  repeats on a ~81 hr
          cycle.

          Title: Gravitational Radiation from Newborn Magnetars
          Authors: Luigi Stella, Simone Dall'Oss, GianLuca Israel (INAF -
          OA Roma), Alberto Vecchio (Univ. Birmingham)
          Comments: Accepted for publication on ApJ Letters
          There  is  growing  evidence  that  two  classes of high-energy
          sources,  the  Soft  Gamma  Repeaters  and  the Anomalous X-ray
          Pulsars  contain  slowly  spinning  ``magnetars'', i.e. neutron
          stars  whose  emission is powered by the release of energy from
          their  extremely strong magnetic fields (>10^15 G. We show here
          that  the  enormous  energy  liberated  in the 2004 December 27
          giant  flare  from SGR1806-20 (~5 10^46 erg), together with the
          likely  recurrence  time  of  such events, requires an internal
          field  strength  of > 10^16 G. Toroidal magnetic fields of this
          strength are within an order of magnitude of the maximum fields
          that  can  be  generated in the core of differentially-rotating
          neutron  stars  immediately  after  their  formation,  if their
          initial  spin  period  is  of a few milliseconds. A substantial
          deformation  of  the  neutron star is induced by these magnetic
          fields  and,  provided  the deformation axis is offset from the
          spin axis, a newborn fast-spinning magnetar would radiate for a
          few  weeks  a strong gravitational wave signal the frequency of
          which  (0.5-2  kHz  range) decreases in time. The signal from a
          newborn  magnetar  with  internal  field  >  10^16.5 G could be
          detected  with Advanced LIGO-class detectors up to the distance
          of  the  Virgo  cluster  (characteristic  amplitude  h_c  about
          10^-21).  Magnetars  are  expected  to  form in Virgo at a rate
          approx.  1/yr.  If  a  fraction of these have sufficiently high
          internal  magnetic  field,  then newborn magnetars constitute a
          promising new class of gravitational wave emitters.

          Many  astronomers  and  astrophysicists require large computing
          resources  for  their  research, which are usually obtained via
          dedicated  (and  expensive) parallel machines. Depending on the
          type  of  the problem to be solved, an alternative solution can
          be  provided  by creating dynamically a computer cluster out of
          non-dedicated  workstations  using  the  Condor High Throughput
          Computing  System  and  the Master-Worker (MW) framework. As an
          example  of this we show in this paper how a radiative transfer
          application  previously  coded  with  MPI  is solved using this
          solution without the need for dedicated machines.

          We  examine  14  hot  white dwarfs for signs of infrared excess
          using  the  Spitzer  Space Telescope. Twelve of the objects are
          massive white dwarfs which have been suggested to be the result
          of  binary  mergers. The remaining two objects are undermassive
          white  dwarfs  which  again may be the result of mergers or the
          inspiral  of  a substellar companion. In no case do we find any
          evidence  for  significant infrared excesses out to wavelengths
          of 8 microns. This places strong constraints on the presence of
          orbiting  dust  and weaker constraints on the presence of close
          substellar companions.

          Comments:  12  pages,  1  figure,  1  table,  to  appear in the
          proceedings of Cherenkov 2005, Palaiseau, France
          The  excellent  sensitivity  and  high resolution capability of
          wide  FoV  ground-based imaging atmospheric Cerenkov telescopes
          allow  us  for  the  first  time  to  resolve the morphological
          structures  of  pulsar  wind  nebulae (PWN) which are older and
          more  extended than the Crab Nebula. VHE gamma-ray observations
          of such extended nebulae (with field strengths below ~ 20 micro
          Gauss) probe the electron component corresponding to the unseen
          extreme ultraviolet (EUV) synchrotron component, which measures
          electron   injection  from  earlier  evolutionary  epochs.  VHE
          observations  of  PWN  therefore  introduce a new window on PWN

          It  appears  that  there is a genuine shortage of radio pulsars
          with  surface  magnetic fields significantly smaller than $\sim
          10^8$ Gauss. We propose that the pulsars with very low magnetic
          fields  are actually strange stars locked in a state of minimum
          free  energy  and therefore at a limiting value of the magnetic
          field which can not be lowered by the system spontaneously.

          The  discovery  of the X-ray source IGR J17252-3616 by INTEGRAL
          was reported on 9 February 2004. Regular monitoring by INTEGRAL
          shows  that  IGR  J17252-3616 is a persistent hard X-ray source
          with an average count rate of 0.96 counts/s (~6.4 mCrab) in the
          20-60 keV energy band. A follow-up observation with XMM-Newton,
          which was performed on 21 March 21 2004, showed that the source
          is  located at R.A.(2000.0)=17h25m11.4 and Dec.=-36degr16'58.6"
          with an uncertainty of 4". The only infra-red counterpart to be
          found   within   the   XMM-Newton   error   circle   was  2MASS
          J17251139-3616575, which has a Ks-band magnitude of 10.7 and is
          located 1" away from the XMM-Newton position.
          The   analysis   of   the   combined  INTEGRAL  and  XMM-Newton
          observations  shows  that  the  source is a binary X-ray pulsar
          with  a  spin  period  of 413.7 s and an orbital period of 9.72
          days.  The spectrum can be fitted with a flat power law plus an
          energy cut off (Gamma~0.02,Ecut~8.2 keV) or a Comptonized model
          (kTe~5.5  keV,  tau~7.8).  The  spectrum also indicates a large
          hydrogen  column density of Nh~15x1e22 atoms/cm-2 suggesting an
          intrinsic  absorption. The Fe Kalpha line at 6.4 keV is clearly
          detected.   Phase-resolved   spectroscopy  does  not  show  any
          variation  in  the continuum except the total emitted flux. The
          absorption  is  constant along the pulse phase. This source can
          be  associated  with  EXO  1722-363 as both systems show common
          timing and spectral features. The observations suggest that the
          source   is  a  wind-fed  accreting  pulsar  accompanied  by  a
          supergiant star.

          Title:  A  Spitzer  Search for Infrared Excesses around Massive
          Young White Dwarfs

          the Astronomical Journal (Feb 2006)
          We  examine  14  hot  white dwarfs for signs of infrared excess
          using  the  Spitzer  Space Telescope. Twelve of the objects are
          massive white dwarfs which have been suggested to be the result
          of  binary  mergers. The remaining two objects are undermassive
          white  dwarfs  which  again may be the result of mergers or the
          inspiral  of  a substellar companion. In no case do we find any
          evidence  for  significant infrared excesses out to wavelengths
          of 8 microns. This places strong constraints on the presence of
          orbiting  dust  and weaker constraints on the presence of close
          substellar companions.

          Nebulae: Towards a New Order

          Comments:  12  pages,  1  figure,  1  table,  to  appear in the

          The  excellent  sensitivity  and  high resolution capability of
          wide  FoV  ground-based imaging atmospheric Cerenkov telescopes
          allow  us  for  the  first  time  to  resolve the morphological
          structures  of  pulsar  wind  nebulae (PWN) which are older and
          more  extended than the Crab Nebula. VHE gamma-ray observations
          of such extended nebulae (with field strengths below ~ 20 micro
          Gauss) probe the electron component corresponding to the unseen
          extreme ultraviolet (EUV) synchrotron component, which measures
          electron   injection  from  earlier  evolutionary  epochs.  VHE
          observations  of  PWN  therefore  introduce a new window on PWN
          research.  This  review  paper  also  identifies conditions for
          maximal VHE visbility of PWN. Regarding pulsar pulsed emission,
          it  is  becoming  clear  that the threshold energies of current

          We   present  an  overview  of  recent  X-ray  observations  of

          spectrum  of  the  nearby  WN8  +  OB  binary WR 147 shows hard
          absorbed X-ray emission, including the Fe K-alpha line complex,
          characteristic  of  colliding  wind shock sources. In contrast,
          sensitive  observations  of four of the closest known single WC
          (carbon-rich)  WR stars have yielded only non-detections. These
          results  tentatively  suggest  that  single  WC stars are X-ray
          quiet.  The  presence  of  a companion may thus be an essential
          factor  in  elevating  the  X-ray  emission of WC + OB stars to
          detectable levels.

          Title: Magnetized hypermassive neutron star collapse: a central

          Authors:  Masaru Shibata, Matthew D. Duez, Yuk Tung Liu, Stuart

          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. Letter
          A  hypermassive  neutron  star  (HMNS)  is a possible transient
          formed after the merger of a neutron star binary. In the latest
          magnetohydrodynamic  simulations in full general relativity, we
          find  that  a magnetized HMNS undergoes `delayed' collapse to a
          rotating  black  hole  (BH)  as  a  result  of angular momentum
          transport   via  magnetic  braking  and  the  magnetorotational
          instability.  The  outcome is a BH surrounded by a massive, hot
          torus with a collimated magnetic field. The torus accretes onto
          the  BH  at a quasi-steady accretion rate ~10 solar mass/s; the
          lifetime  of  the  torus is ~10 ms. The torus has a temperature
          \sim   10^{12}  K,  leading  to  copious  neutrino-antineutrino
          thermal  radiation.  Therefore,  the  collapse  of an HMNS is a
          promising  scenario  for  generating  short-duration  gamma-ray
          bursts  and  an  accompanying  burst of gravitational waves and
          neutrinos.

          published by Ap&SS
          The  space  experiment CoRoT will provide continuous monitoring
          and  high  accuracy light curves of about sixty thousand stars.
          Selected  binary  systems  will  be  observed in the Additional
          Program  frame  as  targets  of  long  and  continuous  pointed
          observations.   Moreover,   thousands   of  new  binaries  will
          certainly  be detected and hundreds of them will have extremely
          accurate  light curves. This will allow studies of fine effects
          on  the  light  curves,  monitoring of stellar activity and, in
          combination   with   ground-based  observations,  will  provide
          exquisite determination of stellar parameters.
          Among  the  new  discoveries  of interesting systems of special

          The  combination  of  dispersion measures of pulsars, distances
          from the model of Cordes and Lazio (2002) and emission measures
          from  the  WHAM  survey enabled a statistical study of electron
          densities  and filling factors of the diffuse ionized gas (DIG)
          in  the  Milky  Way.  The  emission measures were corrected for
          absorption  and  contributions from beyond the pulsar distance.
          For  a sample of 157 pulsars at |b| > 5 degrees, mainly located
          in  interarm  regions  within about 3 kpc from the Sun, we find
          that:  (1)  The average volume filling factor along the line of
          sight is inversely proportional to the mean electron density in
          clouds. (2) The average volume filling factor increases towards
          larger  distances from the Galactic plane. (3) The local volume
          filling  factor may reach a maximum near |z| = 0.9 kpc, whereas
          the local electron density continues to decrease at higher |z|,
          thus  causing  the  observed  flattening in the distribution of
          dispersion  measures  perpendicular  to  the  plane  above this
          height.  (4)  The  scale  heights  of the electron density, the
          volume filling factor and the emission measure are the same and
          in the range 250-500 pc.

          on Variable Stars. Pecs (Hungary), September 2005
          The  study  of  binary  stars is worth to undertake not only to
          learn  more  about the properties of binaries as such, but also
          because  binaries  are  multi-purpose astrophysical tools. This
          paper  reviews  some  of  the ways this effective "tool" can be
          used, focusing on fundamental parameter determination, tests of
          theoretical models, and the recent contribution of binary stars
          to  establish  the  distance  to  the  Magellanic  Clouds,  and
          therefore, the first rungs of the cosmological distance ladder.

          MNRAS
          We  study  the "minimal" cooling scenario of superfluid neutron
          stars  with  nucleon  cores,  where  the direct Urca process is
          forbidden  and the enhanced cooling is produced by the neutrino
          emission  due  to  Cooper  pairing  of  neutrons. Extending our
          previous  consideration  (Gusakov et al. 2004a), we include the
          effects  of  accreted  envelopes  of  light elements. We employ
          phenomenological    density-dependent   critical   temperatures
          T_{cp}(\rho)  and  T_{cnt}(\rho)  of  singlet-state  proton and
          triplet-state neutron pairing in a stellar core, as well as the
          critical  temperature  T_{cns}(\rho)  of  singlet-state neutron
          pairing  in  a  stellar  crust.  We  show  that the presence of
          accreted    envelopes    simplifies   the   interpretation   of
          observations  of  thermal radiation from isolated neutron stars
          in  the scenario of Gusakov et al. (2004a) and widens the class
          of  models  for nucleon superfluidity in neutron star interiors
          consistent with the observations.

          Title:  On  the  complex  X-ray structure tracing the motion of
          Geminga

          A deep (100 ks) XMM-Newton observation of Geminga has shown two
          faint tails of diffuse X-ray emission, extending for ~2' behind
          the pulsar, well aligned with the proper motion (PM) direction.
          We  report  here  on a recent ~20 ks Chandra observation, which
          unveils a new structure, ~25'' long and ~5'' thick, starting at
          the   pulsar   position  and  perfectly  aligned  with  the  PM
          direction, with a surface brightness ~40 times higher than that
          of  the  XMM  Tails.  The  Chandra  comet-like  feature  has  a
          remarkably   hard   spectrum   (photon  index  0.9-1.4)  and  a
          luminosity of ~5.5x10^28 erg s^-1, comparable to the energetics
          of  the  larger XMM one. Geminga is thus the first neutron star
          to  show  a  clear  X-ray  evidence  of  a  large-scale,  outer
          bow-shock as well as a short, inner cometary trail.

          of  High Energy Sources in Galaxies", held in Dublin (Ireland),

          press)
          The  supernova  explosion of 1054 AD, which originated the Crab
          Nebula and Pulsar, is probably the astronomical event which has
          been  most  deeply  studied  by  means  of  historical sources.
          However,  many  mysteries  and  inconsistencies, both among the
          different sources and between what is deduced by the historical
          records  and  the  present day astronomical data, are demanding
          extraordinary  efforts  by theoretical astrophysicists in order
          to  put  all  the  data  in a meaningful framework. An accurate
          analysis  of  the  historical  sources,  like  the  one  we are
          presenting   here,  may  contribute  to  solve  some  of  these
          problems.

          Title:  Binaries  Like  to  be  Twins:  Implications for Doubly
          Degenerate   Binaries,   the   Supernova   Ia  Rate  and  Other
          Interacting Binaries
          Authors: M. H. Pinsonneault, K. Z. Stanek
          Comments: 14 pages, 2 figures, ApJL, submitted
          The  recent  sample  of  21  detached eclipsing binaries in the
          Small  Magellanic  Cloud  (Harries et al. 2003, Hilditch et al.
          2005)  provides a valuable test of the binary mass function for
          massive  stars.  We  show  that  50%  of detached binaries have
          companions  with  very  similar masses, q=M_2/M_1 > 0.87, where
          M_1,  M_2 denote the masses of the two binary components, M_1 >
          M_2.  A  Salpeter  relative  mass function for the secondary is
          very  strongly excluded, and the data is consistent with a flat
          mass  function  containing  55%  of  the systems and a ``twin''
          population with q>0.95 containing the remainder. We also survey
          the  vast  existing  literature  discussing  the  mass ratio in
          binaries  and  conclude  that a significant twin population (of
          more  than  20-25%)  exists  in  binaries  that  are  likely to
          interact   across   a   broad   range  of  stellar  masses  and
          metallicity.  Interactions  involving  nearly  equal mass stars
          have distinctly different properties than those involving stars
          of  unequal  mass;  the secondaries will tend to be evolved and
          the  common  envelope evolution is qualitatively different. The
          implications  of such a population for both binary interactions
          and  star  formation  are  substantial,  and  we  present  some
          examples.  We  argue  that  twin  systems may provide a natural
          stellar  population  to  explain  the  recently proposed prompt
          channel  for  type Ia SN, and the presence of a twin population
          dramatically  reduces  the  maximum  inferred NS+BH merger rate
          relative  to the NS+NS merger rate. Twins may also be important
          for  understanding  the  tendency  of  WD and NS binaries to be
          nearly  equal  in  mass,  and  inclusion of twins in population
          studies will boost the blue straggler production rate.

          Title: Nucleosynthesis in Early Supernova Winds II: The Role of
          Neutrinos
          Authors:  J. Pruet, R.D. Hoffman, S.E. Woosley, H.-T. Janka, R.
          Buras
          One of the outstanding unsolved riddles of nuclear astrophysics
          is the origin of the so called ``p-process'' nuclei from A = 92
          to  126.  Both  the  lighter  and  heavier p-process nuclei are
          adequately  produced  in the neon and oxygen shells of ordinary
          Type  II  supernovae,  but  the  origin  of  these intermediate
          isotopes,   especially  92,94Mo  and  96,98Ru,  has  long  been
          mysterious.  Here  we explore the production of these nuclei in
          the neutrino-driven wind from a young neutron star. We consider
          such  early  times that the wind still contains a proton excess
          because  the  rates for electron neutrino and positron captures
          on  neutrons  are faster than those for the inverse captures on
          protons.  Following  a  suggestion  by Frohlich et al. 2005, we
          also  include the possibility that, in addition to the protons,
          alpha-particles,  and  heavy  seed, a small flux of neutrons is
          maintained  by  the  reaction  p(bar(nu_e),e+)n.  This  flux of
          neutrons  is critical in bridging the long waiting points along
          the  path  of  the rp-process by (n,p) and (n,gamma) reactions.
          Using   the   unmodified   ejecta   histories   from  a  recent
          two-dimensional  supernova  model by Janka et al. 2003, we find
          synthesis of p-rich nuclei up to 102Pd. However, if the entropy
          of  these ejecta is increased by a factor of two, the synthesis
          extends to 120Te. Still larger increases in entropy, that might
          reflect the role of magnetic fields or vibrational energy input
          neglected in the hydrodynamical model, result in the production
          of  numerous r-, s-, and p-process nuclei up to A approximately
          170, even in winds that are proton-rich.

          Title:  Formalism for Testing Theories of Gravity Using Lensing
          by Compact Objects. I: Static, Spherically Symmetric Case
          Authors: Charles R. Keeton (Rutgers), A. O. Petters (Duke)
          Comments: accepted in PRD
          We  are  developing a general, unified, and rigorous analytical
          framework for using gravitational lensing by compact objects to
          test  different  theories of gravity beyond the weak-deflection
          limit.  In  this  paper  we present the formalism for computing
          corrections  to  lensing  observables  for  static, spherically
          symmetric  gravity  theories  in  which  the corrections to the
          weak-deflection limit can be expanded as a Taylor series in one
          parameter,  namely the gravitational radius of the lens object.
          We  take  care to derive coordinate-independent expressions and
          compute  quantities  that  are  directly observable. We compute
          first-  and  second-order  corrections  to the image positions,
          magnifications,  and  time  delays. Interestingly, we find that
          the  first-order  corrections  to  the  total magnification and
          centroid  position  vanish  in  all gravity theories that agree
          with  general relativity in the weak-deflection limit, but they
          can  remain  nonzero in modified theories that disagree with GR
          in the weak-deflection limit. For the Reissner-Nordstrom metric
          and   a  related  metric  from  heterotic  string  theory,  our
          formalism  reveals  an  intriguing  connection  between lensing
          observables  and  the condition for having a naked singularity,
          which  could  provide  an  observational method for testing the
          existence  of  such  objects.  We  apply  our  formalism to the
          Galactic  black  hole  and  predict that the corrections to the
          image  positions are at the level of 10 micro-arcseconds, while
          the  correction  to  the  time  delay  is a few hundredths of a
          second. These corrections would be measurable today if a pulsar
          were  found  to  be lensed by the Galactic black hole; and they
          should be readily detectable with planned missions like MAXIM.

          Title: Polarimetry of binary stars
          Authors: N. Manset
          Comments:  12  pages,  no  figures,  invited review, conference
          proceedings, in press
          Astronomical  polarimetry  is  a  powerful  technique  that can
          provide  physical information sometimes difficult or impossible
          to  obtain by any other type of observation. Almost every class
          of  binary  star  can  benefit  from polarimetric observations:
          pre-main-sequence   objects,   close   or   contact   binaries,
          mass-transfer systems, evolved binaries, cataclysmic variables,
          eclipsing binaries, etc. In these systems, polarimetry can help
          determine  the  geometry  of  the circumstellar or circumbinary
          matter  distribution,  yield  information  on  asymmetries  and
          anisotropies,  identify obscured sources, map starspots, detect
          magnetic fields, and establish orbital parameters, to name just
          a few examples. The orbital inclination in particular is a very
          important  piece  of information for a binary system because it
          can  lead  to  the determination of the components' masses, the
          fundamental   parameter   that   determines  a  star's  initial
          structure and subsequent evolution. This review will illustrate
          the  usefulness  of  polarimetric  techniques  for the study of
          binary  stars,  with examples of results obtained for a variety
          of  binary  systems, and an overview of models, including those
          used to retrieve the orbital inclination.

          We  present  results  of  a  spectroscopic study of 37 southern
          (candidate)  gamma  Doradus stars based on echelle spectra. The
          observed   spectra  were  cross-correlated  with  the  standard
          template spectrum of an F0-type star for an easier detection of
          binary  and  intrinsic  variations. We identified 15 objects as
          spectroscopic  binaries,  including  7  new ones, and another 3
          objects are binary suspects. At least 12 objects show composite
          spectra.  We  could  determine  the  orbital  parameters  for 9
          binaries,  of which 4 turn out to be ellipsoidal variables. For
          6  binaries, we estimated the expected time-base of the orbital
          variations.  Clear  profile  variations  are  observed  for  17
          objects,  pointing towards stellar pulsation. For 8 of them, we
          have  evidence  that  the  main  spectroscopic  and photometric
          periods  coincide.  Our  results,  in  combination  with  prior
          knowledge from the literature, lead to the classification of 10
          objects  as  new bona-fide gamma Doradus stars, 1 object as new
          bona-fide  delta  Scuti  star, and 8 objects as constant stars.
          Finally,  we  determined the projected rotational velocity with
          two  independent methods. The resulting vsini values range from
          3  to  135  km/s.  For  the  bona-fide gamma Doradus stars, the
          majority has vsini below 60 km/s.

          Authors: Alex Golovin, Elena Pavlenko
          Comments: Accepted to JAAVSO vol. 34
          We  present  an analysis of the RZ Cassiopeia O-C diagram for a
          30-year  period,  based on data published by the AAVSO. The new
          parabolic   light-elements   are   determined   and  P-dot  was
          estimated. This enabled us to establish the value of M-dot, the
          rate  of the mass transfer between components of this eclipsing
          binary.  Deviations from the parabola in the RZ Cas O-C diagram
          have  a  wavelike trend. The pulsation of the primary component
          influences  the scatter of O-C points, as well as it influences
          the  shape  of  the  eclipse.  Some physical points on such O-C
          behavior are presented.

          We  consider  nearby  young  black holes formed after supernova
          explosions  in  close  binaries  whose secondary components are
          currently  observed  as the so-called runaway stars. Using data
          on  runaway  stars  and making reasonable assumptions about the
          mechanisms  of  supernova  explosions  and  binary  breakup, we
          estimate  the present position of nearby young black holes. For
          two  objects, we obtained relatively small error regions ($\sim
          50$-100  deg$^2$).  The  possibility  of detecting these nearby
          young black holes is discussed.

          We  present  results  of  observations  of  the transient X-ray
          pulsar  V0332+53  performed  during a very powerful outburst in
          Dec, 2004 -- Feb, 2005 with the INTEGRAL and RXTE observatories
          in  a  wide  (3-100  keV)  energy  band.  A cyclotron resonance
          scattering  line  at  an energy of ~26 keV has been detected in
          the  source  spectrum together with its two higher harmonics at
          ~50  and  ~73 keV, respectively. We show that the energy of the
          line  is  not  constant  but  linearly  changes with the source
          luminosity.  Strong  pulse  profile variations, especially near
          the  cyclotron  line,  are revealed for different levels of the
          source  intensity.  We discuss the obtained results in terms of
          the theoretical models of X-ray pulsars.

          Title: The BATSE-Swift luminosity and redshift distributions of
          short-duration GRBs
          Authors: Dafne Guetta, Tsvi Piran
          We  compare  the luminosity function and rate inferred from the
          BATSE  short hard bursts (SHBs) peak flux distribution with the
          redshift  and  luminosity  distributions  of  SHBs  observed by
          Swift/HETE   II.   While   the  Swift/HETE  II  SHB  sample  is
          incompatible   with   SHB  population  that  follows  the  star
          formation rate, it is compatible with a SHB rate that reflect a
          distribution  of  delay  times after the SFR. This would be the
          case  if  SHBs are associated with binary neutron star mergers.
          The  available data allows, however, different interpretations.
          For  example,  a  population  whose  rate is independent of the
          redshift fits the data very well. The implied SHB rates that we
          find range from $\sim 8$ to $\sim
          30h_{70}^3$Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. This is a much higher rate than
          what  was previously estimated. A detailed (2 dimensional) look
          at the best fit models shows, however, some discrepancy between
          the four Swift/HETE II SHBs and the models based on BATSE SHBs.
          This  could  be  a  statistical fluke. It could also arise from
          wrong  estimates  of  the triggering criteria or from selection
          effects.  If  real  it  may  indicate  the existence of two SHB
          populations  with  different  luminosity functions and redshift
          distributions.

          Title:  Three-Body  Kick  to  a Bright Quasar out of Its Galaxy
          During a Merger
          Authors: Loren Hoffman, Abraham Loeb (Harvard U.)
          Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Nature
          The  quasar HE0450-2958 was recently discovered to reside ~7kpc
          away  from  a  galaxy  that  was  likely  disturbed by a recent
          merger.  The  lack  of  a  massive spheroid of stars around the
          quasar  raised  the unlikely suggestion that it may have formed
          in  a  dark galaxy. Here we explain this discovery as a natural
          consequence  of  a  dynamical kick imparted to the quasar as it
          interacted  with  a  binary  black  hole system during a galaxy
          merger  event.  The  typical stalling radius (~1pc) for a ~10^9
          solar  mass binary provides a kick of order the escape velocity
          of  the stellar spheroid, bringing the quasar out to around the
          observed radius before it turns around. This is consistent with
          the  observed  low relative velocity between the quasar and the
          merger-remnant  galaxy.  The  gas  carried  with the black hole
          throughout  the three-body interaction fuels the quasar for the
          duration of its journey, ~2x10^7 years. Gravitational radiation
          recoil could not have produced the required kick.

          Title:  Possible  evidence  for  the ejection of a supermassive
          black hole from an ongoing merger of galaxies
          Authors:  Martin  G.  Haehnelt  (IoA), Melvyn B. Davies (Lund),
          Martin J. Rees (IoA)
          Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX, no figures; MNRAS in press
          Attempts  of  Magain  et al (2005) to detect the host galaxy of
          the  bright  QSO  HE0450--2958  have  not  been  successful. We
          suggest  that  the supermassive black hole powering the QSO was
          ejected from the observed ULIRG at the same redshift and at 1.5
          arcsec distance. Ejection could have either be caused by recoil
          due  to gravitational wave emission from a coalescing binary of
          supermassive  black  holes  or  the  gravitational slingshot of
          three or more supermassive black holes in the ongoing merger of
          galaxies  which  triggered the starburst activity in the ULIRG.
          We  discuss implications for the possible hierarchical build-up
          of  supermassive  black  holes from intermediate and/or stellar
          mass   black   holes,  and  for  the  detection  of  coalescing
          supermassive binary black holes by LISA.

          Title:  Rotational  Broadening of Atomic Spectral Features from
          Neutron Stars
          Authors: P. Chang, S. Morsink, L. Bildsten, I. Wasserman
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, to appear in ApJ Letters
          The  discovery of the first gravitationally redshifted spectral
          line from a neutron star (NS) by Cottam, Paerels and Mendez has
          triggered  theoretical  studies  of  the physics of atomic line
          formation  in  NS  atmospheres.  Chang,  Bildsten and Wasserman
          showed  that  the hydrogenic Fe H$\alpha$ line formed above the
          photosphere  of  a  bursting  NS is intrinsically broad. We now
          include  rotational  broadening  within  general relativity and
          compare  the  resulting  profile to that observed during Type I
          bursts  from  EXO  0748-676.  We  show  that the fine structure
          splitting  of the line precludes a meaningful constraint on the
          radius.  Our  fitting of the data show that the line forming Fe
          column    is    ${\rm    log}_{10}    (N_{\rm   Fe,   n=2}/{\rm
          cm^{-2}})=17.9_{-0.42}^{+0.27}$ and gravitational redshift $1+z
          =1.345_{-0.008}^{+0.005}$ with 95% confidence. We calculate the
          detectability  of  this  spectral  feature for a large range of
          spins  and  inclinations  assuming that the emission comes from
          the  entire  surface.  We find that at 300 (600) Hz only 10-20%
          (5-10%)  of  NSs  would  have spectral features as deep as that
          seen in EXO 0748-676.

          Title:  Exposing  the Nuclear Burning Ashes of Radius Expansion
          Type I X-ray Bursts
          Authors:  Nevin  N.  Weinberg  (Caltech,  KITP),  Lars Bildsten
          (KITP, UCSB), Hendrik Schatz (MSU, JINA)
          Comments: 15 pages, 15 figures (emulateapj), accepted to ApJ
          We  solve  for  the  evolution  of  the  vertical extent of the
          convective  region of a neutron star atmosphere during a Type I
          X-ray  burst. The convective region is well-mixed with ashes of
          nuclear  burning and its extent determines the rise time of the
          burst  light  curve.  Using a full nuclear reaction network, we
          show  that the maximum vertical extent of the convective region
          during   photospheric  radius  expansion  (RE)  bursts  can  be
          sufficiently  great that: (1) some ashes of burning are ejected
          by  the radiation driven wind during the RE phase and, (2) some
          ashes  of  burning  are  exposed  at  the  neutron star surface
          following the RE phase. We find that ashes with mass number A ~
          30  -  60  are mixed in with the ejected material. We calculate
          the  expected  column  density  of ejected and surface ashes in
          hydrogen-like states and determine the equivalent widths of the
          resulting  photoionization edges from both the wind and neutron
          star  surface.  We  find  that  these can exceed 100 eV and are
          potentially  detectable.  A  detection  would probe the nuclear
          burning processes and might enable a measurement of the neutron
          star  gravitational  redshift.  In  addition,  we  find that in
          bursts with pure helium burning layers, protons from (alpha, p)
          reactions  cause  a  rapid onset of the 12C(p, gamma)13N(alpha,
          p)16O  reaction  sequence. The sequence bypasses the relatively
          slow  12C(alpha, gamma)16O reaction and leads to a sudden surge
          in  energy production that is directly observable as a rapid (~
          ms) increase in flux during burst rise.

          Title: The Local Rate and the Progenitor Lifetime of Short-Hard
          Gamma-Ray Bursts: Synthesis and Predictions for LIGO
          Authors: Ehud Nakar, Avishay Gal-Yam, Derek B. Fox
          The  properties  of the short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) with
          known  host-galaxies  suggest  that  these events result from a
          long-lived progenitor system. The most popular progenitor model
          of  SHBs invokes the merger of either double neutron star (DNS)
          binaries  or  neutron  star-black  hole  (NS-BH)  systems. Such
          events  produce  strong  gravitational waves (GWs) at frequency
          range   that  is  accessible  to  current  and  next-generation
          ground-based  GW  observatories.  In  this  work we combine the
          census of SHB observations with refined theoretical analysis to
          critically  evaluate  the  compact  binary progenitor model. We
          then explore the implications for GW detection of these events.
          Beginning  from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic
          time,  we  consider  what  intrinsic  luminosity  and  lifetime
          distributions  can  reproduce  both the known SHB redshifts and
          luminosities, and the peak flux distribution of the large BATSE
          SHB  sample.  We  find  that (1) Short progenitor lifetimes, <3
          Gyr,  are ruled out, and lifetimes of about 6 Gyr favored. This
          result  is  difficult to reconcile with the observed properties
          of  the  DNS  population  in  our  galaxy. We show that for DNS
          systems to remain viable SHB progenitors, a large population of
          old  undetectable  NS  binaries must be postulated. (2) We find
          that  the  local  rate  of SHBs is at least 10 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 and
          likely as high as 10^5 Gpc^-3 yr-1, significantly above earlier
          estimates.  (3)  We find that assuming that SHBs do result from
          compact   binaries,  either  through  the  old  DNS  population
          mentioned   above   or   from   NS-BH  mergers,  our  resulting
          predictions  for the LIGO event rate are extremely encouraging:
          several   detections   per  year  may  be  expected  at  design
          sensitivity,   and   the   first   coincident   observation  of
          electromagnetic  and  gravitational  radiation  from an SHB may
          well be made with current facilities.

          Title: Binary and Millisecond Pulsars

          URL
          Journal-ref: Living Rev. Relativity 8, (2005), 7
          We review the main properties, demographics and applications of
          binary  and  millisecond  radio pulsars. Our knowledge of these
          exciting  objects has greatly increased in recent years, mainly
          due  to  successful surveys which have brought the known pulsar
          population   to   over  1700.  There  are  now  80  binary  and
          millisecond pulsars associated with the disk of our Galaxy, and
          a  further 103 pulsars in 24 of the Galactic globular clusters.
          Recent  highlights  have  been  the discovery of the first ever
          double  pulsar  system  and  a  recent flurry of discoveries in
          globular clusters, in particular Terzan 5.

          Title:  Astrometric  Light-Travel  Time signature of sources in
          nonlinear motion
          Authors: Guillem Anglada, Jordi Torra
          Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures
          Context:Very  precise  planned  space  astrometric missions and
          recent  improvements on imaging capabilities require a detailed
          review of the assumptions of classical astrometric modeling.
          Aims:We  show that Light-Travel Time must be taken into account
          to  model  the  kinematics of astronomical objects in nonlinear
          motion, even at stellar distances.
          Methods:A closed expression to include Light-Travel Time in the
          actual  astrometric  models  with nonlinear motion is provided.
          Using   a   perturbative   approach   the   expression  of  the
          Light-Travel  Time signature is derived. We propose a practical
          form  of the astrometric modelling to be applied in astrometric
          data reduction of sources at stellar distances($d>1 pc$).
          Results  :We  show  that  the  Light-Travel  Time  signature is
          relevant  at  $\muas$  accuracy (or even at $mas$) depending on
          the  time  span of the astrometric measurements. We explain how
          information  about  the  radial  motion  of  a  source  can  be
          obtained. Some estimative numbers are provided for known nearby
          binary systems
          Conclusions  :In the light of the obtained results, it is clear
          that  this  effect  must be taken into account to interpret any
          kind   of  precise  astrometric  measurements.  The  effect  is
          particularly  interesting  in  measurements  performed  by  the
          planned   astrometric   space  missions  (GAIA,  SIM,  JASMINE,
          TPF/DARWIN).  Finally  an  objective  criterion  is provided to
          quickly  evaluate  whether  the  Light-Travel  Time modeling is
          required for a given source or system.

          26-30   September   2005,   from  a  detailed  paper  (Mowlavi,
          Kreykenbohm, Shaw et al) submitted to A&A in September 2005
          We  present the spectral and temporal analysis of the 2004/2005
          outburst  of  the  transient  X-ray pulsar V0332+53 as observed
          with  Integral. After the discovery of the third cyclotron line
          in  phase averaged spectra (Kreykenbohm et al 2005, Pottschmidt
          et   al  2005),  detailed  pulse  phase  spectroscopy  revealed
          remarkably  little  variability  of the cyclotron lines through
          the  4.4s  X-ray  pulse  (Pottschmidt  et  al 2005). During the
          decline  of  the  outburst,  the  flux  was  observed  to decay
          exponentially  until  2005  Feb 10 and linearly thereafter. The
          spectrum  was  found  to  become  harder  with  time, while the
          folding energy remained constant. The energy of the fundamental
          cyclotron  line  increased  with  time from 26.5kev in the RXTE
          observation  up  to 29.5kev in the last Integral one indicating
          that the emission region is moving closer to the surface of the
          neutron  star.  For  a  detailed  analysis,  see  Mowlavi et al
          (2005).

          Title: Investigating Galaxy Evolution with Chandra

          Comments:  To  be  included  in  the  proceedings of the 'X-ray
          universe  2005  meeting'  held  in  San  Lorenzo de El Escorial
          (Spain), 26-30 Sep 2005
          Chandra  observations show the importance of the X-ray band for
          studying the evolution of galaxies. Binary X-ray sources are an
          easily  detectable  tracer  of  the stellar population. Chandra
          studies  of  these  populations are giving us insights into the
          nature  and  formation of these binaries, and provide the basis
          for   diagnostics   of   galaxy  evolution.  With  Chandra  and
          XMM-Newton  we  can  explore relatively poorly known aspects of
          the black hole population of the universe: ultra-luminous X-ray
          sources,  that may be connected with the 'missing' intermediate
          mass  black  holes  predicted  by hierarchical galaxy and black
          hole  formation  scenarios;  and quiescent supermassive nuclear
          black  holes and their surroundings, as a way to understand the
          full  range  of  the  AGN  phenomenon.  Finally, the X-ray band
          provides  the  only  way  to  explore  hot plasmas in galaxies;
          recent  observations  are  revealing  the  importance  of these
          plasmas as vehicles of both chemical enrichment and energy.
