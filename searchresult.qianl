          Title: OVI in Elliptical Galaxies: Indicators of Cooling Flows
          Authors:  Joel  N. Bregman, Eric D. Miller, Alex E. Athey, Jimmy

          Comments: 49 pages, 26 figures, ApJ, in press
          Early-type   galaxies   often   contain  a  hot  X-ray  emitting
          interstellar medium (3-8E6 K) with an apparent radiative cooling
          time  much  less  than  a Hubble time. If unopposed by a heating
          mechanism, the gas will radiatively cool to temperatures <= 10E4
          K  at  a  rate proportional to L_X/T_X, typically 0.03-1 M_solar
          yr^-1.  We can test if gas is cooling through the 3E5 K range by
          observing  the  OVI doublet, whose luminosity is proportional to
          the  cooling  rate.  Here  we  report  on a study of an unbiased
          sample  of  24 galaxies, obtaining Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic
          Explorer  spectra  to  complement  the  X-ray data of ROSAT} and
          Chandra.  The OVI line emission was detected in about 40% of the
          galaxies  and  at  a  luminosity level similar to the prediction
          from  the  cooling  flow  model.  There is a correlation between
          Mdot_OVI  and  Mdot_X,  although there is significant dispersion
          about the relationship, where the OVI is brighter or dimmer than
          expected  by  a  factor  of  three  or more. If the cooling flow
          picture is to be retained, this dispersion requires that cooling
          flows  be  time-dependent,  as might occur by the activity of an
          AGN.  However,  of  detected  objects, those with the highest or
          lowest  values  of Mdot_OVI/Mdot_X are not systematically hot or
          cool, as one might predict from AGN heating.

          Title:  On  the spin-up/spin-down transitions in accreting X-ray
          binaries
          Authors:  Rosalba  Perna  (Colorado/JILA),  Enrico  Bozzo  (OAR,
          Rome), Luigi Stella (OAR, Rome)
          Comments:  37  pages,  11 figures, accepted to the Astrophysical
          Journal
          Accreting  X-Ray  Binaries  display  a wide range of behaviours.
          Some  of  them  are  observed  to  spin  up  steadily, others to
          alternate   between  spin-up  and  spin-down  states,  sometimes
          superimposed  on  a longer trend of either spin up or spin down.
          Here  we interpret this rich phenomenology within a new model of
          the  disk-magnetosphere  interaction.  Our  model,  based on the
          simplest  version  of a purely material torque, accounts for the
          fact  that,  when  a  neutron star is in the propeller regime, a
          fraction  of the ejected material does not receive enough energy
          to  completely  unbind,  and  hence falls back into the disk. We
          show  that  the  presence of this feedback mass component causes
          the occurrence of multiple states available to the system, for a
          given,  constant  value of the mass accretion rate dot{M}_* from
          the companion star. If the angle chi of the magnetic dipole axis
          with  respect  to the perpendicular to the disk is larger than a
          critical  value  chi_crit,  the  system  eventually settles in a
          cycle  of  spin-up/spin-down transitions for a constant value of
          dot{M}_*  and independent of the initial conditions. No external
          perturbations  are  required to induce the torque reversals. The
          transition  from  spin up to spin down is often accompanied by a
          large  drop  in  luminosity. The frequency range spanned in each
          cycle and the timescale for torque reversals depend on dot{M}_*,
          the magnetic field of the star, the magnetic colatitude chi, and
          the  degree  of  elasticity  regulating  the  magnetosphere-disk
          interaction. The critical angle chi_crit ranges from \~25-30 deg
          for a completely elastic interaction to ~40-45 deg for a totally
          anelastic  one.  For  chi  ~<  chi_crit,  cycles  are  no longer
          possible  and  the  long-term  evolution of the system is a pure
          spin  up.  We  specifically illustrate our model in the cases of
          the X-ray binaries GX 1+4 and 4U 1626-67.

          We  present  an  analysis  of  the  2-150  keV  spectrum  of the
          transient  X-ray  pulsar  V0332+53  taken  with  the Rossi X-Ray
          Timing  Explorer  (RXTE)  in  2004  December.  We  report on the
          detection  of  three cyclotron resonance features at 27, 51, and
          74  keV  in  the  phase-averaged  data, corresponding to a polar
          magnetic  field  of  2.7  x 10^12 G. After 4U0115+63, this makes
          V0332+53  the  second  accreting neutron star in which more than
          two  cyclotron  lines have been detected; this has now also been
          confirmed   by   INTEGRAL.   Pulse-phase   spectroscopy  reveals
          remarkably  little variability of the cyclotron line through the
          4.4 s X-ray pulse.

          25 pages, 14 figures
          We  investigate  the  properties  of massive galaxies at z=1-3.5
          using   HST  observations,  ground-based  near-IR  imaging,  and
          Spitzer Space Telescope observations at 3-24 micron. We identify
          153 distant red galaxies (DRGs) with J-K > 2.3 mag (Vega) in the
          southern  GOODS  field. This sample is approximately complete in
          stellar  mass  for passively evolving galaxies above 10^11 solar
          masses  and z < 3. The galaxies identified by this selection are
          roughly   split   between  objects  whose  optical  and  near-IR
          rest-frame  light  is  dominated  by evolved stars combined with
          ongoing star formation, and galaxies whose light is dominated by
          heavily  reddened  starbursts.  Very few of the galaxies (< 10%)
          have   no  indication  of  current  star  formation.  Using  SFR
          estimates  that  include the reradiated IR emission, the DRGs at
          z=1.5-3  with  stellar masses > 10^11 solar masses have specific
          SFRs (SFRs per unit stellar mass) ranging from 0.2 to 10 Gyr^-1,
          with a mean value of ~2.4 Gyr^-1. The DRGs with stellar masses >
          10^11 solar masses and 1.5 < z < 3 have integrated specific SFRs
          greater the global value over all galaxies. In contrast, we find
          that  galaxies  at  z  = 0.3-0.75 with these stellar masses have
          integrated  specific  SFRs  less than the global value, and more
          than an order of magnitude lower than that for massive DRGs at z
          =  1.5-3.  At  z  <  1, lower-mass galaxies dominate the overall
          cosmic  mass  assembly.  This  suggests  that  the  bulk of star
          formation  in massive galaxies occurs at early cosmic epochs and
          is largely complete by z~1.5. [Abridged]

          Title:  Bimodal  Galaxies  and  Bimodality  in  Globular Cluster
          Systems
          Authors: Duncan A. Forbes
          Comments:  11 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, accepted for publication
          in ApJ Letters
          Various  galaxy properties are not continuous over a large range
          in   mass,   but   rather  reveal  a  remarkable  transition  or
          `bimodality'  at  a  stellar  mass  of  3  x  10^{10}  Mo. These
          properties  include  colors,  stellar populations, Xray emission
          and  mass-to-light ratios. This behavior has been interpreted as
          the  transition  from  hot  to  cold  flows  by Dekel & Birnboim
          (2005).
          Here  we  explore  whether  globular  cluster  (GC) systems also
          reveal a bimodal nature with regard to this critical mass scale.
          Globular  clusters  probe  star formation at early epochs in the
          Universe  and  survive subsequent galaxy mergers and accretions.
          We  use  new  data  from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (Peng etal
          2005),  which  provides  a  homogeneous sample of the GC systems
          around one hundred Virgo early-type galaxies covering a range of
          five  hundred  in  galaxy  mass.  Their classification of the GC
          color  distributions  is  taken to examine a key quantity -- the
          number  of  GCs  per  unit galaxy luminosity. Below the critical
          mass, this quantity (called the GC specific frequency) increases
          dramatically  in its mean value and spread. This increase may be
          due  to  regulated star formation in low mass galaxies, which in
          turn  is  due to mass loss via winds and the transition from hot
          to  cold  gas  accretion  flows.  We  also  note  that above the
          critical mass, galaxies possess two GC subpopulations (with blue
          and  red  mean  colors)  but below this mass, galaxies reveal an
          increasing proportion of single (blue) GC systems.

          Title:  Millihertz  Quasi-Periodic  Oscillations from Marginally
          Stable Nuclear Burning on an Accreting Neutron Star
          Authors:  Alexander Heger (1,2), Andrew Cumming (3), Stanford E.
          Woosley (2) ((1) LANL, (2) UCSC, (3) McGill)
          Comments: 10 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  investigate marginally stable nuclear burning on the surface
          of  accreting  neutron  stars  as  an  explanation  for  the mHz
          quasi-periodic  oscillations (QPOs) observed from three low mass
          X-ray  binaries.  At  the  boundary  between unstable and stable
          burning,  the temperature dependence of the nuclear heating rate
          and  cooling  rate  almost  cancel. The result is an oscillatory
          mode  of  burning,  with  an  oscillation  period  close  to the
          geometric  mean  of the thermal and accretion timescales for the
          burning  layer.  We  describe  a  simple  one-zone  model  which
          illustrates  this  basic  physics,  and  then  present  detailed
          multizone  hydrodynamical  calculations of nuclear burning close
          to  the  stability  boundary  using  the KEPLER code. Our models
          naturally  explain the characteristic 2 minute period of the mHz
          QPOs, and why they are seen only in a very narrow range of X-ray
          luminosities.   The  oscillation  period  is  sensitive  to  the
          accreted hydrogen fraction and the surface gravity, suggesting a
          new  way  to  probe these parameters. A major puzzle is that the
          accretion   rate   at  which  the  oscillations  appear  in  the
          theoretical models is an order of magnitude larger than the rate
          implied  by  the X-ray luminosity when the mHz QPOs are seen. We
          discuss  the  implications  for  our  general  understanding  of
          nuclear  burning  on accreting neutron stars. One possibility is
          that  the accreted material covers only part of the neutron star
          surface at luminosities Lx > ~1E37 erg/s.

          We  have  studied  the  nuclear  activity  in  a  sample  of six
          quiescent   early-type  galaxies,  with  new  Chandra  data  and
          archival  HST  optical  images. Their nuclear sources have X-ray
          luminosities  ~  10^{38}  - 10^{39} erg/s (L_X/L_Edd ~ 10^{-8} -
          10^{-7}),  and  colors  or  spectra  consistent  with  accreting
          supermassive  black holes (SMBHs)--except for the nucleus of NGC
          4486B, which is softer than typical AGN spectra. In a few cases,
          the  X-ray  morphology  of  the  nuclear  sources shows hints of
          marginally  extended  structures, in addition to the surrounding
          diffuse  thermal  emission  from hot gas, which is detectable on
          scales  >~  1  kpc.  In  one  case  (NGC 5845), a dusty disk may
          partially  obstruct  our  direct  view  of  the  SMBH.  We  have
          estimated  the  temperature  and density of the hot interstellar
          medium,  which  is  one  major  source of fuel for the accreting
          SMBH;  typical  central  densities  are  n_e  ~  (0.02 +/- 0.01)
          cm^{-3}.  Assuming  that  the hot gas is captured by the SMBH at
          the Bondi rate, we show that the observed X-ray luminosities are
          too  faint  to  be  consistent with standard disk accretion, but
          brighter  than  predicted  by  radiatively-inefficient solutions
          (eg,  ADAF).  In  total,  there are ~ 20 galaxies for which SMBH
          mass,   hot  gas  density,  and  nuclear  X-ray  luminosity  are
          simultaneously  known.  In  some  cases, the nuclear sources are
          brighter  than predicted by the ADAF model; in other cases, they
          are  consistent  or  fainter.  We  discuss  the apparent lack of
          correlations  between  Bondi  rate  and  X-ray  luminosity,  and
          suggest  that, in order to understand the observed distribution,
          we  need  to  know  two additional parameters: the amount of gas
          supplied  by the stellar population inside the accretion radius,
          and the fraction (possibly << 1) of the total gas available that
          is  accreted  by  the SMBH. We shall discuss these issues in our
          Paper II.

          Title: A High-Mass Protobinary System in the Hot Core W3(H2O)
          Authors: Huei-Ru Chen, William J. Welch, David J. Wilner, Edmund
          C. Sutton
          Comments:  38  pages,  9  figures, accepted by The Astrophysical
          Journal
          We  have observed a high-mass protobinary system in the hot core
          W3(H2O)  with  the BIMA Array. Our continuum maps at wavelengths
          of   1.4mm   and   2.8mm   both  achieve  sub-arcsecond  angular
          resolutions  and  show  a  double-peaked morphology. The angular
          separation   of  the  two  sources  is  1.19"  corresponding  to
          2.43X10^3  AU  at  the  source  distance  of  2.04 kpc. The flux
          densities  of the two sources at 1.4mm and 2.8mm have a spectral
          index  of  3,  translating  to an opacity law of kappa ~ nu. The
          small  spectral  indices  suggest that grain growth has begun in
          the  hot core. We have also observed 5 K components of the CH3CN
          (12-11)  transitions.  A radial velocity difference of 2.81 km/s
          is found towards the two continuum peaks. Interpreting these two
          sources as binary components in orbit about one another, we find
          a  minimum  mass  of  22 Msun for the system. Radiative transfer
          models  are constructed to explain both the continuum and methyl
          cyanide    line   observations   of   each   source.   Power-law
          distributions  of  both  density  and  temperature  are derived.
          Density  distributions close to the free-fall value, r^-1.5, are
          found  for both components, suggesting continuing accretion. The
          derived  luminosities  suggest  the  two sources have equivalent
          zero-age  main  sequence  (ZAMS)  spectral  type  B0.5 - B0. The
          nebular masses derived from the continuum observations are about
          5 Msun for source A and 4 Msun for source C. A velocity gradient
          previously  detected  may  be  explained  by  unresolved  binary
          rotation with a small velocity difference.

          Title:   Formation   of   Magnetically  Supported  Disks  During
          Hard-to-Soft Transition in Black Hole Accretion Flows

          Comments:  Accepted  to  PASJ,  27  pages, 8 figures. For higher
          resolution figures, see this http URL
          We    carried    out    three-dimensional    global    resistive
          magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the cooling instability
          in  optically  thin  hot  black hole accretion flows by assuming
          bremsstrahlung   cooling.   General   relativistic  effects  are
          simulated  by  using  the  pseudo-Newtonian  potential.  Cooling
          instability grows when the density of the accretion disk becomes
          sufficiently  large.  We found that as the instability grows the
          accretion   flow  changes  from  an  optically  thin,  hot,  gas
          pressure-supported   state   (low/hard   state)   to  a  cooler,
          magnetically   supported,   quasi-steady   state.   During  this
          transition,  magnetic  pressure exceeds the gas pressure because
          the disk shrinks in the vertical direction almost conserving the
          toroidal  magnetic  flux.  Since further vertical contraction of
          the disk is suppressed by magnetic pressure, the cool disk stays
          in an optically thin, spectrally hard state. In the magnetically
          supported  disk,  the  heating  rate balances with the radiative
          cooling  rate.  The  magnetically supported disk exists for time
          scale  much longer than the thermal time scale and comparable to
          the accretion time scale.
          We  examined  the  stability  of the magnetically supported disk
          analytically,  assuming  that  the  toroidal  magnetic  flux  is
          conserved,  and  found  it  thermally  and secularly stable. Our
          findings may explain why black hole candidates stay in luminous,
          X-ray   hard  state  even  when  their  luminosity  exceeds  the
          threshold for the onset of the cooling instability.

          SINFONI.  The  observed  spectrum  is  featureless  and  can  be
          described  by  a  power law. We show for the first time that the
          spectral  index  is  correlated  with the instantaneous flux and
          that both flux and spectral index experience significant changes
          within  less  than  one  hour.  We  argue that the near infrared
          flares   from   Sgr  A*  are  due  to  synchrotron  emission  of
          transiently  heated  electrons,  the  emission being affected by
          orbital   dynamics  and  synchrotron  cooling,  both  acting  on
          timescales  of  ~20 minutes. The synchrotron cooling process may
          account  for  the observed variation in spectral index, which in
          turn  requires  a  magnetic  field  ~30G,  consistent  with  the
          equipartition  field  in  a hot accretion flow with an accretion
          rate of ~10^{-8} solar masses per year.

          Title:   Steady   shocks   around   black   holes   produced  by
          sub-keplerian flows with negative energy
          Authors: D. Molteni, G. Gerardi, V. Teresi
          Comments:  5  pages, 5 figures, accepted by MNRAS on 10 November
          2005
          We discuss a special case of formation of axisymmetric shocks in
          the accretion flow of ideal gas onto a Schwarzschild black hole:
          when the total energy of the flow is negative. The result of our
          analysis  enlarges  the  parameter  space for which these steady
          shocks  are  exhibited  in  the accretion of gas rotating around
          relativistic   stellar   objects.  Since  keplerian  disks  have
          negative  total energy, we guess that, in this energy range, the
          production  of  the shock phenomenon might be easier than in the
          case of positive energy. So our outcome reinforces the view that
          sub-keplerian  flows  of  matter  may  significantly  affect the
          physics  of  the  high energy radiation emission from black hole
          candidates.  We  give  a simple procedure to obtain analytically
          the  position  of  the  shocks. The comparison of the analytical
          results  with  the  data  of  1D  and  2D axisymmetric numerical
          simulations confirms that the shocks form and are stable.

          Title:   Spitzer/IRAC   Photometry   of   the  Eta  Chameleontis
          Association
          Authors:  S.  T. Megeath (1), L. Hartmann (2), K. L. Luhman (3),
          G. G. Fazio (1)
          Comments: Accepted to ApJ letters
          We present IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 micron photometry for the 17
          A,  K  and  M  type members of the Eta Chameleontis association.
          These  data  show infrared excesses toward six of the 15 K and M
          stars, indicating the presence of circumstellar disks around 40%
          of  the  stars  with masses of 0.1-1 solar mass. The two A-stars
          show no infrared excesses. The excess emission around one of the
          stars  is  comparable to the median excess for classical T Tauri
          stars  in  the  Taurus  association;  the  remaining  five  show
          comparatively   weak   excess   emission.  Taking  into  account
          published  Halpha  spectroscopy  that shows that five of the six
          stars   are  accreting,  we  argue  that  the  disks  with  weak
          mid-infrared  excesses  are  disks in which the inner disks have
          been  largely  depleted  of small grains by grain growth, or, in
          one  case,  the  small grains have settled to the midplane. This
          suggests that Eta Cha has a much higher fraction of disks caught
          in  the act of transitioning into optically thin disks than that
          measured in younger clusters and associations.

          Title: Red AGN in XMM-Newton/SDSS fields
          Authors: A. Georgakakis (1,2), I. Georgantopoulos (2), A. Akylas
          (2) ((1) Imperial College, (2) National Athens Observatory)
          Comments: Accepted by MNRAS
          In  this  paper  we  combine archival and proprietary XMM-Newton
          observations  (about 5deg^2) that overlap with the Sloan Digital
          Sky  Survey  to  explore  the  nature  of  the  moderate-z X-ray
          population. We focus on X-ray sources with optically red colours
          (g-r>0.4),  which  we  argue are important for understanding the
          origin   of   the   X-ray  background.  Firstly,  these  systems
          constitute  a  significant fraction, about 2/3, of the z<1 X-ray
          population  to  the  limit  f(2-8keV)~2e-14cgs.  Secondly, their
          luminosity   function  under  evolution  of  the  form  ~(1+z)^3
          suggests that they could be responsible for about 17 per cent of
          the  diffuse  X-ray  background  to  z=1. Thirdly, their stacked
          X-ray  spectrum  in  the  range  1-8keV  is  consistent  with  a
          power-law distribution with Gamma~1.4 (without fitting intrinsic
          absorption),  i.e.  similar  to the diffuse X-ray background. We
          find  that  the optically red X-ray population comprises a mixed
          bag  of objects, both obscured (N_H>1e22 cm^{-2}) and unobscured
          (N_H<1e22  cm^{-2}),  with a wide range of X-ray luminosities up
          L_X~1e44cgs. We argue that dilution of the AGN light by the host
          galaxy may play a role in shaping the continuum optical emission
          of  this  population. Finally, we explore a possible association
          of  these  sources  and  the  moderate-z  red  (J-Ks>2mag)  AGNs
          identified  in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). The median
          N_H of the red X-ray sources studied here is ~1e21cm^{-2}, lower
          than  that  found  for  the  2MASS  AGNs,  suggesting  different
          populations.

          Comments: accepted to be published in ApJ, 9 Figures
          We  present sub-arcsecond resolution IRAM PdBI interferometry of
          eight  submillimeter  galaxies at redshifts from 2 to 3.4, where
          we detect continuum at 1mm and/or CO lines at 3 and 1 mm. The CO
          3-2/4-3  line profiles in five of the sources are double-peaked,
          indicative of orbital motion either in a single rotating disk or
          of  a  merger of two galaxies. The millimeter line and continuum
          emission is compact; we marginally resolve the sources or obtain
          tight  upper  limits  to their intrinsic sizes in all cases. The
          median  FWHM  diameter  for  these  sources  and  the previously
          resolved  sources,  SMMJ023952-0136  and SMMJ140104+0252 is less
          than  or  equal  to 0.5" (4 kpc). The compactness of the sources
          does  not  support  a  scenario  where the far-IR/submm emission
          comes  from  a  cold,  very  extended  dust  distribution. These
          measurements  clearly  show  that  the submillimeter galaxies we
          have  observed  resemble scaled-up and more gas rich versions of
          the  local  Universe,  ultra-luminous galaxy (ULIRG) population.
          Their  central  densities  and  potential  well  depths are much
          greater  than  in  other  redshift 2-3 galaxy samples studied so
          far.  They  are  comparable  to  those of elliptical galaxies or
          massive  bulges.  The  SMG  properties  fulfill  the criteria of
          'maximal' starbursts, in which most of the available initial gas
          reservoir of 10^10-10^11 solar masses is converted to stars on a
          few dynamical timescales.

          We  report  the discovery of a 16th magnitude star, HE0437-5439,
          with   a   heliocentric   radial   velocity  of  +723+-3km/s.  A
          quantitative   spectral   analysis  of  high-resolution  optical
          spectra  obtained  with  the VLT and the UVES spectrograph shows
          that   HE0437-5439   is   a   main  sequence  B-type  star  with
          Teff=20350K,  log  g=3.77, solar within a factor of a few helium
          abundance  and  metal content, rotating at v sin i=54km/s. Using
          appropriate evolutionary tracks we derive a mass of 8 Msun and a
          corresponding  distance  of  61  kpc.  Its  galactic  rest frame
          velocity  is  at  least 563km/s, almost twice the local Galactic
          escape  velocity,  indicating  that  the  star is unbound to the
          Galaxy.  Numerical  kinematical  experiments  are carried out to
          constrain  its  place  of birth. It has been suggested that such
          hyper-velocity  stars can be formed by the tidal disruption of a
          binary  through interaction with the super-massive black hole at
          the  Galactic  center  (GC).  HE0437-5439 needs about 100Myrs to
          travel  from the GC to its presentposition, much longer than its
          main sequence lifetime of 25Myrs. This can only be reconciled if
          HE0437-5439  is  a  blue  straggler  star.  In  this  case,  the
          predicted proper motion is so small that it can only be measured
          by  future  space missions. Since the star is much closer to the
          Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, 18kpc) than to the GC, it can reach
          its  position  from  the  center  of  the LMC. The proper motion
          predicted  in  this  case is about 2mas/y (relative to the LMC),
          large  enough to be measurable with conventional techniques from
          the   ground.   The  LMC  origin  could  also  be  tested  by  a
          high-precision abundance analysis.

          Title: US 708 - An unbound hyper-velocity subluminous O star
          Authors: H.A. Hirsch, U. Heber, S.J. O'Toole, F. Bresolin
          Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
          We  report  the  discovery of an unbound hyper-velocity star, US
          708,  in the Milky Way halo, with a heliocentric radial velocity
          of  +708+-15km/s.  A quantitative NLTE model atmosphere analysis
          of  optical  spectra  obtained with LRIS at the Keck I telescope
          shows  that  US  708 is an extremely helium-rich (N(He)/N(H)=10)
          subluminous  O  type  star  with  Teff=44500K,  log  g=5.23 at a
          distance  of 19kpc. Its Galactic rest frame velocity is at least
          751km/s,  much  higher  than  the local Galactic escape velocity
          indicating  that  the star is unbound to the Galaxy. It has been
          suggested  that  such  hyper-velocity stars can be formed by the
          tidal  disruption  of  a  binary  through  interaction  with the
          super-massive  black  hole  (SMBH)  at the Galactic centre (GC).
          Numerical kinematical experiments are carried out to reconstruct
          the  path  from the GC.U S 708 needs about 32Myrs to travel from
          the  GC  to  its  present  position,  less than its evolutionary
          lifetime.     Its    predicted    proper    motion    mue(alpha)
          cos(delta)=-2.3mas/y    and   mue(delta)=-2.4mas/y   should   be
          measurable  by  future space missions. We conjecture that US 708
          is  formed  by  the merger of two helium white dwarfs in a close
          binary  induced  by  the interaction with the SMBH in the GC and
          then escaped.

          The basic theory of dynamic tides in close binaries is reviewed.
          Particular attention is paid to resonances between dynamic tides
          and free oscillation modes and to the role of the apsidal-motion
          rate in probing the internal structure of binary components. The
          discussed  effects  are generally applicable to stars across the
          entire   Hertzsprung-Russell   diagram,   including  the  binary
          OB-stars discussed at this meeting.

          Title: Turbulent Mixing in the Outer Solar Nebula
          Authors: N. J. Turner, K. Willacy, G. Bryden, H. W. Yorke
          Comments:  To  appear  in the Astrophysical Journal; 20 pages, 9
          figures
          The effects of turbulence on the mixing of gases and dust in the
          outer  Solar  nebula  are examined using 3-D MHD calculations in
          the shearing-box approximation with vertical stratification. The
          turbulence  is driven by the magneto-rotational instability. The
          magnetic  and hydrodynamic stresses in the turbulence correspond
          to  an  accretion  time  at  the  midplane  about  equal  to the
          lifetimes  of  T  Tauri  disks,  while  accretion in the surface
          layers  is  thirty  times  faster. The mixing resulting from the
          turbulence  is  also  fastest  in the surface layers. The mixing
          rate  is  similar  to  the  rate  of  radial exchange of orbital
          angular  momentum, so that the Schmidt number is near unity. The
          vertical  spreading  of  a  trace  species  is  well-matched  by
          solutions   of   a   damped  wave  equation  when  the  flow  is
          horizontally-averaged.  The  damped wave description can be used
          to  inexpensively  treat mixing in 1-D chemical models. However,
          even  in  calculations  reaching a statistical steady state, the
          concentration  at  any  given  time  varies  substantially  over
          horizontal planes, due to fluctuations in the rate and direction
          of  the transport. In addition to mixing species that are formed
          under  widely  varying conditions, the turbulence intermittently
          forces  the  nebula  away  from  local chemical equilibrium. The
          different transport rates in the surface layers and interior may
          affect estimates of the grain evolution and molecular abundances
          during the formation of the Solar system.

          Compton  Gamma  Ray  Observatory,  OSSE, SMM, TGRS, balloon and
          recent  INTEGRAL  data  reveal  a  feature  of  the  0.511  MeV
          annihilation  radiation  of  the Galactic Center with a flux of
          approximately  5x  10^{-4}~0.511 MeV photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. We
          argue that e+e- pairs can be generated when the X-ray radiation
          photons  and ~10-30 MeV photons interact with each other in the
          compact  region  in  the proximity of the Galactic Center black
          hole.  In fact, disks formed near black holes of 10^{17} g mass
          should  emit  the  ~ 10 MeV temperature blackbody radiation. If
          positron  e+ sources are producing about 10^{42} e+ s^{-1} near
          the  Galactic  Center  they would annihilate on the way out and
          result  in 0.511 MeV emission. We suggest that the annihilation
          radiation   can   be   an   observational  consequence  of  the
          interaction  of  the accretion disk radiation of the SMall Mass
          Black  Holes  (SMMBHs)  with  X-ray  radiation  in the Galactic
          Center.  This  is probably the only way to identify and observe
          these SMMBHs.

          Galaxies
          Authors:   Filippo  Fraternali,  James  Binney  (University  of

          MNRAS. High resolution version available at this http URL
          Recent HI observations reveal that the discs of spiral galaxies
          are  surrounded  by  extended gaseous haloes. This extra-planar
          gas  reaches  large  distances  (several kpc) from the disc and
          shows  peculiar  kinematics  (low rotation and inflow). We have
          modelled  the extra-planar gas as a continuous flow of material
          from  the  disc  of  a  spiral galaxy into its halo region. The
          output of our models are pseudo-data cubes that can be directly
          compared  to  the  HI data. We have applied these models to two
          spiral   galaxies   (NGC891   and  NGC2403)  known  to  have  a
          substantial  amount of extra-planar gas. Our models are able to
          reproduce  accurately the vertical distribution of extra-planar
          gas for an energy input corresponding to a small fraction (<4%)
          of  the energy released by supernovae. However they fail in two
          important  aspects: 1) they do not reproduce the right gradient
          in  rotation velocity; 2) they predict a general outflow of the
          extra-planar  gas,  contrary  to what is observed. We show that
          neither  of  these  difficulties  can  be removed if clouds are
          ionized and invisible at 21cm as they leave the disc but become
          visible  at some point on their orbits. We speculate that these
          failures  indicate  the need for accreted material from the IGM
          that   could  provide  the  low  angular  momentum  and  inflow
          required.

          Comments: 10 pages, 6 colour figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          Recent  observations  of the distant Universe suggest that much
          of  the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at
          $z>1$. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation
          because  massive  halos  are  assembled  late  in  hierarchical
          cosmologies  such  as cold dark matter (CDM). In this paper, we
          discuss  a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model
          in  which  feedback  due  to  active  galactic  nuclei (AGN) is
          assumed   to  quench  cooling  flows  in  massive  halos.  This
          mechanism  naturally  creates  a  break  in  the  local  galaxy
          luminosity   function   at  bright  magnitudes.  The  model  is
          implemented   within  the  Millennium  N-body  simulation;  the
          accurate   dark   matter  merger  trees  and  large  number  of
          realizations   of   the   galaxy  formation  process  that  the
          simulation  provides  results  in  highly  accurate statistics.
          After  adjusting  the  values of the physical parameters in the
          model  by reference to the properties of local galaxies, we use
          it  to  investigate  the evolution of the K-band luminosity and
          galaxy  stellar  mass  functions.  We also calculate the volume
          averaged  star  formation  rate  density  of  the Universe as a
          function  of  redshift and the way in which this is apportioned
          amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts
          a  substantial  population  of massive galaxies out to redshift
          $z\sim  5$  and  a star formation rate density which rises with
          increasing   redshift   in  objects  of  all  masses.  Although
          observational  data  on  these  properties  have  been cited as
          evidence  for  ``anti-hierarchical''  galaxy formation, we find
          that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally
          hierachical  CDM  model  provides  a  very  good match to these
          observations.

          Our  X-ray study of the nuclear activity in a new sample of six
          quiescent  early-type galaxies, and in a larger sample from the
          literature,  confirmed  (Soria  et al., Paper I) that the Bondi
          accretion  rate  of  diffuse hot gas is not a good indicator of
          the  supermassive  black  hole (SMBH) X-ray luminosity. Here we
          suggest  that  a  more  reliable estimate of the accretion rate
          must  include the gas released by the stellar population inside
          the  sphere  of influence of the SMBH, in addition to the Bondi
          inflow   of  hot  gas  across  that  surface.  We  use  optical
          surface-brightness profiles to estimate the mass-loss rate from
          stars  in  the  nuclear  region: we show that for our sample of
          galaxies  it  is  an  order  of  magnitude  higher (~ 10^{-4} -
          10^{-3}  M_sun/yr)  than  the  Bondi inflow rate of hot gas, as
          estimated  from  Chandra (Paper I). Only by taking into account
          both  sources of fuel can we constrain the true accretion rate,
          the  accretion  efficiency,  and  the power budget. Radiatively
          efficient  accretion  is  ruled  out,  for quiescent SMBHs. For
          typical  radiatively  inefficient  flows,  the  observed  X-ray
          luminosities  of  the SMBHs imply accretion fractions ~ 1 - 10%
          (ie,  ~  90 - 99% of the available gas does not reach the SMBH)
          for  at  least five of our six target galaxies, and most of the
          other   galaxies   with  known  SMBH  masses.  We  discuss  the
          conditions   for   mass   conservation  inside  the  sphere  of
          influence,  so  that  the  total  gas  injection is balanced by
          accretion  plus  outflows. We show that a fraction of the total
          accretion power (mechanical plus radiative) would be sufficient
          to  sustain  a self-regulating, slow outflow which removes from
          the  nuclear  region all the gas that does not sink into the BH
          (``BH  feedback'').  The  rest  of  the  accretion power may be
          carried  out  in  a jet, or advected. We also discuss scenarios
          that would lead to an intermittent nuclear activity.

          In   this   work   we   present  a  system  for  the  automatic

          performed  by  a  Bayesian  ensemble of neural networks trained
          with   {\em  Hipparcos}  data  of  seven  different  categories
          including  eccentric  binary systems and two types of pulsating

          Comments:  4  pages, one figure, proceedings of the 2005 Gdansk
          meeting PN as astronomical tools, in press
          The  common  envelope  interaction  is  responsible for evolved
          close  binaries.  Among them are a minority of central stars of
          planetary  nebula  (PN). Recent observational results, however,
          point to most PN actually being in binary systems. We therefore
          ask  the  question  if  it  is  feasible that most, or even all
          Galactic  PN  derive  from  a  common envelope interaction. Our
          recent  calculation finds that if all single and binary primary
          stars with mass between ~1-8 Mo eject a PN, there would be many
          more  PN  in  the  galaxy than observed. On the other hand, the
          predicted   number  of  post-common  envelope  PN  is  more  in
          agreement  with the total number of PN in the Galaxy. This is a
          new  indication that binary interactions play a functional role
          in the creation of PN and an encouragement to intensify efforts
          to detect binary companions.

          Authors: Sergey Mashchenko, H. M. P. Couchman, Alison Sills
          Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ApJ
          Using  a  large  set  of  high resolution numerical simulations
          incorporating  non-equilibrium molecular hydrogen chemistry and
          a  constant source of external radiation, we study gas collapse
          in   previously   photo-ionized   mini-galaxies   with   virial
          temperatures  less than 10^4 K in the early universe (redshifts
          z=10-20). We confirm that the mechanism of positive feedback of
          ionizing  radiation on star formation in mini-galaxies proposed
          by  Ricotti,  Gnedin, & Shull (2002) can be efficient despite a
          significant  flux of metagalactic photo-dissociating radiation.
          We  derive  critical  fluxes  for  the  Lyman-Werner background
          radiation   sufficient  to  prevent  the  collapse  of  gas  in
          mini-galaxies  as a function of the virial mass of the halo and
          redshift.  In  our  model,  the  formation  of mini-galaxies in
          defunct HII regions is most efficient at large redshifts (z>15)
          and/or  for  large local gas overdensity delta>10. We show that
          non-equilibrium chemistry plays an important dynamical role not
          only  during  the initial evolutionary phase leading to the gas
          becoming  gravitationally  unstable  inside  the mini-halo, but
          also  at the advanced stages of the core collapse, resulting in
          efficient  gas  accretion in the core region. We speculate on a
          possible connection between our objects and metal-poor globular
          clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

          Compton  Gamma  Ray  Observatory,  OSSE,  SMM, TGRS, balloon and
          recent   INTEGRAL  data  reveal  a  feature  of  the  0.511  MeV
          annihilation  radiation  of  the  Galactic Center with a flux of
          approximately  5x  10^{-4}~0.511  MeV photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. We
          argue  that e+e- pairs can be generated when the X-ray radiation
          photons  and  ~10-30 MeV photons interact with each other in the
          compact  region  in  the  proximity of the Galactic Center black
          hole.  In  fact, disks formed near black holes of 10^{17} g mass
          should  emit  the  ~  10 MeV temperature blackbody radiation. If
          positron  e+  sources are producing about 10^{42} e+ s^{-1} near
          the  Galactic  Center  they  would annihilate on the way out and
          result  in  0.511 MeV emission. We suggest that the annihilation
          radiation can be an observational consequence of the interaction
          of  the  accretion  disk radiation of the SMall Mass Black Holes
          (SMMBHs)  with  X-ray  radiation in the Galactic Center. This is
          probably the only way to identify and observe these SMMBHs.

          Title:  A  Dynamical  Model  for  the Extra-planar Gas in Spiral
          Galaxies
          Authors: Filippo Fraternali, James Binney (University of Oxford)
          Comments:  19  pages,  20  figures,  accepted for publication in
          MNRAS. High resolution version available at this http URL
          Recent  HI observations reveal that the discs of spiral galaxies
          are surrounded by extended gaseous haloes. This extra-planar gas
          reaches  large  distances  (several kpc) from the disc and shows
          peculiar  kinematics (low rotation and inflow). We have modelled
          the  extra-planar  gas as a continuous flow of material from the
          disc  of a spiral galaxy into its halo region. The output of our
          models  are  pseudo-data  cubes that can be directly compared to
          the HI data. We have applied these models to two spiral galaxies
          (NGC891  and  NGC2403)  known  to  have  a substantial amount of
          extra-planar  gas.  Our  models are able to reproduce accurately
          the  vertical  distribution  of  extra-planar  gas for an energy
          input  corresponding  to  a  small  fraction (<4%) of the energy
          released  by  supernovae.  However  they  fail  in two important
          aspects: 1) they do not reproduce the right gradient in rotation
          velocity;  2) they predict a general outflow of the extra-planar
          gas, contrary to what is observed. We show that neither of these
          difficulties  can be removed if clouds are ionized and invisible
          at  21cm as they leave the disc but become visible at some point
          on  their  orbits. We speculate that these failures indicate the
          need  for  accreted material from the IGM that could provide the
          low angular momentum and inflow required.

          Comments: 10 pages, 6 colour figures. Submitted to MNRAS
          Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of
          the  stellar  mass  of  bright  galaxies was already in place at
          $z>1$.  This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation
          because   massive  halos  are  assembled  late  in  hierarchical
          cosmologies  such  as  cold dark matter (CDM). In this paper, we
          discuss  a  new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model
          in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed
          to  quench  cooling  flows  in  massive  halos.  This  mechanism
          naturally  creates  a  break  in  the  local  galaxy  luminosity
          function  at  bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within
          the  Millennium  N-body  simulation;  the  accurate  dark matter
          merger  trees  and  large  number  of realizations of the galaxy
          formation process that the simulation provides results in highly
          accurate  statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical
          parameters  in the model by reference to the properties of local
          galaxies,  we  use it to investigate the evolution of the K-band
          luminosity  and galaxy stellar mass functions. We also calculate
          the  volume averaged star formation rate density of the Universe
          as  a  function  of  redshift  and  the  way  in  which  this is
          apportioned  amongst  galaxies  of  different  mass.  The  model
          robustly  predicts  a substantial population of massive galaxies
          out  to  redshift  $z\sim  5$  and a star formation rate density
          which  rises  with increasing redshift in objects of all masses.
          Although  observational data on these properties have been cited
          as  evidence for ``anti-hierarchical'' galaxy formation, we find
          that  when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally
          hierachical  CDM  model  provides  a  very  good  match to these
          observations.

          Our  X-ray  study of the nuclear activity in a new sample of six
          quiescent  early-type  galaxies, and in a larger sample from the
          literature,  confirmed  (Soria  et  al., Paper I) that the Bondi
          accretion rate of diffuse hot gas is not a good indicator of the
          supermassive black hole (SMBH) X-ray luminosity. Here we suggest
          that a more reliable estimate of the accretion rate must include
          the  gas released by the stellar population inside the sphere of
          influence  of  the  SMBH, in addition to the Bondi inflow of hot
          gas  across  that  surface.  We  use  optical surface-brightness
          profiles  to  estimate  the  mass-loss  rate  from  stars in the
          nuclear region: we show that for our sample of galaxies it is an
          order  of  magnitude  higher (~ 10^{-4} - 10^{-3} M_sun/yr) than
          the  Bondi  inflow  rate  of  hot gas, as estimated from Chandra
          (Paper  I). Only by taking into account both sources of fuel can
          we  constrain the true accretion rate, the accretion efficiency,
          and  the  power budget. Radiatively efficient accretion is ruled
          out,  for  quiescent  SMBHs. For typical radiatively inefficient
          flows,  the  observed  X-ray  luminosities  of  the  SMBHs imply
          accretion  fractions  ~ 1 - 10% (ie, ~ 90 - 99% of the available
          gas does not reach the SMBH) for at least five of our six target
          galaxies, and most of the other galaxies with known SMBH masses.
          We  discuss  the  conditions  for  mass  conservation inside the
          sphere of influence, so that the total gas injection is balanced
          by accretion plus outflows. We show that a fraction of the total
          accretion  power (mechanical plus radiative) would be sufficient
          to  sustain  a  self-regulating, slow outflow which removes from
          the  nuclear  region  all the gas that does not sink into the BH
          (``BH  feedback'').  The  rest  of  the  accretion  power may be
          carried  out  in  a  jet, or advected. We also discuss scenarios
          that would lead to an intermittent nuclear activity.

          non-equilibrium  chemistry plays an important dynamical role not
          only  during  the  initial evolutionary phase leading to the gas
          becoming gravitationally unstable inside the mini-halo, but also
          at  the  advanced  stages  of  the  core  collapse, resulting in
          efficient  gas  accretion  in the core region. We speculate on a
          possible  connection between our objects and metal-poor globular
          clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

          Title:  The  Dynamical  Evolution  of  Black  Hole-Neutron Star
          Binaries in General Relativity: Simulations of Tidal Disruption
          Authors:  Joshua  A.  Faber,  Thomas  W.  Baumgarte,  Stuart L.
          Shapiro, Keisuke Taniguchi, Frederic A. Rasio
          Comments:  32  pages, 16 figures, 2 tables, RevTeX, accepted by
          PRD
          We  calculate  the  first dynamical evolutions of merging black
          hole-neutron  star  binaries  that construct the combined black
          hole-neutron   star   spacetime   in   a  general  relativistic
          framework.  We  treat  the  metric  in  the  conformal flatness
          approximation,   and   assume  that  the  black  hole  mass  is
          sufficiently large compared to that of the neutron star so that
          the  black  hole  remains  fixed  in  space. Using a spheroidal
          spectral methods solver, we solve the resulting field equations
          for  a  neutron  star  orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole. The
          matter  is  evolved  using a relativistic, Lagrangian, smoothed
          particle  hydrodynamics (SPH) treatment. We take as our initial
          data  recent  quasiequilibrium  models for synchronized neutron
          star   polytropes  generated  as  solutions  of  the  conformal
          thin-sandwich   (CTS)   decomposition  of  the  Einstein  field
          equations.  We  are able to construct from these models relaxed
          SPH  configurations whose profiles show good agreement with CTS
          solutions.  Our  adiabatic  evolution  calculations for neutron
          stars  with  low  compactness  show that mass transfer, when it
          begins  while  the  neutron  star  orbit  is  still outside the
          innermost  stable  circular  orbit,  is  more  unstable than is
          typically  predicted  by  analytical formalisms. This dynamical
          mass  loss  is found to be the driving force in determining the
          subsequent  evolution of the binary orbit and the neutron star,
          which  typically  disrupts  completely  within  a  few  orbital
          periods.  The  majority  of the mass transferred onto the black
          hole is accreted promptly; a significant fraction (~30%) of the
          mass  is  shed  outward  as  well,  some  of  which will become
          gravitationally unbound and ejected completely from the system.
          The  remaining portion forms an accretion disk around the black
          hole,  and  could  provide the energy source for short-duration
          gamma ray bursts.

          Demonstration Tool

          Comments:  16 pages, 4 color figures, one line figure. Accepted
          for March 2006 issue of Publ. Ast. Soc. Pacific
          We  present  the  software  tool  FITDisk, a precompiled-binary
          Windows  GUI  version  of  our  smoothed particle hydrodynamics
          cataclysmic  variable accretion disk research code. Cataclysmic
          variables  are  binary  star systems in which a compact stellar
          remnant, typically a white dwarf star, is stripping mass from a
          lower-main-sequence companion star by way of an accretion disk.
          Typically  the  disk  is the brightest component of the system,
          because the plasma is heated dramatically as it spirals down in
          the  gravitational  well  of  the primary white dwarf star. The
          shortest-period    systems   can   display   disk   "superhump"
          oscillations   driven  by  the  rotating  tidal  field  of  the
          secondary  star.  FITDisk models these accretion disk phenomena
          using  a fully three-dimensional hydrodynamics calculation, and
          data  can  be visualized as they are computed or stored to hard
          drive  for later playback at a fast frame rate. Simulations are
          visualized  using  OpenGL graphics and the viewing angle can be
          changed interactively. Pseudo light curves of simulated systems
          can  be  plotted  along  with  the associated Fourier amplitude
          spectrum.   FITDisk   is   available   for   free  download  at

          Title:  The  Evolution  of  the Water Distribution in a Viscous
          Protoplanetary Disk
          Authors: Fred J. Ciesla, Jeffrey N. Cuzzi
          Comments:  45  pages,  7  figures,  revised  for publication in
          Icarus
          (Abridged)    Astronomical   observations   have   shown   that
          protoplanetary  disks are dynamic objects through which mass is
          transported  and  accreted  by  the central star. Age dating of
          meteorite  constituents  shows  that their creation, evolution,
          and  accumulation occupied several Myr, and over this time disk
          properties   would  evolve  significantly.  Moreover,  on  this
          timescale,  solid  particles  decouple from the gas in the disk
          and their evolution follows a different path. Here we present a
          model  which tracks how the distribution of water changes in an
          evolving   disk   as   the   water-bearing  species  experience
          condensation,  accretion,  transport,  collisional destruction,
          and  vaporization.  Because solids are transported in a disk at
          different rates depending on their sizes, the motions will lead
          to  water  being  concentrated  in  some  regions of a disk and
          depleted  in  others.  These  enhancements  and  depletions are
          consistent  with  the conditions needed to explain some aspects
          of  the  chemistry  of  chondritic  meteorites and formation of
          giant  planets.  The  levels of concentration and depletion, as
          well  as  their  locations,  depend  strongly  on  the combined
          effects of the gaseous disk evolution, the formation of rapidly
          migrating  rubble, and the growth of immobile planetesimals. We
          present  examples  of  evolution  under  a  range  of plausible
          assumptions  and  demonstrate how the chemical evolution of the
          inner  region  of a protoplanetary disk is intimately connected
          to the physical processes which occur in the outer regions.

          Title:  Eddington-limited  X-ray Bursts as Distance Indicators.
          II. Possible Compositional Effects in Bursts from 4U 1636-536

          Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, accepted by ApJ
          We analyzed 123 thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts observed by
          the  Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer from the low-mass X-ray binary
          4U  1636-536.  All  but two of the 40 radius-exansion bursts in
          this sample reached peak fluxes which were normally distributed
          about  a  mean of 6.4e-8 ergs/cm^2/s, with a standard deviation
          of 7.6%. The remaining two radius-expansion bursts reached peak
          fluxes a factor of 1.69+/-0.13 lower than this mean value; as a
          consequence,  the  overall  variation  in  the peak flux of the
          radius-expansion  bursts  was a factor of ~2. This variation is
          comparable to the range of the Eddington limit between material
          with solar H-fraction (X=0.7) and pure He. Such a variation may
          arise  if,  for the bright radius-expansion bursts, most of the
          accreted  H  is  eliminated either by steady hot CNO burning or
          expelled  in a radiatively-driven wind. However, steady burning
          cannot  exhaust  the  accreted H for solar composition material
          within  the  typical  ~2  hr  burst recurrence time, nor can it
          result   in   sufficient   elemental  stratification  to  allow
          selective  ejection of the H only. An additional stratification
          mechanism  appears  to  be  required  to  separate the accreted
          elements  and thus allow preferential ejection of the hydrogen.
          We  found  no  evidence for a gap in the peak flux distribution
          between  the  radius-expansion and non-radius expansion bursts,
          previously observed in smaller samples. Assuming that the faint
          radius-expansion  bursts reached the Eddington limit for H-rich
          material (X~0.7), and the brighter bursts the limit for pure He
          (X=0), we estimate the distance to 4U 1636-536 (for a canonical
          neutron  star  with  M_NS=1.4M_sun, R_NS=10 km) to be 6.0+/-0.5
          kpc, or for M_NS=2M_sun at most 7.1 kpc. (Abstract abridged)

          Comments:  18 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in The
          Astrophysical Journal
          We  present  mid-infrared  spectra of the nearby, Ultraluminous
          Infrared  Galaxy  NGC  6240  taken with the IRS on Spitzer. The
          spectrum  of  NGC  6240  is  dominated by strong fine-structure
          lines,  rotational  H2 lines, and PAH emission features. The H2
          line fluxes suggest molecular gas at a variety of temperatures.
          A  simple  two-temperature  fit  to the S(0) through S(7) lines
          implies  a mass of 6.7E6 solar masses at T=957K and 1.6E9 solar
          masses  at T=164K, or about 15% of the total molecular gas mass
          in  this  system.  Noteably,  we  have  detected the [NeV] 14.3
          micron   emission  line,  with  a  flux  of  5E-14  erg/cm^2/s,
          providing  the  first direct detection of the buried AGN in the
          mid-infrared.   Modelling   of  the  total  SED  from  near  to
          far-infrared  wavelengths  requires  the presence of a hot dust
          (T=700K)  component,  which  we  also associate with the buried
          AGN.  The  small  [NeV]/[NeII]  and  [NeV]/IR  flux ratios, the
          relative  fraction  of  hot dust emission, as well as the large
          6.2  micron  PAH  EQW,  are all consistent with an apparent AGN
          contribution   of  only  3-5%  to  the  bolometric  luminosity.
          However,  correcting  the measured [NeV] flux by the extinction
          implied  by  the  silicate  optical  depth and our SED fitting,
          suggests  an  intrinsic  fractional  AGN  contribution  to  the
          bolometric  luminosity  of about 20-24% in NGC 6240, which lies
          within the range implied by fits to the hard X-ray spectrum.

          Title:  QPO  as  the Rosetta Stone for understanding black hole
          accretion
          Authors: Marek A. Abramowicz
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
          Journal-ref: Astronomische Nachrichten / AN 326, No. 9 (2005)
          Quasi  periodic  oscillations (QPO) seen in the X-ray fluxes of
          individual neutron stars and black hole sources are one of most
          intriguing phenomena in today's astrophysics. The QPO nature is
          visibly  determined by super-strong Einstein's gravity. I argue
          here  that  it also profoundly depends on the MRI turbulence in
          accretion  flows.  Understanding  the QPO physics may therefore
          guide accretion theory out of its present state of confusion.

          Title:  A  prominent  relativistic  iron  line in the Seyfert 1
          MCG-02-14-009
          Authors: Delphine Porquet
          Comments:  Accepted  for  publication,  A&A Letters, 5 pages, 3
          figures, and 1 table
          I  report  the  discovery of a prominent broad and asymmetrical
          feature  near  6.4 keV in the Seyfert 1 MCG-02-14-009 (z=0.028)
          with  XMM-Newton/EPIC.  The present short X-ray observation (PN
          net  exposure  time  ~5  ks)  is  the first one above 2 keV for
          MCG-02-14-009.  The  feature  can  be  explained  by  either  a
          relativistic   iron   line   around   either   a  Schwarzschild
          (non-rotating)  or a Kerr (rotating) black hole. If the feature
          is  a relativistic iron line around a Schwarzschild black hole,
          the  line  energy  is 6.51 (+0.21,-0.12) keV with an equivalent
          width  of  631 (+259,-243) eV and that the inclination angle of
          the   accretion   disc  should  be  less  than  43  degrees.  A
          relativistically  blurred  photoionized disc model gives a very
          good  spectral  fit over the broad band 0.2-12keV energy range.
          The  spectrum  is  reflection dominated and this would indicate
          that  the primary source in MCG-02-14-009 is located very close
          to  the black hole, where gravitational light bending effect is
          important  (about  3-4 Rg), and that the black hole may rapidly
          rotate.

          The  low mass X-ray binary system 4U 1812-12 was monitored with
          the  INTEGRAL  observatory  in  the  period  2003-2004 and with
          BeppoSAX  on April 20, 2000. We report here on the spectral and
          temporal  analysis  of  both persistent and burst emission. The
          full  data  set confirms the persistent nature of this burster,
          and  reveals  the  presence  of  emission  up  to  200 keV. The
          persistent  spectrum  is  well  described  by  a comptonization
          (CompTT)  model plus a soft blackbody component. The source was
          observed  in  a hard spectral state with a 1-200 keV luminosity
          of  2*10^(36)  ergs/s  and  L/LEdd~1%  and  no  meaningful flux
          variation  has  been revealed, as also confirmed by a 2004 RXTE
          observation.  We  have  also  detected  4 bursts showing double
          peaked profiles and blackbody spectra with temperatures ranging
          from 1.9 to 3.1 keV.

          Title:  Evolution  of Massive Blackhole Triples I -- Equal-mass
          binary-single systems
          Authors: Masaki Iwasawa, Yoko Funato, Junichiro Makino
          Comments: 20 pages, 12 figures
          We  present  the  result  of  $N$-body simulations of dynamical
          evolution  of triple massive blackhole (BH) systems in galactic
          nuclei.  We found that in most cases two of the three BHs merge
          through gravitational wave (GW) radiation in the timescale much
          shorter  than the Hubble time, before ejecting one BH through a
          slingshot.  In  order  for a binary BH to merge before ejecting
          out  the third one, it has to become highly eccentric since the
          gravitational  wave  timescale  would  be  much longer than the
          Hubble time unless the eccentricity is very high. We found that
          two  mechanisms  drive  the increase of the eccentricity of the
          binary.   One   is  the  strong  binary-single  BH  interaction
          resulting in the thermalization of the eccentricity. The second
          is  the  Kozai  mechanism which drives the cyclic change of the
          inclination  and  eccentricity  of the inner binary of a stable
          hierarchical  triple  system.  Our  result implies that many of
          supermassive blackholes are binaries.

          Title: Saturn's internal structure and carbon enrichment
          Authors: Olivier Mousis, Yann Alibert, Willy Benz
          Comments: accepted in A&A
          We  use  the clathrate hydrate trapping theory to calculate the
          enrichments  in  O,  N,  S,  Xe, Ar and Kr compared to solar in
          Saturn's  atmosphere.  For  this, we calibrate our calculations
          using  two different carbon abundance determinations that cover
          the  domain  of measurements published in the last decades: one
          derived   from   the   NASA   $Kuiper$   Airborne   Observatory
          measurements and the other obtained from the Cassini spacecraft
          observations.   We   show   that  these  two  different  carbon
          abundances  imply  quite  a  different  minimum  heavy  element
          content  for  Saturn.  Using  the  Kuiper  Airborne Observatory
          measurement  for  calibration,  the  amount of ices accreted by
          Saturn  is  found to be consistent with current interior models
          of   this   planet.  On  the  other  hand,  using  the  Cassini
          measurement  for  calibration  leads  to  an ice content in the
          planet's envelope which is higher than the one derived from the
          interior  models. In this latter case, reconciling the interior
          models  with the amount of C measured by the Cassini spacecraft
          requires  that  significant differential sedimentation of water
          and  volatile  species  have  taken  place in Saturn's interior
          during its lifetime.

          We   have  computed  models  for  ultraluminous  X-ray  sources
          ("ULXs")  consisting  of  a black-hole accretor of intermediate
          mass  ("IMBH"; e.g., ~1000 Msun) and a captured donor star. For
          each of four different sets of initial donor masses and orbital
          separations, we computed 30,000 binary evolution models using a
          full  Henyey  stellar  evolution code. To our knowledge this is
          the  first  time that a population of X-ray binaries this large
          has been carried out with other than approximation methods, and
          it  serves  to  demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to
          large-scale  population  studies  of mass-transfer binaries. In
          the  present  study,  we find that in order to have a plausible
          efficiency  for  producing active ULX systems with IMBHs having
          luminosities   >   10^{40}   ergs/sec,   there  are  two  basic
          requirements  for  the capture of companion/donor stars. First,
          the  donor stars should be massive, i.e., > 8 Msun. Second, the
          initial  orbital  separations, after circularization, should be
          close,  i.e., < 6-30 times the radius of the donor star when on
          the  main  sequence. Even under these optimistic conditions, we
          show  that  the  production  rate  of IMBH-ULX systems may fall
          short of the observed values by factors of 10-100.

          Title:  Discovery  and  disentangling  of  multi-mode delta-Sct
          pulsations in the eclipsing binary V994 Her
          Authors: S. Dallaporta, U. Munari
          Comments: submitted on Oct 27 to IBVS
          Accurate   and  extensive  photoelectric  photometry  has  been
          obtained  of  V994  Her  which  was  discovered as an eclipsing
          binary  by  Hipparcos satellite. A marked pulsation activity is
          evident   in   the   light-curve,   with  periods  0.152100488,
          0.116836079   and   0.09466580  day  that  appears  to  be  the
          contemporanous   presence  of  fundamental,  first  and  second
          overtone  periods  of  a  multi-mode  delta-Sct  pulsation. The
          latter is observed to remain stable in amplitude and phase over
          the whole observaing campaign that lasted between June 10, 2002
          and July 15, 2004.

          Title:  Entropy  Profiles in the Cores of Cooling Flow Clusters
          of Galaxies

          (except for a typo correction in the abstract)
          The  X-ray  properties  of  a  relaxed  cluster of galaxies are
          determined  primarily  by  its gravitational potential well and
          the  entropy distribution of its intracluster gas. That entropy
          distribution reflects both the accretion history of the cluster
          and  the  feedback  processes  which  limit the condensation of
          intracluster  gas.  Here we present Chandra observations of the
          core  entropy  profiles of nine classic "cooling-flow" clusters
          that appear relaxed and contain intracluster gas with a cooling
          time  less  than  a  Hubble  time.  We  show that those entropy
          profiles  are  remarkably  similar,  despite  the fact that the
          clusters  range  over  a  factor  of three in temperature. They
          typically  have  an  entropy level of ~ 130 keV cm^2 at 100 kpc
          that  declines  to  a  plateau ~10 keV cm^2 at \lesssim 10 kpc.
          Between  these  radii, the entropy profiles are \propto r^alpha
          with  alpha ~ 1.0 - 1.3. The non-zero central entropy levels in
          these   clusters   correspond  to  a  cooling  time  ~10^8  yr,
          suggesting  that  episodic  heating on this timescale maintains
          the central entropy profile in a quasi-steady state.

          Title: Lithium isotopes in population II dwarfs
          Authors: Laurent Piau
          Comments: 18 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables
          We  investigate  the history of $^6$Li and $^7$Li in population
          II  dwarfs  during the pre main sequence and main sequence. The
          evolution  is  followed  using  the  CESAM code and taking into
          account  the  most  recent  physics.  The effective temperature
          ranges  from $\approx$ 4700 K to $\approx$ 6400 K and therefore
          concerns  objects on the so-called Spite plateau and cooler. We
          find  the  $^7$Li  pre  main  sequence  depletion  is unable to
          account for the observations in the halo whatever the effective
          temperature.   This   supports  microscopic  diffusion  and  an
          additional  non  standard mixing process both acting during the
          main  sequence.  On  the  contrary  the  models $^6$Li pre main
          sequence   depletion  appears  too  strong  and  is  marginally
          compatible with recent detections.
          During the main sequence we introduce the effects of tachocline
          diffusion.  This  process  is  a  rotationnally  induced mixing
          acting  at  the  top  of  the  radiative core. We show that the
          differences  in  the  early  rotation  history cannot result in
          scattered lithium abundances on the Spite plateau. Moreover the
          tachocline  mixing  process  predicts $^7$Li abundances in good
          agreement   with  the  observations.  We  briefly  address  the
          question  of  turn off $^7$Li poor stars. A modest accretion of
          lithium  free  matter  would  be  enough  to  explain their low
          abundance in this element.
          We  expect  the  scatter  in $^7$Li abundances is correlated to
          variations  in  [Fe/O]  ratio  for  dwarfs  cooler than 5500 K.
          Finally  the  tachocline  mixing  is robust with respect to the
          recent  $^6$Li  observations  around the turn-off. We similarly
          suggest  the [Fe/O] should be higher in objects with $^6$Li and
          effective temperature below 6000 K.

          Many  EHB stars have been found in short-period binaries, where
          the companions in these post-common envelope systems are either
          white  dwarfs  or dM stars; these systems are catalogued as hot
          subdwarfs  because the subdwarf is the more luminous component.
          Hypothesized  Roche-lobe  overflow  systems  (with more massive
          companions) may largely be uncatalogued, since the G band or Ca
          II  K-line  from  the  companion  may  have  caused  them to be
          overlooked  or discarded. In particular, many candidate objects
          were excluded from the PG catalog because of such spectroscopic
          indicators.  Could  these  rejects  include  large  numbers  of
          "missing"  hot  subdwarfs?  We  have  examined 2MASS, SDSS, and
          GALEX  archival data for large subsets of these rejected stars,
          and conclude that only a handful (about 3%) show indications of
          binarity; most are consistent with (single) metal-poor F stars,
          as was originally supposed.

          Title:  The  Nature of the Late-Type Companions in Hot Subdwarf
          Composite-Spectrum Binaries

          Meeting  on  Hot  Subdwarf Stars and Related Objects, 6-10 June
          2005  (La  Palma,  Canary  Islands,  Spain) to appear in Baltic
          Astronomy
          We  present  the results of a study of the late-type companions
          in  hot  subdwarf composite spectrum binaries. The exact nature
          of   these  late-type  companions  has  been  disputed  in  the
          literature -- some argue that they are main sequence stars, and
          others  have  claimed  they  are  subgiants.  To  determine the
          properties  of  the  late-type companions, we first conducted a
          survey  utilizing the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) All-Sky
          Data  Release Catalog to identify composite-colored binaries in
          the  "Catalogue  of Spectroscopically Identified Hot Subdwarfs"
          (Kilkenny,  Heber,  & Drilling 1988, 1992). We then conducted a
          spectroscopic    study   of   a   sub-sample   of   the   2MASS
          composite-colored   hot   subdwarfs.  The  sample  consists  of
          photometrically  and spectroscopically single and composite hot
          subdwarfs  (14  single  and  51  composite).  We  also obtained
          spectra  of 59 single late-type stars with Hipparcos parallaxes
          for calibration. We used measured equivalent width (EW) indices
          from  the  composite  systems  to  estimate the temperature and
          gravity of the late-type star, taking into account the dilution
          of  its  spectral  features  by  light  from  the hot subdwarf.
          Results from combining the spectroscopic data with model energy
          distributions   indicate   that  the  late-type  companions  in
          composite-spectrum  systems are best described by main sequence
          companions overall.

          Title:  Wind  accretion in the massive X-ray binary 4U 2206+54:
          abnormally slow wind and moderately eccentric orbit
          Authors:  M.  Ribo,  I.  Negueruela, P. Blay, J.M. Torrejon, P.
          Reig
          Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A
          Massive  X-ray binaries are usually classified depending on the
          properties  of  the  donor star in classical, supergiant and Be
          X-ray  binaries.  The  massive X-ray binary 4U 2206+54 does not
          fit  in  any  of these groups, and deserves a detailed study to
          understand  how  the transfer of matter and the accretion on to
          the  compact  object  take  place.  To this end we study an IUE
          spectrum  of  the  donor  and  obtain  a wind terminal velocity
          (v_inf) of ~350 km/s, which is abnormally slow for its spectral
          type.  We  also  analyse  here  more  than 9 years of available
          RXTE/ASM  data. We study the long-term X-ray variability of the
          source  and  find  it  to  be  similar  to that observed in the
          wind-fed  supergiant system Vela X-1, reinforcing the idea that
          4U  2206+54  is  also a wind-fed system. We find a quasi-period
          decreasing  from  ~270 to ~130 d, noticed in previous works but
          never  studied  in  detail.  We  discuss possible scenarios and
          conclude   that  long-term  quasi-periodic  variations  in  the
          mass-loss  rate  of  the  primary  are  probably  driving  such
          variability  in  the measured X-ray flux. We obtain an improved
          orbital  period  of  9.5591  d  with  maximum X-ray flux at MJD
          51856.6.  Our  study  of  the  orbital X-ray variability in the
          context  of  wind  accretion  suggests  a moderate eccentricity
          around  0.15.  Moreover,  the  low  value  of  v_inf solves the
          long-standing  problem  of the relatively high X-ray luminosity
          for  the  unevolved  nature of the donor, BD +53 2790, which is
          probably  an  O9.5 V star. We note that changes in v_inf and/or
          the  mass-loss  rate  of  the  primary alone cannot explain the
          diferent  patterns  displayed by the orbital X-ray variability.
          We  finally  emphasize  that 4U 2206+54, together with LS 5039,
          could  be  part of a new population of wind-fed HMXBs with main
          sequence  donors,  the  natural progenitors of supergiant X-ray
          binaries. (Abridged)

          We  present  optical  long-slit  spectra  of  the  Virgo  dwarf
          elliptical   galaxy  VCC  510  at  high  spectral  and  spatial
          resolution. Heliocentric velocities and velocity dispersions as
          functions   of   galaxy  radius  are  derived  by  deconvolving
          line-of-sight   velocity   distributions.  A  maximum  rotation
          v_rot=8  km/s  inside  half the effective radius (re~20 arcsec)
          and a mean, radially flat velocity dispersion sigma=44 km/s are
          measured.  The core extending over the inner 2 arcsec (~140 pc)
          is  found  to  rotate  in the opposite sense with v_rot(core) ~
          -1/2  v_rot.  VCC  510  (M_B  ~  -15.7) is therefore by far the
          faintest  and  smallest  galaxy  with  a  counter-rotating core
          known.  From the main body rotation and the velocity dispersion
          profile  we  deduce that VCC 510 is anisotropic and clearly not
          entirely   supported   by   rotation.  By  comparison  of  Lick
          absorption-line  indices  with  stellar  population  models  we
          derive  an  old  luminosity-weighted age (10 Gyr) and sub-solar
          metallicity  ([Z/H]=-0.4) inside the effective radius. There is
          tentative  evidence  that  the  counter-rotating  core might be
          younger and less alpha/Fe enhanced. From the stellar population
          parameters  we  obtain  a  total stellar mass-to-light ratio of
          ~3.6  (M/L_B)_sun  which  is  significantly  lower than a rough
          dynamical  estimate  obtained  from  the kinematics through the
          virial   theorem  (~15).  This  discrepancy  hints  toward  the
          possible  presence  of dark matter in the centre of VCC 510. We
          discuss  the  origin  of  the counter-rotating core and exclude
          fly-by  encounters  as  a  viable possibility. Gas accretion or
          galaxy  merging  provide  more  likely explanations. VCC 510 is
          therefore the direct observational evidence that such processes
          do occur in cluster satellite galaxies on dwarf galaxy scales.

          Title:  The  Highest Dynamical Frequency in the Inner Region of
          an Accretion Disk
          Authors:  M.  Ali Alpar (Sabanci University), Dimitrios Psaltis
          (U. of Arizona)
          Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJ Letters
          In the inner regions of accretion disks around compact objects,
          the  orbital  frequency  of  the  gas  deviates  from the local
          Keplerian  value. For long-wavelength modes in this region, the
          radial  epicyclic  frequency kappa is higher than the azimuthal
          frequency  Omega.  This has significant implications for models
          of the twin kHz QPOs observed in many neutron-star sources that
          traditionally identify the frequencies of the two kHz QPOs with
          dynamical  frequencies  in  the accretion disk. The recognition
          that the highest frequency in the transition or boundary region
          of  the  disk is actually the epicyclic frequency also modifies
          significantly  the  constraints  imposed  by the observation of
          high-frequency  QPOs  on  the  mass  and  radius of the compact
          objects.

          We  present  a photometric search for objects with point-source
          components   that  are  optically  variable  on  timescales  of
          weeks--months   in  the  Hubble  Ultra  Deep  Field  (HUDF)  to
          i'(AB)=28.0  mag.  The  data  are split into four sub-stacks of
          approximately  equal  exposure  times.  Objects  exhibiting the
          signature  of  optical variability are selected by studying the
          photometric  error  distribution  between  the  four  different
          epochs, and selecting 622 candidates as 3.0 sigma outliers from
          the original catalog of 4644 objects. Of these, 45 are visually
          confirmed  as  free  of  contamination  from close neighbors or
          various  types of image defects. Four lie within the positional
          error  boxes  of  Chandra  X-ray  sources, and two of these are
          spectroscopically   confirmed  AGN.  The  photometric  redshift
          distribution  of  the  selected  variable sample is compared to
          that of field galaxies, and we find that a constant fraction of
          ~1%  of  all  field  objects show variability over the range of
          0.1<z<4.5.  Combined with other recent HUDF results, as well as
          those  of  recent  state-of-the-art  numerical  simulations, we
          discuss  a  potential  link between the hierarchical merging of
          galaxies and the growth of AGN.

          marked  contrast to the cooler, 40-60 K dust found in starburst
          galaxies.  For  the  first  time we detect the low-J rotational
          lines  from  molecular  hydrogen.  Adopting  LTE there is ~10^5
          solar  masses  of  ~400  K gas, which is <0.1 % of the cold gas
          mass.  The  combination  of  one-third solar metallicity with a
          recent, <5 million year, epsiode of star formation is reflected
          in  the  S and Ne ratios. The excitation is higher than typical
          values  for  starburst  galaxies  and  similar to that found in
          BCDs.  Using the Infared Array Camera we identify an additional
          13  PAH-rich  candidate  TDGs.  These sources occupy a distinct
          region of IRAC color space with [3.6] - [4.5] < 0.4 and [4.5] -
          [8.0]  >  3.2. NGC 5291 N and S have stellar masses of (1.5 and
          3.0)  10^8  solar  masses,  which  is  comparable to BCDs. This
          system appears to be a remarkable TDG nursery.

          Title:  Tracing Galaxy Assembly: Tadpole Galaxies in the Hubble
          Ultra Deep Field

          Astrophysical Journal
          In  the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) an abundance of galaxies
          is  seen  with  a  knot  at  one  end  plus  an  extended tail,
          resembling   a   tadpole.   These   "tadpole  galaxies"  appear
          dynamically   unrelaxed--presumably   in   an   early   merging
          state--where  tidal  interactions  likely created the distorted
          knot-plus-tail   morphology.   Here  we  systematically  select
          tadpole  galaxies from the HUDF and study their properties as a
          function  of  their  photometric redshifts. In a companion HUDF
          variability  study,  Cohen et al. (2005) revealed a total of 45
          variable  objects  believed to be Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
          Here we show that this faint AGN sample has no overlap with the
          tadpole  galaxy  sample,  as predicted by theoretical work. The
          tadpole  morphology--combined with the lack of overlap with the
          variable  objects--supports the idea that these galaxies are in
          the  process  of  an early-stage merger event, i.e., at a stage
          that likely precedes the "turn-on" of any AGN component and the
          onset of any point-source variability.

          Title:  Connecting  Dense  Gas Tracers of Star Formation in our
          Galaxy to High-z Star Formation

          Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures. In press for ApJ Letters
          Observations have revealed prodigious amounts of star formation
          in starburst galaxies as traced by dust and molecular emission,
          even at large redshifts. Recent work shows that for both nearby
          spiral   galaxies  and  distant  starbursts,  the  global  star
          formation  rate, as indicated by the infrared luminosity, has a
          tight  and  almost  linear correlation with the amount of dense
          gas as traced by the luminosity of HCN. Our surveys of Galactic
          dense  cores  in  HCN  1-0  emission show that this correlation
          continues  to  a much smaller scale, with nearly the same ratio
          of  infrared luminosity to HCN luminosity found over 7-8 orders
          of magnitude in L_IR, with a lower cutoff around 10^{4.5} L_sun
          of infrared luminosity. The linear correlation suggests that we
          may  understand  distant  star  formation in terms of the known
          properties  of local star-forming regions. Both the correlation
          and the luminosity cutoff can be explained if the basic unit of
          star  formation  in  galaxies is a dense core, similar to those
          studied in our Galaxy.

          We present long-slit H- and K-band spectroscopy of the low-mass
          outflow  source  SVS  13,  obtained  with  the  adaptive-optics
          assisted  imager-spectrometer  NACO  on the VLT. With a spatial
          resolution  of  < 0.25 arcsec and a pixel scale of 0.027 arcsec
          we  precisely establish the relative offsets of H2, [FeII], CO,
          HI  and  NaI  components  from the source continuum. The H2 and
          [FeII] peaks are clearly associated with the jet, while the CO,
          HI  and  NaI peaks are spatially unresolved and coincident with
          the  source,  as  is  expected  for  emission  associated  with
          accretion  processes. The H2 profile along the slit is resolved
          into   multiple  components,  which  increase  in  size  though
          decrease in intensity with distance from the source. This trend
          might  be  consistent  with thermal expansion of packets of gas
          ejected during periods of increased accretion activity. Indeed,
          for  the  brightest component nearest the source, proper motion
          measurements   indicate   a   tangential   velocity   of  0.028
          arcsec/year.  It  therefore  seems  unlikely that this emission
          peak  is  associated  with a stationary zone of warm gas at the
          base  of  the  jet.  However,  the same can not be said for the
          [FeII]  peak, for which we see no evidence for motion downwind,
          even  though  radial  velocity  measurements  indicate that the
          emission is associated with higher jet velocities. We postulate
          that the [FeII] could be associated with a collimation shock at
          the base of the jet.

          Title:  Revisiting  the  Infrared  Spectra  of  Active Galactic
          Nuclei with a New Torus Emission Model

          Comments:  23  pages,  20  figures. Accepted for publication in
          MNRAS
          We  describe  improved  modelling  of the emission by dust in a
          toroidal--like  structure  heated  by  a  central  illuminating
          source  within  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We chose a simple
          but  realistic  torus geometry, a flared disc, and a dust grain
          distribution  function  including  a full range of grain sizes.
          The optical depth within the torus is computed in detail taking
          into  account  the  different  sublimation  temperatures of the
          silicate  and graphite grains, which solves previously reported
          inconsistencies in the silicate emission feature in type-1 AGN.
          We   exploit   this   model   to   study  the  spectral  energy
          distributions  (SEDs)  of  58  extragalactic  (both  type-1 and
          type-2)  sources using archival optical and infrared (IR) data.
          We  find  that  both  AGN and starburst contributions are often
          required  to  reproduce  the  observed  SEDs, although in a few
          cases  they  are  very well fitted by a pure AGN component. The
          AGN contribution to the far-IR luminosity is found to be higher
          in  type-1 sources, with all the type-2 requiring a substantial
          contribution  from  a  circum-nuclear  starburst.  Our  results
          appear  in  agreement  with  the  AGN Unified Scheme, since the
          distributions of key parameters of the torus models turn out to
          be compatible for type-1 and type-2 AGN. Further support to the
          unification     concept     comes    from    comparison    with
          medium-resolution  IR  spectra  of  type-1  AGN  by the Spitzer
          observatory,  showing evidence for a moderate silicate emission
          around 10 \mums which our code reproduces. From our analysis we
          infer  accretion  flows  in  the  inner  nucleus  of  local AGN
          characterized  by  high  equatorial  optical depths ($A_V\simeq
          100$), moderate sizes ($R_{max}<100 pc$) and very high covering
          factors ($f\simeq 80$ per cent) on average.

          We  report  on observations of the X-ray pulsar IGR J16320-4751
          (a.k.a. AX J1631.9-4752) performed simultaneously with INTEGRAL
          and  XMM-Newton. We refine the source position and identify the
          most  likely  infrared  counterpart.  Our simultaneous coverage
          allows  us to confirm the presence of X-ray pulsations at ~1300
          s,  that  we  detect  above  20 keV with INTEGRAL for the first
          time. The pulse fraction is consistent with being constant with
          energy,  which is compatible with a model of polar accretion by
          a  pulsar.  We study the spectral properties of IGR J16320-4751
          during  two  major  periods  occurring  during the simultaneous
          coverage  with  both satellites, namely a flare and a non-flare
          period. We detect the presence of a narrow 6.4 keV iron line in
          both  periods.  The  presence  of  such a feature is typical of
          supergiant  wind  accretors  such  as  Vela X-1 or GX 301-2. We
          inspect the spectral variations with respect to the pulse phase
          during  the non-flare period, and show that the pulse is solely
          due  to  variations of the X-ray flux emitted by the source and
          not to variations of the spectral parameters.
          Our  results  are  therefore compatible with the source being a
          pulsar  in  a  High  Mass X-ray Binary. We detect a soft excess
          appearing  in  the spectra as a blackbody with a temperature of
          ~0.07  keV.  We discuss the origin of the X-ray emission in IGR
          J16320-4751:  while  the  hard  X-rays are likely the result of
          Compton  emission produced in the close vicinity of the pulsar,
          based  on  energy  argument  we suggest that the soft excess is
          likely the emission by a collisionally energised cloud in which
          the compact object is embedded.

          Title:  Masses  and  Radii  of  Low-Mass  Stars:  Theory versus
          Observations
          Authors: Ignasi Ribas (CSIC, IEEC, Spain)
          Comments:  8 pages, 1 figure, proceedings of the meeting "Close
          Binaries in the 21st Century"
          Eclipsing  binaries  with  M-type  components  are  still  rare
          objects.  Strong observational biases have made that today only
          a  few  eclipsing binaries with component masses below 0.6 Msun
          and  well-determined fundamental properties are known. However,
          even  in  these  small  numbers  the detailed comparison of the
          observed  masses  and  radii  with  theoretical predictions has
          revealed  large  disagreements.  Current models seem to predict
          radii  of  stars  in  the  0.4-0.8  Msun range to be some 5-15%
          smaller than observed. Given the high accuracy of the empirical
          measurements  (a  few  percent  in both mass and radius), these
          differences   are   highly   significant.   I  review  all  the
          observational  evidence  on  the properties of M-type stars and
          discuss  a  possible  scenario  based  on  stellar  activity to
          explain the observed discrepancies.

          Conference on "Astrophysics of Variable Stars"
          Binary  systems  have  long  been  recognized  as the source of
          powerful astrophysical diagnostics. Among the many applications
          of  binary  stars,  they  have  been  used as probes of stellar
          structure  and evolution (both of single and binary stars) in a
          broad  range  of  masses,  evolutionary  stages,  and  chemical
          compositions,  and as indicators of distance and time. With the
          numerous   ongoing   photometric  surveys  and  upcoming  space
          astrometry  and  photometry  missions,  the  future of binaries
          looks    bright.   The   various   aspects   of   binaries   as
          astrophysically  useful  laboratories  are  reviewed here, with
          emphasis   on   the   currently   open  problems  and  research

          compared  with  the distributions predicted by a number of XLFs
          and  absorption models. In contrast to other studies, we do not
          find any evidence that the absorption distribution is dependent
          on redshift or intrinsic luminosity.

          In  the  recent  literature  on AGNs it has been often reported
          that  spectra  of  Seyfert  1 Galaxies show resonant absorption
          lines  of  Fe  K  which  are  redshifted  from  the  rest frame
          position. Such lines are often found with marginal significance
          but,  if  real,  could potentially open up new avenues to study
          the circumnuclear gas in the black hole environment. It is also
          extremely important to take them into account in X-ray spectral
          analysis  because  of  the  influence  they have in the correct
          estimation  of  spectral parameters, Fe K alpha line in primis.
          An XMM-Newton observation of Mrk 335 is reported here as a case
          study: a narrow feature has been detected at 5.9 keV, i.e. with
          a   redshift   corresponding  to  a  velocity  of  v  ~  0.15c.
          Preliminary  results  on the statistical significance of narrow

          Nugis, Annuk (eds.), ASP Conf. Ser
          At  very  low metallicity, the effects of differential rotation
          have  a more important impact on the evolution of stars than at
          high  metallicity. Rotational mixing leads to the production of
          great  quantities  of helium and of primary $^{14}$N by massive
          stars. Rotation induces important mass loss and allows stars to
          locally   strongly   enrich  the  interstellar  medium  in  CNO
          elements. Stars formed from interstellar clouds enriched by the
          winds  of  fast  rotating  massive  stars would present surface
          abundances  similar  to  those  of  C-rich extremely metal-poor
          stars.  C-rich  stars can also be formed by mass accretion in a
          binary  system  where  the  primary  would  be  a fast rotating
          intermediate  mass  star  in the early-AGB phase. Fast rotation
          may  also  lead to the formation of collapsars even at very low
          metallicity  and  make  the  most  massive stars avoid the pair
          instability.

          Gamma  ray bursts (GRBs) belong to the most energetic events in
          the  Universe.  Recently,  the  extragalactic  nature  of these
          sources  has  been confirmed with the discovery of several host
          galaxies  (HGs)  and  the  measurement  of  their redshifts. To
          explain  the  origin of GRBs several models have been proposed,
          among   which  the  coalescence  of  compact  objects  and  the
          hypernova (or collapsar) scenarios are the most representative,
          being  the collapsar model one of the most accepted nowadays. A
          natural  consequence  of  the  collapsar model is that the GRBs
          would trace the star formation rate (SFR) of their HGs. In this
          contributed   paper  we  present  preliminary  results  of  the
          development  of  a  Montecarlo-based  model for hypernova event
          formation    which    is   coupled   to   chemical-cosmological
          simulations, with the aim at studying the GRB relationship with
          the  SFR  cosmic  history  and the properties of their HGs in a
          hierarchical scenario.

          Title: A survey of weak MgII absorbers at redshift <z>=1.78
          Authors: Ryan S. Lynch, Jane C. Charlton, Tae-Sun Kim
          Comments: 25 pages, 14 figures, to be published in ApJ 01 March
          2006, v639, 1
          The exact nature of weak MgII absorbers (those with W_r(2796) <
          0.3  A)  is  a matter of debate, but most are likely related to
          areas of local star formation or supernovae activity outside of
          giant   galaxies.  Using  18  QSO  spectra  obtained  with  the
          Ultra-Violet  Echelle  Spectrograph  (UVES)  on  the Very Large
          Telescope  (VLT),  we  have  conducted  a  survey for weak MgII
          absorbers  at 1.4 < z < 2.4. We searched a redshift path length
          of  8.51, eliminating regions badly contaminated by atmospheric
          absorption  so  that  the  survey  is close to 100% complete to
          W_r(2796)  =  0.02  A.  We  found  a total of 9 weak absorbers,
          yielding a number density of absorbers of dN/dz = 1.06 +/- 0.12
          for  0.02  <=  W_r(2796) < 0.3 A. Narayanan et al. (2005) found
          dN/dz  =  1.00  +/-  0.20  at  0 < z < 0.3 and Churchill et al.
          (1999) found dN/dz = 1.74 +/- 0.10 at 0.4 < z < 1.4. Therefore,
          the  population  of weak MgII absorbers appears to peak at z~1.
          We  explore  the  expected evolution of the absorber population
          subject  to a changing extragalactic background radiation (EBR)
          from  z  = 0.9 to z = 1.78 (the median redshift of our survey),
          and  find that the result is higher than the observed value. We
          point  out  that the peak epoch for weak MgII absorption at z~1
          may  coincide  with  the peak epoch of global star formation in
          the dwarf galaxy environment.

          Comments:  58  pages,  including  11  tables and 16 figures. To
          appear in 01 April 2006 issue of the Astrophysical Journal
          (Abridged)    We    present   spectroscopic   and   photometric
          observations of the eclipsing system V1061 Cyg (P = 2.35 days).
          We  show  that  it  is a hierarchical triple in which the third
          star   is  visible  in  the  spectra.  We  combine  the  radial
          velocities   for   the  three  stars,  times  of  eclipse,  and
          intermediate   astrometric  data  from  the  HIPPARCOS  mission
          (abscissa  residuals)  to  establish  the elements of the outer
          orbit  (P  =  15.8  yr)  and accurate values for the masses and
          radii  (1-2%  errors)  and  the  effective  temperatures of the
          binary  components.  Both  stars  are rotating rapidly and have
          their  rotation synchronized with the orbital motion. There are
          signs  of activity including strong X-ray emission and possibly
          spots.  Current  stellar  evolution  models agree well with the
          properties of the primary, but show a very large discrepancy in
          the radius of the secondary: the predicted values are about 10%
          smaller than observed (a 5-sigma effect). Also, the temperature
          is cooler than predicted by some 200 K. These discrepancies are
          quite  remarkable  given  that the star is only 7% less massive
          than  the  Sun, the calibration point of all stellar models. We
          identify  the chromospheric activity as the likely cause of the
          effect.  Inactive  stars agree very well with the models, while
          active  ones  such  as  V1061  Cyg Ab appear systematically too
          large and too cool. Theory provides an understanding of this in
          terms  of  the  strong magnetic fields commonly associated with
          stellar   activity,  which  tend  to  inhibit  convective  heat
          transport.

          Kokubo, Daisuke Kinoshita
          Comments:  Published  in  2003  in  the proceedings of the 35th

          Mechanics,  eds. E. Kokubo, H. Arakida, and T. Yamamoto. Tokyo,

          Recent  observations  (Burnes2002,Veillet2002,Margot2002a) have
          revealed   an  unexpectedly  high  binary  fraction  among  the
          Trans-Neptunian  Objects  (TNOs) that populate the Kuiper Belt.
          The   TNO  binaries  are  strikingly  different  from  asteroid
          binaries  in four respects (Veillet2002): their frequency is an
          order  of  magnitude larger, the mass ratio of their components
          is  closer  to  unity,  and  their  orbits are wider and highly
          eccentric.  Two  explanations  have  been  proposed  for  their
          formation,   one  assuming  large  numbers  of  massive  bodies
          (Weidenschilling2002),  and one assuming large numbers of light
          bodies  (Goldreich2002).  We  argue  that  both assumptions are
          unwarranted,  and we show how TNO binaries can be produced from
          a  modest  number  of  intermediate-mass  bodies  of  the  type
          predicted  by  the  gravitational  instability  theory  for the
          formation  of  planetesimals (Goldreich and Ward1973). We start
          with  a  TNO  binary  population similar to the asteroid binary
          population,  but  subsequently  modified by three-body exchange
          reactions,  a  process that is far more efficient in the Kuiper
          belt,  because  of  the much smaller tidal perturbations by the
          Sun.   Our   mechanism  can  naturally  account  for  all  four
          characteristics  that  distinguish  TNO binaries from main-belt
          asteroid binaries.

          Title:   Cannonballs  in  the  context  of  Gamma  Ray  Bursts:
          Formation sites ?
          Authors: Jan E. Staff, Christian Fendt, Rachid Ouyed
          Comments: 10 pages, 12 figures
          We  investigate possible formation sites of the cannonballs (in
          the  gamma  ray  bursts  context) by calculating their physical
          parameters,  such  as  density,  magnetic field and temperature
          close  to  the  origin.  Our  results favor scenarios where the
          cannonballs  form  as  instabilities  (knots) within magnetized
          jets  from hyperaccreting disks. These instabilities would most
          likely  set  in  beyond  the light cylinder where flow velocity
          with  Lorentz  factors  as  high  as  2000 can be achieved. Our
          findings  challenge the cannonball model of gamma ray bursts if
          these  indeed  form  inside  core-collapse  supernovae (SNe) as
          suggested  in  the  literature; unless hyperaccreting disks and
          the  corresponding jets are common occurrences in core-collapse
          SNe.

          Title: Birth and fate of hot-Neptune planets
          Authors: I. Baraffe, Y. Alibert, G. Chabrier, W. Benz
          Comments:  4 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and
          Astrophysics
          This  paper  presents a consistent description of the formation
          and  the  subsequent evolution of gaseous planets, with special
          attention   to   short-period,   low-mass  hot-Neptune  planets
          characteristic  of  $\mu$  Ara-like  systems. We show that core
          accretion including migration and disk evolution and subsequent
          evolution  taking  into  account  irradiation  and  evaporation
          provide  a viable formation mechanism for this type of strongly
          irradiated light planets. At an orbital distance $a \simeq$ 0.1
          AU, this revised core accretion model leads to the formation of
          planets  with  total  masses  ranging  from $\sim$ 14 $\mearth$
          (0.044  $\mjup$)  to  $\sim$  400 $\mearth$ (1.25 $\mjup$). The
          newly  born  planets  have  a dense core of $\sim$ 6 $\mearth$,
          independent of the total mass, and heavy element enrichments in
          the envelope, $M_{\rm Z,env}/M_{\rm env} $, varying from 10% to
          80%  from  the  largest to the smallest planets. We examine the
          dependence   of  the  evolution  of  the  born  planet  on  the
          evaporation rate due to the incident XUV stellar flux. In order
          to  reach  a  $\mu$  Ara-like  mass ($\sim$ 14 $\mearth$) after
          $\sim  $  1  Gyr,  the  initial planet mass must range from 166
          $\mearth$  ($\sim$  0.52  $\mjup$)  to  about 20 $\mearth$, for
          evaporation   rates   varying   by   2   orders  of  magnitude,
          corresponding  to  90%  to  20% mass loss during evolution. The
          presence  of  a core and heavy elements in the envelope affects
          appreciably  the  structure and the evolution of the planet and
          yields  $\sim  8%-9%$ difference in radius compared to coreless
          objects  of  solar  composition  for Saturn-mass planets. These
          combinations  of  evaporation  rates  and internal compositions
          translate  into  different  detection  probabilities,  and thus
          different   statistical   distributions  for  hot-Neptunes  and
          hot-Jupiters.

          Title: On the Detection of Artefacts in Spectro-astrometry
          Authors: E. Brannigan, M. Takami, A. Chrysostomou, J. Bailey
          Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          We   demonstrate  that  artificial  bipolar  structure  can  be
          detected   using   spectro-astrometry  when  the  point  spread
          function  (PSF)  of  a  point  source  suffers  distortion in a
          relatively  wide  slit. Spectro-astrometry is a technique which
          allows  us  to  probe  the  spatial  structure  of astronomical
          sources  on  milliarcsecond scales making it possible to detect
          close  binaries  and  to  study  the geometry and kinematics of
          outflowing  gas  on  scales much smaller than the seeing or the
          diffraction  limit  of  the  telescope. It is demonstrated that
          distortion  of  the  PSF,  caused  by  tracking  errors  of the
          telescope  or  unstable  active  optics  during an exposure can
          induce  artificial  signals  which  may  be misinterpreted as a
          real-astrometric  signal.  Using simulations we show that these
          may be minimised by using a narrow slit relative to the seeing.
          Spectra  should  be  obtained  at  anti-parallel  slit position
          angles (eg. 0 and 180 degrees) for comparison in order to allow
          artificial signatures to be identified.

          Title: Orbital phase spectroscopy of X-ray pulsars to study the
          stellar wind of the companion
          Authors: U.Mukherjee, B.Paul
          Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures. To be Published in Elsevier/ASR
          High  Mass X-ray Binary Pulsars (HMXBP), in which the companion
          star  is  a  source  of  supersonic  stellar  wind,  provide  a
          laboratory  to  probe  the velocity and density profile of such
          winds.  Here,  we have measured the variation of the absorption
          column  density  along  with other spectral parameters over the
          binary  orbit  for  two HMXBP in elliptical orbits, as observed
          with  the  Rossi  X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the BeppoSAX
          satellites.  A spherically symmetric wind profile was used as a
          model  to compare the observed column density variations. In 4U
          1538-52,  we  find  the  model  corroborating the observations;
          whereas in GX 301-2, the stellar wind appears to be very clumpy
          and  a  smooth  symmetric  wind model seems to be inadequate in
          explaining the variation in column density.

          Comments:  35  pages,  19 figures. To be published in Astronomy
          and Astrophysics
          We present a NIR analysis of a sample of H2 outflows from young
          embedded sources to compare the physical properties and cooling
          mechanisms  of  the  different  flows.  The sample comprises 23
          outflows   driven   by   Class   0   and   I   sources   having
          low-intermediate  luminosity.  We  have  obtained  narrow  band
          images   in   H2  2.12um  and  FeII  1.64um  and  spectroscopic
          observations  in  the  range  1-2.5um. H2 line ratios have been
          used  to estimate the visual extinction and average temperature
          of  the molecular gas. Av values range from 2 to 15mag; average
          temperatures  range  between 2000 and 4000K. In several knots a
          stratification  of temperatures is found with maximum values up
          to  5000K.  Such  a stratification is more commonly observed in
          those  knots which also show FeII emission, while a thermalized
          gas  at  a  single  temperature  is  generally  found  in knots
          emitting only in molecular lines. Combining narrow band imaging
          with  the parameters derived from the spectral analysis, we are
          able to measure the total luminosity of the H2 and FeII shocked
          regions  in  each  flow.  H2  is  the  major IR coolant with an
          average L(H2)/L(FeII) ratio of 10^{-2}. 83% of the sources have
          a  L(H2)/L(bol) ratio of 0.04, irrespective of the Class of the
          driving   source,   while  a  smaller  group  of  sources  have
          L(H2)/L(bol)  an  order  of magnitude smaller.Such a separation
          reveals  the non-homogeneous behaviour of ClassI, where sources
          with  very  different  outflow  activity  can be found. This is
          consistent with other studies showing that among ClassI one can
          find   objects  with  different  accretion  properties  and  it
          demonstrates  that  the  H2  power in the jet can be a powerful
          tool to identify the most active sources of this class.

          A  review  of  recent  observations  of  the  kinematics of six
          objects  that  represent  the  broad  range of phenomena called
          planetary  nebulae  (PNe) is presented. It is demonstrated that
          Hubble-type outflows are predominant, consequently it is argued
          that  ballistic  ejections  from  the  central stars could have
          dominated  the  dynamical effects of the fast winds in several,
          and  perhaps all, of these objects. An alternative possibility,
          which  involves an extension to the Interacting Winds model, is
          considered   to  explain  the  dynamics  of  evolved  planetary
          nebuale.

          We  carry  out a systematic search campaign for wide companions
          of  exoplanet  host  stars  to study their multiplicity and its
          influence on the long-term stability and the orbital parameters
          of  the  exoplanets.  We  have already found 6 wide companions,
          raising  the  number  of confirmed binaries among the exoplanet
          host  stars  to  20  systems.  We  have  also searched for wide
          companions  of Gl86, the first known exoplanet host star with a
          white  dwarf companion. Our Sofi/NTT observations are sensitive
          to  substellar  companions  with  a minimum-mass of 35 Mjup and
          clearly  rule  out  further  stellar  companions with projected
          separations between 40 and 670AU.

          Title: Probing dark matter with X-ray binaries
          Authors: Walter Dehnen, Andrew King (Leicester)
          Comments: 3 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Low-mass  X-ray  binaries  (LMXBs),  which occur in old stellar
          populations,  have  velocities  exceeding those of their parent
          distribution  by at least 20 km/s. This makes them ideal probes
          for  dark  matter,  in  particular in dwarf spheroidals (dSph),
          where  the  LMXBs  should  penetrate  well  outside the visible
          galaxy.  We  argue  that  the  most  likely  explanation of the
          observation  of  LMXBs  in the Sculptor dSph by Maccarone et al
          (2005)  is  the presence of a dark matter halo of >~ 10^9 Msun,
          corresponding  to  a  total-mass  to  light  ratio  of  >~  600
          (M/L_V)_sun.  In  this case there should be an extended halo of
          LMXBs which may be observable.

          Title: A model for the X-ray absorption in Compton--thin AGN
          Authors: Alessandra Lamastra, G. Cesare Perola, Giorgio Matt
          Comments: Astronomy and Astrophysics, in press
          The fraction of AGN with photoelectric absorption in the X-rays
          ranging  from  NH  of  10^{22}  up  to  about  10^{24}  cm^{-2}
          (Compton-thin)  appears observationally to be anticorrelated to
          their  luminosity  Lx.  This recently found evidence is used to
          investigate  the  location  of the absorbing gas. The molecular
          torus  invoked  in  the unified picture of AGN, while it can be
          regarded  as  confirmed  on  several  grounds  to  explain  the
          Compton-thick  objects,  do not conform to this new constraint,
          at  least  in  its  physical models as developed so far. In the
          frame  of  observationally  based evidence that in Compton-thin
          sources  the  absorbing  gas might be located far away from the
          X-ray source, it is shown that the gravitational effects of the
          black  hole  (BH) on the molecular gas in a disk, within 25-450
          pc  (depending on the BH mass, from 10^6 to 10^9 M_solar, leads
          naturally to the observed anticorrelation, under the assumption
          of  a  statistical  correlation between the BH mass and Lx. Its
          normalization  is  also  reproduced  provided  that the surface
          density,  Sigma,  of  this  gas  is  larger  than about 150-200
          M_solar pc^{-2}, and assuming that the bolometric luminosity is
          one  tenth  of the Eddington limit. Interestingly, the required
          values  are  consistent  with the value of the 300 pc molecular
          disk in our own galaxy, namely 500 M_solar pc^{-2}. In a sample
          of  nearby galaxies from the BIMA SONG survey, it is found that
          half  of the objects have central Sigma larger than 150 M_solar
          pc${-2}.  Given  the  simplicity  of  the  proposed model, this
          finding   is   very  encouraging,  waiting  for  future  higher
          resolution surveys in CO on more distant galaxies.

          Title: Chaplygin gas may prevent big trip
          Authors: José A. Jiménez Madrid (IAA, Granada & IMAFF, Madrid)
          Comments: 6 pages, no figures, uses Revtex
          This  paper  deals  with  the  study  of  the  accretion  of  a
          generalized    Chaplygin    gas    with   equation   of   state
          $p=-A/\rho^\alpha$  onto  wormholes. We have obtained that when
          dominant  energy  condition  is  violated  the size of wormhole
          increases  with  the scale factor up to a given plateau. On the
          regime  where  the  dominant  energy condition is satisfied our
          model  predicts  a  steady  decreasing  of the wormhole size as
          generalized  Chaplygin  gas is accreted. Our main conclusion is
          that  the  big trip mechanism is prevented in a large region of
          the physical parameters of the used model.

          We present the first images of the 691.473 GHz CO J=6-5 line in
          a  protoplanetary  disk,  obtained  along with the 690 GHz dust
          continuum,  toward  the classical T Tauri star TW Hya using the
          Submillimeter  Array.  Imaging  in  the CO J=6-5 line reveals a
          rotating  disk,  consistent  with  previous  observations of CO
          J=3-2  and  2-1 lines. Using an irradiated accretion disk model
          and  2D Monte Carlo radiative transfer, we find that additional
          surface  heating  is  needed to fit simultaneously the absolute
          and relative intensities of the CO J=6-5, 3-2 and 2-1 lines. In
          particular,  the  vertical gas temperature gradient in the disk
          must  be  steeper  than that of the dust, mostly likely because
          the  CO emission lines probe nearer to the surface of the disk.
          We  have  used an idealized X-ray heating model to fit the line
          profiles  of CO J=2-1 and 3-2 with Chi-square analysis, and the
          prediction  of  this  model yields CO J=6-5 emission consistent
          with the observations.

          (Springer: Dordrecht)
          Extended,  soft  X-ray  emission  from the halo of a very large
          disk   galaxy  has  been  detected  out  to  r~20-40  kpc.  The
          luminosity  and surface brightness distribution is in very good
          agreement  with  predictions  by  recent,  cosmological  galaxy
          formation  models. Predictions of Ly-alpha emission, associated
          with  ``cold''  accretion of filamentary gas onto galaxies, are
          presented.  In particular these predictions are compared to the
          properties  of  a  recently  detected  Ly-alpha ``blob'', which
          shows   no   obvious   continuum  counter-part  in  any  of  12
          broad-bands,  from  X-rays  (Chandra)  to  infrared  (Spitzer).
          Finally,  the predicted evolution of the Tully-Fisher relation,
          going  from  z=0  to  1,  is  discussed  in  relation to recent
          observations.

          Combination   of  high-precision  photometry  and  spectroscopy
          allows  the  detailed  study of the upper main sequence in open
          clusters. We are carrying out a comprehensive study of a number
          of  clusters  containing  Be  stars  in  order  to evaluate the
          likelihood  that  a significant number of Be stars form through
          mass  exchange  in  a  binary. Our first results show that most
          young  open  clusters  contain blue stragglers. In spite of the
          small  number  of  clusters  so  far  analysed, some trends are
          beginning  to emerge. In younger open clusters, such as NGC 869
          and  NGC 663, there are many blue stragglers, most of which are
          not  Be stars. In older clusters, such as IC 4725, the fraction
          of  Be  stars  among  blue stragglers is very high. Two Be blue
          stragglers  are  moderately  strong  X-ray sources, one of them
          being  a  confirmed X-ray binary. Such objects must have formed
          through  binary  evolution. We discuss the contribution of mass
          transfer  in  a  close  binary  to  the  formation of both blue
          stragglers and Be stars

          Title:  Protostellar  Jets  and Turbulence in Molecular Clouds:
          The Role of Interactions
          Authors: Andrew J. Cunningham, Adam Frank, Eric G. Blackman
          Comments: 21 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ
          We  present a series of numerical studies of the interaction of
          colliding  radiative,  hydrodynamic  young stellar outflows. We
          study  the  effect  of  the  collision  impact parameter on the
          acceleration  of  ambient  material and the degree to which the
          flow is isotropized by the collision as a mechanism for driving
          turbulence  in the parent molecular cloud. Our results indicate
          that  the  high  degrees  of  compression  of outflow material,
          achieved  through  radiative  shocks  near  the  vertex  of the
          interaction, prevents the redirected outflow from spraying over
          a  large spatial region. Furthermore, the collision reduces the
          redirected  outflow's  ability  to  entrain and impart momentum
          into  the  ambient cloud. Consideration of the probabilities of
          outflow  collisions  leads  us  to conclude that individual low
          velocity  fossil  outflows  are  the principle coupling between
          outflows and the cloud.

          Relativistic  neutron-loaded  outflows  in gamma-ray bursts are
          studied  at  their  early  stages,  before  deceleration  by  a
          surrounding medium. The outflow has four components: radiation,
          electrons,  protons  and neutrons. The components interact with
          each  other  and  exchange  energy  as the outflow expands. The
          presence   of   neutrons   significantly  changes  the  outflow
          evolution.  Before  neutrons  decouple  from  protons, friction
          between the two components increases their temperatures by many
          orders  of magnitude. After the decoupling, the gradual neutron
          decay  inside  the outflow has a drag effect on the protons and
          reduces their final Lorentz factor.

          Comments:   52  pages,  15  figures,  5  tables,  accepted  for
          publication in the Astronomical Journal
          We present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of the parent
          star  of  the  transiting  extrasolar  planet  TrES-1. Based on
          high-resolution   Keck/HIRES   and  HET/HRS  spectra,  we  have
          determined  abundances relative to the Sun for 16 elements (Na,
          Mg,  Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba).
          The   resulting   average   abundance   of   $<[$$X$/H$]>$   $=
          -0.02\pm0.06$  is  in  good agreement with initial estimates of
          solar  metallicity  based  on  iron.  We  compare the elemental
          abundances  of  TrES-1  with  those of the sample of stars with
          planets,  searching  for possible chemical abundance anomalies.
          TrES-1  appears not to be chemically peculiar in any measurable
          way.  We  investigate  possible signs of selective accretion of
          refractory elements in TrES-1 and other stars with planets, and
          find no statistically significant trends of metallicity [$X$/H]
          with   condensation   temperature   $T_c$.   We  use  published
          abundances   and   kinematic  information  for  the  sample  of
          planet-hosting stars (including TrES-1) and several statistical
          indicators  to  provide  an  updated classification in terms of
          their likelihood to belong to either the thin disk or the thick
          disk  of  the  Milky  Way  Galaxy. TrES-1 is found to be a very
          likely  member  of  the  thin  disk  population.  By  comparing
          $\alpha$-element abundances of planet hosts and a large control
          sample   of   field   stars,   we  also  find  that  metal-rich
          ([Fe/H]$\gtrsim   0.0$)   stars   with  planets  appear  to  be
          systematically  underabundant in [$\alpha$/Fe] by $\approx 0.1$
          dex with respect to comparison field stars. The reason for this
          signature   is  unclear,  but  systematic  differences  in  the
          analysis procedures adopted by different groups cannot be ruled
          out.

          Authors: J.F. Gonzalez, S. Hubrig, N. Nesvacil, P. North
          Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          Using  recent  spectroscopic  observations,  we  show  that the
          triple  system AO Vel with an eclipsing BpSi primary is in fact
          a  remarkable  quadruple  system  formed  by  two  double-lined
          spectroscopic  binaries  with components close to the ZAMS. All
          available  data  have  been reanalyzed to derive proper orbital
          parameters  for  both  binary systems and to calculate absolute
          parameters  of the eclipsing system. For the first time, direct
          determination of the radius and the mass have been obtained for
          a  BpSi  star.  The  study  of  the physical parameters of this
          unique system is especially important since it can be used as a
          test   of   evolutionary   models   for  very  young  stars  of
          intermediate mass.

          Cores
          Authors: Tomoaki Matsumoto, Takeshi Nakazato, Kohji Tomisaka
          Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, Accepted by ApJ Letters
          We  estimate  the  polarized  thermal  dust  emission  from MHD
          simulations  of  protostellar collapse and outflow formation in
          order  to  investigate  alignment  of  outflows  with  magnetic
          fields.  The  polarization  maps  indicate that alignment of an
          outflow  with  the magnetic field depends on the field strength
          inside  the cloud core; the direction of the outflow, projected
          on  the  plane  of  the sky, is aligned preferentially with the
          mean polarization vector for a cloud core with a magnetic field
          strength of 80 microgauss, while it does not tend to be aligned
          for  50  microgauss as long as the 1000 AU scale is considered.
          The  direction  of  the  magnetic  field at the cloud center is
          probed  by  the  direction  of  the  outflow.  In addition, the
          magnetic field at the cloud center can be revealed by ALMA even
          when  the  source  is  embedded  deeply  in  the  envelope. The
          Chandrasekhar-Fermi  formula is examined using the polarization
          maps,  indicating  that  the  field  strength  predicted by the
          formula  should  be  corrected  by a factor of 0.24 - 0.44. The
          correction  factor  has a tendency to be lower for a cloud core
          with a weaker magnetic field.

          We  present  Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the z=2.38
          lya-emitter   over-density   associated   with  galaxy  cluster
          J2143-4423, the largest known structure (110 Mpc) above z=2. We
          imaged 22 of the 37 known lya-emitters within the filament-like
          structure,  using  the  MIPS  24um  band.  We detected 6 of the
          lya-emitters, including 3 of the 4 clouds of extended (>50 kpc)
          lyman  alpha emission, also known as Lya Blobs. Conversion from
          rest-wavelength  7um  to  total  far-infrared  luminosity using
          locally  derived correlations suggests all the detected sources
          are  in  the  class  of  ULIRGs,  with some reaching Hyper-LIRG
          energies.  Lya  blobs frequently show evidence for interaction,
          either  in  HST  imaging,  or  the  proximity  of multiple MIPS
          sources  within  the  Lya  cloud. This connection suggests that
          interaction or even mergers may be related to the production of
          Lya  blobs.  A  connection  to  mergers does not in itself help
          explain  the  origin of the Lya blobs, as most of the suggested
          mechanisms  for  creating  Lya  blobs (starbursts, AGN, cooling
          flows) could also be associated with galaxy interactions.

          Comments:   Proceedings   of   The   Third  21COE  Symposium  :
          Astrophysics as Interdisciplinary Science
          We  investigate  the merging process in N-body self-gravitating
          system  from  the viewpoints of the local virial relation which
          is  the relation between the local kinetic energy and the local
          potential.  We  compare  both the density profile and the phase
          space  density  profile  in  cosmological  simulations with the
          critical solutions of collisionless static state satisfying the
          local  virial  (LV)  relation.  We  got  the  results  that the
          critical   solution  can  explain  the  characteristic  density
          profile  with  the  appropriate  value  of anisotropy parameter
          $\beta  \sim  0.5$.  It  can  also explain the power law of the
          phase space density profile in the outer part of a bound state.
          However,  it  fails  in  explaining the central low temperature
          part  which  is  connected  to  the scale invariant phase space
          density.  It  can  be well fitted to the critical solution with
          the  higher  value  of$\beta \sim 0.75$. These results indicate
          that the LV relation is not compatible with the scale invariant
          phase space density in cosmological simulation.

          Selective  amplification  of  the  line and continuum source by
          microlensing  in  a  lensed  quasar  can  lead  to  changes  of
          continuum spectral slopes and line shapes in the spectra of the
          quasar   components.   Comparing   the   spectra  of  different
          components  of  the  lensed  quasar and the spectra of an image
          observed  in  different  epochs  one  can infer the presence of
          millilensing,    microlensing    and   intrinsic   variability.
          Especially,  microlensing  can be used for investigation of the
          unresolved  broad  line  (BLR)  and  continuum  emitting region
          structure  in  active  galactic  nuclei  (AGN).  Therefore  the
          spectroscopic  monitoring  of  selected  lensed quasars with 3D
          spectroscopy  open new possibility for investigation of the BLR
          structure  in  AGN.  Here we discuss observational effects that
          may  be  present  during the BLR microlensing in the spectra of
          lensed QSOs.

          Title: A Precessing Ring Model for Low-Frequency Quasi-periodic
          Oscillations
          Authors: Jeremy D. Schnittman (U Maryland), Jeroen Homan (MIT),
          Jon M. Miller (U Michigan)
          Comments: Accepted to ApJ, 22 pages, 7 figures
          We  develop a simple physical model to describe the most common
          type  of  low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen
          in  a  number  of  accreting black hole systems, as well as the
          shape  of  the  relativistically  broadened iron emission lines
          that  often appear simultaneously in such sources. The model is
          based on an inclined ring of hot gas that orbits the black hole
          along  geodesic  trajectories.  For  spinning black holes, this
          ring will precess around the spin axis of the black hole at the
          Lense-Thirring    (``frame-dragging'')   frequency.   Using   a
          relativistic  ray-tracing code, we calculate X-ray light curves
          and  observed  energy  spectra  as a function of the radius and
          tilt angle of the ring, the spin magnitude, and the inclination
          of the black hole. The model predicts higher-amplitude QPOs for
          systems  with high inclinations, as seen in a growing number of
          black  hole binary systems. We find that the Rossi X-ray Timing
          Explorer observations of low-frequency QPOs in GRS 1915+105 are
          consistent  with a ring of radius R ~ 10M orbiting a black hole
          with  spin  a/M  ~0.5  and  inclination  angle  of  i ~ 70 deg.
          Finally,  we  describe how future X-ray missions may be able to
          use  simultaneous  timing  and  spectroscopic  observations  to
          measure the black hole spin and probe the inner-most regions of
          the accretion disk.

          We  present  spectral  results,  from  Chandra  and  XMM-Newton
          observations,  of  a  sample of 22 low-redshift (z < 0.1) radio
          galaxies,  and  consider  whether  the core emission originates
          from  the  base  of  a  relativistic jet, an accretion flow, or
          contains  contributions from both. We find correlations between
          the   unabsorbed   X-ray,   radio,   and   optical  fluxes  and
          luminosities  of FRI-type radio-galaxy cores, implying a common
          origin  in  the  form of a jet. On the other hand, we find that
          the  X-ray spectra of FRII-type radio-galaxy cores is dominated
          by   absorbed  emission,  with  $N_{\rm  H}  >  10^{23}$  atoms
          cm$^{-2}$, that is likely to originate in an accretion flow. We
          discuss  several  models  which  may  account for the different
          nuclear  properties  of  FRI-  and  FRII-type  cores,  and also
          demonstrate  that both heavily obscured, accretion-related, and
          unobscured,  jet-related  components  may  be  present  in  all
          radio-galaxy    nuclei.    Any   absorbed,   accretion-related,
          components    in   FRI-type   galaxies   have   low   radiative
          efficiencies.

          We  use  a  sample  of  87  rest-frame UV-selected star-forming
          galaxies  with  mean spectroscopic redshift z=2.26 to study the
          correlation  between  metallicity  and  stellar  mass  at  high
          redshift.  Using  stellar masses determined from SED fitting to
          0.3-8  micron photometry, we divide the sample into six bins in
          stellar mass, and construct six composite H-alpha+[NII] spectra
          from  all  of  the  objects  in  each bin. We estimate the mean
          oxygen  abundance in each bin from the [NII]/H-alpha ratio, and
          find  a  monotonic  increase  in  metallicity  with  increasing
          stellar mass, from 12+log(O/H) < 8.2 for galaxies with <M_star>
          =  2.7e9 Msun to 12+log(O/H) = 8.6 for galaxies with <M_star> =
          1e11 Msun. We use the empirical relation between star formation
          rate  density  and gas density to estimate the gas fractions of
          the   galaxies,  finding  an  increase  in  gas  fraction  with
          decreasing  stellar mass. These gas fractions combined with the
          observed  metallicities  allow  the estimation of the effective
          yield  y_eff  as  a  function  of stellar mass; in constrast to
          observations  in  the  local  universe which show a decrease in
          y_eff with decreasing baryonic mass, we find a slight increase.
          Such  a  variation of metallicity with gas fraction is best fit
          by  a  model with supersolar yield and an outflow rate ~4 times
          higher  than  the  star  formation  rate.  We conclude that the
          mass-metallicity  relation  at  high  redshift is driven by the
          increase  in  metallicity as the gas fraction decreases through
          star  formation,  and  is  likely  modulated by metal loss from
          strong outflows in galaxies of all masses. There is no evidence
          for  preferential  loss of metals from low mass galaxies as has
          been suggested in the local universe. [Abridged]

          We  solve  for  the  time-dependent  dynamics  of axisymmetric,
          general  relativistic  magnetohydrodynamic  winds from rotating
          neutron stars. The mass loss rate is obtained self-consistently
          as a solution to the MHD equations, subject to a finite thermal
          pressure  at the stellar surface. We consider both monopole and
          dipole  magnetic  field geometries and we explore the parameter
          regime  extending  from low magnetization (low-sigma_o), almost
          thermally-driven  winds  to  high magnetization (high-sigma_o),
          relativistic  Poynting-flux  dominated outflows. We compute the
          angular momentum and rotational energy loss rates as a function
          of  sigma_o  and  compare  with  analytic expectations from the
          classical  theory  of  pulsars and magnetized stellar winds. In
          the   case  of  the  monopole,  our  high-sigma_o  calculations
          asymptotically  approach  the  analytic force-free limit. If we
          define the spindown rate in terms of the open magnetic flux, we
          similarly  reproduce  the  spindown rate from recent force-free
          calculations  of  the aligned dipole. However, even for sigma_o
          as  high  as ~20, we find that the location of the Y-type point
          (r_Y), which specifies the radius of the last closed field line
          in  the  equatorial  plane,  is  not  the  radius  of the light
          cylinder  R_L  =  c/omega  (R  =  cylindrical  radius),  as has
          previously  been  assumed  in  most  estimates  and  force-free
          calculations.   Instead,   although   the   Alfven   radius  at
          intermediate   latitudes  quickly  approaches  R_L  as  sigma_o
          exceeds unity, r_Y remains significantly less than R_L. Because
          r_Y  <  R_L,  our  calculated  spindown  rates  thus exceed the
          classic  ``vacuum  dipole'' rate. We discussthe implications of
          our   results   for  models  of  rotation-powered  pulsars  and
          magnetars,   both   in  their  observed  states  and  in  their
          hypothesized rapidly rotating initial state.

          S. Holt, Neil Gehrels and John A. Nousek (2006)
          We  describe  the  theoretical modeling and analysis techniques
          associated  with  a  preliminary search for correlated neutrino
          emission   from  GRB980703a,  which  triggered  the  Burst  and
          Transient  Source  Experiment  (BATSE  GRB trigger 6891), using
          archived  data  from  the  Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector
          Array (AMANDA-B10). Under the assumption of associated hadronic
          acceleration,  the  expected  observed  neutrino energy flux is
          directly   derived,   based   upon   confronting  the  fireball
          phenomenology with the discrete set of observed electromagnetic
          parameters   of   GRB980703a,  gleaned  from  ground-based  and
          satellite   observations,   for   four  models,  corrected  for
          oscillations.  Models  1  and  2,  based upon spectral analysis
          featuring  a  prompt  photon  energy  fit to the Band function,
          utilize  an  observed spectroscopic redshift, for isotropic and
          anisotropic  emission  geometry, respectively. Model 3 is based
          upon  averaged  burst  parameters, assuming isotropic emission.
          Model  4, based upon a Band fit, features an estimated redshift
          from  the  lag-luminosity  relation  with  isotropic  emission.
          Consistent  with  our  AMANDA-II  analysis  of GRB030329, which
          resulted  in  a flux upper limit of ~0.150 GeV/cm^2/s for model
          1,  we  find  differences in excess of an order of magnitude in
          the  response  of  AMANDA-B10,  among  the  various  models for
          GRB980703a.  Implications  for  future  searches  in the era of

          Title:  Strongly  induced collapse in the Class 0 protostar NGC
          1333 IRAS 4A
          Authors: A. Belloche, P. Hennebelle, P. Andre
          Comments: Accepted by A&A. 12 pages, 10 figures
          The  onset  of gravitational collapse in cluster-forming clouds
          is still poorly known. Our goal is to use the Class 0 protostar
          IRAS  4A,  which is undergoing collapse in the active molecular
          cloud  NGC  1333,  to  set  constraints  on  this  process.  In
          particular  we  want  to  measure  the  mass  infall  rate  and
          investigate whether the collapse could have been triggered by a
          strong  external  perturbation.  We  analyze existing continuum
          observations  to  derive the density structure of the envelope,
          and  use our new molecular line observations done with the IRAM
          30m  telescope  to  probe  its velocity structure. We perform a
          detailed  comparison of this set of data with a numerical model
          of  collapse triggered by a fast external compression. Both the
          density  and  velocity  structures  of the envelope can be well
          fitted  by  this  model  of collapse induced by a fast external
          compression  for  a  time elapsed since point mass formation of
          1-2  x  10**4 yr. We deduce a large mass infall rate of 0.7-2 x
          10**-4  Msun/yr.  The momentum required for the perturbation to
          produce this large mass infall rate is of the same order as the
          momenta  measured  for  the  NGC  1333  numerous  outflows. Our
          analysis  shows  also that the turbulence is highly non uniform
          in  the  envelope,  dropping from supersonic to subsonic values
          toward the center. The inner subsonic turbulence is most likely
          a  relic  of the conditions prevailing in the dense core before
          the  onset of collapse. The vigorous collapse undergone by IRAS
          4A  was  triggered  by  a  fast  external compression, probably
          related  to  the expansion of a nearby cavity, which could have
          triggered  the collapse of the nearby Class 0 protostar IRAS 4B
          simultaneously.  This  cavity  could  have been generated by an
          outflow  but  we  have  not found a good protostellar candidate
          yet.

          MNRAS
          We   have   applied  an  eccentric  accretion  disc  theory  in
          simplified  form  to  the case of an accretion disc in a binary
          system,  where  the  disc  contains the 3:1 Lindblad resonance.
          This  is relevant to the case of superhumps in SU Ursae Majoris
          cataclysmic  variables  and  other systems, where it is thought
          that  this  resonance  leads  to  growth  of eccentricity and a
          modulation  in  the  light  curve  due  to the interaction of a
          precessing   eccentric  disc  with  tidal  stresses.  A  single
          differential   equation   is  formulated  which  describes  the
          propagation,   resonant   excitation  and  viscous  damping  of
          eccentricity. The theory is first worked out in the simple case
          of  a  narrow  ring  and  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  the
          eccentricity distribution is locally suppressed by the presence
          of  the  resonance,  creating  a dip in the eccentricity at the
          resonant  radius.  Application  of this theory to the superhump
          case  confirms  this  conclusion  and  produces a more accurate
          expression  for  the  precession rate of the disc than has been
          previously accomplished with simple dynamical estimates.

          With  the  discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Ibata
          et  al.  1994),  a galaxy caught in the process of merging with
          the  Milky  Way,  the  hunt for other such accretion events has
          become  a  very  active  field  of  astrophysical research. The
          identification  of  a stellar ring-like structure in Monoceros,
          spanning  more  than 100 degrees (Newberg et al. 2002), and the
          detection  of  an  overdensity of stars in the direction of the
          constellation  of  Canis  Major  (CMa,  Martin  et  al.  2004),
          apparently  associated  to  the ring, has led to the widespread
          belief that a second galaxy being cannibalised by the Milky Way
          had  been found. In this scenario, the overdensity would be the
          remaining  core  of  the disrupted galaxy and the ring would be
          the  tidal  debris left behind. However, unlike the Sagittarius
          dwarf,  which is well below the Galactic plane and whose orbit,
          and  thus  tidal  tail, is nearly perpendicular to the plane of
          the  Milky  Way,  the  putative  CMa galaxy and ring are nearly
          co-planar with the Galactic disk. This severely complicates the
          interpretation  of  observations.  In this letter, we show that
          our  new  description  of  the  Milky Way leads to a completely
          different  picture.  We  argue that the Norma-Cygnus spiral arm
          defines  a  distant  stellar  ring  crossing  Monoceros and the
          overdensity  is simply a projection effect of looking along the
          nearby  local  arm.  Our  perspective sheds new light on a very
          poorly  known  region, the third Galactic quadrant (3GQ), where
          CMa is located.

          AGN Tori and its Application to NGC 1068

astro-ph limitations); accepted by A&A
          Recent  observations of NGC 1068 and other AGN support the idea
          of  a  geometrically and optically thick dust torus surrounding
          the  central supermassive black hole and accretion disk of AGN.
          In  type  2  AGN, the torus is seen roughly edge-on, leading to
          obscuration  of  the  central  radiation  source and a silicate
          absorption  feature  near  10 micron. While most of the current
          torus  models  distribute  the  dust smoothly, there is growing
          evidence  that the dust must be arranged in clouds. We describe
          a  new  method  for modeling near- and mid-infrared emission of
          3-dimensional  clumpy  tori  using  Monte Carlo simulations. We
          calculate  the radiation fields of individual clouds at various
          distances  from  the AGN and distribute these clouds within the
          torus region. The properties of the individual clouds and their
          distribution within the torus are determined from a theoretical
          approach of self-gravitating clouds close to the shear limit in
          a  gravitational  potential.  We demonstrate that clumpiness in
          AGN  tori  can overcome the problem of over-pronounced silicate
          features.  Finally,  we  present  model  calculations  for  the
          prototypical  Seyfert  2  galaxy  NGC  1068 and compare them to
          recent  high-resolution  measurements.  Our  model  is  able to
          reproduce  both the SED and the interferometric observations of
          NGC 1068 in the near- and mid-infrared.

          Title:   The   spatial  clustering  of  ultraluminous  infrared
          galaxies over 1.5<z<3

          We  present  measurements of the spatial clustering of galaxies
          with  evolved  stellar masses >10^11Msun, infrared luminosities
          >10^12Lsun,  and  star  formation  rates  >200Msun yr^-1 in two
          redshift  intervals;  1.5<z<2.0 and 2<z<3. Both samples cluster
          moderately   strongly,  with  spatial  correlation  lengths  of
          r0=6.14+/-0.84h^-1    Mpc    for    the   2<z<3   sample,   and
          r0=5.36+/-1.28h^-1   Mpc   for   the  1.5<z<2.0  sample.  These
          clustering  amplitudes  are  consistent  with  both populations
          residing  in  dark  matter  haloes with masses of ~7x10^12Msun,
          which  is  comparable to that seen for optical QSOs at the same
          epochs.  We  infer  that  a minimum dark matter halo mass is an
          important  factor  for all forms of luminous, obscured activity
          in galaxies at z>1, both starbursts and AGN. Adopting plausible
          models  for  the  growth  of  DM haloes with redshift, then the
          haloes  hosting  the 2<z<3 sample will likely host poor to rich
          clusters  of  galaxies  at  z=0, whereas the haloes hosting the
          1.5<z<2.0  sample  will  likely  host  >L*  ellipticals or poor
          clusters  at  z=0.  We  conclude  that  ULIRGs  at z~2.5 likely
          signpost  a  significant  period of stellar buildup in galaxies
          that  will  reside in clusters at z=0, and that ULIRGs at z~1.7
          likely  signpost  stellar  buildup  in sources that will either
          become >L* ellipticals, or reside in poor clusters, at z=0.

          We  use near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy obtained with GNIRS on
          Gemini,  NIRSPEC  on  KECK,  and  ISAAC on the VLT to study the
          rest-frame  optical  continua  of  three `Distant Red Galaxies'
          (having  Js  -  Ks > 2.3) at z>2. All three galaxy spectra show
          the  Balmer/4000  Angstrom break in the rest-frame optical. The
          spectra  allow us to determine spectroscopic redshifts from the
          continuum  with  an  estimated  accuracy dz/(1+z) ~ 0.001-0.04.
          These redshifts agree well with the emission line redshifts for
          the   2  galaxies  with  Halpha  emission.  This  technique  is
          particularly  important  for  galaxies  that  are  faint in the
          rest-frame  UV,  as  they are underrepresented in high redshift
          samples  selected  in  optical  surveys  and  are too faint for
          optical  spectroscopy. Furthermore, we use the break, continuum
          shape,   and   equivalent   width   of   Halpha  together  with
          evolutionary  synthesis  models  to  constrain  the  age,  star
          formation  timescale,  dust  content,  stellar  mass  and  star
          formation rate of the galaxies. Inclusion of the NIR spectra in
          the  stellar  population  fits  greatly  reduces  the  range of
          possible  solutions  for stellar population properties. We find
          that  the  stellar  populations  differ greatly among the three
          galaxies,  ranging  from  a  young dusty starburst with a small
          break  and  strong  emission  lines to an evolved galaxy with a
          strong break and no detected line emission. The dusty starburst
          galaxy  has  an  age  of  0.3 Gyr and a stellar mass of 1*10^11
          Msun.  The  spectra of the two most evolved galaxies imply ages
          of  1.3-1.4  Gyr  and stellar masses of 4*10^11 Msun. The large
          range  of  properties  seen  in  these galaxies strengthens our
          previous much more uncertain results from broadband photometry.
          Larger samples are required to determine the relative frequency
          of dusty starbursts and (nearly) passively evolving galaxies at
          z~2.5.

          Title: Giant Planet Accretion and Migration: Surviving the Type
          I Regime
          Authors: Edward W. Thommes, Norman Murray
          Comments:  To  appear in ApJ. 644. 12 pages, 9 figures. Figures
          degraded for size; see this http URL for originals
          In  the  standard  model of gas giant planet formation, a large
          solid  core  (~  10  times  the Earth's mass) forms first, then
          accretes  its  massive  envelope  (100 or more Earth masses) of
          gas.  However,  inward  planet  migration  due to gravitational
          interaction  with the proto-stellar gas disk poses a difficulty
          in  this  model.  Core-sized  bodies  undergo  rapid  "Type  I"
          migration;  for typical parameters their migration timescale is
          much  shorter  than  their  accretion  timescale. How, then, do
          growing cores avoid spiraling into the central star before they
          ever  get  the  chance to become gas giants? Here, we present a
          simple model of core formation in a gas disk which is viscously
          evolving.  As  the  disk  dissipates,  accretion  and migration
          timescales  eventually become comparable. If this happens while
          there  is  still enough gas left in the disk to supply a jovian
          atmosphere,   then  a  window  of  opportunity  for  gas  giant
          formation  opens.  We  examine  under  what  circumstances this
          happens,  and  thus, what predictions our model makes about the
          link  between  proto-stellar disk properties and the likelihood
          of forming giant planets.

          We present a total of 4784 unique broad absorption line quasars
          from  the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  Third  Data Release. An
          automated  algorithm  was  used  to  match  a continuum to each
          quasar  and  to identify regions of flux at least 10% below the
          continuum  over  a  velocity range of at least 1000 km/s in the
          CIV  and  MgII  absorption  regions.  The  model  continuum was
          selected  as  the  best-fit match from a set of template quasar
          spectra   binned   in  luminosity,  emission  line  width,  and
          redshift,  with the power-law spectral index and amount of dust
          reddening  as  additional  free parameters. We characterize our
          sample  through  the  traditional  ``balnicity''  index  and  a
          revised absorption index, as well as through parameters such as
          the  width,  outflow  velocity,  fractional depth and number of
          troughs.  From a sample of 16883 quasars at 1.7 \le z \le 4.38,
          we  identify 4386 (26.0%) quasars with broad CIV absorption, of
          which 1756 (10.4%) satisfy traditional selection criteria. From
          a  sample  of  34973 quasars at 0.5 \le z \le 2.15, we identify
          457  (1.31%) quasars with broad MgII absorption, 191 (0.55%) of
          which satisfy traditional selection criteria. We also provide a
          supplementary  list  of  39  visually identified z>4.38 quasars
          with  broad  CIV absorption. We find that broad absorption line
          quasars  may  have broader emission lines on average than other
          quasars.

          Comments: Protostars and Planets V review. 16 pages long
          We  review the known properties of molecular outflows from low-
          and  high-mass  young  stars. General trends among outflows are
          identified,  and  the  most  recent  studies on the morphology,
          kinematics, energetics, and evolution of molecular outflows are
          discussed,  focusing on results from high-resolution millimeter
          observations.  We  review  the  existing  four broad classes of
          outflow  models  and  compare  numerical  simulations  with the
          observational data. A single class of models cannot explain the
          range  of  morphological  and  kinematic  properties  that  are
          observed,  and  we  propose  a possible solution. The impact of
          outflows on their cloud is examined, and we review how outflows
          can disrupt their surrounding environment, through the clearing
          of gas and the injection of momentum and energy onto the gas at
          distances  from their powering sources from about 0.01 to a few
          pc.  We  also  discuss  the  effects  of shock-induced chemical
          processes  on  the  ambient medium, and how these processes may
          act  as  a  chemical  clock  to  date  outflows. Lastly, future
          outflow  research  with  existing  and  planned  millimeter and
          submillimeter instruments is presented.

          Title:  How  Do  We  See the Relativistic Accretion Disk during
          Thermal Instability?
          Authors: Akihiro Kawata, Ken-ya Watarai, Jun Fukue
          Comments: 8pages, 5figures, PASJ 58 (2006) in press
          We  calculated the bolometric images of relativistic slim disks
          during  radiation-pressure-driven thermal instability. When the
          mass-accretion  rate  exceeds the critical one, an inner region
          of  the standard accretion disk bursts to change to a slim disk
          state having a large scale height. That is, the inner region of
          the  disk  becomes  high  temperature, and the thickness of the
          disk  increases  due to the increase of the radiation pressure.
          As  a  result,  we  found  that  the observed image of the disk
          during  the  burst  strongly  depends on the inclination angle.
          That is, radiation from the innermost disk would be occulted by
          the  disk  outer  rim  for  high  inclination angles($i \gtrsim
          70^\circ$). We also calculated the spectral energy distribution
          during  thermal  instability.  The Wien peak of the spectrum of
          high  inclination  angles  becomes  softer  than  that  of  low
          inclination angles due to the geometrical thickness. From these
          facts,  even  if the burst happens in black hole candidates, we
          may  not observe the burst when the inclination angle is large.
          We may suggest that numerous luminous black hole candidates are
          still hidden in our Galaxy.

          As  part  of  the first far-IR line survey towards Orion KL, we
          present  the  detection  of  seven  new rotationally excited OH
          Lambda-doublets   (at   48,   65,  71,  79,  98  and  115  um).
          Observations   were   performed   with   the   Long  Wavelength
          Spectrometer  (LWS)  Fabry-Perots  on  board the Infrared Space
          Observatory   (ISO).   In  total,  more  than  20  resolved  OH
          rotational  lines,  with  upper energy levels up to 620 K, have
          been  detected  at an angular and velocity resolutions of 80$''
          and  33  km  s^-1 respectively. OH line profiles show a complex
          behavior  evolving  from  pure absorption, P-Cygni type to pure
          emission.  We  also present a large scale 6' declination raster
          in  the  OH  ^2\Pi_3/2 J=5/2^+-3/2^- and ^2\Pi_3/2 J=7/2^-5/2^+
          lines  (at  119.441  and  84.597  um) revealing the decrease of
          excitation  outside  the  core  of the cloud. From the observed
          profiles,  mean  intrinsic  line  widths  and  velocity offsets
          between  emission  and  absorption  line peaks we conclude that
          most  of  the excited OH arises from Orion outflow(s), i.e. the
          ``plateau''  component.  We  determine an averaged OH abundance
          relative to H_2 of X(OH)=(0.5-1.0)x10^-6, a kinetic temperature
          of  100 K and a density of n(H_2)=5x10^5 cm^-3. Even with these
          conditions,  the  OH  excitation  is  heavily  coupled with the
          strong  dust continuum emission from the inner hot core regions
          and from the expanding flow itself.

          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          Molecular gas in the merging starburst galaxy NGC 3256 has been
          imaged  with  the  Submillimeter Array at a resolution of 1'' x
          2'' (170 x 340 pc at 35 Mpc). This is the first interferometric
          imaging  of  molecular  gas  in the most luminous galaxy within
          z=0.01.  There  is a large disk of molecular gas (r > 3 kpc) in
          the center of the merger with a strong gas concentration toward
          the  double nucleus. The gas disk having a mass of ~3*10^9 Msun
          in  the  central  3  kpc rotates around a point between the two
          nuclei  that  are 850 pc apart on the sky. The molecular gas is
          warm and turbulent and shows spatial variation of the intensity
          ratio  between  CO  isotopomers. High-velocity molecular gas is
          discovered  at the galactic center. Its velocity in our line of
          sight  is  up  to 420 km/s offset from the systemic velocity of
          the galaxy; the terminal velocity is twice as large as that due
          to  the rotation of the main gas disk. The high-velocity gas is
          most  likely  due  to  a  molecular  outflow from the gas disk,
          entrained  by the starburst-driven superwind in the galaxy. The
          molecular  outflow  is  estimated to have a rate of ~10 Msun/yr
          and to play a significant role in the dispersal or depletion of
          molecular   gas   from  the  galactic  center.  A  compact  gas
          concentration and steep velocity gradient are also found around
          each  of  the  twin  nuclei. They are suggestive of a small gas
          disk   rotating  around  each  nucleus.  If  these  are  indeed
          mini-disks,  their  dynamical  masses  are  ~10^9 Msun within a
          radius of 170 pc.

          The  hard  X-ray source IGRJ11215-5952 has been discovered with
          INTEGRAL  during a short outburst in 2005 and proposed as a new
          member  of  the  class  of supergiant fast X-ray transients. We
          analysed  INTEGRAL  public  observations of the source field in
          order to search for previous outbursts from this transient, not
          reported  in  literature.Our  results are based on a systematic
          re-analysis of INTEGRAL archival observations, using the latest
          analysis  software  and  instrument calibrations. We report the
          discovery  of  two  previously  unnoticed  outbursts, spaced by
          intervals  of  ~330  days,  that  occurred in July 2003 and May
          2004.  The  5-100keV  spectrum  is  well described by a cut-off
          power  law,  with  a  photon index of 0.5, and a cut-off energy
          ~15-20keV,  typical  of  High  Mass  X-ray  Binaries  hosting a
          neutron  star.  A  5-100keV  luminosity  of 3E36 erg/s has been
          derived  (assuming  6.2kpc,  the distance of the likely optical
          counterpart).  The  5-100keV spectral properties, the recurrent
          nature  of the outbursts,together with the reduced error region
          containing   the  blue  supergiant  star  HD306414,support  the
          hypothesis  that IGRJ11215-5952 is a member of the class of the
          Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients.

          Using  Chandra X-ray data of a sample of 15 X-ray bright galaxy
          groups,  we  present preliminary results of a coherent study of
          the  radial  distribution of metal abundances in the hot gas in
          groups.  The  iron  content  in  group outskirts is found to be
          lower  than in clusters by a factor of ~2, despite showing mean
          levels  in the central regions comparable to those of clusters.
          The  abundance  profiles are used to constrain the contribution
          from  supernovae  type Ia and II to the chemical enrichment and
          thermal  energy  of  the  intragroup  medium at different group
          radii.  The  results  suggest a scenario in which a substantial
          fraction  of  the  chemical  enrichment of groups took place in
          filaments prior to group collapse.

          We  report  the detection of a 110 MG cyclotron harmonic in the
          SDSS-spectrum  of  the  magnetic  cataclysmic variable (MCV) RX
          J1554.2+2721.  This  feature  was  noted  earlier by others but
          remained  unexplained.  The  wide  spectral coverage of the new
          spectrum  together with the earlier detection of a Zeeman split
          Ly-a  line in a field of 144 MG makes the identification almost
          unambiguous.   We   propose   to   explain  the  non-conforming
          UV-optical photospheric temperature of the white dwarf by an as
          yet  unobserved  cyclotron  component  in the ultraviolet which
          also  could  significantly  contribute  to  the  overall energy
          balance of the accretion process.

          Title: The X-ray nuclei of intermediate-redshift radio sources
          Authors: M. J. Hardcastle, D. A. Evans, J. H. Croston
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS. 12 pages, 5 figures
          We  present  a  Chandra and XMM-Newton spectral analysis of the
          nuclei  of  the  radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars from the
          3CRR  sample  in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.5. In the range
          of  radio luminosity sampled by these objects, mostly FRIIs, it
          has  been  clear  for  some  time  that  a  population of radio
          galaxies   (`low-excitation   radio  galaxies')  cannot  easily
          participate in models that unify narrow-line radio galaxies and
          broad-line objects. We show that low-excitation and narrow-line
          radio  galaxies  have  systematically  different  nuclear X-ray
          properties: while narrow-line radio galaxies universally show a
          heavily  absorbed  nuclear  X-ray  component,  such  a  heavily
          absorbed  component  is  rarely  found  in  sources  classed as
          low-excitation  objects. Combining our data with the results of
          our  earlier  work  on  the  z<0.1 3CRR sources, we discuss the
          implications of this result for unified models, for the origins
          of mid-infrared emission from radio sources, and for the nature
          of  the  apparent  FRI/FRII dichotomy in the X-ray. The lack of
          direct  evidence  for  accretion-related X-ray emission in FRII
          LERGs leads us to argue that there is a strong possibility that
          some,  or most, FRII LERGs accrete in a radiatively inefficient
          mode.  However, our results are also consistent with a model in
          which   the   accretion   mode   is   the  same  for  low-  and
          high-excitation FRIIs, with the lower accretion luminosities in
          FRII   LERGs   attributed   instead  to  more  efficient  radio
          luminosity production in those objects.

          Title:  Disks  around  Young O-B (Proto)Stars: Observations and
          Theory

          Disks  are  a  natural outcome of the star formation process in
          which  they  play  a  crucial  role. Luminous, massive stars of
          spectral  type  earlier  than  B4  are  likely to be those that
          benefit  most  from the existence of accretion disks, which may
          significantly  reduce  the  effect of radiation pressure on the
          accreting material. The scope of the present contribution is to
          review  the  current  knowledge  about disks in young high-mass
          (proto)stars and discuss their implications. The issues of disk
          stability and lifetime are also discussed. We conclude that for
          protostars  of  less  than  ~20  solar  masses, disks with mass
          comparable  to  that of the central star are common. Above this
          limit  the  situation is unclear and there are no good examples
          of  proto  O4-O8  stars surrounded by accretion disks: in these
          objects  only huge, massive, toroidal, non-equilibrium rotating
          structures  are  seen.  It  is clear on the other hand that the
          observed  disks in stars of 10-20 solar masses are likely to be
          unstable and with short lifetimes.

          We  present  a  high  quality  multiwavelength (from 0.3 to 8.0
          micron)  catalog  of  the  large  and  deep  area  in the GOODS
          Southern   Field  covered  by  the  deep  near-IR  observations
          obtained  with  the  ESO  VLT. The catalog is entirely based on
          public  data:  in  our  analysis,  we  have included the F435W,
          F606W,  F775W  and  F850LP  ACS  images, the JHKs VLT data, the
          Spitzer data provided by IRAC instrument (3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0
          micron), and publicly available U-band data from the 2.2ESO and
          VLT-VIMOS.  We  describe  in  detail  the procedures adopted to
          obtain   this   multiwavelength   catalog.  In  particular,  we
          developed  a  specific software for the accurate "PSF-matching"
          of  space  and  ground-based images of different resolution and
          depth   (ConvPhot),   of  which  we  analyse  performances  and
          limitations.  We  have  included  both  z-selected,  as well as
          Ks-selected   objects,   yielding   a  unique,  self-consistent
          catalog.  The largest fraction of the sample is 90% complete at
          z~26  or  Ks~23.8  (AB scale). Finally, we cross-correlated our
          data  with  all  the  spectroscopic catalogs available to date,
          assigning  a  spectroscopic redshift to more than 1000 sources.
          The  final  catalog is made up of 14847 objects, at least 72 of
          which  are  known  stars,  68  are  AGNs, and 928 galaxies with
          spectroscopic  redshift  (668  galaxies  with reliable redshift
          determination).  We  applied  our  photometric redshift code to
          this data set, and the comparison with the spectroscopic sample
          shows  that  the quality of the resulting photometric redshifts
          is  excellent,  with  an average scatter of only 0.06. The full
          catalog,  which  we named GOODS-MUSIC (MUltiwavelength Southern
          Infrared  Catalog), including the spectroscopic information, is
          made   publicly   available,   together   with   the   software
          specifically designed to this end.

          We  use  the GOODS-MUSIC sample, a catalog of ~3000 Ks-selected
          galaxies  based  on  VLT and HST observation of the GOODS-South
          field  with  extended  multi-wavelength coverage (from 0.3 to 8
          micron)  and accurate estimates of the photometric redshifts to
          select  179 DRGs with J-Ks>1.3 in an area of 135 sq. arcmin. We
          first  show  that  the  J-Ks>1.3  criterion  selects  a  rather
          heterogeneous  sample  of  galaxies,  going  from  the targeted
          high-redshift   luminous  evolved  systems,  to  a  significant
          fraction  of  lower  redshift  (1<z<2)  and less luminous dusty
          starbursts.  These  low-redshift  DRGs  are  significantly less
          clustered  than  higher-z  DRGs.  With  the  aid of extreme and
          simplified  theoretical  models of clustering evolution we show
          that  it  is  unlikely  that the two samples are drawn from the
          same  population observed at two different stages of evolution.
          High-z  DRGs  likely  represent  the  progenitors  of  the more
          massive  and  more  luminous galaxies in the local Universe and
          might  mark  the regions that will later evolve into structures
          of  intermediate  mass,  like  groups or small galaxy clusters.
          Low-z DRGs, on the other hand, will likely evolve into slightly
          less massive field galaxies.

          Title:   Polars   Changing  State:  Multiwavelength  Long  Term
          Photometry and Spectroscopy of QS Tel, V834 Cen, and BL Hyi
          Authors: Jill R. Gerke, Steve B. Howell, Frederick M. Walter
          Comments: 9 figures, 4 tables; accepted for publication in PASP
          Long  term  optical  and  near-infrared  photometric  and  blue
          spectroscopic  observations were obtained for QS Tel, V834 Cen,
          and  BL  Hyi.  The  optical  light  curves  of all three polars
          displayed  large  magnitude  changes  during  our observations.
          These  same  high/low  state  transitions were also apparent in
          near-infrared  JHK photometry, though with decreased amplitude.
          The  color  of the polar with respect to its state was examined
          and  found  not  to  be  a  good indicator of the instantaneous
          state.  During low to high state transitions, a nearly constant
          magnitude  difference  was  observed  in all three polars. This
          $\Delta$m  value  was  found  to  be  consistent with the level
          expected to occur if accretion onto the white dwarf reached the
          Eddington  luminosity  during  the  high  state. The high state
          Balmer  decrement  was  measured  for  each  star  and  used to
          estimate  that  the  temperature  of  the emission line forming
          region  was  ~12,000K with N$_H$ near 12.8 dex. No relationship
          between  the  Balmer emission line strength and the white dwarf
          magnetic  field  strength  was  seen,  in  contrast  to  a good
          correlation  between  these  two  parameters  observed  for  UV
          emission lines.

          A growing number of early Be stars exhibit unusually hard X-ray
          spectra  and luminosities intermediate between those typical of
          early type stars and those emitted by most Be/X-ray binaries in
          quiescence. We report on XMM-Newton and optical observations of
          two  such  Be stars, SAO 49725 and HD 161103. The nature of the
          hard-thermal  X-ray  emission  is discussed in the light of the
          models  proposed  for Gamma Cas, magnetic disc-star interaction
          or  accretion onto a compact companion object - neutron star or
          white  dwarf.  These  two  new  objects  added to similar cases
          discovered  in  XMM-Newton  surveys point at the emergence of a
          new class of Gamma Cas analogs.

          We  develop  a  formalism  for  the identification and accurate
          estimation of the strength of structure formation shocks during
          cosmological   smoothed   particle  hydrodynamics  simulations.
          Shocks  not only play a decisive role for the thermalization of
          gas  in virialising structures but also for the acceleration of
          relativistic   cosmic   rays   (CRs)  through  diffusive  shock
          acceleration.  Our  formalism  is  applicable  both to ordinary
          non-relativistic  thermal  gas,  and to plasmas composed of CRs
          and  thermal gas. To this end, we derive an analytical solution
          to  the  one-dimensional  Riemann  shock  tube  problem  for  a
          composite  plasma  of CRs and thermal gas. We apply our methods
          to  study  the  properties  of  structure  formation  shocks in
          high-resolution  hydrodynamic simulations of the LCDM model. We
          find  that  most  of  the energy is dissipated in weak internal
          shocks  with  Mach  numbers M~2 which are predominantly central
          flow  shocks  or  merger  shock  waves traversing halo centres.
          Collapsed  cosmological  structures  are surrounded by external
          shocks  with  much  higher  Mach numbers up to M~1000, but they
          play only a minor role in the energy balance of thermalization.
          We  show  that  after the epoch of cosmic reionisation the Mach
          number  distribution  is significantly modified by an efficient
          suppression   of   strong  external  shock  waves  due  to  the
          associated  increase  of  the  sound  speed of the diffuse gas.
          Invoking  a  model  for CR acceleration in shock waves, we find
          that  the  average  strength  of shock waves responsible for CR
          energy  injection  is higher than that for shocks that dominate
          the  thermalization  of  the  gas. When combined with radiative
          dissipation  and star formation, our formalism can also be used
          to  study  CR  injection  by  supernova shocks, or to construct
          models  for  shock-induced  star  formation in the interstellar
          medium. (abridged)

          SDSSJ1049+5103,  commonly  known  as Willman 1, is an extremely
          low-luminosity   Milky   Way  companion  whose  properties  are
          intermediate  between  those  of  globular  clusters  and dwarf
          spheroidals. In this paper, we use deep photometry to show that
          this object is old and moderately metal-poor, has a distance of
          38  +/-  7  kpc,  has  an M_V of -2.5 mag, and has a half-light
          radius  of 21 +/- 7 pc, consistent with previous estimates. The
          spatial  distribution  of Willman 1's main sequence stars shows
          1)  its  total  spatial  extent  exceeds its tidal radius for a
          range  of assumptions about its total mass and its orbit and 2)
          the  presence of prominent multi-directional stellar tails. The
          tidal  interactions causing these tail features may explain the
          large  physical  size  of  Willman 1 relative to low-luminosity
          globular  clusters.  It is the most distant Galactic object yet
          known  to  display  prominent  tails,  and  is the only distant
          satellite  to  display  multi-directional  tails.  Although  we
          cannot   at   present  determine  the  cause  of  this  unusual
          morphology,  preliminary  comparisons between the morphology of
          Willman 1 and published simulations suggest that it may be near
          the apocenter of its orbit, or that it may have interacted with
          another  halo  object. We find a significant difference between
          the  luminosity  functions  of  stars  in the center and in the
          tails  of  Willman 1, strongly suggesting mass segregation much
          like  that  seen  in  Palomar  5.  Although  Willman 1 has more
          pronounced  tidal  tails  than  most  confirmed Milky Way dwarf
          galaxies,  because  of  its  very low stellar mass we cannot at
          present  rule  out  the  possibility  that it has a dark matter
          halo. (Abridged)

          The  inner  0.1 AU around accreting T Tauri stars hold clues to
          many  physical  processes that characterize the early evolution
          of  solar-type  stars.  The accretion-ejection connection takes
          place at least in part in this compact magnetized region around
          the central star, with the inner disk edge interacting with the
          star's    magnetosphere    thus   leading   simultaneously   to
          magnetically  channeled  accretion  flows  and to high velocity
          winds  and  outflows.  The  magnetic  star-disk  interaction is
          thought  to  have  strong implications for the angular momentum
          evolution  of  the  central  system, the inner structure of the
          disk,  and  possibly for halting the migration of young planets
          close to the stellar surface. We review here the current status
          of  magnetic  field  measurements  in T Tauri stars, the recent
          modeling  efforts  of  the  magnetospheric  accretion  process,
          including   both   radiative  transfer  and  multi-D  numerical
          simulations,  and  summarize  current  evidence  supporting the
          concept  of magnetically-channeled accretion in young stars. We
          also   discuss   the   limits   of  the  models  and  highlight
          observational   results   which   suggest  that  the  star-disk
          interaction  is a highly dynamical and time variable process in
          young stars.

          Title:  A  Viscous  Heating Mechanism for the Hot Plasma in the
          Galactic Center Region
          Authors: R. Belmont, M. Tagger
          Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in A&A
          In  addition  to  lines originating in a soft phase at ~0.8 keV
          and  to  cold  molecular  clouds,  the  X-ray  spectra from the
          Galactic center region also exhibit properties similar to those
          of  a  diffuse,  thin,  very  hot plasma at 8 keV on a scale of
          hundreds of parsecs. This phase is surprising for more than one
          reason.  First,  such  a  hot plasma should not be bound to the
          Galactic  plane  and  the  power needed to sustain the escaping
          matter  would be higher then any known source. Second, there is
          no  known  mechanism able to heat the plasma to more than a few
          keV.  Recently we have suggested that, hydrogen having escaped,
          the  hot  plasma  could  be a helium plasma, heavy enough to be
          gravitationally  confined.  In this case, the required power is
          much  more  reasonable.  We  present  here  a  possible heating
          mechanism  which taps the gravitational energy of the molecular
          clouds.  We note that the 8 keV plasma is highly viscous and we
          show  how  viscous  friction of molecular clouds flowing within
          the  hot  phase can dissipate energy in the gas and heat it. We
          detail  the  MHD  wake  of a spherical cloud by considering the
          different  MHD waves the cloud can excite. We find that most of
          the   energy   is   dissipated   by  the  damping  of  Alfvenic
          perturbations  in  two  possible  manners, namely by non-linear
          effects  and  by  a  large  scale curvature of the field lines.
          Depending  on  the field strength, this heating can balance the
          radiative  cooling.  We  note that the plasma parameters may be
          optimal  to  make  the dissipation most efficient, suggesting a
          self-regulation    mechanism.   The   loss   of   kinetic   and
          gravitational  energy  also  causes accretion of the clouds and
          may  have significant action on the gas dynamics in this region
          between  the  large  scale,  bar dominated flow and the central
          accretion to the massive black hole.

          Title: New Results from High Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy
          Authors: Heinrich J. Völk
          Comments:  10  pages, 6 figures, Invited paper at IAU Symposium
          No.230,  2005,  in Dublin (Ireland); E.J.A. Meurs, G. Fabbiano,
          eds.; in press (2006)
          High  energy  gamma-ray astronomy has recently made significant
          progresss   through  ground-based  instruments  like  the  {\it
          H.E.S.S.}  array  of  imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.
          The  unprecedented  angular  resolution  and the large field of
          view  has  allowed  to spatially resolve for the first time the
          morphology  of  gamma-ray  sources in the TeV energy range. The
          experimental  technique  is  described and the types of sources
          detected  and  still  expected  are discussed. Selected results
          include  objects  as different as a Galactic binary Pulsar, the
          Galactic  Center  and  Supernova Remnants but they also concern
          the  diffuse  extragalactic  optical/infrared  radiation field.
          Finally,  a  scan  of  the  Galactic plane in TeV gamma rays is
          described  which  has  led  to  a significant number of new TeV
          sources,   many  of  which  are  still  unidentified  in  other
          wavelengths.  The  field  has  a  close  connection  with X-ray
          astronomy  which  allows  the study of the synchrotron emission
          from these very high energy sources.

          Title:   Mass   spectrum   of   primordial   black  holes  from
          inflationary  perturbation in the Randall-Sundrum braneworld: a
          limit on blue spectra

          The  mass  spectrum  of  the  primordial  black holes formed by
          density  perturbation  in  the  radiation-dominated  era of the
          Randall-Sundrum   type-2   cosmology  is  given.  The  spectrum
          coincides  with  standard  four-dimensional one on large scales
          but  the  deviation  is  apparent  on  smaller scales. The mass
          spectrum  is  initially  softer  than standard four-dimensional
          one,  while  after accretion during the earliest era it becomes
          harder  than  that. We also show expected extragalactic diffuse
          photon  background  spectra  varying  the  initial perturbation
          power-law  power  spectrum  and  give  constraints  on the blue
          spectra  and/or  the  reheating  temperature.  The  most recent
          observations on the small scale density perturbation from WMAP,
          SDSS  and  Lyman-\alpha  Forest  are  used.  What  we  get  are
          interpreted  as  constraints  on the smaller scale inflation on
          the  brane  connected  to  the  larger  one  at  the  scale  of
          Lyman-\alpha  Forest. If we set the bulk curvature radius to be
          0.1 mm and assume the reheating temperature is higher than 10^6
          GeV, the scalar spectral index from the smaller scale inflation
          is constrained to be n \lesssim 1.3. Typically, the constraints
          are  tighter  than standard four-dimensional one, which is also
          revised by us using the most recent observations.

          Title:  The  black hole fundamental plane from a uniform sample
          of radio and X-ray emitting broad line AGNs
          Authors: Ran Wang (PKU), Xue-Bing Wu (PKU), Min-Zhi Kong (NAOC)
          Comments: 23 pages, 7 figures, ApJ accepted
          We  derived the black hole fundamental plane relationship among
          the  1.4GHz radio luminosity (L_r), 0.1-2.4keV X-ray luminosity
          (L_X),  and  black hole mass (M) from a uniform broad line SDSS
          AGN  sample  including  both  radio  loud and radio quiet X-ray
          emitting  sources.  We found in our sample that the fundamental
          plane  relation  has  a  very weak dependence on the black hole
          mass, and a tight correlation also exists between the Eddington
          luminosity  scaled  X-ray  and radio luminosities for the radio
          quiet  subsample. Additionally, we noticed that the radio quiet
          and  radio  loud  AGNs  have  different power-law slopes in the
          radio--X-ray  non-linear  relationship.  The  radio loud sample
          displays  a  slope of 1.39, which seems consistent with the jet
          dominated  X-ray  model.  However, it may also be partly due to
          the  relativistic  beaming  effect.  For radio quiet sample the
          slope  of the radio--X-ray relationship is about 0.85, which is
          possibly  consistent  with  the theoretical prediction from the
          accretion  flow  dominated  X-ray model. We briefly discuss the
          reason  why  our  derived  relationship  is different from some
          previous  works and expect the future spectral studies in radio
          and  X-ray bands on individual sources in our sample to confirm
          our result.

          Comments: Submitted to Nature
          During  the  last  eight  years  a  clear  connection  has been
          established  between  the  two  most powerful explosions in our
          Universe:  core-collapse  supernovae  (SNe)  and long gamma ray
          bursts (GRBs). Theory suggests that every GRB is simultaneously
          accompanied  by a SN, but in only a few nearby cases have these
          two  phenomena  been observed together. We report the discovery
          and daily monitoring of SN2006aj associated with the GRB060218.
          Because  the  event was the second closest GRB, both explosions
          could  be  examined  in detail. GRB060218 had an unusually soft
          spectrum,  long  duration, and a total energy 100 to 1000 times
          less than most other GRBs. Yet SN2006aj was similar to those in
          other  GRBs,  aside  from  rising  more  rapidly and being ~40%
          fainter.  Taken  together, these observations suggest that GRBs
          have  two  components:  a  broad,  energetic,  but  only mildly
          relativistic  outflow  that  makes  a  SN,  and a more narrowly
          focused,  highly  relativistic jet responsible for the GRB. The
          properties of the GRB jet apparently vary greatly from event to
          event,  while the broad SN outflow varies much less. Low energy
          transients  like GRB060218 may be the most common events in the
          Universe.

          Comments: Submitted to ApJ, 16 pages, 3 color figures
          We  report  recent  Chandra  observations  of  the  ULX  in the
          elliptical   galaxy   NGC3379  that  clearly  detect  two  flux
          variability  cycles.  Comparing  these  data  with  the Chandra
          observation  of  ~5yr  ago, we measure a flux modulation with a
          period   of  ~12.6hr.  Moreover,  we  find  that  the  emission
          undergoes  a correlated spectral modulation, becoming softer at
          low  flux. We argue that our results establish this source as a
          ULX binary in NGC3379. Given the old stellar population of this
          galaxy,  the  ULX  is  likely  to  be a soft transient, however
          historical  X-ray  sampling  suggests that the current on phase
          has  lasted  ~10yr.  We discuss our results in terms of ADC and
          wind-feedback  models.  We constrain the donor mass and orbital
          period  at  the  onset  of  mass  transfer within 1.15-1.4M and
          12.5-16hr,  respectively.  The  duration  of  the mass-transfer
          phase  so  far is probably ~1Gyr and the binary has been a soft
          X-ray  transient  throughout  this  time. These constraints are
          insensitive to the mass of the accretor.

          Title: Microlensing modulation by binaries
          Authors: Florian Dubath, Maria Alice Gasparini, Ruth Durrer
          We  compute  the effect of the lens quadrupole on microlensing.
          The  time  dependence  of  the  quadrupole can lead to specific
          modulations  of  the  amplification signal. We study especially
          binary   system   lenses  in  our  galaxy.  The  modulation  is
          observable if the rotation period of the system is smaller than
          the time over which the amplification is significant and if the
          impact parameter of the passing light ray is sufficiently close
          to the Einstein radius so that the amplification is very large.
          Observations   of   this   modulation   can   reveal  important
          information  on  the  quadrupole  and thus on the gravitational
          radiation emitted by the lens.

          figures available at this http URL
          We  present  observations  of  3.86  sq.  deg.  of  the Perseus
          molecular  cloud  complex  with  the  Spitzer  Space  Telescope
          Infrared  Array  Camera  (IRAC).  The maps show strong extended
          emission  arising from shocked H2 in outflows in the region and
          from   polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbon  features.  More  than
          120,000  sources are extracted toward the cloud. Based on their
          IRAC  colors  and  comparison  to  off-cloud  and extragalactic
          fields,  we identify 400 candidate young stellar objects. About
          two  thirds  of  these  are  associated with the young clusters
          IC348 and NGC1333, while the last third is distributed over the
          remaining   cloud.   We  classify  the  young  stellar  objects
          according to the traditional scheme based on the slope of their
          spectral  energy  distributions.  Significant  differences  are
          found  for  the numbers of embedded Class I objects relative to
          more  evolved  Class  II  objects  in  IC348,  NGC1333  and the
          remaining  cloud  with the embedded Class I and "flat spectrum"
          YSOs  constituting 14%, 36% and 47% of the total number of YSOs
          identified in each of these regions. The high number of Class I
          objects  in  the  extended cloud (61% of the Class I objects in
          the  entire  cloud) suggests that a significant fraction of the
          current  star  formation  is  occuring  outside  the  two  main
          clusters.  Finally we discuss a number of outflows and identify
          their  driving  sources,  including  the  known deeply embedded
          Class  0  sources  outside  the two major clusters. The Class 0
          objects  are  found to be detected by Spitzer and have very red
          [3.6]-[4.5]  colors  but  do not show similarly red [5.8]-[8.0]
          colors.   The  Class  0  objects  are  easily  identifiable  in
          color-color   diagrams   plotting  these  two  colors  but  are
          problematic  to  extract  automatically  due  to  the  extended
          emission  from  shocked  gas  or  scattered  light  in cavities
          related to the associated outflows.

          We  present  new  images  (groundbased optical and mid-infrared
          (MIR)  from  the  Spitzer  Space  Telescope)  and spectra (from
          Spitzer)  of  the archetypal starburst galaxy M 82. The Spitzer
          data  show  that  the MIR emission extends at least 6 kpc along
          the  minor  axis of the galaxy. We use the optical and infrared
          data  to demonstrate that the extended emission is dominated by
          emission  from  dust.  The  colors  of the MIR emission and the
          spectra  indicate  that there is a strong component of aromatic
          feature  emission  (the  MIR  features  commonly  attributed to
          polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons).  The  dust  continuum  and
          aromatic  feature  emission  are  both strong in the well-known
          superwind  region  of  this  galaxy; clearly the carrier of the
          aromatic  features  can survive in close proximity to the wind,
          far  from  the  plane  of  the  galaxy. We also see significant
          emission  by  dust well outside the superwind region, providing
          the  clearest  picture  to date of the dust distribution in the
          halo of this galaxy.

          Title:  The  Distribution  of  Secondary  Masses in Post-Common
          Envelope  Binaries:  A  Potential  Test  of  Disrupted Magnetic
          Braking
          Authors: Michael Politano, Kevin P. Weiler
          The  distribution  of  secondary  star  masses  in  present-day
          post-common  envelope binaries (PCEBs) is calculated using four
          different  models  for  angular  momentum loss (AML) during the
          post-CE   phase:   only  gravitational  radiation  (GR),  GR  +
          disrupted  magnetic  braking  (DMB),  GR + reduced MB, and GR +
          intermediate  MB. For the DMB model, we find that the number of
          PCEBs  decreases  abruptly by 38% once MB begins to operate for
          non-fully  convective  secondaries.  We  do  not find a similar
          feature  in the distributions calculated using any of the other
          three  AML models in which MB is not disrupted. This percentage
          decrease in the number of present-day PCEBs predicted using the
          DMB   model   is  easily  large  enough  so  that  an  observed
          distribution  of  secondary  masses  or  even spectral types in
          PCEBs can provide an important test of whether magnetic braking
          is  indeed  substantially  reduced  in secondary stars that are
          fully  convective.  We  discuss briefly the feasibility of such
          observations.

          We  present  the  catalog of 477 spectra from the Serendipitous
          Extragalactic  X-ray  Source  Identification (SEXSI) program, a
          survey  designed to probe the dominant contributors to the 2-10
          keV  cosmic  X-ray background. Our survey covers 1 deg^2 of sky
          to  2-10  keV  fluxes of 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1, and 2 deg^2 for
          fluxes of 3 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1. Our spectra reach to R <24
          and  have  produced  redshifts  for 438 hard X-ray sources. The
          vast  majority  of  the  2-10  keV-selected sample are AGN with
          redshifts  between  0.1  and 3. We find that few sources at z<1
          have high X-ray luminosities, reflecting a dearth of high-mass,
          high-accretion-rate   sources   at   low   redshift,  a  result
          consistent  with  other  recent  wide-area surveys. Half of our
          sources  show  significant  obscuration,  with N_H>10^22 cm^-2,
          independent  of  unobscured luminosity. We classify 168 sources
          as  emission-line galaxies; all are X-ray luminous objects with
          optical spectra lacking both high-ionization lines and evidence
          of  a non-stellar continuum. The redshift distribution of these
          emission-line  galaxies peaks at a significantly lower redshift
          than  does that of the sources we spectroscopically identify as
          AGN.  We  conclude  that few of these sources can be powered by
          starburst  activity.  Stacking  spectra  for  a subset of these
          sources,  we  detect  [Ne V] emission, a clear signature of AGN
          activity,  confirming  that  the  majority of these objects are
          Seyfert  2s  in  which the high-ionization lines are diluted by
          stellar  emission.  We  find  33 objects lacking broad lines in
          their  optical  spectra  which  have  quasar X-ray luminosities
          (Lx>10^44  erg  s^-1),  the  largest  sample  of  such  objects
          identified  to  date. In addition, we explore 17 AGN associated
          with  galaxy  clusters  and  find  that  the cluster-member AGN
          sample  has  a  lower  fraction of broad-line AGN than does the
          background sample.

          We  present 0.5" resolution near-IR integral field spectroscopy
          of  the  Ha  line emission of 14 z~2 UV-selected BM/BX galaxies
          obtained with SINFONI at ESO/VLT. The mean Ha half-light radius
          r_1/2 is about 4kpc and line emission is detected over > ~20kpc
          in  several sources. In 9 sources, we detect spatially-resolved
          velocity  gradients,  from  40  to  410  km/s  over ~10kpc. The
          observed  kinematics  of the larger systems are consistent with
          orbital  motions.  Four galaxies are well described by rotating
          disks  with  clumpy morphologies and we extract rotation curves
          out  to  radii > ~10kpc. One or two galaxies exhibit signatures
          more  consistent with mergers. Analyzing all 14 galaxies in the
          framework  of  rotating  disks,  we infer mean inclination- and
          beam-corrected  maximum circular velocities v_c of 180+-90 km/s
          and  dynamical  masses  of (0.5-25)x10^10 Msun within r_1/2. On
          average,  the  dynamical masses are consistent with photometric
          stellar masses assuming a Chabrier/Kroupa IMF but too small for
          a  0.1-100  Msun  Salpeter IMF. The specific angular momenta of
          our  BM/BX  galaxies  are  similar  to those of local late-type
          galaxies.  The  specific  angular  momenta of their baryons are
          comparable  to  those of their dark matter halos. Extrapolating
          from  the  average v_c at 10kpc, the virial mass of the typical
          halo  of  a  galaxy  in  our  sample  is  10^(11.7+-0.5)  Msun.
          Kinematic  modeling  of the 3 best cases implies a ratio of v_c
          to  local  velocity  dispersion  of order 2-4 and accordingly a
          large  geometric  thickness. We argue that this suggests a mass
          accretion (alternatively, gas exhaustion) timescale of ~500Myr.
          We  also  argue  that  if our BM/BX galaxies were initially gas
          rich,  their  clumpy disks will subsequently lose their angular
          momentum  and  form  compact  bulges  on a timescale of ~1 Gyr.

          We review the phenomenon of ultra-compact H II regions (UCHIIs)
          as  a  key phase in the early lives of massive stars. This most
          visible manifestation of massive star formation begins when the
          Lyman  continuum  output  from the massive young stellar object
          becomes sufficient to ionize the surroundings from which it was
          born.  Knowledge  of  this  environment  is  gained  through an
          understanding  of  the  morphologies  of  UCHII  regions and we
          examine  the  latest  developments  in  deep  radio  and mid-IR
          imaging.  SPITZER data from the GLIMPSE survey are an important
          new  resource  in which PAH emission and the ionizing stars can
          be seen. We review the role played by strong stellar winds from
          the  central stars in sweeping out central cavities and causing
          the  limb-brightened  appearance.  A  range  of  evidence  from
          velocity  structure,  proper motions, the molecular environment
          and  recent  hydrodynamical  modeling  indicates  that cometary
          UCHII  regions  require a combination of champagne flow and bow
          shock  motion. Finally, we discuss the class of hyper-compact H
          II regions or broad recombination line objects. They are likely
          to  mark  the  transition  soon after the breakout of the Lyman
          continuum  radiation  from  the  young  star.  Models for these
          objects  are  presented,  including photo-evaporating disks and
          ionized  accretion  flows  that  are  gravitationally  trapped.
          Evolutionary  scenarios  tracing  young  massive  stars passage
          through these ionized phases are discussed.

          Light  curves  of  the  long-period  Algols are known for their
          complex  shape  (asymmetry  in  the  eclipse,  light variations
          outside   eclipse,  changes  from  cycle-to-cycle),  and  their
          interpretation  is not possible in the standard model of binary
          stars. Complex structures present in these active Algol systems
          could  be  studied  with  the  eclipse-mapping method which was
          successfully   applied   to   the   new   7-color   photometric
          observations  in  the  Geneva system of W Cru, belonging to the
          isolated  group  of these active Algols. Several cycles of this
          long-period  (198.5 days) eclipsing binary have been covered by
          observations.  We have used a modified Rutten's approach to the
          eclipse-mapping.  The  optimization  of the system's parameters
          and  the  recovery  of  the  disk  intensity  distribution  are
          performed  using  a  genetic algorithm (GA). It is found that a
          hot  component  is  hidden  in  the  thick accretion disk which
          confirms previous findings. The mass of the component, M1 = 8.2
          Ms  indicates  that  it  is  a mid-B type star. The mass-losing
          component  is  filling  its  critical  lobe which means it is a
          G-type  supergiant  with  a  mass  M2  =  1.6  Ms.  The disk is
          geometrically  very  extended and its outer radius is about 80%
          of the primary's critical lobe. A reconstructed image reveals a
          rather  clumpy  and  nonuniform  brightness  distribution of an
          accretion  disk  rim  in  this almost edge-on seen system. This
          clumpyness   accounts   for   light   curve   distortions   and
          asymmetries, as well as for secular changes.

          A  precise  derivation  of the evolution of the Tully Fisher is
          crucial  to  understand  the  interplay between dark matter and
          baryonic  matter  in  cosmological  models, Using 15 deployable
          integral   field  units  of  FLAMES/GIRAFFE  at  VLT,  we  have
          recovered  the  velocity  fields of 35 galaxies at intermediate
          redshift (0.4 < z < 0.75). This facility is able to recover the
          velocity  fields  of almost all the emission line galaxies with
          Iab  <=22.5  and  W_0(OII)>=15A In our sample, we find only 35%
          rotating  disks.  These  rotating  disks produce a Tully-Fisher
          relationship  (stellar  mass  or  M_K  versus  V_max) which has
          apparently  not  evolved in slope, zero point and scatter since
          z=0.6.  The only evolution found is a brightening of the B band
          luminosity  of  a  third  of  the  disks,  possibly  due  to an
          enhancement  of  the  star  formation.  The very large scatters
          found  in  previously  reported  Tully-Fisher  relationships at
          moderate  redshifts  are  caused by the numerous (65%) galaxies
          with  perturbed  or  complex kinematics. Those galaxies include
          minor  or major mergers, merger remnants and/or inflow/outflows
          and  their  kinematics  can  be  easily  misidentified  by slit
          spectroscopy. Their presence suggests a strong evolution in the
          dynamical properties of galaxies during the last 7 Gyrs.

          We   used   the   moderately   high   spectral   resolution  of
          FLAMES/GIRAFFE  (R=10000)  to  derive  electron  densities from
          [OII]  line  ratios in 6 galaxies at z~0.55. These measurements
          have  been  done  through  the  GIRAFFE multiple integral field
          units  and  are the very first mapping of electron densities in
          such  distant objects. This allows us to confirm an outflow and
          identify  the role of giant HII regions in galactic disks. Such
          measurements  could  be  used  in the future to investigate the
          nature  of the physical processes responsible for the high star
          formations rates observed in galaxies between z~0.4 and z~1.

          Title:  Consistency  between  deep  crustal  heating of strange
          stars in superbursters and soft X-ray transients
          Authors: Morten Stejner, Jes Madsen (University of Aarhus)
          Comments: Submitted to A&A
          Both  superbursters and soft X-ray transients probe the process
          of deep crustal heating in compact stars. It was recently shown
          that  the  transfer  of  matter from crust to core in a strange
          star can heat the crust and ignite superbursts provided certain
          constraints  on  the strange quark matter equation of state are
          fulfilled.  We derive corresponding constraints on the equation
          of  state  for  soft  X-ray transients assuming their quiescent
          emission  is  powered  in the same way, and further discuss the
          time dependence of this heating mechanism in transient systems.
          We  approach  this  using  a simple parametrized model for deep
          crustal heating in strange stars assuming slow neutrino cooling
          in  the core and blackbody photon emission from the surface.The
          constraints  derived  for  hot  frequently accreting soft X-ray
          transients  are always consistent with those for superbursters.
          The  colder  sources are consistent for low values of the quark
          matter   binding   energy,   heat   conductivity  and  neutrino
          emissivity.  The heating mechanism is very time dependent which
          may  help  to  explain cold sources with long recurrence times.
          Thus  deep  crustal  heating  in  strange  stars  can provide a
          consistent   explanation   for  superbursters  and  soft  X-ray
          transients.

          Aims.  The  aim  of this work is to identify and study spectral
          features in the quasar 3C 273 usually blended by its strong jet
          emission.  Method.  A  historic  minimum  in the sub-millimetre
          emission  of  3C  273  triggered  coordinated  multi-wavelength
          observations   in   June  2004.  X-ray  observations  from  the
          INTEGRAL,  XMM-Newton  and  RXTE satellites are complemented by
          ground-based    optical,   infrared,   millimetre   and   radio
          observations.  The  overall  spectrum  is  used  to  model  the
          infrared  and X-ray spectral components. Results. Three thermal
          dust  emission  components  are identified in the infrared. The
          dust  emission on scales from 1 pc to several kpc is comparable
          to  that  of  other  quasars,  as  expected  by AGN unification
          schemes.  The  observed weakness of the X-ray emission supports
          the hypothesis of a synchrotron self-Compton origin for the jet
          component.  There  is  a clear soft-excess and we find evidence
          for  a  very  broad  iron line which could be emitted in a disk
          around  a  Kerr  black hole. Other signatures of a Seyfert-like
          X-ray component are not detected.

          March 2006
          We  have carried out a detailed abundance analysis for a sample
          of  16  carbon stars found among candidate extremely metal-poor
          (EMP)  stars  from  the  Hamburg/ESO  Survey.  We find that the
          Fe-metallicities  for  the  cooler  C-stars (Teff ~ 5100K) have
          been  underestimated  by  a  factor  of ~10 by the standard HES
          survey  tools.  The  results  presented  here  provided crucial
          supporting  data  used  by  Cohen  et  al  (2006) to derive the
          frequency of C-stars among EMP stars.
          C-enhancement in these EMP C-stars appears to be independent of
          Fe-metallicity  and  approximately  constant  at ~1/5 the solar
          C/H.  The  mostly  low  C12/C13  ratios  (~4)  and  the  high N
          abundances  in  many of these stars suggest that material which
          has been through proton burning via the CN cycle comprises most
          of  the  stellar  envelope.  C-enhancement  is  associated with
          strong  enrichment of heavy nuclei beyond the Fe-peak for 12 of
          the 16 stars. The remaining C-stars from the HES, which tend to
          be  the most Fe-metal poor, show no evidence for enhancement of
          the heavy elements. Very high enhancements of lead are detected
          in  some of the C-stars with highly enhanced Ba. (We show that)
          the  s-process  is responsible for the enhancement of the heavy
          elements for the majority of the C-stars in our sample.
          We  suggest  that both the s-process rich and Ba-normal C-stars
          result  from  phenomena associated with mass transfer in binary
          systems. This leads directly to the progression from C-stars to
          CH  stars and then to Ba stars as the Fe-metallicity increases.

          Title: Starbursts near supermassive black holes: young stars in
          the Galactic Center, and gravitational waves in LISA band
          Authors: Yuri Levin (Leiden Observatory and Lorentz Institute)
          Comments:  11  pages.  Submitted  to  MNRAS  in  December, this
          version addresses referee's remarks
          We  propose  a  scenario  in  which  massive  stars  form  in a
          self-gravitating gaseous disc around a supermassive black hole.
          We  find  that  once  the surface density of the disc exceeds a
          critical  value,  the  disc  fragments  into  dense clumps. The
          clumps  accrete material from the remaining disc and merge into
          larger  clumps;  the upper mass of a merged clump is a few tens
          to  a  few  hundreds of solar mass. This picture fits well with
          the  observed  young stellar discs near the SgrA* black hole in
          the  Galactic Center. In particular, we show how the masses and
          spatial  distribution of the young stars, and the total mass in
          the Galactic Center discs can be explained. However, explaining
          the origin of the several young stars closest to the black hole
          (the  S-stars)  is  more problematic: their orbits are compact,
          eccentric,  and  have  random  orientation. We propose that the
          S-stars were born in a previous starburst(s), and then migrated
          through  their  parent  disc  via  type I or runaway migration.
          Their   orbits  were  then  randomized  by  the  Rauch-Tremaine
          resonant  relaxation.  We  then explore the consequences of the
          star-formation  scenario  for AGN discs, which are continuously
          resupplied  with  gas.  We  argue  that  some  compact remnants
          generated  by  the starburst will get embedded in the disc. The
          disc-born    stellar-mass    black    holes    will    interact
          gravitationally  with the massive accretion disc and be dragged
          towards  the  central  black  hole. Merger of a disc-born black
          hole  with  the  central  black  hole  will  produce a burst of
          gravitational  waves. If the central black hole is accreting at
          a rate comparable to the Eddington limit, the gas drag from the
          accretion disc will not alter significantly the dynamics of the
          final  year  of  merger,  and the gravitational waves should be
          observable by LISA.

          We  present  analysis  of  the  near-infrared  spectra  of  114
          rest-frame   UV-selected   star-forming  galaxies  at  z~2.  By
          combining  the  H-alpha  spectra  with photometric measurements
          from  observed  0.3--8  micron,  we  assess  the  relationships
          between  kinematics,  dynamical masses, inferred gas fractions,
          and  stellar  masses  and  ages. The H-alpha line widths give a
          mean  dynamical  mass  M_dyn=6.9  +/- 0.6 x 10^10 Msun within a
          typical  radius  of  ~6  kpc,  after excluding AGN. The average
          dynamical  mass  is  ~2  times  larger than the average stellar
          mass,  and the two agree to within a factor of several for most
          objects. However, ~15% of the sample has M_dyn >> M_star. These
          objects  are  best fit by young stellar populations and tend to
          have  high  H-alpha equivalent widths, suggesting that they are
          young  starbursts  with  large  gas  masses. Rest-frame optical
          luminosity  and velocity dispersion are correlated with 4 sigma
          significance.  Using  the  local  empirical correlation between
          star  formation  rate per unit area and gas surface density, we
          estimate  the  mass  of the gas associated with star formation,
          and  find  a mean gas fraction of ~50% and a strong decrease in
          gas  fraction  with  increasing stellar mass. The masses of gas
          and  stars combined are considerably better correlated with the
          dynamical  masses  than are the stellar masses alone, and agree
          to  within  a  factor  of  three  for  85%  of  the sample. The
          combination of kinematic measurements, estimates of gas masses,
          and  stellar  population  properties suggest that the factor of
          ~500  range  in  stellar mass across the sample cannot be fully
          explained  by  intrinsic differences in the total masses of the
          galaxies,  which  vary  by  a  factor  of  ~40;  the  remaining
          variation is due to the evolution of the stellar population and
          the conversion of gas into stars. [Abridged]

          We  report on the discovery of a supermassive binary black hole
          system   in   the  radio  galaxy  0402+379,  with  a  projected
          separation  between the two black holes of just 7.3 pc. This is
          the  closest  black hole pair yet found by more than two orders
          of   magnitude.   These   results   are   based   upon   recent
          multi-frequency observations using the Very Long Baseline Array
          (VLBA)  which  reveal  two  compact,  variable,  flat-spectrum,
          active  nuclei  within  the elliptical host galaxy of 0402+379.
          Multi-epoch observations from the VLBA also provide constraints
          on  the  total  mass  and  dynamics of the system. Low spectral
          resolution   spectroscopy   using  the  Hobby-Eberly  Telescope
          indicates  two velocity systems with a combined mass of the two
          black  holes of ~1.5 x 10^8 solar masses. The two nuclei appear
          stationary  while the jets emanating from the weaker of the two
          nuclei  appear  to  move out and terminate in bright hot spots.
          The discovery of this system has implications for the number of
          close binary black holes that might be sources of gravitational
          radiation.  Green  Bank  Telescope  observations  at  22 GHz to
          search  for  water  masers  in this interesting system are also
          presented.

          Comments:   12   pages,   1  table,  2  figures,  accepted  for
          publication in ApJ Letters
          We   analyse   archival  Rossi  X-Ray  Timing  Explorer  (RXTE)
          proportional  counter  array  (PCA) data of thermonuclear X-ray
          bursts  from  the  2002  outburst  of the accreting millisecond
          pulsar  SAX  J1808.4-3658.  We present evidence of nonmonotonic
          variations  of  oscillation  frequency  during  burst rise, and
          correlations  among  the  time  evolution  of  the  oscillation
          frequency,  amplitude, and the inferred burning region area. We
          also  discuss  that  the  amplitude  and  burning  region  area
          evolutions are consistent with thermonuclear flame spreading on
          the  neutron  star  surface. Based on this discussion, we infer
          that  for  the  2002  Oct. 15 thermonuclear burst, the ignition
          likely  occured in the mid-latitudes, the burning region took ~
          0.2  s  to nearly encircle the equatorial region of the neutron
          star, and after that the lower amplitude oscillation originated
          from  the  remaining asymmetry of the burning front in the same
          hemisphere  where the burst ignited. Our observational findings
          and   theoretical  discussion  indicate  that  studies  of  the
          evolution of burst oscillation properties during burst rise can
          provide  a  powerful  tool  to  understand  thermonuclear flame
          spreading  on  neutron  star  surfaces  under  extreme physical
          conditions.

          Journal
          We  present  an  optical,  X-ray,  and  radio  analysis  of the
          starburst  in  the  Abell 1835 cluster's central cD galaxy. The
          dense  gas  surrounding  the  galaxy is radiating X-rays with a
          luminosity  of  ~1E45  erg/s  consistent with a cooling rate of
          ~1000-2000  solar  masses  per  year.  However, new Chandra and
          XMM-Newton  observations  find  less  than 200 solar masses per
          year  of  gas  cooling below ~2 keV, a level that is consistent
          with  the  cD's  current  star  formation rate of 100-180 solar
          masses  per  year.  One  or more heating agents (feedback) must
          then  be  replenishing the remaining radiative losses. The heat
          fluxes  from  supernova explosions and thermal conduction alone
          are  unable to do so. However, a pair of X-ray cavities from an
          AGN outburst has deposited ~1.7E60 erg into the surrounding gas
          over  the  past  40  Myr.  The  corresponding  jet power 1.4E45
          erg/sec  is  enough to offset most of the radiative losses from
          the  cooling  gas.  The jet power exceeds the radio synchrotron
          power  by  ~4000 times, making this one of the most radiatively
          inefficient  radio  sources  known. The large jet power implies
          that  the  cD's supermassive black hole accreted at a mean rate
          of
          ~0.3 solar masses per year over the last 40 Myr or so, which is
          a  small  fraction  of  the Eddington accretion rate for a 10E9
          solar  mass  black  hole.  The  ratio  of the bulge growth rate
          through  star  formation and the black hole growth rate through
          accretion  is  consistent  with  the  slope  of the (Magorrian)
          relationship  between  bulge  and  central  black  hole mass in
          nearby quiescent galaxies. The consistency between net cooling,
          heating  (feedback),  and  the cooling sink (star formation) in
          this  system  resolves  the  primary  objection  to traditional
          cooling flow models. (abridged)

          Title:  Detection  of  Highly Ionized Metal Absorption Lines in
          the Ultracompact X-ray Dipper 4U 1916-05
          Authors: Adrienne M. Juett (Virginia), Deepto Chakrabarty (MIT)
          Comments:  7  pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We   present  the  high-resolution  Chandra  X-ray  Observatory
          persistent  (non-dip)  spectrum  of  4U  1916-05 which revealed
          narrow   absorption  lines  from  hydrogenic  neon,  magnesium,
          silicon,  and  sulfur,  in  addition to the previous identified
          hydrogenic and helium-like iron absorption lines. This makes 4U
          1916-05  only  the second of the classical X-ray dipper systems
          to  show narrow absorption lines from elements other than iron.
          We  propose  two  possible  explanations for the small measured
          line  widths  (>~ 500-2000 km s^{-1}), compared to the expected
          Keplerian  velocities  (> 1000 km s^{-1}) of the accretion disk
          in  this  50-min  orbital period system, and lack of wavelength
          shifts  (>~  250 km s^{-1}). First, the ionized absorber may be
          stationary.  Alternatively, the line properties may measure the
          relative  size of the emission region. From this hypothesis, we
          find  that  the  emission  region  is constrained to be >~ 0.25
          times the radial extent of the absorber. Our results also imply
          that   the   ionized  absorber  spans  a  range  of  ionization
          parameters.

          Title: Hydrogen in Type Ic Supernovae?
          Authors:  David  Branch, David J. Jeffery, Timothy R. Young, E.
          Baron
          Comments: Submitted to PASP, comments welcome
          By  definition,  a  Type  Ic  supernova  (SN  Ic) does not have
          conspicuous   lines  of  hydrogen  or  helium  in  its  optical
          spectrum.   SNe  Ic  usually  are  modelled  in  terms  of  the
          gravitational collapse of bare carbon-oxygen cores. We consider
          the  possibility  that  the spectra of ordinary (SN 1994I-like)
          SNe  Ic  have  been  misinterpreted,  and  that  SNe  Ic  eject
          hydrogen.  An  absorption feature usually attributed to a blend
          of  Si  II 6355 and C II 6580 may be produced by H-alpha. If SN
          1994I-like   SNe   Ic  eject  hydrogen,  the  possibility  that
          hypernova (SN 1998bw-like) SNe Ic, some of which are associated
          with   gamma-ray   bursts,   also   eject  hydrogen  should  be
          considered.  The implications of hydrogen for SN Ic progenitors
          and explosion models are briefly discussed.

          The Survey for Transiting Extrasolar Planets in Stellar Systems
          (STEPSS)  project  is  a  search for planetary transits in open
          clusters.  In this paper, we analyze the STEPSS observations of
          the  open  cluster  NGC  1245  to  determine  the variable star
          content of the cluster. Out of 6787 stars observed with V < 22,
          of  which ~870 are cluster members, we find 14 stars with clear
          intrinsic  variability  that are potential cluster members, and
          29  clear variables that are not cluster members. None of these
          variables  have  been  previously  identified. We present light
          curves,  finding  charts, and stellar/photometric data on these
          variable  objects.  Several  of  the  interacting binaries have
          estimated   distances  consistent  with  the  cluster  distance
          determined  from isochrone fits to the color magnitude diagram.
          Four  stars  at  the  main sequence turnoff of the cluster have
          light  curves  consistent  with  gamma  Doradus variability. If
          these  gamma  Doradus  candidates are confirmed, they represent
          the  oldest  and  coolest  members  of  this  class of variable
          discovered to date.

          Authors:  Jonathan  Ferreira (LAOG), Catherine Dougados (LAOG),
          Sylvie Cabrit (LERMA)
          Comments: 14 pages, accepted by A&A
          AIMS:  We  examine  whether ejection phenomena from accreting T
          Tauri   stars   can   be   described   by   only  one  type  of
          self-collimated  jet  model.  METHODS:  We  present  analytical
          kinematic predictions valid soon after the Alfv\'en surface for
          all  types  of steady magnetically self-confined jets. RESULTS:
          We  show  that  extended disc winds, X-winds, and stellar winds
          occupy  distinct  regions  in  the  poloidal speed vs. specific
          angular  momentum  plane. Comparisons with current observations
          of  T Tauri jets yield quantitative constraints on the range of
          launching radii, magnetic lever arms, and specific energy input
          in  disc  and  stellar winds. Implications on the origin of jet
          asymmetries and disc magnetic fields are outlined. CONCLUSIONS:
          We  argue  that ejection phenomena from accreting T Tauri stars
          most  likely  include  three dynamical components: (1) an outer
          self-collimated steady disc wind carrying most of the mass-flux
          in   the   optical   jet   (when   present),  confining  (2)  a
          pressure-driven  coronal  stellar wind and (3) a hot inner flow
          made  of  blobs  sporadically ejected from the magnetopause. If
          the  stellar  magnetic  moment is parallel to the disc magnetic
          field,   then  the  highly  variable  inner  flow  resembles  a
          "Reconnection  X-wind",  that  has  been  proven to efficiently
          brake  down  an  accreting  and  contracting young star. If the
          magnetic  moment  is anti-parallel, then larger versions of the
          solar  coronal mass ejections are likely to occur. The relative
          importance  of  these three components in the observed outflows
          and  the  range of radii involved in the disc wind are expected
          to  vary  with  time,  from the stage of embedded source to the
          optically revealed T Tauri star phase.

          We  imaged  the  Lynds  723  dark nebula (L723) with the aim of
          studying  the  morphology  of the Herbig-Haro object HH 223 and
          other  line-emission nebula detected in the region. We obtained
          deep  narrow-band  images  in the Halpha and [SII] lines and in
          the  continuum nearby Halpha of a field of ~5' of the L723 dark
          nebula  centered  on HH 223. The Halpha and [SII] images reveal
          the  detailed  morphology  of  HH  223,  unresolved in previous
          optical  images.  Both  images  show  a  quite  complex knotty,
          wiggling   structure   embedded   in   a  low-emission  nebula.
          Comparison between the [SII] and Halpha fluxes of the knots are
          indicative  of  variations in the excitation conditions through
          HH 223. In addition, several other faint nebula are detected in
          Halpha  a  few arcmin to the SE and to the NW of HH 223, all of
          them  lying  projected  onto the east-west pair of lobes of the
          quadrupolar  CO  outflow. Comparison between the Halpha and the
          continuum images confirms the HH-like nature of the Vrba object
          V83, while the Vrba objects V84 and V85 are identified as faint
          field stars.

          Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures, Astrophysical Journal, in press
          Large  galaxies  are  thought  to form hierarchically, from the
          accretion  and  disruption  of  many  smaller  galaxies. Such a
          scenario   should   naturally   lead  to  galactic  phase-space
          distributions   containing  some  degree  of  substructure.  We
          examine the errors in mass estimates of galaxies and their dark
          halos  made  using  the projected phase-space distribution of a
          tracer  population  (such  as  a  globular  cluster  system  or
          planetary nebulae) due to falsely assuming that the tracers are
          distributed randomly. The level of this uncertainty is assessed
          by  applying a standard mass estimator to samples drawn from 11
          random  realizations  of  galaxy  halos  containing  levels  of
          substructure   consistent  with  current  models  of  structure
          formation.  We  find  that  substructure  will distort our mass
          estimates  by  up  to  ~20%  -  a  negligible error compared to
          statistical  and  measurement  errors in current derivations of
          masses for our own and other galaxies. However, this represents
          a  fundamental  limit  to  the  accuracy  of  any  future  mass
          estimates  made under the assumption that the tracer population
          is  distributed  randomly, regardless of the size of the sample
          or the accuracy of the measurements.

          We  present  analysis  of  the  near-infrared  spectra  of  114
          rest-frame   UV-selected   star-forming  galaxies  at  z~2.  By
          combining  the  H-alpha  spectra  with photometric measurements
          from  observed  0.3--8  micron,  we  assess  the  relationships
          between  kinematics,  dynamical masses, inferred gas fractions,
          and  stellar  masses  and  ages. The H-alpha line widths give a
          mean  dynamical  mass  M_dyn=6.9  +/- 0.6 x 10^10 Msun within a
          typical  radius  of  ~6  kpc,  after excluding AGN. The average
          dynamical  mass  is  ~2  times  larger than the average stellar
          mass,  and the two agree to within a factor of several for most
          objects. However, ~15% of the sample has M_dyn >> M_star. These
          objects  are  best fit by young stellar populations and tend to
          have  high  H-alpha equivalent widths, suggesting that they are
          young  starbursts  with  large  gas  masses. Rest-frame optical
          luminosity  and velocity dispersion are correlated with 4 sigma
          significance.  Using  the  local  empirical correlation between
          star  formation  rate per unit area and gas surface density, we
          estimate  the  mass  of the gas associated with star formation,
          and  find  a mean gas fraction of ~50% and a strong decrease in
          gas  fraction  with  increasing stellar mass. The masses of gas
          and  stars combined are considerably better correlated with the
          dynamical  masses  than are the stellar masses alone, and agree
          to  within  a  factor  of  three  for  85%  of  the sample. The
          combination of kinematic measurements, estimates of gas masses,
          and  stellar  population  properties suggest that the factor of
          ~500  range  in  stellar mass across the sample cannot be fully
          explained  by  intrinsic differences in the total masses of the
          galaxies,  which  vary  by  a  factor  of  ~40;  the  remaining
          variation is due to the evolution of the stellar population and
          the conversion of gas into stars. [Abridged]

          We  report on the discovery of a supermassive binary black hole
          system   in   the  radio  galaxy  0402+379,  with  a  projected
          separation  between the two black holes of just 7.3 pc. This is
          the  closest  black hole pair yet found by more than two orders
          of   magnitude.   These   results   are   based   upon   recent
          multi-frequency observations using the Very Long Baseline Array
          (VLBA)  which  reveal  two  compact,  variable,  flat-spectrum,
          active  nuclei  within  the elliptical host galaxy of 0402+379.
          Multi-epoch observations from the VLBA also provide constraints
          on  the  total  mass  and  dynamics of the system. Low spectral
          resolution   spectroscopy   using  the  Hobby-Eberly  Telescope
          indicates  two velocity systems with a combined mass of the two
          black  holes of ~1.5 x 10^8 solar masses. The two nuclei appear
          stationary  while the jets emanating from the weaker of the two
          nuclei  appear  to  move out and terminate in bright hot spots.
          The discovery of this system has implications for the number of
          close binary black holes that might be sources of gravitational
          radiation.  Green  Bank  Telescope  observations  at  22 GHz to
          search  for  water  masers  in this interesting system are also
          presented.

          Title: Spreading of thermonuclear flames on the neutron star in
          SAX J1808.4-3658: an observational tool
          Authors: Sudip Bhattacharyya, Tod E. Strohmayer
          Comments:   12   pages,   1  table,  2  figures,  accepted  for
          publication in ApJ Letters
          We   analyse   archival  Rossi  X-Ray  Timing  Explorer  (RXTE)
          proportional  counter  array  (PCA) data of thermonuclear X-ray
          bursts  from  the  2002  outburst  of the accreting millisecond
          pulsar  SAX  J1808.4-3658.  We present evidence of nonmonotonic
          variations  of  oscillation  frequency  during  burst rise, and
          correlations  among  the  time  evolution  of  the  oscillation
          frequency,  amplitude, and the inferred burning region area. We
          also  discuss  that  the  amplitude  and  burning  region  area
          evolutions are consistent with thermonuclear flame spreading on
          the  neutron  star  surface. Based on this discussion, we infer
          that  for  the  2002  Oct. 15 thermonuclear burst, the ignition
          likely  occured in the mid-latitudes, the burning region took ~
          0.2  s  to nearly encircle the equatorial region of the neutron
          star, and after that the lower amplitude oscillation originated
          from  the  remaining asymmetry of the burning front in the same
          hemisphere  where the burst ignited. Our observational findings
          and   theoretical  discussion  indicate  that  studies  of  the
          evolution of burst oscillation properties during burst rise can
          provide  a  powerful  tool  to  understand  thermonuclear flame
          spreading  on  neutron  star  surfaces  under  extreme physical
          conditions.

          A  Case Study of Galaxy Formation Regulated by an Outburst from

          Journal
          We  present  an  optical,  X-ray,  and  radio  analysis  of the
          starburst  in  the  Abell 1835 cluster's central cD galaxy. The
          dense  gas  surrounding  the  galaxy is radiating X-rays with a
          luminosity  of  ~1E45  erg/s  consistent with a cooling rate of
          ~1000-2000  solar  masses  per  year.  However, new Chandra and
          XMM-Newton  observations  find  less  than 200 solar masses per
          year  of  gas  cooling below ~2 keV, a level that is consistent
          with  the  cD's  current  star  formation rate of 100-180 solar
          masses  per  year.  One  or more heating agents (feedback) must
          then  be  replenishing the remaining radiative losses. The heat
          fluxes  from  supernova explosions and thermal conduction alone
          are  unable to do so. However, a pair of X-ray cavities from an
          AGN outburst has deposited ~1.7E60 erg into the surrounding gas
          over  the  past  40  Myr.  The  corresponding  jet power 1.4E45
          erg/sec  is  enough to offset most of the radiative losses from
          the  cooling  gas.  The jet power exceeds the radio synchrotron
          power  by  ~4000 times, making this one of the most radiatively
          inefficient  radio  sources  known. The large jet power implies
          that  the  cD's supermassive black hole accreted at a mean rate
          of
          ~0.3 solar masses per year over the last 40 Myr or so, which is
          a  small  fraction  of  the Eddington accretion rate for a 10E9
          solar  mass  black  hole.  The  ratio  of the bulge growth rate
          through  star  formation and the black hole growth rate through
          accretion  is  consistent  with  the  slope  of the (Magorrian)
          relationship  between  bulge  and  central  black  hole mass in
          nearby quiescent galaxies. The consistency between net cooling,
          heating  (feedback),  and  the cooling sink (star formation) in
          this  system  resolves  the  primary  objection  to traditional
          cooling flow models. (abridged)

          Title:  Detection  of  Highly Ionized Metal Absorption Lines in
          the Ultracompact X-ray Dipper 4U 1916-05
          Authors: Adrienne M. Juett (Virginia), Deepto Chakrabarty (MIT)
          Comments:  7  pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in the
          Astrophysical Journal
          We   present  the  high-resolution  Chandra  X-ray  Observatory
          persistent  (non-dip)  spectrum  of  4U  1916-05 which revealed
          narrow   absorption  lines  from  hydrogenic  neon,  magnesium,
          silicon,  and  sulfur,  in  addition to the previous identified
          hydrogenic and helium-like iron absorption lines. This makes 4U
          1916-05  only  the second of the classical X-ray dipper systems
          to  show narrow absorption lines from elements other than iron.
          We  propose  two  possible  explanations for the small measured
          line  widths  (>~ 500-2000 km s^{-1}), compared to the expected
          Keplerian  velocities  (> 1000 km s^{-1}) of the accretion disk
          in  this  50-min  orbital period system, and lack of wavelength
          shifts  (>~  250 km s^{-1}). First, the ionized absorber may be
          stationary.  Alternatively, the line properties may measure the
          relative  size of the emission region. From this hypothesis, we
          find  that  the  emission  region  is constrained to be >~ 0.25
          times the radial extent of the absorber. Our results also imply
          that   the   ionized  absorber  spans  a  range  of  ionization
          parameters.

          Title: Hydrogen in Type Ic Supernovae?
          Authors:  David  Branch, David J. Jeffery, Timothy R. Young, E.
          Baron
          Comments: Submitted to PASP, comments welcome
          By  definition,  a  Type  Ic  supernova  (SN  Ic) does not have
          conspicuous   lines  of  hydrogen  or  helium  in  its  optical
          spectrum.   SNe  Ic  usually  are  modelled  in  terms  of  the
          gravitational collapse of bare carbon-oxygen cores. We consider
          the  possibility  that  the spectra of ordinary (SN 1994I-like)
          SNe  Ic  have  been  misinterpreted,  and  that  SNe  Ic  eject
          hydrogen.  An  absorption feature usually attributed to a blend
          of  Si  II 6355 and C II 6580 may be produced by H-alpha. If SN
          1994I-like   SNe   Ic  eject  hydrogen,  the  possibility  that
          hypernova (SN 1998bw-like) SNe Ic, some of which are associated
          with   gamma-ray   bursts,   also   eject  hydrogen  should  be
          considered.  The implications of hydrogen for SN Ic progenitors
          and explosion models are briefly discussed.

          The Survey for Transiting Extrasolar Planets in Stellar Systems
          (STEPSS)  project  is  a  search for planetary transits in open
          clusters.  In this paper, we analyze the STEPSS observations of
          the  open  cluster  NGC  1245  to  determine  the variable star
          content of the cluster. Out of 6787 stars observed with V < 22,
          of  which ~870 are cluster members, we find 14 stars with clear
          intrinsic  variability  that are potential cluster members, and
          29  clear variables that are not cluster members. None of these
          variables  have  been  previously  identified. We present light
          curves,  finding  charts, and stellar/photometric data on these
          variable  objects.  Several  of  the  interacting binaries have
          estimated   distances  consistent  with  the  cluster  distance
          determined  from isochrone fits to the color magnitude diagram.
          Four  stars  at  the  main sequence turnoff of the cluster have
          light  curves  consistent  with  gamma  Doradus variability. If
          these  gamma  Doradus  candidates are confirmed, they represent
          the  oldest  and  coolest  members  of  this  class of variable
          discovered to date.

          Title: Which jet launching mechanism(s) in TTauri stars?
          Authors:  Jonathan  Ferreira (LAOG), Catherine Dougados (LAOG),
          Sylvie Cabrit (LERMA)
          Comments: 14 pages, accepted by A&A
          AIMS:  We  examine  whether ejection phenomena from accreting T
          Tauri   stars   can   be   described   by   only  one  type  of
          self-collimated  jet  model.  METHODS:  We  present  analytical
          kinematic predictions valid soon after the Alfv\'en surface for
          all  types  of steady magnetically self-confined jets. RESULTS:
          We  show  that  extended disc winds, X-winds, and stellar winds
          occupy  distinct  regions  in  the  poloidal speed vs. specific
          angular  momentum  plane. Comparisons with current observations
          of  T Tauri jets yield quantitative constraints on the range of
          launching radii, magnetic lever arms, and specific energy input
          in  disc  and  stellar winds. Implications on the origin of jet
          asymmetries and disc magnetic fields are outlined. CONCLUSIONS:
          We  argue  that ejection phenomena from accreting T Tauri stars
          most  likely  include  three dynamical components: (1) an outer
          self-collimated steady disc wind carrying most of the mass-flux
          in   the   optical   jet   (when   present),  confining  (2)  a
          pressure-driven  coronal  stellar wind and (3) a hot inner flow
          made  of  blobs  sporadically ejected from the magnetopause. If
          the  stellar  magnetic  moment is parallel to the disc magnetic
          field,   then  the  highly  variable  inner  flow  resembles  a
          "Reconnection  X-wind",  that  has  been  proven to efficiently
          brake  down  an  accreting  and  contracting young star. If the
          magnetic  moment  is anti-parallel, then larger versions of the
          solar  coronal mass ejections are likely to occur. The relative
          importance  of  these three components in the observed outflows
          and  the  range of radii involved in the disc wind are expected
          to  vary  with  time,  from the stage of embedded source to the
          optically revealed T Tauri star phase.

          We  imaged  the  Lynds  723  dark nebula (L723) with the aim of
          studying  the  morphology  of the Herbig-Haro object HH 223 and
          other  line-emission nebula detected in the region. We obtained
          deep  narrow-band  images  in the Halpha and [SII] lines and in
          the  continuum nearby Halpha of a field of ~5' of the L723 dark
          nebula  centered  on HH 223. The Halpha and [SII] images reveal
          the  detailed  morphology  of  HH  223,  unresolved in previous
          optical  images.  Both  images  show  a  quite  complex knotty,
          wiggling   structure   embedded   in   a  low-emission  nebula.
          Comparison between the [SII] and Halpha fluxes of the knots are
          indicative  of  variations in the excitation conditions through
          HH 223. In addition, several other faint nebula are detected in
          Halpha  a  few arcmin to the SE and to the NW of HH 223, all of
          them  lying  projected  onto the east-west pair of lobes of the
          quadrupolar  CO  outflow. Comparison between the Halpha and the
          continuum images confirms the HH-like nature of the Vrba object
          V83, while the Vrba objects V84 and V85 are identified as faint
          field stars.

          Authors:  Brian  M.  Yencho,  Kathryn  V.  Johnston,  James  S.

          Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures, Astrophysical Journal, in press
          Large  galaxies  are  thought  to form hierarchically, from the
          accretion  and  disruption  of  many  smaller  galaxies. Such a
          scenario   should   naturally   lead  to  galactic  phase-space
          distributions   containing  some  degree  of  substructure.  We
          examine the errors in mass estimates of galaxies and their dark
          halos  made  using  the projected phase-space distribution of a
          tracer  population  (such  as  a  globular  cluster  system  or
          planetary nebulae) due to falsely assuming that the tracers are
          distributed randomly. The level of this uncertainty is assessed
          by  applying a standard mass estimator to samples drawn from 11
          random  realizations  of  galaxy  halos  containing  levels  of
          substructure   consistent  with  current  models  of  structure
          formation.  We  find  that  substructure  will distort our mass
          estimates  by  up  to  ~20%  -  a  negligible error compared to
          statistical  and  measurement  errors in current derivations of
          masses for our own and other galaxies. However, this represents
          a  fundamental  limit  to  the  accuracy  of  any  future  mass
          estimates  made under the assumption that the tracer population
          is  distributed  randomly, regardless of the size of the sample
          or the accuracy of the measurements.

          Using H-alpha spectra of 114 rest-frame UV-selected galaxies at
          z~2, we compare inferred star formation rates (SFRs) with those
          determined  from  the UV continuum luminosity. After correcting
          for  extinction  using  standard  techniques  based  on  the UV
          continuum  slope,  we  find  excellent  agreement  between  the
          indicators,  with  <SFR_Ha>  =  31  Msun/yr  and  <SFR_UV> = 29
          Msun/yr. The agreement between the indicators suggests that the
          UV  luminosity is attenuated by an typical factor of ~4.5 (with
          a  range  from  no attenuation to a factor of ~100 for the most
          obscured   object  in  the  sample),  in  good  agreement  with
          estimates of obscuration from X-ray, radio and mid-IR data. The
          H-alpha  luminosity  is  attenuated  by  a  factor  of  ~1.7 on
          average, and the maximum H-alpha attenuation is a factor of ~5.
          In  agreement  with  X-ray and mid-IR studies, we find that the
          SFR  increases  with  increasing stellar mass and at brighter K
          magnitudes,  to  <SFR_Ha>  ~ 60 Msun/yr for galaxies with K<20;
          the  correlation  between  K magnitude and SFR is much stronger
          than the correlation between stellar mass and SFR. All galaxies
          in  the  sample  have SFRs per unit area Sigma_SFR in the range
          observed in local starbursts. We compare the instantaneous SFRs
          and the past average SFRs as inferred from the ages and stellar
          masses, finding that for most of the sample, the current SFR is
          an  adequate  representation of the past average. There is some
          evidence  that  the  most massive galaxies (M_star >10^11 Msun)
          have had higher SFRs in the past.

          Over the last decade, long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and
          X-ray flashes (XRFs) have been revealed to be a rare variety of
          Type Ibc supernova (SN). While all these events result from the
          death  of  massive  stars,  the electromagnetic luminosities of
          GRBs  and  XRFs  exceed  those of ordinary Type Ibc SNe by many
          orders of magnitude. The essential physical process that causes
          a  dying  star  to  produce  a  GRB or XRF, and not just an SN,
          remains  the  crucial  open question. Here we present radio and
          X-ray  observations  of XRF 060218 (associated with SN 2006aj),
          the  second  nearest  GRB identified to-date, which allow us to
          measure  its total energy and place it in the larger context of
          cosmic  explosions.  We  show that this event is 100 times less
          energetic  but  ten  times  more common than cosmological GRBs.
          Moreover, it is distinguished from ordinary Type Ibc SNe by the
          presence of 10^48 erg of mildly-relativistic ejecta, along with
          a  central  engine  which  produces  X-rays for weeks after the
          explosion.  This  suggests  that  the  presence of relativistic
          ejecta  is  the  key physical distinction between GRBs/XRFs and
          ordinary  SNe,  while  the  nature of the central engine (black
          hole  or  magnetar)  may distinguish cosmological GRBs from the
          low-luminosity and spherical events like XRF 060218.

          Symposium, ChJAA in press
          The  recently  started  Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) pulsar
          survey aims to find ~1000 new pulsars. Due to its high time and
          frequency  resolution  the  survey  is  especially sensitive to
          millisecond   pulsars,   which   have  the  potential  to  test
          gravitational  theories,  detect  gravitational waves and probe
          the  neutron-star equation of state. Here we report the results
          of  our  preliminary  analysis:  in  the  first  months we have
          discovered  21  new pulsars. One of these, PSR J1906+0746, is a
          young   144-ms   pulsar   in   a  highly  relativistic  3.98-hr
          low-eccentricity  orbit.  The 2.61 +- 0.02 solar-mass system is
          expected  to coalesce in ~300 Myr and contributes significantly
          to the computed cosmic inspiral rate of compact binary systems.

          Title: Optical spectroscopy of the dwarf nova U Geminorum
          Authors: Unda-Sanzana, E. Marsh, T. R. Morales-Rueda, L
          U Gem is unique in having a direct measurement of K1 = 107 +- 2
          km/s,  Long  et  al.  1999). We present high-resolution optical
          spectra of the dwarf nova U Gem in quiescence taken to test the
          accuracy  to  which the HST value can be recovered from optical
          data.  We  find that, even with data of very high S/N we cannot
          recover  Long  et  al.'s  value to better than about 20% by any
          method.  Contamination  by  neighbouring emission lines seems a
          likely  culprit.  Our  data  reveal  a  number of new features:
          Doppler  tomograms  show emission at low velocity, close to the
          centre  of  mass, and a transient, narrow absorption feature is
          seen  in  the Balmer lines near the line centres at the time of
          eclipse.  We  suggest  that  stellar prominences, as previously
          invoked  for the dwarf novae IP Peg and SS Cyg in outburst, may
          explain  both  of  these  features.  The  He  II 4686.75 A line
          emission is dominated by the gas stream/disc impact region. Two
          distinct  spots  are seen in Doppler maps, the first being very
          narrow  and  showing  a velocity close to that of the accretion
          disc  in  the  impact  region,  and the second much broader and
          located  between  the  velocities of the (ballistic) stream and
          the  (Keplerian)  disc.  We  present tentative evidence of weak
          spiral  structure.  We find no evidence of stream-disc overflow
          in  the  system.  Our  data  suggests an inclination angle > 70
          degrees,  adding  to  the evidence of a puzzle in the mass of U
          Gem's  white  dwarf.  The  mass  donor  is  clearly seen in the
          Doppler maps, with emission concentrated towards its poles, and
          mainly  on  the  side  facing  the  white  dwarf. This suggests
          irradiation  with  shielding by the disc from which we estimate
          an H/R ratio between 0.15 and 0.25.

          Title:  Variability  of the NGC 1333 IRAS 4A Outflow: Molecular
          Hydrogen and Silicon Monoxide Images
          Authors: Minho Choi, Klaus W. Hodapp, Masahiko Hayashi, Kentaro
          Motohara, Soojong Pak, Tae-Soo Pyo
          The  NGC  1333 region was observed in the H2 1-0 S(1) line. The
          H2  images  cover  a  5' x 7' region around IRAS 4. Numerous H2
          emission   features   were  detected.  The  northeast-southwest
          bipolar  outflow driven by IRAS 4A was studied by combining the
          H2  images  with  SiO  maps  published  previously.  The SiO-H2
          outflows are continuous on the southwestern side but show a gap
          on  the northeastern side. The southwestern outflow lobe curves
          smoothly,  and  the  position angle increases with the distance
          from  the  driving  source.  The  base and the outer tip of the
          northeastern  outflow lobe are located at positions opposite to
          the   corresponding   parts  of  the  southwestern  lobe.  This
          point-symmetry  suggests  that the outflow axis may be drifting
          or  precessing  clockwise  in the plane of the sky and that the
          cause of the axis drift may be intrinsic to the outflow engine.
          The  axis  drift  model  is supported by the asymmetric lateral
          intensity  profile  of  the SiO outflow. The axis drift rate is
          about  0.011  deg  yr-1.  The  middle  part of the northeastern
          outflow  does  not exactly follow the point symmetry because of
          the   superposition  of  two  different  kinds  of  directional
          variability:  the  axis  drift  of  the  driving source and the
          deflection  by  a  dense  core. The axis drift model provides a
          good   explanation  for  the  large  deflection  angle  of  the
          northeastern  outflow.  Other  H2  emission features around the
          IRAS  4  region  are  discussed briefly. Some of them are newly
          found  outflows,  and some are associated with outflows already
          known before.

          submitted
          We  use  a 54.4 ks Chandra observation to study nuclear outflow
          activity  in  NGC4552  (M89), an elliptical galaxy in the Virgo
          Cluster.  Chandra  images  in  the  0.5-2  keV  band  show  two
          ring-like features ~1.7 kpc in diameter in the core of NGC4552,
          as  reported  previously  by  Filho  et  al. We use spherically
          symmetric  point explosion shock models to argue that the shape
          of  the surface brightness profile across the rims of the rings
          and the temperature of hot gas in the rings are consistent with
          a  Mach  1.7 shock carrying mean mechanical power L_shock ~ 3 x
          10^{41}  ergs/s  produced  by  a  ~1.4  x  10^{55} ergs nuclear
          outburst  \~1  -  2 Myr ago. We find the gas temperature in the
          central  ~100  pc  of  the galaxy to be 1.0 +/- 0.2 keV, hotter
          than  elsewhere  in  the  galaxy,  suggesting  that  we  may be
          observing  directly  the  reheating  of  the  galaxy ISM by the
          outburst.

          Astrophysical     Plasmas:     Exact     Solutions    Including
          Momentum-Dependent Escape
          Authors: P. A. Becker, T. Le, C. D. Dermer
          Comments: Accepted for publication in ApJ
          Stochastic   acceleration   of   charged   particles   due   to
          interactions with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma waves is the
          dominant  process  leading  to the formation of the high-energy
          electron  and  ion  distributions in a variety of astrophysical
          systems.   Collisions   with   the  waves  influence  both  the
          energization  and  the  spatial transport of the particles, and
          therefore  it  is  important  to treat these two aspects of the
          problem   in   a   self-consistent   manner.   We   solve   the
          representative   Fokker-Planck   equation   to  obtain  a  new,
          closed-form  solution  for  the time-dependent Green's function
          describing  the  acceleration  and  escape of relativistic ions
          interacting  with  Alfven  or  fast-mode waves characterized by
          momentum  diffusion  coefficient  $D(p)\propto  p^q$  and  mean
          particle escape timescale $t_esc(p) \propto p^{q-2}$, where $p$
          is  the particle momentum and $q$ is the power-law index of the
          MHD  wave  spectrum. In particular, we obtain solutions for the
          momentum  distribution  of  the ions in the plasma and also for
          the  momentum distribution of the escaping particles, which may
          form   an  energetic  outflow.  The  general  features  of  the
          solutions  are  illustrated  via  examples  based  on  either a
          Kolmogorov  or  Kraichnan  wave  spectrum.  The new expressions
          complement  the  results  obtained  by  Park and Petrosian, who
          presented  exact  solutions for the hard-sphere scattering case
          ($q=2$)  in  addition  to  other  scenarios in which the escape
          timescale  has  a  power-law  dependence  on  the momentum. Our
          results   have  direct  relevance  for  models  of  high-energy
          radiation    and   cosmic-ray   production   in   astrophysical
          environments  such as $\gamma$-ray bursts, active galaxies, and
          magnetized coronae around black holes.

          Standard   LCDM   predicts   that  the  major  merger  rate  of
          galaxy-size  dark matter halos rises rapidly with redshift. The
          average  number  of  close  companions per galaxy, Nc, is often
          used   to   infer  the  galaxy  merger  rate,  however,  recent
          observational  studies suggest that Nc evolves very little with
          redshift.  Here  we  use  a  "hybrid"  N-  body simulation plus
          analytic substructure model to predict Nc directly. We identify
          dark  matter  subhalos with galaxies and show that the observed
          lack  of  close  pair  count  evolution arises because the high
          merger  rate  per  halo  at  early  times  is counteracted by a
          decrease in the number of halos massive enough to host a galaxy
          pair.  We  compare our results to data compiled from the DEEP2,
          SSRS2, and the UZC redshift surveys. Observed pair counts match
          our predictions if we assume a monotonic mapping between galaxy
          luminosity  and the maximum circular velocity that each subhalo
          had  when  it  was  first  accreted  onto  its  host halo. This
          suggests   that   satellite  galaxies  are  significantly  more
          resilient  to  destruction than are dissipationless dark matter
          subhalos.  We  argue  that  while  Nc does not provide a direct
          measure  of the halo merger rate, it offers a powerful means to
          constrain  the  Halo  Occupation  Distribution  and the spatial
          distribution of galaxies within halos. Interpreted in this way,
          close  pair  counts  provide  a useful test of galaxy formation
          processes on < 100 kpc scales.

          Title:  Hot  Accretion  With  Conduction:  Spontaneous  Thermal
          Outflows
          Authors: Takamitsu Tanaka, Kristen Menou (Columbia)
          Comments: 38 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ
          Motivated  by the low-collisionality of gas accreted onto black
          holes  in  Sgr  A* and other nearby galactic nuclei, we study a
          family   of  2D  advective  accretion  solutions  with  thermal
          conduction.  While  we only impose global inflow, the accretion
          flow  spontaneously  develops  bipolar  outflows.  The  role of
          conduction  is  key  in  providing  the extra degree of freedom
          (latitudinal   energy  transport)  necessary  to  launch  these
          rotating  thermal  outflows. The sign of the Bernoulli constant
          does not discriminate between inflowing and outflowing regions.
          Our  parameter survey covers mass outflow rates from ~ 0 to 13%
          of  the  net  inflow rate, outflow velocities from ~0 to 11% of
          the  local Keplerian velocity and outflow opening angles from ~
          0  to  60  degs.  As  the magnitude of conduction is increased,
          outflows  can  adopt  a conical geometry, pure inflow solutions
          emerge,  and  the limit of 2D non-rotating Bondi-like solutions
          is    eventually    reached.   These   results   confirm   that
          radiatively-inefficient,    hot    accretion   flows   have   a
          hydrodynamical propensity to generate bipolar thermal outflows.

          Inverse-Compton Scattering of Shock Breakout Thermal Photons
          Authors: Z. G. Dai, Bing Zhang, E. W. Liang
          Comments: 10 pages, 1 figure
          The gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060218/SN 2006aj is a peculiar event,
          with the second lowest redshift, low luminosity, long duration,
          chromatic  lightcurve features, and in particular, the presence
          of  a  thermal  component  in the X-ray and UV-optical spectra.
          Thanks  to  detailed temporal and spectral coverage of the {\em
          Swift}  observatory,  the  abundant  data  allow the GRB prompt
          emission to be modelled in great detail for the first time. The
          low   flux   of   prompt   UV/optical  emission  disfavors  the
          conventional internal shock/synchrotron radiation models, which
          generally predict strong UV/optical emission. Here we show that
          the  unusual  prompt  emission of GRB 060218 can be produced by
          inverse-Compton  scattering  of  shock-accelerated relativistic
          electrons  off the detected thermal photons. A pair of (forward
          plus reverse) shocks form when a relativistic outflow interacts
          with   a  preexisting  slower  shell.  The  observed  gamma-ray
          emission  and X-ray emission arise from the reverse-shocked and
          forward-shocked  regions,  respectively.  A  fit  to  the  data
          requires  an  initially increasing outflow luminosity, which is
          consistent with the prediction of the popular collapsar model.

          Title: The pattern of accretion flow onto Sgr A*
          Authors: Monika Moscibrodzka Tapas K. Das Bozena Czerny
          Comments: 10 pages,7 figures, accepted to MNRAS
          The material accreting onto Sgr A* most probably comes from the
          nearby  stars. We analyze the pattern of this flow at distances
          of  a  fraction  of  a parsec and we argue that the net angular
          momentum  of  this  material is low but non-negligible, and the
          initially  supersonic disk accretion changes into subsonic flow
          with  constant  angular  momentum.  Next  we  estimate the flow
          parameters  at  a distance $R_{BHL}$ from the black hole and we
          argue that for the plausible parameter range the accretion flow
          is non-stationary. The inflow becomes supersonic at distance of
          $\sim  10^4  R_g$  but the solution does not continue below the
          horizon  and  the material piles up forming a torus, or a ring,
          at a distance of a few up to tens of Schwarzchild radii. Such a
          torus   is   known  to  be  unstable  and  may  explain  strong
          variability of the flow in Sgr A*. Our considerations show that
          the   temporary   formation   of  such  a  torus  seems  to  be
          unavoidable.
          Our  best  fitting model predicts a rather large accretion rate
          of around $4 \cdot 10^{-6} M_{\odot}/yr$ directly on Sgr A*. We
          argue  that  magnetic  fields  in the flow are tangled and this
          allows  our model to overcome the disagreement with the Faraday
          rotation limits.

          Title: Dark Energy as a Born-Infeld Gauge Interaction Violating
          the Equivalence Principle

          Comments: 14 pages, 4 figures, sequel of Phys. Rev. D 73 023520
          (2006), submitted to Physical Review
          We investigate the possibility that dark energy does not couple
          to gravitation in the same way than ordinary matter, yielding a
          violation  of  the  weak  and  strong equivalence principles on
          cosmological  scales.  We  build a transient mechanism in which
          gravitation  is  pushed  away  from  general  relativity  by  a
          Born-Infeld   gauge   interaction   acting  as  an  "Abnormally
          Weighting"  (dark)  Energy.  This  mechanism  accounts  for the
          Hubble  diagram  of  far-away supernovae by cosmic acceleration
          and   time   variation  of  the  gravitational  constant  while

          of the physical mechanisms associated to the Supermassive Black

          Title:  Feedback  and  metal  enrichment  in  cosmological  SPH
          simulations  -  II.  A  multiphase  model with supernova energy
          feedback
          Authors:  Cecilia  Scannapieco, Patricia B. Tissera, Simon D.M.

          Comments: MNRAS submitted
          We   have   developed  a  new  scheme  to  treat  a  multiphase
          interstellar   medium   in   smoothed   particle  hydrodynamics
          simulations  of  galaxy  formation. This scheme can represent a
          co-spatial  mixture  of  cold  and  hot  ISM components, and is
          formulated  without  scale-dependent  parameters.  It  is  thus
          particularly   suited  to  studies  of  cosmological  structure
          formation  where  galaxies  with  a  wide  range of masses form
          simultaneously.  We  also present new algorithms for energy and
          heavy  element  injection by supernovae, and show that together
          these  schemes can reproduce several important observed effects
          in   galaxy  evolution.  Both  in  collapsing  systems  and  in
          quiescent  galaxies  our  codes  can  reproduce  the  Kennicutt
          relation  between  the  surface  densities  of  gas and of star
          formation.  Strongly metal-enhanced winds are generated in both
          cases  with  ratios  of  mass-loss  to star formation which are
          similar to those observed. This leads to a self-regulated cycle
          for  star  formation  activity.  The overall impact of feedback
          depends on galaxy mass. Star formation is suppressed at most by
          a  factor of a few in massive galaxies, but in low-mass systems
          the  effects  can  be  much  larger,  giving  star formation an
          episodic,  bursty  character.  The  larger  the energy fraction
          assumed  available  in  feedback, the more massive the outflows
          and  the  lower  the  final  stellar masses. Winds from forming
          disks  are  collimated  perpendicular  to the disk plane, reach
          velocities  up  to  1000 km/s, and efficiently transport metals
          out of the galaxies. The asymptotically unbound baryon fraction
          drops  from  >95% to ~30% from the least to the most massive of
          our  idealised galaxies, but the fraction of all metals ejected
          with  this  component  exceeds  60 per cent regardless of mass.
          Such  winds  could plausibly enrich the intergalactic medium to
          observed levels.

          We  have  calculated  the first dynamical evolutions of merging
          black  hole-neutron  star  binaries  that  treat  the  combined
          spacetime  in a nonperturbative general relativistic framework.
          Using the conformal flatness approximation, we have studied how
          the location of the tidal disruption radius with respect to the
          the  black  hole  horizon  and  innermost stable circular orbit
          (ISCO)  affects  the qualitative evolution of the system. Based
          on  simple  arguments,  we  show  that  for a binary mass ratio
          q>~0.24,  tidal  disruption  occurs outside the ISCO, while the
          opposite  is  true  for  q<~0.24.  When tidal disruption occurs
          sufficiently far outside the ISCO, mass is transferred unstably
          from  the  neutron  star  to  the  black hole, resulting in the
          complete  disruption of the neutron star. When tidal disruption
          occurs  slightly within the ISCO, we find that some of the mass
          forms  an  extremely  hot  disk  around  the  black  hole.  The
          resulting  configurations in this case are excellent candidates
          for the progenitors of short-hard gamma ray bursts.

          IC  2163  and  NGC 2207 are interacting galaxies that have been
          well  studied at optical and radio wavelengths and simulated in
          numerical  models  to  reproduce  the  observed  kinematics and
          morphological  features.  Spitzer  IRAC  and  MIPS observations
          reported  here  show  over  200  bright  clumps from young star
          complexes. The brightest IR clump is a morphologically peculiar
          region  of  star formation in the western arm of NGC 2207. This
          clump,  which dominates the Halpha and radio continuum emission
          from both galaxies, accounts for ~12% of the total 24mu m flux.
          Nearly  half  of  the  clumps  are  regularly spaced along some
          filamentary structure, whether in the starburst oval of IC 2163
          or in the thin spiral arms of NGC 2207. This regularity appears
          to influence the clump luminosity function, making it peaked at
          a  value  nearly  a  factor of 10 above the completeness limit,
          particularly  in the starburst oval. This is unlike the optical
          clusters  inside  the  clumps, which have a luminosity function
          consistent  with  the usual power law form. The giant IR clumps
          presumably   formed   by  gravitational  instabilities  in  the
          compressed  gas  of  the  oval and the spiral arms, whereas the
          individual  clusters  formed by more chaotic processes, such as
          turbulence compression, inside these larger-scale structures.

          Title:  Modelling  galaxy  spectra  in presence of interstellar
          dust. II. From the UV to the far infrared
          Authors: Lorenzo Piovan, Rosaria Tantalo, Cesare Chiosi
          Comments: 28 pages, 23 figures and 1 table. Accepted by MNRAS
          In   this  paper,  we  present  spectrophotometric  models  for
          galaxies  of different morphological type whose spectral energy
          distributions  (SEDs)  take  into account the effect of dust in
          absorbing  UV-optical  light and re-emitting it in the infrared
          (IR). The models contain three main components: (i) the diffuse
          interstellar  medium  (ISM)  composed of gas and dust, (ii) the
          large  complexes  of  molecular clouds (MCs) in which new stars
          are  formed  and  (iii)  the  stars  of  any  age  and chemical
          composition.  The  galaxy  models  stand  on  a robust model of
          chemical  evolution  taylored  in such a way to match the gross
          properties  of  galaxies  of  different  morphological  type. A
          simple  geometrical  model  is adopted for each type of galaxy.
          The  total gas and star mass provided by the chemical model are
          distributed  over the whole volume by means of suitable density
          profiles,  one  for  each component and depending on the galaxy
          type (spheroidal, disk and disk plus bulge). The galaxy is then
          split  in  suitable  volume  elements  to  each  of  which  the
          appropriate  amounts  of  stars,  MCs  and ISM are assigned. We
          derive  the  SEDs  of galaxies of different morphological type.
          First  the  the basic relations driving the interaction between
          the  physical  components  of the galaxy are presented. Second,
          the  main  parameters are examined and their effects on the SED
          of  three  prototype  galaxies  (a  disk,  an  elliptical and a
          starburster)  are  highlighted.  The final part of the paper is
          devoted   to  assess  the  ability  of  our  galaxy  models  in
          reproducing  the  SEDs  of  a  few  real  galaxies of the Local
          Universe.

          The  behavior  of  the  aromatic  features  as  a  function  of
          metallicity/radiation  field  hardness  in M101 HII regions and
          starburst  galaxies  is investigated using Spitzer/IRS spectra.
          These  spectra  reveal  that  the 6.2, 7.8+8.6, and 11.3 micron
          aromatics  have different dependencies on metallicity/radiation
          field  hardness.  Specifically,  the  6.2  and  7.8+8.6  micron
          aromatics  are weak or absent at a metallicity, 12+log(O/H), of
          approx.  8.0  while  the 11.3 micron feature remains relatively
          strong.  These  results  apply to both the M101 HII regions and
          starbursts showing that HII regions can indeed be thought of as
          ``mini-starbursts.''  Comparison  of  this  work  with  various
          candidate  materials results in a good match with the annealing
          behavior  in  Quenched Carbonaceous Composite (QCC) which is an
          amorphous, hydrogenated, carbonaceous solid.

          Comments: 31 pages, 8 figures, accepted by AJ
          We  present  the  results  of  our optical monitoring of the BL
          Lacertae  object  OJ  287  during  the  first half of 2005. The
          source  did  not  show  large-amplitude  variations during this
          period  and  was  in  a  relatively quiescent state. A possible
          period  of  40  days was derived from its light curves in three
          BATC    wavebands.   A   bluer-when-brighter   chromatism   was
          discovered,  which is different from the extremely stable color
          during  the outburst in 1994--96. The different color behaviors
          imply different variation mechanisms in the two states. We then
          re-visited  the  optical  data on OJ 287 from the OJ-94 project
          and  found  as well a probable period of 40 days in its optical
          variability  during the late-1994 outburst. The results suggest
          that  two  components  contribute  to the variability of OJ 287
          during  its  outburst  state. The first component is the normal
          {\sl blazar} variation. This component has an amplitude similar
          to  that  of  the  quiescent state and also may share a similar
          periodicity.   The   second   component   can  be  taken  as  a
          `low-frequency  modulation'  to  the first component. It may be
          induced by the interaction of the assumed binary black holes in
          the  center of this object. The 40-day period may be related to
          the  helical structure of the magnetic field at the base of the
          jet,  or  to  the  orbital  motion close to the central primary
          black hole.

          Authors: MAGIC Collaboration: J. Albert, et al
          Comments: 11 pages with 4 figures
          Microquasars   are   binary   star  systems  with  relativistic
          radio-emitting  jets. They are potential sources of cosmic rays
          and  laboratories  for  elucidating the physics of relativistic
          jets.  Here  we  report  the  detection  of  variable gamma-ray
          emission above 100 gigaelectron volts from the microquasar LS I
          +61  303.  Six orbital cycles were recorded. Several detections
          occur  at  a  similar orbital phase, suggesting the emission is
          periodic. The strongest gamma-ray emission is not observed when
          the  two  stars  are  closest to one another, implying a strong
          orbital modulation of the emission or the absorption processes.

          Title:   The   planets   capture  model  of  V838  Monocerotis:
          conclusions for the penetration depth of the planet/s
          Authors: Alon Retter, Bing Zhang, Lionel Siess, Amir Levinson
          Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures, MNRAS, accepted
          V838   Mon  is  the  prototype  of  a  new  class  of  objects.
          Understanding  the  nature  of  its  multi-stage  outburst  and
          similar  systems is challenging. So far, several scenarios have
          been  invoked to explain this group of stars. In this work, the
          planets-swallowing  model for V838 Mon is further investigated,
          taking  into  account  the findings that the progenitor is most
          likely  a massive B type star. We find that the super-Eddington
          luminosity  during  the  eruption  can  explain the fast rising
          times  of  the  three peaks in the optical light curve. We used
          two  different  methods  to  estimate  the  location  where the
          planets  were  consumed.  There is a nice agreement between the
          values  obtained  from  the  luminosities of the peaks and from
          their  rising  time  scale.  We  estimate that the planets were
          stopped  at  a  typical  distance  of one solar radius from the
          center  of  the  host  giant  star. The planets-devouring model
          seems  to  give  a satisfying explanation to the differences in
          the  luminosities  and  rising  times of the three peaks in the
          optical  light curve of V838 Mon. The peaks may be explained by
          the  consumption  of  three  planets  or alternatively by three
          steps  in  the  terminal falling process of a single planet. We
          argue  that  only  the binary merger and the planets-swallowing
          models  are consistent with the observations of the new type of
          stars defined by V838 Mon.

          Title:  Reconciling  optical and X-ray mass estimates: the case
          of the elliptical galaxy NGC3379
          Authors: S. Pellegrini, L. Ciotti
          Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, accepted by MNRAS
          NGC3379  is  a well studied nearby elliptical for which optical
          investigations  have  claimed  a little dark matter content, or
          even  no dark matter. Recently, its total mass profile M(r) has
          been derived by exploiting Chandra observations of its extended
          and X-ray emitting interstellar medium, based on the hypothesis
          of hydrostatic equilibrium for the hot gas. The resulting total
          mass  within  the  effective radius Re has been claimed to be a
          few  times  larger  than found by optical studies. Here we show
          that  part of the discrepancy can be due to an underestimate of
          the  optically derived mass, and the remaining discrepancy of a
          factor  of  ~2  can be explained by deviations from hydrostatic
          equilibrium of the hot gas. By using hydrodynamical simulations
          tailored  to  reproduce  the  observed  hot  gas  properties of
          NGC3379, and by assuming as input for the simulations the total
          mass  profile derived optically, we show that i) the hot gas at
          the  present  time  has  X-ray properties consistent with those
          observed  only  if  it  is outflowing over most of the galactic
          body,  and  ii)  an overestimate of M of the same size found in
          the   recent   X-ray   analysis   is  recovered  when  assuming
          hydrostatic  equilibrium.  We  also  show  that  the hot gas is
          outflowing  even  for a dark matter fraction within Re as large
          as  derived  with  the  standard  X-ray  procedure based on the
          hydrostatic    equilibrium    assumption,   which   shows   the
          unapplicability of the method for this galaxy. Finally, we find
          that  the  whole  range  of  dark  mass amount and distribution
          allowed  for  by  optical  studies is compatible with a hot gas
          flow with the observed X-ray properties.

          One  of the most recent discoveries of the INTEGRAL observatory
          is  the  existence  of a previously unknown population of X-ray
          sources  in  the inner arms of the Galaxy. IGR J17544-2619, IGR
          J16465-4507 and XTE J1739-302 are among these sources. Although
          the   nature   of  these  systems  is  still  unexplained,  the
          investigations  of the optical/NIR counterparts of the two last
          sources, combined with high energy data, have provided evidence
          of  them  being  highly  absorbed high mass X-ray binaries with
          blue supergiant secondaries and displaying fast X-ray transient
          behaviour. In this work we present our optical/NIR observations
          of IGR J17544-2619, aimed at identifying and characterizing its
          counterpart.  We  show  that  the  source  is a high mass X-ray
          binary  at  a distance of 2-4 kpc with a strongly absorbed O9Ib
          secondary, and discuss the nature of the system.

          Radiative transfer in a clumped winds is used to describe X-ray
          emission  line profiles observed in the XMM-Newton RGS spectrum
          of  the  OI  star  Zeta  Puppis.  It  is  shown that this X-ray
          spectrum    can    be   explained   as   originating   from   a
          multi-temperature   collisional  plasma  located  in  the  wind
          acceleration  zone.  The  X-rays  are attenuated in the clumped
          stellar  wind,  which  gives  characteristic  profiles  to  the
          emergent  lines.  We specifically study the N VII emission line
          in the spectrum of Zeta Pup. Long RGS exposures reveal that the
          N  VII line profile is structured. On the basis of our Zeta Pup
          atmosphere model, we rule out the presence of N VII in the cool
          wind  component.  We  suggest  that  the  detailed  N  VII line
          structure  is  due  to  self-absorption in the hot plasma. Wind
          clumping  also  affects  the  transfer of ionizing radiation in

          Title:  Optical  Counterparts  of  Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources

          We   present  a  systematic  analysis  of  archival  HST  WFPC2
          ``Association''  data  sets  that  correlate  with  the Chandra
          positions of a set of 44 ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) of
          nearby  galaxies.  We  have  improved  the Chandra-HST relative
          astrometry  whenever  possible.  Disparate numbers of potential
          ULX  counterparts  are found, and in some cases none are found.
          The  lack of or low number of counterparts in some cases may be
          due  to insufficient depth in the WFPC2 images. Particularly in
          late-type  galaxies,  the HST image in the ULX region was often
          complex  or crowded. We therefore address various scenarios for
          the  nature  of the ULX since it is not known which, if any, of
          the   sources   found   are   true  counterparts.  The  optical
          luminosities  of  the sources are typically in the range 10^4-6
          L_sun.  In  several  cases color information is available, with
          the  colors  roughly  tending  to  be  more  red  in early-type
          galaxies.  This  suggests  that,  in  general,  the (potential)
          counterparts  found  in  early-type  galaxies  are likely to be
          older  stellar populations, and are probably globular clusters.
          Several  early-type galaxy counterparts have blue colors, which
          may be due to younger stellar populations in the host galaxies,
          however  these  could  also  be  background  sources. In spiral
          galaxies  the sources may also be due to localized structure in
          the disks rather than bound stellar systems. Alternatively some
          of  the  counterparts  in  late-type  galaxies  may be isolated
          supergiant  stars.  The  observed  X-ray/optical  flux ratio is
          diluted  by  the optical emission of the cluster in cases where
          the system is an X-ray binary in a cluster, particularly in the
          case of a low-mass X-ray binaries in old cluster. (abridged)

          Title:   Gravitational   Waves   from   Light  Cosmic  Strings:
          Backgrounds and Bursts with Large Loops
          Authors: Craig J. Hogan
          Comments: 22 pages, Latex, 1 figure, submitted to Phys Rev D
          The  mean  spectrum and burst statistics of gravitational waves
          produced  by  a  cosmological population of cosmic string loops
          are  estimated  using  analytic approximations, calibrated with
          earlier   simulations.   Formulas   are   derived  showing  the
          dependence  of observables on the string tension, in the regime
          where  newly-formed  loops  are relatively large, not very much
          smaller  than  the  horizon. Large loops form earlier, are more
          abundant, and generate a more intense stochastic background and
          more   frequent  bursts  than  assumed  in  earlier  background
          estimates, enabling experiments to probe lighter cosmic strings
          of  interest  to  string  theory. Predictions are compared with
          instrument  noise from current and future experiments, and with
          confusion  noise  from  known  astrophysical gravitational wave
          sources  such  as  stellar  and massive black hole binaries. In
          these  large-loop  models, current data from millisecond pulsar
          timing  already  suggests  that  the tension is less than about
          $10^{-10}$,  a  typical  value  expected  in strings from brane
          inflation.  LISA  will  be  sensitive to stochastic backgrounds
          created  by  strings  as  light  as  $G\mu\approx 10^{-15}$, at
          frequencies  where it is limited by confusion noise of Galactic
          stellar  populations;  however,  for  those lightest detectable
          strings, bursts are rarely detectable.

          Title: A warped m=2 water maser disc in V778 Cyg?
          Authors:   Natalia   Babkovskaia,  Juri  Poutanen,  Anita  M.S.

          Comments:  7  pages,  5  figures.  This  paper  is accepted for
          publication in MNRAS
          The  silicate  carbon star V778 Cyg is a source of 22 GHz water
          maser   emission   which   was  recently  resolved  by  MERLIN.
          Observations revealed an elongated S-like structure along which
          the  velocities  of the maser features show a linear dependence
          on   the   impact   parameter.   This   is  consistent  with  a
          doubly-warped  m=2  disc  observed  edge-on.  Water  masers and
          silicate dust emission (detected by IRAS and ISO) have a common
          origin  in  O-rich  material and are likely to be co-located in
          the  disc.  We  propose  a  detailed self-consistent model of a
          masing gas-dust disc around a companion to the carbon star in a
          binary  system,  which allows us to estimate the companion mass
          of  1.7  +-  0.1  M_sun,  the  disc radius of 40 +-3 AU and the
          distance  between  companions  of about 80 AU. Using a dust-gas
          coupling  model  for water masing, we calculate the maser power
          self-consistently,  accounting  for  both  the gas and the dust
          energy  balances.  Comparing  the  simulation  results with the
          observational  data,  we deduce the main physical parameters of
          the  masing  disc,  such  as  the gas and dust temperatures and
          their  densities.  We also present an analysis of the stability
          of the disc.

          Title:  The  answer  is  blowing  in  the  wind: Simulating the
          interaction of jets with dynamic cluster atmospheres
          Authors: S. Heinz, M. Brueggen, A. Young, E. Levesque
          Comments: 5 Pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS Letters
          We  present numerical simulations investigating the interaction
          of  AGN  jets  with  galaxy clusters, for the first time taking
          into account the dynamic nature of the cluster gas and detailed
          cluster  physics.  The  simulations  successfully reproduce the
          observed  morphologies  of  radio  sources in clusters. We find
          that   cluster  inhomogeneities  and  large  scale  flows  have
          significant  impact  on  the morphology of the radio source and
          cannot  be  ignored  a-priori  when  investigating radio source
          dynamics. Morphological comparison suggests that the gas in the
          centres of clusters like Virgo and Abell 4059 shows significant
          shear  and/or  rotation. We find that shear and rotation in the
          intra-cluster  medium  move large amounts of cold material back
          into  the  path  of  the  jet,  ensuring  that  subsequent  jet
          outbursts  encounter  a  sufficient  column  density  of gas to
          couple with the inner cluster gas, thus alleviating the problem
          of  evacuated  channels discussed in the recent literature. The
          same  effects  redistribute the excess energy Delta_E deposited
          by  the  jets, making the distribution of Delta_E at late times
          consistent with being isotropic.

          Gamma-Ray Background

          Comments:  submitted  to  ApJ,  6  pages,  1  table,  1 figure,
          emulateapj
          Cosmic  ray protons interacting with gas at the mean density of
          the  interstellar  medium  in  starburst  galaxies  lose energy
          rapidly  via  inelastic  collisions  with  ambient  nuclei. The
          resulting  pions  produce  secondary  electrons  and positrons,
          high-energy  neutrinos,  and gamma-ray photons. We estimate the
          cumulative  gamma-ray emission from starburst galaxies and find
          a  specific  intensity  at  GeV energies of (nu I_nu) ~ 3 times
          10^{-7} GeV cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1}. Starbursts may thus account
          for  a  significant  fraction  of  the extra-galactic gamma-ray
          background.  We  show that the FIR-radio correlation provides a
          strong  constraint  on  the  gamma-ray  emission from starburst
          galaxies   because   pions   decay  into  both  gamma-rays  and
          radio-emitting  electron/positron  pairs.  We  identify several
          nearby  systems  where  the  potential  for observing gamma-ray
          emission  is  the  most  favorable  (M82,  NGC  253, & IC 342),
          predict  their  fluxes,  and  predict  a  linear  FIR-gamma-ray
          correlation  for  the  densest  starbursts. If established, the
          FIR-gamma-ray correlation would provide strong evidence for the
          ``calorimeter''  theory  of the FIR-radio correlation and would
          imply  that cosmic rays in starburst galaxies interact with gas
          at  approximately  the  mean density of the interstellar medium
          (ISM), thereby providing an important constraint on the physics
          of the ISM in starbursts.

          Title:  Outgassing  of Ordinary Chondritic Material and Some of
          its  Implications  for the Chemistry of Asteroids, Planets, and
          Satellites
          Authors: Laura Schaefer, Bruce Fegley, Jr
          Comments: 72 pages, 17 figures, 3 tables; submitted to Icarus
          We  used  chemical  equilibrium  calculations  to model thermal
          outgassing  of  ordinary  chondritic  material as a function of
          temperature,  pressure,  and  bulk  compositions  and  use  our
          results to discuss outgassing on asteroids and the early Earth.
          The  calculations  include  ~1,000  solids  and  gases  of  the
          elements Al, C, Ca, Cl, Co, Cr, F, Fe, H, K, Mg, Mn, N, Na, Ni,
          O,  P,  S,  Si,  and  Ti.  The  major  outgassed volatiles from
          ordinary  chondritic material are CH4, H2, H2O, N2, and NH3(the
          latter  at conditions where hydrous minerals form). Contrary to
          widely  held  assumptions,  CO is never the major C-bearing gas
          during  ordinary  chondrite metamorphism. The calculated oxygen
          fugacity  (partial pressure) of ordinary chondritic material is
          close  to  that  of  the quartz-fayalite-iron (QFI) buffer. Our
          results  are  insensitive  to variable total pressure, variable
          volatile  element abundances, and kinetic inhibition of C and N
          dissolution in Fe metal. Our results predict that Earth's early
          atmosphere contained CH4, H2, H2O, N2, and NH3; similar to that
          used in Miller-Urey synthesis of organic compounds.

          Title: Physics of Strongly Magnetized Neutron Stars
          Authors: Alice K. Harding (GSFC), Dong Lai (Cornell)
          Comments:  93  pages.  Reports on Progress in Physics, in press
          (2006)
          There  has  recently been growing evidence for the existence of
          neutron  stars  possessing  magnetic fields with strengths that
          exceed  the  quantum  critical  field  strength  of $4.4 \times
          10^{13}$  G,  at which the cyclotron energy equals the electron
          rest  mass.  Such evidence has been provided by new discoveries
          of  radio  pulsars  having  very  high  spin-down  rates and by
          observations  of  bursting  gamma-ray sources termed magnetars.
          This article will discuss the exotic physics of this high-field
          regime,  where  a  new  array of processes becomes possible and
          even  dominant,  and  where  familiar processes acquire unusual
          properties. We review the physical processes that are important
          in  neutron  star  interiors  and magnetospheres, including the
          behavior  of  free  particles,  atoms,  molecules,  plasma  and
          condensed  matter in strong magnetic fields, photon propagation
          in  magnetized  plasmas, free-particle radiative processes, the
          physics  of  neutron  star  interiors,  and field evolution and
          decay    mechanisms.   Application   of   such   processes   in
          astrophysical   source   models,   including   rotation-powered
          pulsars,  soft gamma-ray repeaters, anomalous X-ray pulsars and
          accreting X-ray pulsars will also be discussed. Throughout this
          review,  we will highlight the observational signatures of high
          magnetic  field  processes,  as  well as the theoretical issues
          that remain to be understood.

          Title:  Constraints  on  the Accretion History of Massive Black
          Holes from Faint X-ray Counts
          Authors: Marta Volonteri, Ruben Salvaterra, Francesco Haardt
          Comments: Submitted to MNRAS, 7 pages, 8 figures
          We  investigate how hierarchical models for the co-evolution of
          the  massive  black hole (MBH) and AGN population can reproduce
          the observed faint X-ray counts. We find that the main variable
          influencing  the theoretical predictions is the Eddington ratio
          of   accreting  sources.  We  compare  three  different  models
          proposed  for  the  evolution  of  AGN  Eddington ratio, f_Edd:
          constant  f_Edd=1,  f_Edd  decreasing  with redshift, and f_Edd
          depending on the AGN luminosity, as suggested by simulations of
          galactic  mergers including BHs and AGN feedback. We follow the
          full  assembly  of  MBHs and host halos from early times to the
          present  in a LambdaCDM cosmology. AGN activity is triggered by
          halo major mergers and MBHs accrete mass until they satisfy the
          observed correlation with velocity dispersion. We find that all
          three  models  can  reproduce fairly well the total faint X-ray
          counts.  The redshift distribution is however poorly matched in
          the  first two models. The Eddington ratios suggested by merger
          simulations  predicts  no  turn-off of the faint end of the AGN
          optical  luminosity function at redshifts z>=1 down to very low
          luminosity.

          Accretion  processes  in quasars and active galactic nuclei are
          still  poorly  understood,  especially as far as the connection
          between observed spectral properties and physical parameters is
          concerned.  Quasars  show  an  additional  degree of complexity
          compared    to   stars   that   is   related   to   anisotropic
          emission/obscuration  influencing  the  observed  properties in
          most  spectral  ranges.  This  complicating factor has hampered
          efforts  to  define  the  equivalent  of  an Hertzsprung-Russel
          diagram for quasars. Even if it has recently become possible to
          estimate  black hole mass and Eddington ratio for sources using
          optical  and  UV  broad  emission  lines, the results are still
          plagued by large uncertainties. Nevertheless, robust trends are
          emerging  from multivariate analysis of large spectral datasets
          of  quasars.  A  firm  observational basis is being laid out by
          accurate   measurements   of  broad  emission  line  properties
          especially when the source rest-frame is known. We consider the
          most   widely   discussed   correlations  (i.e.  the  so-called
          "eigenvector  1  parameter space" and the "Baldwin effect") and
          analyze  how  they  can  be  explained  in  terms  of accretion
          properties,  broad line region structure, and source evolution.
          We  critically  review  recent  estimates  of  black hole mass,
          accretion  rate,  spin  and  possible  orientation  indicators,
          stressing that any improvement in these parameters will provide
          a  much better understanding of the physics and dynamics of the
          region  producing the optical and UV broad emission lines. More
          accurate  measurements  of  Eddington ratio and black hole mass
          may  have  a significant impact on our ideas about evolution of
          quasar  properties  with  redshift and luminosity as well as on
          broader cosmological issues.

          Title: Mass Accretion onto T Tauri Stars
          Authors: S. G. Gregory, M. Jardine, I. Simpson, J.-F. Donati
          Comments:  17  pages,  10  figures, accepted for publication by
          MNRAS
          It  is now accepted that accretion onto classical T Tauri stars
          is  controlled  by  the stellar magnetosphere, yet to date most
          accretion  models  have  assumed that their magnetic fields are
          dipolar.  By  considering a simple steady state accretion model
          with  both  dipolar  and  complex  magnetic  fields  we  find a
          correlation between mass accretion rate and stellar mass of the
          form  $\dot{M}  \propto  M_{\ast}^{\alpha}$,  with  our results
          consistent  within observed scatter. For any particular stellar
          mass there can be several orders of magnitude difference in the
          mass  accretion  rate,  with accretion filling factors of a few
          percent.   We   demonstrate  that  the  field  geometry  has  a
          significant effect in controlling the location and distribution
          of  hot  spots,  formed  on  the  stellar surface from the high
          velocity  impact  of accreting material. We find that hot spots
          are  often  at  mid  to  low  latitudes, in contrast to what is
          expected for accretion to dipolar fields, and that particularly
          for  higher  mass  stars,  the  accretion flow is predominantly
          carried by open field lines.

          25,000  deg^2 to a limiting flux of 3E-11 ergs/cm**2/sec (7,000
          deg^2  to  a flux limit of 1E-11 ergs/cm**2/sec) in the 20 - 40
          keV band with INTEGRAL. We have constructed a detailed exposure
          map  to  compensate  for  effects  of non-uniform exposure. The
          flux-number  relation  is  best described by a power-law with a
          slope  of alpha = 1.66+-0.11. The integration of the cumulative
          flux  per  unit  area  leads  to f = 2.6E-10 ergs/cm**2/sec/sr,
          which is about 1% of the known 20 - 40 keV X-ray background. We
          present  the first luminosity function of AGNs in the 20-40 keV
          energy range, based on 38 extragalactic objects detected by the
          imager  IBIS/ISGRI  on-board  INTEGRAL. The luminosity function
          shows a smoothly connected two power-law form, with an index of
          gamma_1  =  0.8  below,  and  gamma_2 = 2.1 above the turn-over
          luminosity  of  L*  =  2.4E43  ergs/sec.  The emissivity of all
          INTEGRAL  AGNs  per  unit volume is W(> 1E41 ergs/sec) = 2.8E38
          ergs/sec/Mpc**3.   These  results  are  consistent  with  those
          derived  in  the  2  -  20  keV  energy  band and do not show a
          significant  contribution by Compton-thick objects. Because the
          sample  used  in this study is truly local (average z = 0.022),
          only limited conclusions can be drawn for the evolution of AGNs
          in this energy band.

          We  present  a  satellite  mission  concept to measure the dark
          energy   equation  of  state  parameter  w  with  percent-level
          precision.  The  Very  Ambitious Dark Energy Research satellite
          (VADER)  is  a  multi-wavelength  survey mission joining X-ray,
          optical,   and  IR  instruments  for  a  simultaneous  spectral
          coverage  from  4microns  (0.3eV) to 10keV over a field of view
          (FoV)  of 1 square degree. VADER combines several clean methods
          for  dark energy studies, the baryonic acoustic oscillations in
          the  galaxy and galaxy cluster power spectrum and weak lensing,
          for  a  joint  analysis  over  an unrivalled survey volume. The
          payload  consists  of  two  XMM-like  X-ray  telescopes with an
          effective area of 2,800cm^2 at 1.5keV and state-of-the-art wide
          field  DEPFET  pixel  detectors  (0.1-10keV)  in a curved focal
          plane configuration to extend the FoV. The X-ray telescopes are
          complemented  by a 1.5m optical/IR telescope with 8 instruments
          for  simultaneous  coverage  of  the  same  FoV  from  0.3 to 4
          microns.   The  8  dichroic-separated  bands  (u,g,r,z,J,H,K,L)
          provide  accurate  photometric  galaxy  redshifts,  whereas the
          diffraction-limited  resolution  of  the  central z-band allows
          precise shape measurements for cosmic shear analysis.
          The  5  year  VADER  survey will cover a contiguous sky area of
          3,500  square degrees to a depth of z~2 and will yield accurate
          photometric  redshifts  and  multi-wavelength object parameters
          for  about 175,000 galaxy clusters, one billion galaxies, and 5
          million   AGN.   VADER  will  not  only  provide  unprecedented
          constraints on the nature of dark energy, but will additionally
          extend  and  trigger a multitude of cosmic evolution studies to
          very large (>10 Gyrs) look-back times.

          Short-period binaries represent extreme cases in the generation
          of  stellar  coronae  via  a  rotational dynamo. Such stars are
          important  for  probing the origin and nature of coronae in the
          regimes  of  rapid  rotation  and  activity  saturation. VW Cep
          (P=0.28  d)  is  a  relatively bright, partially eclipsing, and
          very  active  object. Light curves made from Chandra/HETGS data
          show  flaring  and  rotational  modulation,  but  no  eclipses.
          Velocity  modulation  of  emission  lines  indicates  that  one
          component dominates the X-ray emission. The emission measure is
          highly  structured,  having  three  peaks.  Helium-like triplet
          lines  give  electron  densities  of  about  3.0E+10 - 18.0E+10
          /cm^3.  We  conclude  that  the  corona is predominantly on the
          polar regions of the primary star and compact.

          We present near-infrared $JHK_s$ photometry and light curves of
          the  candidate  magnetic  white  dwarf+brown  dwarf binary SDSS
          J121209.31+013627.7    and   report   on   the   detection   of
          near-infrared  excess  and  variability  in the $K_s-$band. The
          observed  near-infrared excess can be explained by the presence
          of  an L7 brown dwarf and an extra emission source. The $J$ and
          $H$  light  curves appear flat, which rules out eclipses deeper
          than  0.2  mag and the presence of an accretion hot spot on the
          white  dwarf.  From  the  variable  $K_s$  lightcurve, we get a
          refined period for the system of 88$\pm$1 minutes. We show that
          the  observed  variability  in  $K_s-$band  can be explained by
          cyclotron emission, which can be modeled by a small spot on the
          surface  of the white dwarf. SDSS 1212 exhibits similarities to
          the  ultra-short  period  polar EF Eridani, however the lack of
          evidence for Roche-lobe overflow accretion suggests it may be a
          pre-polar.

          Title:  Spectroscopy  of  Young  Planetary Mass Candidates with
          Disks
          Authors: Ray Jayawardhana, Valentin D. Ivanov
          Comments: to appear in The Astrophysical Journal Letters
          It is now well established that many young brown dwarfs exhibit
          characteristics  similar  to classical T Tauri stars, including
          infrared  excess  from  disks  and  emission  lines  related to
          accretion.  Whether  the  same  holds  true for even lower mass
          objects,  namely  those  near  and  below the Deuterium-burning
          limit,  is  an  important  question.  Here  we  present optical
          spectra of six isolated planetary mass candidates in Chamaeleon
          II,  Lupus  I  and  Ophiuchus  star-forming  regions,  recently
          identified  by  Allers  and collaborators to harbor substantial
          mid-infrared  excesses.  Our  spectra,  from  ESO's  Very Large
          Telescope  and  New Technology Telescope, show that four of the
          targets  have  spectral types in the ~M9-L1 range, and three of
          those  also  exhibit H_alpha. Their luminosities are consistent
          with  masses  of  ~5-15  M_{Jupiter}  according  to  models  of
          Chabrier,  Baraffe  and  co-workers,  thus  placing  these four
          objects  among  the  lowest  mass  brown  dwarfs  known  to  be
          surrounded  by  circum-sub-stellar  disks. Our findings bolster
          the  idea  that free-floating planetary mass objects could have
          infancies  remarkably  similar  to  those of Sun-like stars and
          suggest  the  intriguing possibility of planet formation around
          primaries  whose  masses are comparable to those of extra-solar
          giant planets. Another target appears to be a brown dwarf (~M8)
          with   prominent   H_alpha   emission,  possibly  arising  from
          accretion.  The  sixth candidate is likely a background source,
          underlining the need for spectroscopic confirmation.

          We  present  preliminary  results from the first X-ray gratings
          spectrometer  observations  of a planetary nebula (PN). We have
          used  the  Chandra  X-ray  Observatory  Low Energy Transmission
          Gratings  Spectrometer  (LETGS)  to observe the bright, diffuse
          X-ray  source  within  the  well-studied BD +30 3639. The LETGS
          spectrum  of  BD  +30 3639 displays prominent and well-resolved
          emission  lines  of  H-like  C, O, and Ne and He-like O and Ne.
          Initial  modeling indicates a plasma temperature T_x ~ 2.5x10^6
          K  and  abundance  ratios  of C/O ~ 20, N/O <~ 1, Ne/O ~ 4, and
          Fe/O  <~  0.1.  These  results  suggest that the X-ray-emitting
          plasma  is dominated by the shocked fast wind from the emerging
          PN  core,  where  this  wind  gas  likely  originated  from the
          intershell  region  of  the  progenitor asymptotic giant branch
          star.

          Title: Variability and multi-periodic oscillations in the X-ray
          light curve of the classical nova V4743 Sgr

          Comments: In press in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
          Society
          The  classical  nova V4743 Sgr was observed with XMM-Newton for
          about  10  hours  on  April  4  2003,  6.5 months after optical
          maximum.  At  this  time,  this  nova  had become the brightest
          supersoft X-ray source ever observed. We present the results of
          a  time  series  analysis  performed  on  the X-ray light curve
          obtained  in  this  observation,  and  in  a  previous  shorter
          observation   done   with  Chandra  16  days  earlier.  Intense
          variability,  with amplitude as large as 40% of the total flux,
          was  observed both times. Similarities can be found between the
          two  observations  in  the structure of the variations. Most of
          the  variability  is  well  represented  as  a  combination  of
          oscillations  at  a  set of discrete frequencies lower than 1.7
          mHz.  At  least  five  frequencies are constant over the 16 day
          time  interval  between the two observations. We suggest that a
          periods  in  the  power  spectrum  of  both light curves at the
          frequency of 0.75 mHz and its first harmonic are related to the
          spin  period  of  the white dwarf in the system, and that other
          observed  frequencies  are  signatures of nonradial white dwarf
          pulsations.  A  possible signal with a 24000 sec period is also
          found  in  the  XMM-Newton  light curve: a cycle and a half are
          clearly  identified. This period is consistent with the 24278 s
          periodicity discovered in the optical light curve of the source
          and thought to be the orbital period of the nova binary system.

          Title:  Is  there  a  caustic  crossing  in  the  lensed quasar

          Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, to appear in MNRAS
          We  re-investigate the gravitationally lensed system Q2237+0305
          data  record  to  quantify  the probability of having a caustic
          crossing  in the A component. Several works assume that this is
          the  case,  but  no  quantitative  analysis is available in the
          literature.  We  combine  the  datasets from the OGLE and GLITP
          collaborations  to  accurately trace the prominent event in the
          lightcurve for the A component of the system. Then the observed
          event  is  compared  with  synthetic  light curves derived from
          trajectories  in  magnification  maps. These maps are generated
          using   a   ray-tracing  technique.  We  take  more  than  10^9
          trajectories  and  test  a  wide  range  of  different physical
          properties  of  the  lensing galaxy and the source quasar (lens
          transverse  velocity,  microlens mass, source intensity profile
          and  source  size).  We  found  that  around  75%  of  our good
          trajectories  (i.e.  that are consistent with the observations)
          are  caustic crossings. In addition, a high transverse velocity
          exceeding  300  km/s, a microlens mass of about 0.1 M_sun and a
          small   standard   accretion   disk   is   the  best  parameter
          combination.  The  results  justify  the  interpretation of the
          OGLE-GLITP   event   in  Q2237+0305A  as  a  caustic  crossing.
          Moreover, the physical properties of the lens and source are in
          very  good agreement with previous works. We also remark that a
          standard   accretion   disk   is   prefered  to  those  simpler
          approaches,  and  that  the former should be used in subsequent
          simulations.

          We  investigate in details the kinematics and morphology of the
          Seyfert  galaxy  NGC6104  in order to identify the mechanism of
          gas  transportation  to  the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Our
          observational   data   were   obtained   at   the  6-m  Special
          Astrophysical    Observatory    telescope    with    the   MPFS
          integral-field spectrograph and the SCORPIO universal device in
          three   modes:   direct   imaging,   a   scanning   Fabry-Perot
          interferometer, and long-slit spectroscopy. Images from the HST
          archive   were   invoked   to   study   the  structure  of  the
          circumnuclear  region.  An analysis of deep images has revealed
          that NGC6104 is in the phase of active merging with a companion
          galaxy.  We  have  been  able  to study the detailed picture of
          ionized  gas  motions  up to galactocentric distances of 14 kpc
          and  to  construct  the  stellar  velocity  field for the inner
          region. The radial gas motions toward the AGN along the central
          bar  play a significant role at galactocentric distances of 1-5
          kpc.  In  addition,  we have detected an outflow of ionized gas
          from the nucleus that presumably resulted from the intrusion of
          a  radio  jet  into  the  ambient  interstellar  medium.  Using
          diagnostic diagrams, we estimate the contributions from the AGN
          and  star formation to the galactic gas ionization. We estimate
          the  bar pattern speed by the Tremaine-Weinberg method and show
          that  the  inner  ring  observed  in  the galactic images has a
          resonant  nature. Two possible ring formation scenarios (before
          and during the interaction with a companion) are discussed.

          We  report the serendipitous discovery of the Sloan Digital Sky
          Survey  star,  SDSS  J160043.6+074802.9  to  be  a  very  rapid
          pulsator.  The  variation is dominated by a frequency near 8380
          microHz  (period  = 119.33 s) with a large amplitude (0.04 mag)
          and  its  first harmonic at 16760 microHz (59.66 s; 0.005 mag).
          In  between  these  frequencies,  we  find  at  least another 8
          variations   with  periods  between  62  and  118  seconds  and
          amplitudes   between   about   0.007   and  0.003  mag;  weaker
          oscillations  might  also  be present. Preliminary spectrograms
          from the performance verification phase of the Southern African
          Large  Telescope  indicate  that  SDSS  J160043.6+074802.9 is a
          spectroscopic  binary consisting of an sdO star and a late-type
          main-sequence  companion.  This  makes it the first unambiguous
          detection  of  such  an  sdO star to pulsate, and certainly the
          first found to exhibit multi-frequency variations.

          remnant RCW 103. No fast pulsations are visible. If genetically
          tied  to  the  supernova remnant, the source could either be an
          X-ray  binary,  comprising a compact object and a low-mass star
          in  an  eccentric  orbit,  or  an isolated neutron star. In the
          latter  case,  its  age-period  combination  would  point  to a
          peculiar  magnetar,  dramatically  slowed-down,  possibly  by a
          supernova  debris  disc.  Both  scenarios  require non-standard
          assumptions  on  the formation and evolution of compact objects
          in supernova explosions.

          Title:  Formation  and  structure  of  the  three  Neptune-mass
          planets system around HD69830

          Since the discovery of the first giant planet outside the solar
          system  in 1995 (Mayor & Queloz 1995), more than 180 extrasolar
          planets   have   been   discovered.  With  improving  detection
          capabilities,  a  new  class  of planets with masses 5-20 times
          larger than the Earth, at close distance from their parent star
          is  rapidly  emerging.  Recently,  the  first  system  of three
          Neptune-mass  planets has been discovered around the solar type
          star  HD69830 (Lovis et al. 2006). Here, we present and discuss
          a  possible  formation scenario for this planetary system based
          on  a  consistent  coupling between the extended core accretion
          model and evolutionary models (Alibert et al. 2005a, Baraffe et
          al.  2004,2006).  We show that the innermost planet formed from
          an  embryo  having  started  inside  the  iceline  is  composed
          essentially  of  a  rocky  core  surrounded  by  a tiny gaseous
          envelope.  The  two  outermost  planets started their formation
          beyond the iceline and, as a consequence, accrete a substantial
          amount  of  water  ice during their formation. We calculate the
          present  day thermodynamical conditions inside these two latter
          planets  and show that they are made of a rocky core surrounded
          by a shell of fluid water and a gaseous envelope.

          Title:  Modelling  spectral  line  profiles  of wind-wind shock
          emissions from massive binary systems
          Authors:  D. Falceta-Goncalves (IAG/USP), Z. Abraham (IAG/USP),
          V. Jatenco-Pereira (IAG/USP)
          Comments: To appear in the MNRAS
          One of the most intriguing spectral features of WR binary stars
          is  the  presence  of  time-dependent  line profiles. Long term
          observations  of  several  systems  revealed the periodicity of
          this  variability,  synchronized  with  the  orbital  movement.
          Several  partially  successful  models  have  been  proposed to
          reproduce the observed data. The most promising assume that the
          origin  of  the  emission is the wind-wind interaction zone. In
          this  scenario,  two  high  velocity  and dense winds produce a
          strong shock layer, responsible for most of the X-rays observed
          from  these  systems.  As  the  secondary  star moves along its
          orbital  path,  the  shock region of conical shape, changes its
          position  with relation to the line of sight. As a consequence,
          the  stream  measured  Doppler  shift  presents time variations
          resulting  in  position  changes  of  the spectral line. In our
          work,  we  present an alternative model, introducing turbulence
          in  the  shock  layer  to  account  for the line broadening and
          opacity  effects  for  the  asymmetry  in the line profiles. We
          showed   that   the  gas  turbulence  avoids  the  need  of  an
          unnaturally  large  contact  layer  thickness to reproduce line
          broadening. Also, we demonstrated that if the emission from the
          opposing  cone  surface  is  absorbed,  the  result is a single
          peaked  profile.  This  result  fully satisfies the recent data
          obtained  from  massive  binary  systems,  and  can help on the
          determination   of   both  winds  and  orbital  parameters.  We
          successfully   applied  this  model  to  the  Br22  system  and
          determined its orbital parameters.

          We present the results of XMM-Newton observations of two AM CVn
          systems - V396 Hya and SDSS J1240-01. Both systems are detected
          in  X-rays and in the UV: neither shows coherent variability in
          their light curves. We compare the rms variability of the X-ray
          and  UV  power  spectra  of  these  sources  with  other AM CVn
          systems.  Apart  from  ES  Cet, AM CVn sources are not strongly
          variable  in  X-rays, while in the UV the degree of variability
          is  related  to  the  systems  apparent  brightness.  The X-ray
          spectra  of  V396  Hya  and SDSS J1240-01 show highly non-solar
          abundances, requiring enhanced nitrogen to obtain good fits. We
          compare  the  UV  and  X-ray  luminosities for 7 AM CVn systems
          using  recent  distances.  We find that the X-ray luminosity is
          not  strongly  dependent  upon  orbital period. However, the UV
          luminosity is highly correlated with orbital period with the UV
          luminosity decreasing with increasing orbital period. We expect
          that  this  is due to the accretion disk making an increasingly
          strong  contribution to the UV emission at shorter periods. The
          implied  luminosities  are  in  remarkably  good agreement with
          predictions.

          least  300 observation points we have found an angular velocity
          $\omega$   and   its   time   derivative  $\frac{d\omega}{dt}$.
          According  to  our  accuracy  there is no evidence that average

          stars are presented.

          We  present  analysis  of  extensive monitoring of SS433 by the
          RXTE  observatory  collected  over  the  period  1996-2005. The
          difference   between   energy   spectra   taken   at  different
          precessional  and orbital phases shows the presence of a strong
          photoabsorption  near  the  optical  star,  probably due to its
          powerful  dense wind. Assuming that a precessing accretion disk
          is  thick,  we  recover  the  temperature  profile in the X-ray
          emitting   jet   that   best  fits  the  observed  precessional
          variations  of  the  X-ray  emission  temperature.  The hottest
          visible  part  of  the  X-ray  jet  is located at a distance of
          $l_0/a\sim0.06-0.09$,   or  $\sim2-3\times10^{11}$cm  from  the
          central  compact  object and has a temperature of about $T_{\rm
          max}\sim30$   keV.  We  discovered  appreciable  orbital  X-ray
          eclipses  at the ``crossover'' precessional phases (jets are in
          the  plane of the sky, disk is edge-on) which put a lower limit
          on  the  size of the optical component $R/a\ga0.5$ and an upper
          limit  on a mass ratio of binary companions $q=M_{\rm x}/M_{\rm
          opt}\la0.3-0.35$.  The  size  of  the  eclipsing  region can be
          larger  than  secondary's  Roche  lobe  because  of substantial
          photoabsorption  by dense stellar wind. This must be taken into
          account  when  evaluating the mass ratio from analysis of X-ray
          eclipses.

          We  investigate  spherical  accretion  to a rotating magnetized
          star  in  the  "propeller"  regime using axisymmetric resistive
          magnetohydrodynamic  simulations.  The  regime  is predicted to
          occur   if   the  magnetospheric  radius  is  larger  than  the
          corotation  radius  and smaller than the light cylinder radius.
          The simulations show that accreting matter is expelled from the
          equatorial  region  of the magnetosphere and that it moves away
          from  the  star in a supersonic, disk-shaped outflow. At larger
          radial  distances  the outflow slows down and becomes subsonic.
          The  equatorial  matter  outflow  is  initially  driven  by the
          centrifugal   force,  but  at  larger  distances  the  pressure
          gradient force becomes significant. We find the fraction of the
          Bondi accretion rate which accretes to the surface of the star.

          Title: 3.9 day orbital modulation in the TeV gamma-ray flux and
          spectrum from the X-ray binary LS 5039

          Astrophysics
          New   observations  of  LS  5039,  a  High  Mass  X-ray  Binary
          comprising  a massive star and compact object, were carried out
          with   the   High   Energy  Stereoscopic  System  of  Cherenkov
          Telescopes  (H.E.S.S.)  in  2005  at  very  high  energy  (VHE)
          gamma-ray energies. These observations reveal that its flux and
          energy  spectrum  are modulated with the 3.9 day orbital period
          of  the  binary  system.  This  is  the first time in gamma-ray
          astronomy  that  orbital  modulation  has  been  observed,  and
          periodicity  clearly  established  using ground-based gamma-ray
          detectors.  The  VHE  gamma-ray emission is largely confined to
          half  of  the  orbit,  peaking  around the inferior conjunction
          epoch  of  the  compact object. For this epoch, there is also a
          hardening  of  the  energy spectrum in the energy range between
          0.2  TeV  and  a  few  TeV.  The flux vs. orbital phase profile
          provides the first clear indication of gamma-ray absorption via
          pair production within an astrophysical source, a process which
          is  expected  to  occur  if  the  gamma-ray  production site is
          situated  within  ~1  AU  of  the  compact object. Moreover the
          production  region  size must be not significantly greater than
          the  binary  separation  (~0.15 AU). Notably, these constraints
          are  also  considerably smaller than the collimated outflows or
          jets  (extending  out  to  ~1000  AU)  observed in LS 5039. The
          spectral  hardening  could  arise from variations with phase in
          the   maximum   electron  energies,  and/or  the  dominant  VHE
          gamma-ray production mechanism.

          Title:   Are  Diffuse  High  Energy  Neutrinos  from  Starburst
          Galaxies Observable?
          Authors: F.W. Stecker (NASA/GSFC)
          Comments: 5 pages
          Loeb and Waxman have argued that high energy neutrinos from the
          decay  of  pions  produced  in interactions of cosmic rays with
          interstellar gas in starburst galaxies would be produced with a
          large  enough  flux to be observable. Their model is reexamined
          here  and it is shown that the the neutrino flux from starburst
          galaxies,  even  given the various assumptions made by them, is
          more  than an order of magnitude lower than the flux which they
          predict.  The  predicted  neutrino  flux  would  be  below  the
          atmospheric  neutrino foreground flux at energies below 300 TeV
          and   therefore  would  be  unobservable.  PeV  neutrinos  from
          starburst  galaxies  are also unlikely to be detected. Compared
          with  predicted  fluxes  from  other  extragalactic high energy
          neutrino  sources,  PeV  starburst  neutrinos would have a flux
          considerably below that predicted for AGN models.

          Title:    Planetesimal    formation    via   fragmentation   in
          self-gravitating protoplanetary discs

          Comments: 5 pages, Accepted for publication in MNRAS
          An  unsolved  issue  in  the  standard core accretion model for
          gaseous  planet  formation is how kilometre-sized planetesimals
          form  from,  initially,  micron-sized dust grains. Solid growth
          beyond  metre  sizes can be difficult both because the sticking
          efficiency  becomes  very  small,  and  because these particles
          should  rapidly migrate into the central star. We consider here
          how  metre-sized particles evolve in self-gravitating accretion
          discs using simulations in which the gravitational influence of
          the  solid  particles  is  also included. Metre-sized particles
          become  strongly  concentrated in the spiral structures present
          in  the  disc  and,  if  the  solid  to  gas  density  ratio is
          sufficiently  high,  can fragment due to their own self-gravity
          to  form  planetesimals  directly.  This  result  suggests that
          planetesimal  formation  may  occur  very  early  in  the  star
          formation  process  while  discs are still massive enough to be
          self-gravitating. The dependence of this process on the surface
          density  of  the solids is also consistent with the observation
          that  extrasolar  planets  are preferentially found around high
          metallicity stars.

          We  discuss  the  relationship  between  rest-frame  color  and
          optical  luminosity  for  X-ray  sources in the range 0.6<z<1.4
          selected  from  the  Chandra survey of the Extended Groth Strip
          (EGS).  These  objects  are  almost exclusively active galactic
          nuclei  (AGN).  While  there  are a few luminous QSOs, most are
          relatively  weak or obscured AGN whose optical colors should be
          dominated  by host galaxy light. The vast majority of AGN hosts
          at z~1 are luminous and red, with very few objects fainter than
          M_{B}=-20.5  or  bluer  than  U-B=0.6. This places the AGN in a
          distinct   region   of  color-magnitude  space,  on  the  ``red
          sequence''  or  at  the top of the ``blue cloud'', with many in
          between  these  two  modes  in galaxy color. A key stage in the
          evolution  of  massive  galaxies  is  when  star  formation  is
          quenched,  resulting  in a migration from the blue cloud to the
          red  sequence.  Our  results  are  consistent with scenarios in
          which  AGN  either  cause or maintain this quenching. The large
          numbers  of  red  sequence  AGN imply that strong, ongoing star
          formation  is  not  a necessary ingredient for AGN activity, as
          black  hole  accretion  appears  often  to  persist  after star
          formation has been terminated.

          SFRD,  rises  by  at  least  ~10x  from z=0-1, although we note
          highly  discrepant  UV-  and  radio-based  SFR  estimates.  Our
          radio-based  SFRs  become  more  difficult  to interpret at z>1
          where   correcting   for  contamination  by  radio-loud  active
          galactic  nuclei (AGN) comes at the price of rejecting luminous
          starbursts. Whilst stacking radio images is a useful technique,
          accurate  radio-based  SFRs  for  z>>1 galaxies require precise
          redshifts  and  extraordinarily  high-fidelity  radio  data  to
          identify and remove accretion-related emission.

          Using  data  from  the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey and HST/ACS
          imaging  in  the  Extended  Groth  Strip,  we select nearly 100
          interacting  galaxy systems including kinematic close pairs and
          morphologically-identified  merging  galaxies.  Spitzer MIPS 24
          micron  fluxes  of these systems reflect the current dusty star
          formation  activity,  and  at  fixed  stellar  mass (M_{*}) the
          median  infrared luminosity (L_{IR}) among merging galaxies and
          close  pairs  of  blue  galaxies is twice (1.9 +/- 0.4) that of
          control  pairs  drawn  from isolated blue galaxies. Enhancement
          declines with galaxy separation, being strongest in close pairs
          and  mergers  and  weaker in wide pairs compared to the control
          sample.  At  z  ~  0.9,  7.1  +/-  4.3 % of massive interacting
          galaxies  (M_{*} > 2*10^{10} M_{solar}) are found to be ULIRGs,
          compared  to  2.6  +/-  0.7  % in the control sample. The large
          spread of IR luminosity to stellar mass ratio among interacting
          galaxies  suggests  that  this  enhancement  may  depend on the
          merger  stage  as  well  as  other  as yet unidentified factors
          (e.g.,  galaxy  structure, mass ratio, orbital characteristics,
          presence  of  AGN  or  bar).  The  contribution  of interacting
          systems  to  the total IR luminosity density is moderate (<= 36
          %).

          We  explore  the  environment  of  z~1 AGN using a sample of 53
          spectroscopically    identified    X-ray    sources    in   the
          All-wavelength  Extended  Groth  strip International Survey. We
          quantify  the  local density in the vicinity of an X-ray source
          by measuring the projected surface density of spectroscopically
          identified  optical galaxies within a radius defined by the 3rd
          nearest  neighbour.  Our main result is that X-ray selected AGN
          at z~1 avoid underdense regions at the 99.89% confidence level.
          Moreover,  although  we find that the overall population shares
          the  same  (rich)  environment with optical galaxies of similar
          U-B  and  M_B,  there is also tentative evidence (96%) that AGN
          with blue colors (U-B<1) reside in denser environments compared
          to  optical  galaxies.  We  argue  that the results above are a
          consequence  of the whereabouts of massive galaxies, capable of
          hosting   supermassive  black  holes  at  their  centers,  with
          available  cold  gas  reservoirs, the fuel for AGN activity. At
          z~1  an  increasing fraction of such systems are found in dense
          regions.

          We  present  deep  Hubble  Space  Telescope Advanced Camera for
          Surveys  / High Resolution Channel U, narrow-V, and I images of
          nine  "ultracompact"  blue dwarf galaxies (UCBDs) selected from
          the  Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey. We define UCBDs as local (z <
          0.01)  star-forming  galaxies having angular diameters < 6" and
          physical sizes < 1 kpc. They are also among the most metal-poor
          galaxies  known, and are found to reside within voids. Both the
          HST  images  and  the objects' optical spectra reveal that they
          are  composites  of  young  (~1  Myr) populations that dominate
          their  light,  and  older  (~10  Gyr) populations that dominate
          their  stellar  masses,  which  we  estimate to be ~10^7 - 10^8
          Msol.  An intermediate-age population is also indicated in most
          cases.  The  objects  are  not  as dynamically disturbed as the
          prototype  UCBD,  POX 186, but the structure of several of them
          suggests  that  their current starbursts have been triggered by
          the collisions/mergers of smaller clumps of stars. In one case,
          HS  0822+3542,  the  ACS/HRC images resolve the object into two
          small  (~100  pc)  components  which  appear  to  have recently
          collided, supporting this interpretation. In six of the objects
          much  of  their star formation is concentrated in Young Massive
          Star clusters. The evidence that the galaxies consist mainly of
          ~10  Gyr old stars establishes that they are not protogalaxies;
          their low metallicities are more likely to be the result of the
          escape  of supernova ejecta, as opposed to youth. These results
          are  consistent  with recent galaxy formation simulations which
          predict  that  cosmic  re-ionization  at  z  ~  6 significantly
          limited  the  subsequent  star  formation  of dwarf galaxies in
          voids  due  to the photo-evaporation of baryons from their cold
          dark matter halos (Abridged).

          Title:  Local hydrodynamics and operator stability of Keplerian
          accretion disks
          Authors: Peter Todd Williams
          Comments:  Old (October 2000) manuscript submitted to ApJL. See
          discussion in postscript. Posted for archival purposes only
          We  discuss non-self-gravitating hydrodynamic disks in the thin
          disk  limit. These systems are stable according to the Rayleigh
          criterion,  and yet there is some evidence that the dissipative
          and  transport  processes  in  these  disks are hydrodynamic in
          nature at least some of the time. We draw on recent work on the
          hydrodynamics  of  laboratory shear flows. Such flows are often
          experimentally  unstable  even  in  the  absence  of  a  linear
          instability.  The transition to turbulence in these systems, as
          well  as  the  large  linear transient amplification of initial
          disturbances,  may  depend  upon the non-self-adjoint nature of
          the  differential  operator  that  describes  the  dynamics  of
          perturbations  to  the  background  state.  We  find that small
          initial  perturbations  can  produce  large growth in accretion
          disks  in  the  shearing  sheet approximation with shearing box
          boundary   conditions,   despite  the  absence  of  any  linear
          instability.   Furthermore,   the  differential  operator  that
          propagates initial conditions forward in time is asymptotically
          close  (as a function of Reynolds number) to possessing growing
          eigenmodes.  The similarity to the dynamics of laboratory shear
          flows   is   suggestive   that   accretion   disks   might   be
          hydrodynamically   unstable  despite  the  lack  of  any  known
          instability mechanism.

          Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures, accepted by ApJL
          It has been recognized that magnetic reconnection process is of
          great  importance in high-energy astrophysics. We develop a new
          two-dimensional   relativistic   resistive  magnetohydrodynamic
          (R$^2$MHD)   code,  and  carry  out  numerical  simulations  of
          magnetic  reconnection.  We  find that outflow velocity reaches
          Alfv\'{e}n  velocity  in  the  inflow  region,  and that higher
          Alfv\'{e}n  velocity provides higher reconnection rate. We also
          find Lorentz contraction plays an important role in enhancement
          of reconnection rate.

          We     present    photoionization    calculations    for    the
          spatially-extended  absorbers  observed  towards  the  extended
          emission  line  spectrum  of  two high-redshift radio galaxies:
          0943-242  (z=2.922)  and  0200+015  (z=2.230),  with the aim of
          reproducing the absorber column ratio, N(CIV)/N(HI). We explore
          the   effects   of   using   different   UV   continua  in  the
          photoionization calculations. A comparison is drawn between the
          absorber  in  0200+015 and the two absorbers in the lensed Lynx
          Arc  Nebula  at  z=3.36,  which  present  similar  N(CIV)/N(HI)
          ratios.  We find that hot stars from a powerful starburst, or a
          metagalactic background radiation (MBR) in which stars dominate
          over  quasars, are equally successful in producing the observed
          N(CIV)/N(HI),  assuming  subsolar absorber metallicities. These
          softer SEDs eliminate the factor 1000 difference in metallicity
          between  the two absorbers encountered in earlier work assuming
          a  powerlaw  SED.  The  detected  level  of  continuum  flux in
          0943-242  is  consistent with stellar ionization. If the MBR is
          responsible  for  the  ionization of the radio galaxy absorbing
          shells,  their  radii (if spherical) would be large (> 100 kpc)
          and  their  mass  would  be huge (>1E12 M_Sun), implying that a
          feedback   event  within  the  radiogalaxy  has  expelled  more
          baryonic  material  than left within it. If, as we believe more
          likely,  stellar sources within the radiogalaxy are responsible
          for  the  absorber's  ionization,  smaller radii of ~25 kpc and
          much smaller masses (~1E8-1E10 M_Sun) are inferred. This radius
          is consistent with the observed transition in radio source size
          between  smaller  sources  where strong HI absorption is almost
          ubiquitous,  and the larger sources where it is mostly lacking.
          Finally,  we  outline  additional  absorption  line diagnostics
          which  could further constrain the properties of the haloes and
          their ionization sources.

          measurement
          Authors:  Shay  Zucker,  Tsevi  Mazeh (Tel Aviv University, Tel
          Aviv, Israel)
          Comments:  6  pages,  11  figures,  to  be published in Monthly
          Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
          We  propose  a  new  approach  to  measure  differential radial
          velocities, mainly for single-lined spectroscopic binaries. The
          proposed  procedure  -  TIRAVEL  (Template  Independent  RAdial
          VELocities)  - does not rely on a prior theoretical or observed
          template,  but  instead  looks  for  a  set of relative Doppler
          shifts  that  simultaneously optimizes the alignment of all the
          observed  spectra. We suggest a simple measure to quantify this
          overall  alignment  and use its maximum to measure the relative
          radial  velocities. As a demonstration, we apply TIRAVEL to the
          observed  spectra  of  three  known spectroscopic binaries, and
          show that in two cases TIRAVEL performs as good as the commonly
          used  approach,  while  in  one  case  TIRAVEL yielded a better
          orbital solution.

          Title: PVLAS Experiment: Some Astrophysical Consequences

          The   birefringent   effects   of   photon-pseudoscalar   boson
          (Goldstone) particle mixing in intergalactic magnetic field are
          calculated  for cosmological objects. We use the recent results
          of  PVLAS  collaboration that reported recently the observation
          of  a  rotation  of the polarization plane of light propagating
          through  a transverse static magnetic field. Such results which
          were  interpretated as arising due to conversion of photon into
          pseudoscalar  with  coupling  strength $g_{a\gamma}\sim 4\times
          10^{-6}  GeV^{-1}$  allows  us  to  estimate  the intergalactic
          magnetic   field  magnitude  as  $\sim  10^{-16}  G$  based  on
          Hatsemekers  et al. observations of extreme-scale alignments of
          quasar  polarization  vectors. We have analyzed some additional
          results of astronomical observations that could be explained by
          axion  interpretation  of the PVLAS data: a sharp steepening of
          the  QSO  continuum  short  ward  of $\simeq 1100$\AA, observed
          circular  polarization  of  AGNs  and QSOs, discrepancy between
          observed  intrinsic  polarization  of stars in the Local Bubble
          and  stellar spectral classification. The observed polarization
          of stars in the Local Bubble can't be explained by interstellar
          origin.

          We  consider  the production of positrons in microquasars, i.e.
          X-ray  binary  systems  that  exhibit  jets frequently, but not
          continuously.  We  estimate the production rate of positrons in
          microquasars,  both  by simple energy considerations and in the
          framework  of  various  proposed  models.  We then evaluate the
          collective emissivity of the annihilation radiation produced by
          Galactic  microquasars  and  we find that it might constitute a
          substantial  contribution  to the annihilation flux measured by
          INTEGRAL/SPI. We also discuss the possible spatial distribution
          of   Galactic  microquasars,  on  the  basis  of  the  (scarce)
          available  data  and  the  resulting  morphology  of  the  flux
          received  on  Earth.  Finally,  we consider nearby 'misaligned'
          microquasars,  with jets occasionally hitting the atmosphere of
          the  companion  star;  these  would represent interesting point
          sources,  for  which we determine the annihilation flux and the
          corresponding  light  curve,  as  well  as  the line's spectral
          profile.  We discuss the possibility of detection of such point
          sources by future instruments.

          The  results  of  27  hours  of  time series photometry of SDSS
          121209.31+013627.7 are presented. The binary period established
          from spectroscopy is confirmed and refined to 0.061412 d (88.43
          minutes).   The  photometric  variations  are  dominated  by  a
          brightening of about 16 mmag, lasting a little less than half a
          binary  cycle.  The amplitude is approximately the same in V, R
          and  white  light. A secondary small brightness increase during
          each  cycle  may  also  be  present.  We  speculate  that  SDSS
          121209.31+013627.7 may be a polar in a low state.

          interpretation  of  the  central  soft  X-ray excess and WMAP's
          non-detection of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect
          Authors: Richard Lieu, John Quenby
          Comments: ApJ submitted
          WMAP's  first  year  non-detection  of  the  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
          effect  (SZE)  among  a  sample  of  31  rich Abell clusters is
          interpreted  in  terms  of  conventional physics. It is already
          widely  believed  that  the  central soft X-ray excess found in
          some clusters cannot be of thermal origin, due to problems with
          rapid   gas   cooling,   but  may  arise  from  inverse-Compton
          scattering  between intracluster relativistic electrons and the
          cosmic  microwave background. We demonstrate that higher energy
          electrons  drawn  from  the  same  power-law  spectrum  as that
          responsible for the soft excess may also synchrotron radiate in
          the  intracluster  magnetic  field  of  strength  B  $\lesssim$
          1~$\mu$G  to  produce  cluster  microwave emissions in the WMAP
          passbands  that  account  for the missing SZE flux. There is in
          fact  no  significant  discrepancy between the model parameters
          that   account  for  either  phenomena.  This  strengthens  the
          likelihood  of  prevailing  non-thermal  activities in at least
          some  clusters.  The  key  point  is that by merely invoking an
          intracluster   population   of  cosmic  rays  having  the  same
          properties  as  those  of our Galaxy, the microwave synchrotron
          flux  is  already within a factor of five from the expected SZE
          flux.  The electrons may originate from AGN jet injection, then
          distributed  cluster-wide with accompanying {\it in situ} Fermi
          acceleration, by Alfven waves.

          Despite  the  common  picture  of an early-type dwarf (dE) as a
          quiescent  galaxy  with  no  star  formation and little gas, we
          identify  23 dEs that have blue central colors caused by recent
          or  ongoing  star  formation in our sample of 476 Virgo cluster
          dEs.  In  addition,  14  objects that were mostly classified as
          (candidate)  BCDs  have  similar  properties. Among the certain
          cluster  members, the dEs with blue centers reach a fraction of
          more  than  15%  of  the  dE  population  at  brighter  (B<=16)
          magnitudes.  A  spectral analysis of the centers of 16 galaxies
          reveals   in  all  cases  an  underlying  old  population  that
          dominates  the  mass,  with M(old)>=90% for all but one object.
          Therefore  the  majority  of  these  galaxies  will appear like
          ordinary  dEs  within  ~one  Gigayear  or  less  after the last
          episode  of  star  formation. Their overall gas content is less
          than  that of dwarf irregular galaxies, but higher than that of
          ordinary  dEs. Their flattening distribution suggests the shape
          of  a  thick  disk, similar to what has been found for dEs with
          disk  features  in  Paper  I  of  this  series. Their projected
          spatial  distribution  shows  no  central clustering, and their
          distribution  with  projected  local  density  follows  that of
          irregular galaxies, indicative of an unrelaxed population. This
          is  corroborated by their velocity distribution, which displays
          two  side  peaks  characteristic  of  recent infall. We discuss
          possible  formation mechanisms (ram-pressure stripping, tidally
          induced  star  formation,  harassment)  that  might  be able to
          explain  both  the disk shape and the central star formation of
          the dEs with blue centers.

          Title:  Spontaneous  axisymmetry  breaking of Saturn's external
          magnetic field
          Authors: Peter Goldreich, Alison J. Farmer
          Comments: 24 pages, 2 figures, submitted to JGRA
          Saturn's  magnetic field is remarkably axisymmetric. Its dipole
          axis  is  inclined  by  less  than  0.2 deg with respect to its
          rotation axis. Rotationally driven convection of magnetospheric
          plasma  breaks  the axisymmetry of its external magnetic field.
          Field  aligned  currents  transfer  angular  momentum  from the
          planet  to  a  tongue of outflowing plasma. This transfer slows
          the  rate of rotation of the ionosphere relative to that of the
          underlying  atmosphere.  The  currents  are  the source for the
          non-axisymmetric  components  of the field. The common rotation
          rates  of  these components and Saturn's kilometric radio (SKR)
          bursts  is  that of the plasma near the orbit of Enceladus, and
          by  extension the rotation rate in the ionosphere to which this
          plasma  is  coupled.  That  rate  tells  us  nothing  about the
          rotation  rate  of  Saturn's  deep  interior. Of that we remain
          ignorant.  Magnetic  perturbations  with  magnitudes similar to
          those  observed  by Cassini are produced for Mdot ~ 10^4 g/s, a
          value similar to estimates for the rate of production of plasma
          from Saturn's E-ring. Enhancement of the SKR occurs in a narrow
          range of longitudes where the tip of the outgoing plasma stream
          connects  to  the  auroral  ionosphere via field lines that are
          bowed outwards by currents that supply the plasma's centripetal
          acceleration. (abridged)

          maps,  optical  spectroscopy,  and Hubble Space Telescope/Space
          Telescope  Imaging Spectrograph ultraviolet spectroscopy of the
          QSO/galaxy pair SBS 1122+594/IC 691. The QSO sight line lies at
          a  position  angle  of  27  degrees  from the minor axis of the
          nearby  dwarf  starburst  galaxy IC 691 (cz_gal = 1204+-3 km/s,
          L_B  ~  0.09  L*, current star formation rate = 0.08-0.24 solar
          masses  per  year) and 33 kpc (6.6 arcmin) from its nucleus. We
          find  that  IC  691 has an H I mass of M_HI = (3.6+-0.1) x 10^8
          solar masses and a dynamical mass of M_dyn = (3.1+-0.5) x 10^10
          solar   masses.  The  UV  spectrum  of  SBS  1122+594  shows  a
          metal-line  (Ly-alpha  + C IV) absorber near the redshift of IC
          691  at  cz_abs  =  1110+-30  km/s.  Since  IC  691  is a dwarf
          starburst  and the SBS 1122+594 sight line lies in the expected
          location for an outflowing wind, we propose that the best model
          for producing this metal-line absorber is a starburst wind from
          IC  691.  We  place  consistent  metallicity  limits  on IC 691
          ([Z/Zsun]  ~  -0.7)  and  the  metal-line  absorber ([Z/Zsun] <
          -0.3).  We  also  find that the galaxy's escape velocity at the
          absorber  location  is  v_esc  =  80+-10 km/s and derive a wind
          velocity  of  v_w  =  160+-50 km/s. Thus, the evidence suggests
          that  IC  691  produces  an unbound starburst wind that escapes
          from its gravitational potential to transport metals and energy
          to the surrounding intergalactic medium.

          Title:   Optical   Intensity  Interferometry  with  Atmospheric
          Cherenkov Telescope Arrays
          Authors: S. Le Bohec, J. Holder
          Comments: Accepted for publicaion in ApJ
          In the 1970s, the Narrabri intensity interferometer was used to
          measure   32   stellar   diameters;   some   as  small  as  0.4
          milli-arc-seconds (mas). The interferometer consisted of a pair
          of  6.5m  telescopes  with  relatively crude optics, similar to
          those  currently  in  use  as  Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
          (ACT).  We  explore  the  possibility  of implementing a modern
          intensity  interferometer on an ACT array. Developments in fast
          digital  signal  processing  technology  now make such a system
          relatively easy to implement, and provide improved sensitivity.
          Allowing  measurements  at short wavelength (<400nm), with long
          baselines  (>  100m), which are still challenging for Michelson
          interferometers,  present  ACT  arrays  could  be used to probe
          angular  structures as small as ~0.2mas, and smaller with large
          array  projects  already  being  discussed.  This would provide
          measurements    of    stellar    diameters,   binary   systems,
          circumstellar   environments  and,  possibly,  stellar  surface
          features. ACT arrays could be used as intensity interferometers
          during  bright  moon  periods,  providing  valuable  scientific
          output  for  little  expense  and  no  impact  on the gamma-ray
          observing schedule.

          (Vol. 58, No. 5, 2006 Oct 25 issue)
          We  present  ground-based infrared K- (2-2.5 micron) and L-band
          (2.8-4.1  micron)  spectroscopy,  as  well  as  interferometric
          observations  at 3mm, for the individual merging components (A,
          B,  and  C)  of  the  luminous  infrared  galaxy  Arp  299.  We
          investigate  the  presence  and location of the putative buried
          active  galactic  nucleus  (AGN)  inferred  from previous X-ray
          observations  at E > 10 keV. Our sub-arcsec-resolution infrared
          spectra  clearly reveal that the putative buried AGN resides in
          the  nucleus  B1  (a  subcomponent  of  B), based on a very low
          equivalent  width of 3.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
          emission,  a weak 2.3 micron CO absorption feature, and a large
          time  variation  of  the  K-  and  L-band  continuum fluxes. In
          component  C, we find strong 3.1 micron ice absorption at L and
          weak  2.3  micron  CO  absorption at K, as expected in a buried
          AGN; however, a centrally concentrated young super star cluster
          is  an  alternative  possibility because of the modest infrared
          luminosity and non-galaxy-nucleus nature of this component. The
          infrared  K-  and  L-band  spectra  of  the  infrared brightest
          nucleus,  A, are typical of a normal starburst with no explicit
          AGN signatures. Our interferometric observations simultaneously
          obtain  HCN  (J=1-0)  and  HCO+  (J=1-0)  emission lines with 4
          arcsec    resolution,   and   we   find   the   HCN   to   HCO+
          brightness-temperature  ratios  to  be as low as those found in
          starburst  nuclei  in  all  the major merging components of Arp
          299. The low ratio even in the AGN-hosting nucleus B may be due
          to the presence of a large amount of high-density molecular gas
          whose  chemistry  is  dominated by coexisting starbursts and/or
          shocks, rather than by the central strong X-ray-emitting AGN.

          Title: Neutron star binaries and long duration gamma-ray bursts
          Authors: Andrew J. Levan, Melvyn B. Davies, Andrew R. King
          Comments: 7 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS
          Cosmological long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are thought
          to  originate from the core collapse to black holes of stripped
          massive   stars.   Those   with   sufficient  rotation  form  a
          centrifugally-supported torus whose collapse powers the GRB. We
          investigate  the role of tidal locking within a tight binary as
          a  source  of  the necessary angular momentum. We find that the
          binary  orbit  must  be  no  wider than a few solar radii for a
          torus  to  form upon core collapse. Comparing this criterion to
          the  observed  population  of  binaries  containing two compact
          objects  suggests  that rotation may have been important in the
          formation  of  up  to  50%  of  the  observed systems. As these
          systems  created  a  neutron  star  and  not  a black hole they
          presumably  did  not  produce  highly luminous GRBs. We suggest
          instead  that  they  make  the subset of GRBs in the relatively
          local universe which have much lower luminosity.

          We  have carried out a sensitive high-resolution imaging survey
          of stars in the young (6-8 Myr), nearby (97 pc) compact cluster
          around  eta Chamaeleontis to search for stellar and sub-stellar
          companions.  Given  its  youth  and  proximity, any sub-stellar
          companions  are expected to be luminous, especially in the near
          infrared, and thus easier to detect next to their parent stars.
          Here,   we   present  VLT/NACO  adaptive  optics  imaging  with
          companion  detection limits for 17 eta Cha cluster members, and
          follow-up  VLT/ISAAC  near-infrared  spectroscopy for companion
          candidates.  The widest binary detected is ~0.2", corresponding
          to  the  projected  separation  20 AU, despite our survey being
          sensitive  down  to  sub-stellar  companions  outside 0.3", and
          planetary  mass  objects  outside  0.5".  This implies that the
          stellar  companion probability outside 0.3" and the brown dwarf
          companion  probability outside 0.5" are less than 0.16 with 95%
          confidence.  We compare the wide binary frequency of eta Cha to
          that  of the similarly aged TW Hydrae association, and estimate
          the  statistical likelihood that the wide binary probability is
          equal  in  both  groups  to  be < 2e-4. Even though the eta Cha
          cluster  is relatively dense, stellar encounters in its present
          configuration  cannot  account for the relative deficit of wide
          binaries.  We  thus conclude that the difference in wide binary
          probability  in  these  two groups provides strong evidence for
          multiplicity  properties being dependent on environment. In two
          appendices  we  derive  the  projected  separation  probability
          distribution   for   binaries,   used   to  constrain  physical
          separations  from observed projected separations, and summarize
          statistical tools useful for multiplicity studies.

          We  report  the discovery of an eclipsing X-ray binary in M101,
          the first such system to be discovered outside the Local Group.
          Based  on  a  sequence of 25 Chandra observations that sample a
          wide  range of orbital phases, we find a period of 32.688 $\pm$
          0.002  hours,  which  we  interpret  as  an orbital period. The
          folded  light  curve exhibits an eclipse lasting about 8 hours,
          suggesting  a compact orbit in an nearly edge-on configuration.
          The  X-ray  binary has an average luminosity of $L_X(0.3-8 {\rm
          keV})  \approx  1.3\times10^{38}$ erg/sec, with only one out of
          the  25  observations  significantly  lower  in  flux  than the
          average  light curve.The presence of the eclipse and the $\sim$
          1.4-day  orbital  period suggests that this source is an analog
          of  the  well studied eclipsing X-ray binary pulsars Her X-1 or
          LMC X-4. Combining the Chandra data and the HST ACS/WFC images,
          we  have  identified  several  possible  optical  counterparts,
          including  an  O5-O3  star  with  V  =  25.0. Follow-up optical
          monitoring  observations  should  be able to identify the donor
          and further constrain the orbital properties.

          Title: Evolution of Giant Planets in Eccentric Disks
          Authors: Gennaro D'Angelo, Stephen H. Lubow, Matthew R. Bate
          Comments:  20  pages  16  figures,  3  tables. To appear in The
          Astrophysical Journal vol.652 (December 1, 2006 issue)
          We  investigate  the  interaction  between a giant planet and a
          viscous   circumstellar   disk  by  means  of  high-resolution,
          two-dimensional  hydrodynamical simulations. We consider planet
          masses that range from 1 to 3 Jupiter masses (Mjup) and initial
          orbital eccentricities that range from 0 to 0.4. We find that a
          planet  can cause eccentricity growth in a disk region adjacent
          to  the planet's orbit, even if the planet's orbit is circular.
          Disk-planet  interactions  lead to growth in a planet's orbital
          eccentricity.  The  orbital  eccentricities of a 2 Mjup and a 3
          Mjup  planet  increase from 0 to 0.11 within about 3000 orbits.
          Over  a  similar  time  period, the orbital eccentricity of a 1
          Mjup planet grows from 0 to 0.02. For a case of a 1 Mjup planet
          with  an initial eccentricity of 0.01, the orbital eccentricity
          grows  to  0.09  over 4000 orbits. Radial migration is directed
          inwards,  but  slows  considerably  as a planet's orbit becomes
          eccentric.   If   a   planet's   orbital  eccentricity  becomes
          sufficiently  large,  e > ~0.2, migration can reverse and so be
          directed  outwards. The accretion rate towards a planet depends
          on  both  the  disk  and the planet orbital eccentricity and is
          pulsed  over  the  orbital  period.  Planet  mass  growth rates
          increase  with  planet orbital eccentricity. For e~0.2 the mass
          growth  rate  of  a planet increases by approximately 30% above
          the  value  for e=0. For e > ~0.1, most of the accretion within
          the  planet's  Roche  lobe  occurs  when the planet is near the
          apocenter.  Similar accretion modulation occurs for flow at the
          inner disk boundary which represents accretion toward the star.

          Title:  A census of the Wolf-Rayet content in Westerlund 1 from
          near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy

          New   NTT/SOFI  imaging  and  spectroscopy  of  the  Wolf-Rayet
          population  in  Westerlund 1 are presented. Narrow-band near-IR
          imaging  together  with follow up spectroscopy reveals four new
          WR stars, of which three were independently identified recently
          by  Groh  et  al.,  bringing the confirmed WR content to 24 (23
          excluding  source  S)  [..]  A  quantitative  near-IR  spectral
          classification  scheme for WR stars is presented and applied to
          members  of  Westerlund  1. Late subtypes are dominant, with no
          subtypes  earlier  than  WN5 or WC8 for the nitrogen and carbon
          sequences,  respectively.  A  qualitative  inspection of the WN
          stars  suggests  that most (75%) are highly H-deficient. The WR
          binary  fraction  is high (>62%), on the basis of dust emission
          from  WC stars, in addition to a significant WN binary fraction
          from hard X-ray detections according to Clark et al. We exploit
          the  large  WN  population  of  Westerlund  1  to  reassess its
          distance  (~5.0kpc) and extinction (A_Ks ~ 0.96 mag), such that
          it  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the Galactic bar, [..]. The
          observed  ratio  of  WR  stars  to  red and yellow hypergiants,
          N(WR)/N(RSG+YHG)~3,   favours  an  age  of  4.5-5.0  Myr,  with
          individual  WR stars descended from progenitors of initial mass
          ~  40-55  Msun.  Qualitative  estimates  of  current masses for
          non-dusty, H-free WR stars are presented, revealing 10-18 Msun,
          such that ~75% of the initial stellar mass has been removed via
          stellar  winds or close binary evolution. We present a revision
          to  the  cluster  turn-off mass for other Milky Way clusters in
          which  WR  stars  are  known, based upon the latest temperature
          calibration  for  OB  stars.  Finally,  comparisons between the
          observed WR population and subtype distribution in Westerlund 1
          and  instantaneous  burst  evolutionary  synthesis  models  are
          presented.

          Title:  The  Initial Conditions for Gravitational Collapse of a
          Core: An Extremely Young Low-Mass Class 0 Protostar GF9-2
          Authors:  Ray  S.  Furuya  (Subaru  Telescope,  Naoj),  Yoshimi
          Kitamura (ISAS/Jaxa), Hiroko Shinnaga (CSO, Caltech)
          Comments: ApJ Accepted. The preprint including figures with the
          original quality is available at this http URL
          We  present  a  study  of  the natal core harboring the class 0
          protostar  GF9-2  in  the  filamentary dark cloud GF 9 (d = 200
          pc).  GF9-2  stands unique in the sense that it shows H2O maser
          emission,  a  clear signpost of protostar formation, whereas it
          does  not  have  a  high-velocity large-scale molecular outflow
          evidenced  by our deep search for CO wing emission. These facts
          indicate  that  GF9-2 core is early enough after star formation
          so that it still retains some information of initial conditions
          for collapse. Our 350 um dust continuum emission image revealed
          the  presence  of  a  protostellar  envelope in the center of a
          molecular  core. The mass of the envelope is ~0.6 Msun from the
          350 um flux density, while LTE mass of the core is ~3 Msun from
          moleuclar line observations. Combining visibility data from the
          OVRO mm-array and the 45m telescope, we found that the core has
          a radial density profile of $\rho(r)\propto r^{-2}$ for 0.003 <
          r/pc  < 0.08 region. Molecular line data analysis revealed that
          the  velocity  width of the core gas increases inward,while the
          outermost region maintains a velocity dispersion of a few times
          of the ambient sound speed. The broadened velocity width can be
          interpreted as infall. Thus, the collapse in GF9-2 is likely to
          be described by an extension of the Larson-Penston solution for
          the  period  after  formation of a central star. We derived the
          current  mass  accretion  rate  of ~3E-05 Msun/year from infall
          velocity  of ~ 0.3 km/s at r~ 7000 AU. All results suggest that
          GF9-2  core  has  been  undergoing gravitational collapse for ~
          5000  years  since  the  formation of central protostar(s), and
          that  the  unstable  state  initiated the collapse ~2E+05 years
          (the free-fall time) ago.

          correlation in AGN

          Context:  We  investigate  mid-infrared and X-ray properties of
          the  dusty  torus  in unification scenarios for active galactic
          nuclei.
          Aims:  We  use  the  relation  between  mid  IR  and hard X-ray
          luminosities to constrain AGN unification scenarios.
          Methods:  With VISIR at the VLT, we have obtained the currently
          highest   angular   resolution  (0".35  FWHM)  narrow-band  mid
          infrared  images  of  the  nuclei of 8 nearby Seyfert galaxies.
          Combining   these   observations   with  X-ray  data  from  the
          literature  we  study  the correlation between their mid IR and
          hard X-ray luminosities.
          Results:  We  find  that the rest frame 12.3 mircon (L_MIR) and
          2-10   keV  (L_X)  luminosities  are  correlated  at  a  highly
          significant  level.  The  best fit power-law to our data is log
          L_MIR  \propto  (1.60 \pm 0.22) log L_X, showing a much smaller
          dispersion than earlier studies.
          Conclusions:  The  similarity  in  the og L_MIR / log L_X ratio
          between  Sy1s  and  Sy2s even using high angular resolution MIR
          data  implies  that  the similarity is intrinsic to AGN and not
          caused  by  contamination  from  extra-nuclear  emission.  This
          supports  clumpy  torus models. The exponent of the correlation
          constrains the inner geometry of the torus.

          Title: What is a planet?
          Authors: Steven Soter
          Comments:  22  pages,  3  tables,  4  figures  submitted to The
          Astronomical Journal
          A  planet  is an end product of disk accretion around a primary
          star  or  substar.  I quantify this definition by the degree to
          which  a body dominates the other masses that share its orbital
          zone.  Both theoretical and observational measures of dynamical
          dominance  reveal  a gap of five orders of magnitude separating
          the  eight  planets of our solar system from the populations of
          asteroids  and  comets.  This  simple definition dispenses with
          upper  and  lower  mass  limits  for  a planet. It reflects the
          tendency  of  disk  evolution  in  a mature system to produce a
          small   number   of   relatively   large  bodies  (planets)  in
          non-intersecting  or  resonant orbits, which prevent collisions
          between them.

          Title:  Gamma-Ray Burst Spectral Correlations: Photospheric and
          Injection Effects
          Authors: Felix Ryde, Claes-Ingvar Bjornsson, Yuki Kaneko, Peter
          Meszaros, Robert Preece, Milan Battelino
          Comments: ApJ, accepted
          We  present  a  physical framework that can account for most of
          the  observed spectral properties of the prompt gamma-ray burst
          emission.  This  includes the variety of spectral shapes, shape
          evolutions, and spectral correlations between flux and spectral
          peak,  within  bursts  described by Borgonovo & Ryde, and among
          bursts  described by Amati/Ghirlanda. In our proposed model the
          spectral  peak  is  given  by  the photospheric emission from a
          relativistic  outflow  for  which  the  horizon  length is much
          smaller  than  the  radial  width. The observed duration of the
          thermal  flash will be given by the radial light-crossing time.
          This  then gives that the typical emission site is at ~10e11 cm
          from  the  center, with a Lorentz factor of ~300. This emission
          is   accompanied   by  non-thermal  emission  from  dissipation
          locations  outside  the  photosphere.  The relative strength of
          these two components depend on injection effects at the central
          engine  leading  to varying relative location of the saturation
          and  photospheric  radii. The total emission can then reproduce
          the  observed  variety.  The spectral correlations are found by
          assuming   that   the   amount  of  energy  dissipated  depends
          non-linearly  on  the  averaged  particle  density.  Beside the
          spectral  correlations this also gives a description of how the
          relative   strength   of  the  thermal  component  varies  with
          temperature within a burst.

          As  part  of  the  DART  project we have used the ESO/2.2m Wide
          Field   Imager  in  conjunction  with  the  VLT/FLAMES  GIRAFFE
          spectrograph  to  study the detailed properties of the resolved
          stellar population of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy out to
          and  beyond  its  tidal  radius.  We  re-derived the structural
          parameters  of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal using our wide field
          imaging  covering  the  galaxy  out  to  its  tidal radius, and
          analysed  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  Fornax  stars of
          different   ages  as  selected  from  Colour-Magnitude  Diagram
          analysis.    We   have   obtained   accurate   velocities   and
          metallicities  from  spectra  in  the  CaII  triplet wavelength
          region  for  562  Red  Giant Branch stars which have velocities
          consistent  with membership in Fornax dwarf spheroidal. We have
          found  evidence  for  the  presence  of at least three distinct
          stellar  components:  a  young  population  (few  100  Myr old)
          concentrated  in  the  centre  of the galaxy, visible as a Main
          Sequence  in  the Colour-Magnitude Diagram; an intermediate age
          population   (2-8  Gyr  old);  and  an  ancient  population  (>
          10Gyr),which are distinguishable from each other kinematically,
          from   the   metallicity   distribution   and  in  the  spatial
          distribution  of  stars  found in the Colour-Magnitude Diagram.
          From our spectroscopic analysis we find that the ``metal rich''
          stars ([Fe/H]> -1.3) show a less extended and more concentrated
          spatial  distribution, and display a colder kinematics than the
          ``metal  poor'' stars ([Fe/H<-1.3). There is tentative evidence
          that  the  ancient  stellar  population in the centre of Fornax
          does  not  exhibit equilibrium kinematics. This could be a sign
          of a relatively recent accretion of external material.

          Title:  A  weakly  nonlinear  analysis of the magnetorotational
          instability in a model channel flow
          Authors: O.M. Umurhan, K. Menou, O. Regev
          Comments: Submitted to Physical Review Letters
          The  magnetorotational  instability (MRI) is generally accepted
          as  the  physical cause of turbulence and enhanced transport of
          angular  momentum in accretion disks, which are one of the most
          basic  and  ubiquitous  astrophysical  structures.  We show, by
          means  of  a  perturbative  weakly nonlinear analysis, that the
          axisymmetric   MRI  of  a  viscous,  resistive,  incompressible
          rotating  shear  flow  in a thin channel gives rise to a Landau
          equation  for  the  disturbance  amplitude.  For small magnetic
          Prandtl  number  (${\cal P}_{\rm m}$), the saturation amplitude
          is $\propto \sqrt{{\cal P}_{\rm m}}$ and the resulting momentum
          transport  scales  as  ${\cal  R}^{-1}$,  where $\cal R$ is the
          hydrodynamic  Reynolds number. Simplifying assumptions, such as
          linear  shear  base  flow,  mathematically  expedient  boundary
          conditions  and  continuous  spectrum  of  the  vertical linear
          modes,  are  used  to  facilitate this analysis. The asymptotic
          results are shown to comply with numerical calculations using a
          spectral  code.  They  suggest  that  the  transport due to the
          nonlinearly  developed  MRI  may be very small, in experimental
          setups with ${\cal P}_{\rm m} \ll 1$.

          Title:  Deficit of wide binaries in the eta Chamaeleontis young
          cluster
          Authors:  Alexis Brandeker, Ray Jayawardhana, Parandis Khavari,
          Karl E. Haisch Jr, Diego Mardones
          Comments: Accepted by ApJ. 13 pages, 10 figures
          We  have carried out a sensitive high-resolution imaging survey
          of stars in the young (6-8 Myr), nearby (97 pc) compact cluster
          around  eta Chamaeleontis to search for stellar and sub-stellar
          companions.  Given  its  youth  and  proximity, any sub-stellar
          companions  are expected to be luminous, especially in the near
          infrared, and thus easier to detect next to their parent stars.
          Here,   we   present  VLT/NACO  adaptive  optics  imaging  with
          companion  detection limits for 17 eta Cha cluster members, and
          follow-up  VLT/ISAAC  near-infrared  spectroscopy for companion
          candidates.  The widest binary detected is ~0.2", corresponding
          to  the  projected  separation  20 AU, despite our survey being
          sensitive  down  to  sub-stellar  companions  outside 0.3", and
          planetary  mass  objects  outside  0.5".  This implies that the
          stellar  companion probability outside 0.3" and the brown dwarf
          companion  probability outside 0.5" are less than 0.16 with 95%
          confidence.  We compare the wide binary frequency of eta Cha to
          that  of the similarly aged TW Hydrae association, and estimate
          the  statistical likelihood that the wide binary probability is
          equal  in  both  groups  to  be < 2e-4. Even though the eta Cha
          cluster  is relatively dense, stellar encounters in its present
          configuration  cannot  account for the relative deficit of wide
          binaries.  We  thus conclude that the difference in wide binary
          probability  in  these  two groups provides strong evidence for
          multiplicity  properties being dependent on environment. In two
          appendices  we  derive  the  projected  separation  probability
          distribution   for   binaries,   used   to  constrain  physical
          separations  from observed projected separations, and summarize
          statistical tools useful for multiplicity studies.

          Comments: 24 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, ApJ in press
          We  report  the discovery of an eclipsing X-ray binary in M101,
          the first such system to be discovered outside the Local Group.
          Based  on  a  sequence of 25 Chandra observations that sample a
          wide  range of orbital phases, we find a period of 32.688 $\pm$
          0.002  hours,  which  we  interpret  as  an orbital period. The
          folded  light  curve exhibits an eclipse lasting about 8 hours,
          suggesting  a compact orbit in an nearly edge-on configuration.
          The  X-ray  binary has an average luminosity of $L_X(0.3-8 {\rm
          keV})  \approx  1.3\times10^{38}$ erg/sec, with only one out of
          the  25  observations  significantly  lower  in  flux  than the
          average  light curve.The presence of the eclipse and the $\sim$
          1.4-day  orbital  period suggests that this source is an analog
          of  the  well studied eclipsing X-ray binary pulsars Her X-1 or
          LMC X-4. Combining the Chandra data and the HST ACS/WFC images,
          we  have  identified  several  possible  optical  counterparts,
          including  an  O5-O3  star  with  V  =  25.0. Follow-up optical
          monitoring  observations  should  be able to identify the donor
          and further constrain the orbital properties.

          Title: Evolution of Giant Planets in Eccentric Disks
          Authors: Gennaro D'Angelo, Stephen H. Lubow, Matthew R. Bate
          Comments:  20  pages  16  figures,  3  tables. To appear in The
          Astrophysical Journal vol.652 (December 1, 2006 issue)
          We  investigate  the  interaction  between a giant planet and a
          viscous   circumstellar   disk  by  means  of  high-resolution,
          two-dimensional  hydrodynamical simulations. We consider planet
          masses that range from 1 to 3 Jupiter masses (Mjup) and initial
          orbital eccentricities that range from 0 to 0.4. We find that a
          planet  can cause eccentricity growth in a disk region adjacent
          to  the planet's orbit, even if the planet's orbit is circular.
          Disk-planet  interactions  lead to growth in a planet's orbital
          eccentricity.  The  orbital  eccentricities of a 2 Mjup and a 3
          Mjup  planet  increase from 0 to 0.11 within about 3000 orbits.
          Over  a  similar  time  period, the orbital eccentricity of a 1
          Mjup planet grows from 0 to 0.02. For a case of a 1 Mjup planet
          with  an initial eccentricity of 0.01, the orbital eccentricity
          grows  to  0.09  over 4000 orbits. Radial migration is directed
          inwards,  but  slows  considerably  as a planet's orbit becomes
          eccentric.   If   a   planet's   orbital  eccentricity  becomes
          sufficiently  large,  e > ~0.2, migration can reverse and so be
          directed  outwards. The accretion rate towards a planet depends
          on  both  the  disk  and the planet orbital eccentricity and is
          pulsed  over  the  orbital  period.  Planet  mass  growth rates
          increase  with  planet orbital eccentricity. For e~0.2 the mass
          growth  rate  of  a planet increases by approximately 30% above
          the  value  for e=0. For e > ~0.1, most of the accretion within
          the  planet's  Roche  lobe  occurs  when the planet is near the
          apocenter.  Similar accretion modulation occurs for flow at the

          Title:  A census of the Wolf-Rayet content in Westerlund 1 from
          near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy

          New   NTT/SOFI  imaging  and  spectroscopy  of  the  Wolf-Rayet
          population  in  Westerlund 1 are presented. Narrow-band near-IR
          imaging  together  with follow up spectroscopy reveals four new
          WR stars, of which three were independently identified recently
          by  Groh  et  al.,  bringing the confirmed WR content to 24 (23
          excluding  source  S)  [..]  A  quantitative  near-IR  spectral
          classification  scheme for WR stars is presented and applied to
          members  of  Westerlund  1. Late subtypes are dominant, with no
          subtypes  earlier  than  WN5 or WC8 for the nitrogen and carbon
          sequences,  respectively.  A  qualitative  inspection of the WN
          stars  suggests  that most (75%) are highly H-deficient. The WR
          binary  fraction  is high (>62%), on the basis of dust emission
          from  WC stars, in addition to a significant WN binary fraction
          from hard X-ray detections according to Clark et al. We exploit
          the  large  WN  population  of  Westerlund  1  to  reassess its
          distance  (~5.0kpc) and extinction (A_Ks ~ 0.96 mag), such that
          it  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the Galactic bar, [..]. The
          observed  ratio  of  WR  stars  to  red and yellow hypergiants,
          N(WR)/N(RSG+YHG)~3,   favours  an  age  of  4.5-5.0  Myr,  with
          individual  WR stars descended from progenitors of initial mass
          ~  40-55  Msun.  Qualitative  estimates  of  current masses for
          non-dusty, H-free WR stars are presented, revealing 10-18 Msun,
          such that ~75% of the initial stellar mass has been removed via
          stellar  winds or close binary evolution. We present a revision
          to  the  cluster  turn-off mass for other Milky Way clusters in
          which  WR  stars  are  known, based upon the latest temperature
          calibration  for  OB  stars.  Finally,  comparisons between the
          observed WR population and subtype distribution in Westerlund 1
          and  instantaneous  burst  evolutionary  synthesis  models  are
          presented.

          Title:  The  Initial Conditions for Gravitational Collapse of a
          Core: An Extremely Young Low-Mass Class 0 Protostar GF9-2
          Authors:  Ray  S.  Furuya  (Subaru  Telescope,  Naoj),  Yoshimi
          Kitamura (ISAS/Jaxa), Hiroko Shinnaga (CSO, Caltech)
          Comments: ApJ Accepted. The preprint including figures with the
          original quality is available at this http URL
          We  present  a  study  of  the natal core harboring the class 0
          protostar  GF9-2  in  the  filamentary dark cloud GF 9 (d = 200
          pc).  GF9-2  stands unique in the sense that it shows H2O maser
          emission,  a  clear signpost of protostar formation, whereas it
          does  not  have  a  high-velocity large-scale molecular outflow
          evidenced  by our deep search for CO wing emission. These facts
          indicate  that  GF9-2 core is early enough after star formation
          so that it still retains some information of initial conditions
          for collapse. Our 350 um dust continuum emission image revealed
          the  presence  of  a  protostellar  envelope in the center of a
          molecular  core. The mass of the envelope is ~0.6 Msun from the
          350 um flux density, while LTE mass of the core is ~3 Msun from
          moleuclar line observations. Combining visibility data from the
          OVRO mm-array and the 45m telescope, we found that the core has
          a radial density profile of $\rho(r)\propto r^{-2}$ for 0.003 <
          r/pc  < 0.08 region. Molecular line data analysis revealed that
          the  velocity  width of the core gas increases inward,while the
          outermost region maintains a velocity dispersion of a few times
          of the ambient sound speed. The broadened velocity width can be
          interpreted as infall. Thus, the collapse in GF9-2 is likely to
          be described by an extension of the Larson-Penston solution for
          the  period  after  formation of a central star. We derived the
          current  mass  accretion  rate  of ~3E-05 Msun/year from infall
          velocity  of ~ 0.3 km/s at r~ 7000 AU. All results suggest that
          GF9-2  core  has  been  undergoing gravitational collapse for ~
          5000  years  since  the  formation of central protostar(s), and
          that  the  unstable  state  initiated the collapse ~2E+05 years
          (the free-fall time) ago.

          Title:  The  small  dispersion  of  the  mid  IR  -- hard X-ray
          correlation in AGN

          Context:  We  investigate  mid-infrared and X-ray properties of
          the  dusty  torus  in unification scenarios for active galactic
          nuclei.
          Aims:  We  use  the  relation  between  mid  IR  and hard X-ray
          luminosities to constrain AGN unification scenarios.
          Methods:  With VISIR at the VLT, we have obtained the currently
          highest   angular   resolution  (0".35  FWHM)  narrow-band  mid
          infrared  images  of  the  nuclei of 8 nearby Seyfert galaxies.
          Combining   these   observations   with  X-ray  data  from  the
          literature  we  study  the correlation between their mid IR and
          hard X-ray luminosities.
          Results:  We  find  that the rest frame 12.3 mircon (L_MIR) and
          2-10   keV  (L_X)  luminosities  are  correlated  at  a  highly
          significant  level.  The  best fit power-law to our data is log
          L_MIR  \propto  (1.60 \pm 0.22) log L_X, showing a much smaller
          dispersion than earlier studies.
          Conclusions:  The  similarity  in  the og L_MIR / log L_X ratio
          between  Sy1s  and  Sy2s even using high angular resolution MIR
          data  implies  that  the similarity is intrinsic to AGN and not
          caused  by  contamination  from  extra-nuclear  emission.  This
          supports  clumpy  torus models. The exponent of the correlation
          constrains the inner geometry of the torus.

          Title: What is a planet?
          Authors: Steven Soter
          Comments:  22  pages,  3  tables,  4  figures  submitted to The
          Astronomical Journal
          A  planet  is an end product of disk accretion around a primary
          star  or  substar.  I quantify this definition by the degree to
          which  a body dominates the other masses that share its orbital
          zone.  Both theoretical and observational measures of dynamical
          dominance  reveal  a gap of five orders of magnitude separating
          the  eight  planets of our solar system from the populations of
          asteroids  and  comets.  This  simple definition dispenses with
          upper  and  lower  mass  limits  for  a planet. It reflects the
          tendency  of  disk  evolution  in  a mature system to produce a
          small   number   of   relatively   large  bodies  (planets)  in
          non-intersecting  or  resonant orbits, which prevent collisions
          between them.

          Title:  Gamma-Ray Burst Spectral Correlations: Photospheric and
          Injection Effects
          Authors: Felix Ryde, Claes-Ingvar Bjornsson, Yuki Kaneko, Peter
          Meszaros, Robert Preece, Milan Battelino
          Comments: ApJ, accepted
          We  present  a  physical framework that can account for most of
          the  observed spectral properties of the prompt gamma-ray burst
          emission.  This  includes the variety of spectral shapes, shape
          evolutions, and spectral correlations between flux and spectral
          peak,  within  bursts  described by Borgonovo & Ryde, and among
          bursts  described by Amati/Ghirlanda. In our proposed model the
          spectral  peak  is  given  by  the photospheric emission from a
          relativistic  outflow  for  which  the  horizon  length is much
          smaller  than  the  radial  width. The observed duration of the
          thermal  flash will be given by the radial light-crossing time.
          This  then gives that the typical emission site is at ~10e11 cm
          from  the  center, with a Lorentz factor of ~300. This emission
          is   accompanied   by  non-thermal  emission  from  dissipation
          locations  outside  the  photosphere.  The relative strength of
          these two components depend on injection effects at the central
          engine  leading  to varying relative location of the saturation
          and  photospheric  radii. The total emission can then reproduce
          the  observed  variety.  The spectral correlations are found by
          assuming   that   the   amount  of  energy  dissipated  depends
          non-linearly  on  the  averaged  particle  density.  Beside the
          spectral  correlations this also gives a description of how the
          relative   strength   of  the  thermal  component  varies  with
          temperature within a burst.

          As  part  of  the  DART  project we have used the ESO/2.2m Wide
          Field   Imager  in  conjunction  with  the  VLT/FLAMES  GIRAFFE
          spectrograph  to  study the detailed properties of the resolved
          stellar population of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy out to
          and  beyond  its  tidal  radius.  We  re-derived the structural
          parameters  of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal using our wide field
          imaging  covering  the  galaxy  out  to  its  tidal radius, and
          analysed  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  Fornax  stars of
          different   ages  as  selected  from  Colour-Magnitude  Diagram
          analysis.    We   have   obtained   accurate   velocities   and
          metallicities  from  spectra  in  the  CaII  triplet wavelength
          region  for  562  Red  Giant Branch stars which have velocities
          consistent  with membership in Fornax dwarf spheroidal. We have
          found  evidence  for  the  presence  of at least three distinct
          stellar  components:  a  young  population  (few  100  Myr old)
          concentrated  in  the  centre  of the galaxy, visible as a Main
          Sequence  in  the Colour-Magnitude Diagram; an intermediate age
          population   (2-8  Gyr  old);  and  an  ancient  population  (>
          10Gyr),which are distinguishable from each other kinematically,
          from   the   metallicity   distribution   and  in  the  spatial
          distribution  of  stars  found in the Colour-Magnitude Diagram.
          From our spectroscopic analysis we find that the ``metal rich''
          stars ([Fe/H]> -1.3) show a less extended and more concentrated
          spatial  distribution, and display a colder kinematics than the
          ``metal  poor'' stars ([Fe/H<-1.3). There is tentative evidence
          that  the  ancient  stellar  population in the centre of Fornax
          does  not  exhibit equilibrium kinematics. This could be a sign
          of a relatively recent accretion of external material.

          Title:  A  weakly  nonlinear  analysis of the magnetorotational
          instability in a model channel flow
          Authors: O.M. Umurhan, K. Menou, O. Regev
          Comments: Submitted to Physical Review Letters
          The  magnetorotational  instability (MRI) is generally accepted
          as  the  physical cause of turbulence and enhanced transport of
          angular  momentum in accretion disks, which are one of the most
          basic  and  ubiquitous  astrophysical  structures.  We show, by
          means  of  a  perturbative  weakly nonlinear analysis, that the
          axisymmetric   MRI  of  a  viscous,  resistive,  incompressible
          rotating  shear  flow  in a thin channel gives rise to a Landau
          equation  for  the  disturbance  amplitude.  For small magnetic
          Prandtl  number  (${\cal P}_{\rm m}$), the saturation amplitude
          is $\propto \sqrt{{\cal P}_{\rm m}}$ and the resulting momentum
          transport  scales  as  ${\cal  R}^{-1}$,  where $\cal R$ is the
          hydrodynamic  Reynolds number. Simplifying assumptions, such as
          linear  shear  base  flow,  mathematically  expedient  boundary
          conditions  and  continuous  spectrum  of  the  vertical linear
          modes,  are  used  to  facilitate this analysis. The asymptotic
          results are shown to comply with numerical calculations using a
          spectral  code.  They  suggest  that  the  transport due to the
          nonlinearly  developed  MRI  may be very small, in experimental
          setups with ${\cal P}_{\rm m} \ll 1$.
